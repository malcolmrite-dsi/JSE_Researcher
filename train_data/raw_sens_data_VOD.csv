Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Having responded rapidly to help curb the spread of COVID-19 earlier in the year, Vodacom Group has turned its attention to
contributing meaningfully to the economic recovery in markets where we operate following the often devastating impacts of
the global pandemic on society.

Through a wide range of initiatives, including free devices and airtime for healthcare workers, cash donations and strategic
partnerships, we continue to deliver on our Social Contract with stakeholders to contribute positively to a number of
pressing societal challenges. For example, we prioritised the resilience of our networks, accelerated support to governments
via donations of handsets, connectivity and medical equipment and made contactless payments more accessible through
zero-rated services and an expanded M-Pesa ecosystem to address social distancing challenges. In addition, and given that
collaboration is instrumental to the economic recovery, we remain committed to establishing innovative partnerships with
an emphasis on health, education, free public benefit services, big data analytics and financial services to complement those
already concluded in recent times with Alipay, Discovery Health and Microsoft.
To help cope with sharp increases in data traffic and shifts in customer behaviour patterns, we accelerated network
infrastructure spend over the six-month period to R6.6 billion, including R5.0 billion in South Africa, keeping families
connected, enabling businesses to operate, facilitating online learning and assisting governments in providing critical
services.
In South Africa, data usage surged +86%, as connectivity demands changed with a need to work, entertain and educate from
home, and as we made substantial reductions in monthly data bundle tariffs. Also, the launch of ConnectU, which provides
zero-rated access to a wide range of websites, including jobs portals and online learning platforms and discounted offers for
poor communities, supported higher usage.
Considering the magnitude of challenges arising from the pandemic in the past six months, it is particularly pleasing that we
recorded a solid financial performance at Group level, where service revenue increased 7.0%. This was underpinned by
strong growth from our Consumer and Enterprise businesses in South Africa, where service revenue rose 7.1% despite
reductions of up to 40% in monthly data bundles which came into effect on 1 April 2020.
In line with our strategy of delivering great value and an exceptional experience to our customers, we recently launched our
loyalty programme “VodaBucks” to complement personalised and segmented offers to customers. These draw on our
expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance customer engagement and provide financial relief at a
time when consumers are increasingly under pressure.
Investment into digital innovation is key to the Group’s growth outlook of which our Financial Services business is an
important enabler. In partnership with Alipay, Vodacom Financial Services is developing a single lifestyle app for both
customers and merchants that promotes greater financial inclusion. Already, our execution in the financial services space in
South Africa is evidenced by the rapid growth of Airtime Advance and insurance services. Airtime advance customers
increased 14.1% to
10.1 million.
While initiatives such as free peer-to-peer (P2P) M-Pesa transactions at the onset of COVID-19 impacted the financial
performance of our International portfolio, it played an important role in facilitating economic activity in addition to being
the right thing to do for customers. Subsequently, this has supported accelerated platform growth and customer adoption of
digital channels to the point where the M-Pesa ecosystem now processes US$20.5 billion a month in transactions across our
International markets, including Safaricom, and contributed R8 billion in revenue in the period.
Following a sustained period of very strong growth, the performance of our International operations was impacted by
disrupted economies and livelihoods on the back of COVID-19, resulting in a 5.2%* decline in service revenue in constant
currency terms. Our reported results show service revenue growth of 5.8%, benefitting from rand weakness. We expect
consumer spend to recover as trading and economies re-open from lockdowns.
Our strategic investment in Safaricom delivered a 52.2% boost in our operating profit, buoyed by currency factors and a one-
off deferred tax rate adjustment of R0.8 billion. Safaricom’s local currency results reflect the impact of depressed economic
activity and lower M-Pesa P2P monetisation, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Safaricom accelerated capital expenditure
by 25.5%, supporting platform growth and a notable financial improvement into the second quarter compared with the first
quarter.
Looking forward, we remain cautious about the pace of economic recovery across our markets as disposable income will
remain under pressure as a result of unemployment and depressed economic activity. Still, we remain steadfast in our quest
to entrench Vodacom Group as a leading pan-African technology company and firmly believe that our investment into
financial, digital and lifestyle services will increasingly provide opportunities to deepen our relationship with the 120 million
customers who choose to use the Vodacom Group network across our footprint.

Dividend policy

intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend received, net of
withholding tax.

The Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining such sums and repaying such
borrowings owing to third parties as shall be necessary to meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan,
taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement to dividends
arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE
Listings Requirements.

Vodacom Group Limited trading update for the quarter ended 30 June 2020 (short form announcement)
Highlights

- Group service revenue was up 7.6% (2.6%*) and Group revenue grew by 5.6% (1.3%*), benefitting from strong growth
  in South Africa with customer demand increasing during the lock down period, while the International operations were
  negatively impacted by lower economic activity from the effects of COVID-19.
- South Africa service revenue growth was solid at 6.4% for the quarter, supported by strong demand for data and
  connectivity services in the period.
- International service revenue grew by 10.7% benefiting from the rand devaluation. Underlying performance was
  subdued with a 5.3% decline, as a result of lower economic trading activity, free M-Pesa services and customer
  registration requirements in these businesses.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
In the face of an unprecedented global pandemic, Vodacom Group has responded rapidly to assist governments where it
operates in curbing the spread of COVID-19 while also adapting to significant changes in customer demands and behaviour
patterns. In South Africa, the combination of increased demand for data following significant tariff reductions of up to 40%
effected on 1 April and more people working and being educated remotely, resulted in a significant increase in mobile and
fixed traffic in the first quarter.

As a result, we accelerated network infrastructure spend by R500 million to R2.7 billion in Q1 and used the temporary
assignment of spectrum by ICASA to rapidly increase network capacity to ensure that we continue to deliver a high quality
experience to customers. The temporary spectrum assignment also allowed us to fast track the launch of South Africa’s first
mobile 5G network and our fixed 5G commercial service.
Collaboration is instrumental in defeating COVID-19 and it is for this reason we have concluded a number of innovative
partnerships in recent months with particular emphasis on health, education, free public benefit services, big data analytics
and financial services to support citizens and governments.

Certain financial information presented in this results announcement constitutes pro-forma financial information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The applicable criteria
on the basis of which this pro-forma financial information has been prepared is set out in the full announcement.
The pro-forma financial information has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by external auditors.
The quarterly information has not been audited or reviewed by Vodacom’s external auditors.

All growth rates quoted are year-on-year and refer to the quarter ended 30 June 2020 compared to the quarter ended 30 June 2019.
Amounts marked with an * in this document represent normalised growth which presents performance on a comparable basis. This excludes merger and acquisition activity and
adjusting for trading foreign exchange and foreign currency fluctuation on a constant currency basis (using the current year as base).
In addition to zero-rating numerous essential service and education websites, we donated 20 000 smartphones plus 100
terabytes of data and 10 million voice call minutes to the National Department of Health to collect and transmit data in real
time for resource planning purposes as part of Government’s accelerated COVID-19 testing campaign.

We partnered with Discovery Health, the country’s largest administrator of medical schemes, to offer free virtual
consultations with doctors to the general public to help alleviate pressure on the country’s healthcare system by assisting in
diagnosing COVID-19 as well as treating it.

More recently Vodacom South Africa partnered with Microsoft to launch the Connected Digital Education Platform which
provides participating educational institutions, from schools through to universities, with significantly discounted data
bundles and educators with the ability to deliver classes to learners where access to Microsoft Teams is provided for free.
Earlier this week we announced a ground-breaking technology partnership with Alipay, the world’s leading digital daily
lifestyle services platform, to bring inclusive mobile solutions to South African consumers and merchants, especially small
businesses, through innovative digital technologies. In terms of the partnership, Vodacom Financial Services will work
closely with Alipay to develop a single, affordable payments app for both customers and merchants that promotes greater
financial inclusion within the communities in which we operate.

As part of a broader Vodacom Group programme to create a Social Contract with its stakeholders that addresses pressing
societal challenges, we will continue to do everything in our power to support all governments throughout our African
operations in whatever way we can.

Strong demand for voice, data and financial services contributed to the 6.4% increase in service revenue growth in South
Africa while our International portfolio benefited significantly from currency changes to grow service revenue by 10.7%. This
resulted in a 7.6% increase in service revenue across the Vodacom Group despite tougher economic trading conditions in
most of our markets.

Excluding currency gains, underlying growth in our International portfolio declined by 5.3% as economic activity declined
across these operations. We also reduced pricing on a temporary basis on a number of M-Pesa transactions to assist
customers in contactless payment in light of social distancing initiatives.

While I am particularly pleased with the performance of our South African business, we remain cautious about the impact of
COVID-19 on our operations and uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery in each of the countries where we
operate as disposable income will increasingly come under pressure as a result of rising unemployment and reduced
economic activity.

That said, we are fully focussed on delivering great value and an exceptional experience to our customers and committed to
a prudently sustainable investment programme that continues to yield positive results.
Looking ahead, the long anticipated award of high-demand spectrum in South Africa remains instrumental in the data pricing
dynamic in our largest market. Lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum continues to
curb the pace at which data prices could have fallen. ICASA is expected to complete its spectrum allocation process by
December 2020.

Covid-19 – annual general meeting – Tuesday 21 July 2020

Shareholders are referred to the 25th annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday 21 July
2020 at 10:00 at Vodacom World, 082 Vodacom Boulevard, Midrand, Johannesburg to
consider, and if deemed fit, to pass with or without modification, the resolutions as set in the
notice of annual general meeting which was posted to shareholders on Friday 12 June 2020
and which notice is available on the company’s website www.vodacom.com.

Vodacom reiterates that the health and wellbeing of our staff and shareholders are paramount.
Notwithstanding the declaration by the South African Government of an advanced level 3
lockdown set of regulations which do allow for conferencing, subject to strict health
requirements, Vodacom has taken note of the continued increase in the infection rate for
COVID-19. To protect shareholders and staff, the 25th annual general meeting will now be held
in electronic form only as permitted by the company’s memorandum of incorporation.

Logistical arrangements for an electronic annual general meeting

   1. Vodacom has retained the services The Meeting Specialist Proprietary Limited (“TMS”)
      to host the 25th annual general meeting on an interactive electronic platform to facilitate
      remote participation and voting by shareholders.

   2. Shareholders who wish to participate electronically in and/ or vote at the 25th annual
      general meeting are required to contact TMS on proxy@tmsmeetings.co.za or
      alternatively contact their office on +27 11 520 7950/1/2 as soon as possible, but for
      administrative purposes no later than 10:00 Friday 17 July 2020.

       Shareholders are strongly encouraged to submit votes by proxy before the meeting. If
       shareholders wish to participate in the 25th annual general meeting, they should instruct
       their CSDP or broker to issue them with the necessary letter of representation to
       participate in the 25th annual general meeting, in the manner stipulated in your custody
       agreement. These instructions must be provided to the CSDP or broker by the cut-off
       time and date advised by the CSDP or broker, to accommodate such requests.

   3. TMS will assist shareholders with the requirements for electronic participation in, and/or
      voting at, the 25th annual general meeting. TMS is further obliged to validate (in
      correspondence with Vodacom and, in particular, the transfer secretary, (Computershare

      and/or vote at the 25th annual general meeting, before providing it with the necessary
      means to access the 25th annual general meeting and/or the associated voting platform.

       Shareholders will be liable for their own network charges in relation to electronic
       participation in and/or voting at the 25th annual general meeting. Any such charges will
      not be for the account of the JSE, Vodacom and/or TMS. None of the JSE, Vodacom or
      TMS can be held accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other
      network failure due to insufficient airtime, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth and/or
      power outages which prevents any such Shareholder from participating in and/or voting
      at the 25th annual general meeting.

       Voting by Proxy

      Notwithstanding the above, shareholders are reminded that they are still able to vote
      normally through proxy submission, despite deciding to participate either electronically or
      not at all in the 25th annual general meeting. Shareholders are strongly encouraged to
      submit votes by proxy in advance of the 25th annual general meeting.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
An improved second half performance in South Africa and the sustained growth of our International businesses contributed
to the Group’s 8.9% increase in headline earnings per share to 945cps and a dividend return of 845cps to shareholders.
This follows last year’s substantial investment in South Africa’s largest ever Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
transaction in the telecommunication sector. Group service revenue rose 5.0%.
The past year has been characterised by strong customer growth - we now connect 116 million customers across the
Group, including Safaricom – and the benefits of prudent portfolio diversification.

In South Africa, sharp data price reductions, specifically out-of-bundle data rates, announced in the first quarter led to a
steady increase in data traffic as the year progressed with 1.9 million more data customers connecting to the Vodacom
network, a 9.7% increase to 21.9 million.
While it is still early days, the trend of increased data usage has continued into the current financial year following reductions
in
30-day data bundle tariffs of up to 40% from 1 April 2020 and the launch of our ConnectU platform, which provides easy
access to numerous zero-rated essential service websites. These initiatives will provide savings of R2.7 billion to customers
at a time when economies around the world are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite deteriorating economic pressures and the proactive price cuts to our out-of-bundle rates, service revenue rose 2.3%
in our biggest market, where initiatives to deliver greater value to customers through pricing transformation and sustained
investment in network infrastructure and IT systems are being rewarded.

As part of our strategy to build diverse and sustainable revenue streams, our efforts to introduce “one more service” to
customers continue to gain momentum. For instance, revenue from our Financial Services business in South Africa jumped
by 21.5% to R2.0 billion, on the back of our popular Airtime Advance, insurance and VodaPay services. Our digital services
business has also produced solid growth, contributing R1.5 billion in revenues on the back of increasing purchases of our
video-on-demand offering and our music, sports, gaming and other video services.
It has been another stellar year for our International portfolio, where we recorded margin expansion for a second year, and
further diversifies our currency exposure from the South African rand. An additional 4.0 million customers and increased
demand for data and M-Pesa services in each of our operations contributed to a 12.5% increase in service revenue across
our International operations.

Our investment in Safaricom, Africa’s second biggest Telco by market capitalisation after Vodacom, delivered a 30.4% boost
in profits from this associate, with growth bolstered by currency factors and inclusion of the new M-Pesa joint venture.
Significant investments in network and infrastructure, an acceleration in pricing transformation and a 17.2% underlying
increase in revenue from M-Pesa, all contributed to Safaricom’s success.

M-Pesa continues to deliver on its promise of delivering financial inclusion, while at the same time positively contributing to
economic growth in markets where it is ubiquitous. Having expanded the M-Pesa ecosystem, customers in our International
markets, including Safaricom, now process more than US$14.7 billion a month in transactions through the platform.
We currently have 40 million customers transacting on M-Pesa across all our operations, generating total revenue of R16.2
billion and growing at 22% a year. Our focus, with our newly created joint venture, is to ensure that we align all product
roadmaps across our operations and continue to expand the M-Pesa ecosystem across all countries. This will include the
roll-out of nano lending platforms and getting the system ready for a smartphone world, where we can on-board more
partners in this space. Our nano lending platform is already being used by 17 million customers in Kenya and Tanzania
where it is driving our commitment to promote financial inclusion.

Over the past 12 months, the Group has made significant progress on a number of regulatory matters, including finality on
the Competition Commission’s data services market inquiry in South Africa. The assignment of available high-demand
spectrum seems imminent, with ICASA indicating that this process will be concluded by the end of this year. Looking ahead,
our immediate collective emphasis is to assist in addressing pressing societal challenges in each of the markets where we
operate, particularly as the world strives to halt the spread of COVID-19 and recovers from the economic impacts of the
pandemic. We remain committed to supporting governments where we operate in whatever way we can. Through numerous
public and private sector partnerships across our footprint, Vodacom’s teams are working hard in difficult conditions to keep
communities, businesses and governments connected. The assignment of temporary spectrum in South Africa and
elsewhere is welcomed and will assist in alleviating network congestion as more people work and are entertained at home.
At the same time, we are executing on our robust, scalable operational continuity plans by anticipating and reacting to the
current extraordinary environment to ensure our long-term sustainability.

We believe that collaborative efforts will be instrumental in defeating the pandemic, which is why we have partnered, for
example, with Discovery Health to launch a simple but powerful online healthcare platform to help citizens understand their
personal risk for COVID-19 and to immediately schedule free healthcare professional consultations where necessary. We
have also partnered with the National Department of Health a to deploy 20 000 smartphones with free voice call minutes
and data, to be used by frontline health workers to collect and transmit data in real time for resource planning purposes, as
government accelerates its COVID-19 testing campaign.

We have consolidated all our existing zero-rated data services with new essential services aimed at social upliftment into our
single ConnectU platform. This social platform provides Vodacom customers with access to a wide range of zero-rated
content that will assist customers during the lockdown and recovery period. The platform includes free access to job portals,
where youth can search for employment and upload their CVs as well as access to our e-School platform that provides
CAPS curriculum aligned content from Grades R – 12. In addition to launching special tariffs for virtual classrooms, we have
expanded our zero-rated offering to all public schools, universities and T-Vet colleges across the country to ensure that
students enrolled into these institutions will be able to access relevant information for free via these portals. In our
International operations, we have zero-rated M-Pesa and greatly reduced fees below certain thresholds for person to person
transfers, to minimise the use of cash for payments.

These are just some of the numerous activities that we have implemented across our markets to assist governments in their
response to COVID-19. We continue to prioritise network quality so that we deliver on our purpose of connecting people to a
better tomorrow.

COVID-19 update

Shareholders are referred to the announcement made by Vodacom on 17 March 2020, in
relation to Vodacom’s operations following the state of disaster announced by the president
on 20 March 2020 in response to the COVID-9 pandemic.

In a subsequent announcement the president issued a national lock down for 21 days, which
has since been extended for a further two weeks. Vodacom fully supports government’s
initiatives in containing this pandemic. In our operations outside of South Africa, there are
various degrees of actions taken by governments. These vary between full lock downs,
partial lock downs and “business as usual”, but with emphasis on social distancing.
Vodacom’s priority is the health and safety of our employees while continuing to deliver
services and support to our customers.

Vodacom is working under strict conditions, across all our operations to limit and minimise
the potential for COVID-19 transmission, and will continue to support and educate our
people on the appropriate hygiene standards to follow. Notwithstanding the critical nature of
our operations, most of our employees have been empowered to work from home.
Telecommunications has been classified as an essential service in South Africa. We have
obtained the necessary approvals and permits to ensure that South Africans remain
connected during this period.

The extent of the shutdown and the effect of COVID-19 on our business is continually being
reassessed, with relevant task teams being established and business continuity plans being
prepared and executed to deal with anticipated outcomes.

The situation remains fluid albeit that the following measures have been taken by the
business to ensure that the business continues during these volatile times.

Financing
Vodacom’s conservative funding approach ensured that we have well managed balance
sheet. Our leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA-aL 1(excluding lease liabilities) at 30
September 2019 was 0.9 times.

  •   Short term debt was refinanced during the year and repayment periods extended.
      Vodacom has no significant debt repayments due during the next 12 months.
  •   The company continues to monitor its debt exposure between fixed and variable
      rates, to ensure a balanced portfolio in an uncertain and volatile environment.


             1
                 Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation; and after lease accounting





 •   In order to ensure that short term liquidity can be met and volatility absorbed, existing
     committed facilities with banks have been doubled by converting shadow facilities to
     committed facilities resulting in a total of R8 billion committed facilities.


     Supply chain


     To date we have not experienced significant device and / or hardware supply disruptions that
     would have negatively impacted business. We are putting further measures in place to avoid
     disruptions and are working closely with our suppliers and partners in order to maintain
     critical supplies during this period. Where possible we have stockpiled some critical network
     and device elements to ensure that the network can remain available, while ensuring that
     customers will get access to devices while working from home.


     Demand
     Overall we have noted increased traffic across our operations. Driven by increased working
     from home initiatives and entertainment at home. Following the implementation of lock down
     regulations in South Africa we noted a surge in data traffic on the network of up to 40% in
     comparison to pre-lock down implementation due to increased traffic as people work and
     entertain from home, but also due to zero-rating certain education, government and health
     sites to assist during the crisis. We are expecting this trend to continue in the short to
     medium term as more customers work from home and people using technology to remain
     connected, educated and entertained.
     
        Network
        Our engineers are ensuring that the network can cater for additional demand to ensure an
        efficient communication channel. Where necessary we have the opportunity to offload more
        of our capacity to the Rain network in terms of our existing 4G roaming agreement with this
        partner. This allows for capacity alleviation on the Vodacom network. In order to increase the
        resilience of our network, we increased investment into capacity upgrades and batteries
        already in March and will continue with this to handle increased traffic and ensure
        availability.

        Separately, we have submitted a request for additional spectrum as per the minister of
        Communications and Digital Technologies invitation to apply for temporary spectrum
        allocations. As per the departments’ timetable we expect to receive feedback during the
        week. This will further ensure that network throughput remains optimal for all customers
        during this period, while being able to expand into certain underserved areas as well.

        Distribution
        In South Africa, where full lock down is in place, customers can continue purchasing airtime
        at a number of service stations, retail shops and spaza outlets, which have been allowed to
        sell food and other essential services during this period. We also offer services such as
        airtime transfer for customers to be able to transfer airtime between family and friends, while
        airtime advance will allow customers to remain connected, until such time that airtime
        recharge is required. Our online channels, including the MyVodacom app and Vodapay also
        make it possible for customers to continue to purchase.


             The longer term effects that lock downs across the globe will have on the world economy as
             well as the South African economy remains unknown. While we expect a short term increase
             in demand for our services, medium term economic downturn is not good for any business.
             We are attempting to manage the crisis in a responsible and sustainable way to ensure we
             minimise financial impact.

             At this time of uncertainty, we are extending a hand of support to the South African
             government in various ways. The ConnectU platform is used as a tool to ensure that
             customer remain connected and kids can stay educated through our e-school learning
             platform. Vodacom has partnered with Discovery health, to provide an on-line health care
             screening process for COVID-19. Citizens can access the portal free of charge and get an
             assessment based on questionnaire on whether further consultation is required. This can
             then be done via a virtual online doctor consultation which is provided for free by Vodacom
             and Discovery for up to 100 000 consultations. This will assist in relieving some of the
             pressure experienced by the health authorities. Vodacom has donated 20 000 smartphones
             plus 100 terabytes in data and 10 million voice call minutes to the National Department of
             Health. This will be used by frontline health workers to collect and transmit data in real time
             for resource planning purposes as government accelerates its COVID-19 testing campaign.
             We are also supporting governments with Big Data analytics using anonymised data to
             model and monitor the spread of the virus. We have also made M-Pesa person to person
             transactions below a certain amount free across a number of our markets. We also support
             governments across our markets with various initiatives during the crisis.

             We continue to monitor the effects that various actions will have on our economies as well
             as the resultant effects on our business. Vodacom will be releasing its results on or about 11
             May 2020 for the year ended 31 March 2020 at which time more information will be
             presented to shareholders and stakeholders.

Shareholders are referred to the announcement by the South African Government on Sunday
15 March 2020 which declared a national state of disaster in response to the Covid-19
pandemic.

Vodacom’s priority is the health and safety of our employees while continuing to deliver services
and support to our customers.

We continue to closely monitor the latest guidance from the WHO, national, regional and local
health authorities and have well developed business continuity plans in place for dealing with
such events. These include co-ordinated regional and international incident management,
response strategies and the increased ability for Vodacom employees to work remotely without
disruption. We have a dedicated team working to maintain the level of service our customers
expect from us and have made available various digital offerings to assist enterprise clients. Our
day-to-day operations will continue and should not be affected during this period.

The data, voice and connectivity services that we offer, will allow customers to continue to stay
connected while reducing social contact, thereby assisting in curbing the spread of the virus. We
are ensuring that we have sufficient network capacity to enable people and businesses to
seamlessly work from home as South Africa, and our other operations, are very dependent on
mobile services due to limited fixed line connectivity.

Given the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible to quantify with certainty the future impact
Covid-19 may have on the business - both from an operational and financial perspective.
Management is monitoring the situation and proactively dealing with the related challenges. To
date we have not experienced significant supply disruptions, we are however monitoring the
situation closely and putting the necessary measures in place to avoid disruptions. We are
confident that we have the right strategy in place and that we are well positioned to navigate
through this period.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Vodacom will assist governments and do what is possible, in
order to cope with the Covid-19 situation.

Voluntary announcement - Competition Commission data pricing enquiry

Shareholders are advised that Vodacom Group has reached an agreement with the Competition Commission
and has issued the following media statement outlining details of the agreement reached:


R2.7 billion boost for customers as Vodacom cuts data prices, launches free data service
On 1 April 2020, Vodacom South Africa will introduce a range of initiatives that will result in R2.7 billion in
additional savings for customers. This forms part of a broader Vodacom Group programme to create a Social
Contract with its stakeholders that will address pressing societal challenges in each of the markets in which it
operates.

Commenting on the latest Competition Commission announcement, Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub,
said: ""Following the release of the Competition Commission's Final Data Market Inquiry Report in December last
year, Vodacom decided to engage constructively with the Commission on the issues arising from the report. The
agreement struck with the Commission provides us with an opportunity to enter into a Social Contract with the
regulators, our customers and the people of South Africa to bring down the cost to communicate and promote
digital inclusion. In terms of the agreement, and following confirmation by the Tribunal, Vodacom will introduce
price reductions across all its monthly bundles and provide free access to basic internet, essential services and
cheaper pricing to the poorest communities. This will promote greater digital inclusion and assist with societal
problems in education and unemployment.""

Over the past three years, Vodacom has made significant progress in reducing the cost to communicate and
making data more accessible, particularly for poorer consumers and communities. For example, in 2019, we
announced substantial cuts in out-of-bundle tariffs and introduced hourly, daily and weekly bundles with much
lower effective prices to drive affordability in addition to overall reductions in bundle prices. These measures
contributed to R2 billion in savings for customers and the circa 50% reduction in effective data prices in the past
two years.

In line with our purpose of connecting people to a better future, education has been and remains integral to
Vodacom in driving digital inclusion. To this end, Vodacom has already connected over 3000 schools and, in
partnership with the Department of Basic education, runs 92 teacher training centres and 10 youth centres.
Vodacom also provides free access to the portals of most of the country's public universities.
""Having heard the concerns raised by the Competition Commission, we proactively entered into a Social Contract
with government and the public. We did this at a time when South African consumers are under increasing
financial pressure and on the understanding that action will be taken by ICASA and Government to auction high
demand spectrum. Delays in assigning spectrum and completing the digital migration has curbed the pace at
which data prices could have fallen,"" adds Shameel.

The data price cuts and free data services that Vodacom will introduce on 1 April 2020 includes:

    *   Accelerating our data pricing transformation on our 30-day bundles by reducing prices by up to 40%.
        Notably, 1GB of data valid for 30 days - often referred to as the ""headline price"" - will reduce by 34%
        from R149 to R99 on all channels. Discounts will be provided on all 30-day bundles while further
        decreases will be effected on 1 April 2021.

    *   With regard to access to free data services, we will be consolidating all existing zero-rated data services
        with new essential services aimed at social upliftment into a single platform called ""Connect U"". This
        social platform will provide Vodacom customers with:
             o    Free access to job portals, where youth can search for employment and upload their CVs.
             o    Free educational content like our e-School platform which provides CAPS curriculum aligned
                  content from Grades R - 12.
             o    Free Health and wellness information through our Mum & Baby platform focused on equipping
                  mothers and caregivers with advice on pregnancy, neonatal and childcare through SMS,
                  educational articles, tutorials, videos and other tools.
             o    Free access to Facebook Flex, the low data alternative to Facebook that enables customers to
                  stay socially connected.
             o    Access to two free SMS's per day to customers, provided they have made a purchase in the
                  past month and they can access these on the new portal.
             o    Extending further discounted bundle offers to pre-paid customers in areas where the majority
                  of people living beneath the food poverty line. This will benefit more than 2000 suburbs and
                  villages, ensuring that this benefits people that really need it most.
             o    Zero-rated access to select government sites to assist members of the public in accessing
                  government services such as Home Affairs, Ambulance Services, Education sites and
                  Government Communication Services. This will assist everyone in gaining access to much
                  needed government services as these are now moving into the digital space as well.
             o    Expanding our zero-rated offering to all schools, universities and T-Vet colleges across the
                  country. This will ensure that learners and students enrolled into these institutions will be able
                  to access relevant information for free via their portals.
             o    A full zero-rated internet search function powered by Wikipedia. This will allow customers
                  access to the entire Wikipedia database of knowledge free of charge.
             o    Free access to other essential information such as local and international headlines, trends
                  and the weather.

""We believe these commitments, as part of our social contract, will go a long way in assisting customers in these
tough economic times and driving digital inclusion for all,"" concludes Shameel.

Vodacom Group CEO, Shameel Joosub, will host a conference call at 16:00 (SA time), 14:00 (London time) and
9:00 (New York time) on Tuesday 10 March 2020 to discuss the agreement reached between the Competition
Commission and Vodacom. For conference call details please email vodacomir@vodacom.co.za.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
Our sustained investment programme, aimed at delivering a better experience for customers in each of the countries where
we operate, continues to yield results. This is reflected in the additional 2 million customers that we connected during the
quarter, contributing to growth of 6.6% in revenue for the Vodacom Group. We now serve over 117 million customers1
across the Group.

As expected, growth trends improved across a number of metrics in South Africa following the significant impacts over the
past year from our ongoing pricing transformation strategy. These included substantial cuts in out-of-bundle tariffs and lower
bundle prices, resulting in a circa 50% decline in effective data prices since March 2016.
A highly successful Summer campaign, which delivered 334 million free rewards to 17 million customers, contributed to an
uplift in activity across our customer base. This increase in data customers and usage is evidence of our success in

transforming data pricing in South Africa. Notable contributions from our Financial Services and Enterprise businesses saw
service revenue in South Africa rise by 4.6% despite a subdued economy.

I am particularly pleased with the consistency in the performance of our International portfolio, which produced solid results
on the back of strong demand for data and M-Pesa services, resulting in a 9% growth in service revenue. Our operations
outside South Africa now contribute over 40%1 to Group service revenue. In January we had to disconnect 1.7 million
customers in Tanzania, as a result of customer registration requirements, primarily due to the lack of government approved
identification documents. This will have an impact on our growth in Tanzania, however we expect to reconnect many of
these customers over the short to medium term once biometrically registered.
Looking ahead, customers can expect to experience the benefit of our revised roaming deal with Rain, which will further
expand our 4G capacity in an environment where delays in assigning available spectrum will constrain capacity for all
networks.

Having been the first network to commercially launch 5G in Africa through Vodacom Lesotho, we expect to be able to launch
5G services in South Africa this year. This is possible thanks to a recent roaming agreement with Liquid Telecom, as 5G
spectrum is largely unassigned in South Africa.
Vodacom remains committed to delivering on its pricing transformation strategy and has engaged constructively with
relevant authorities, including the Competition Commission, to share the measures we intend to introduce in due course to
further reduce data prices.
