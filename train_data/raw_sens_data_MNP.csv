Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance,15 Oct 2020,"Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance

Mondi plc
(Incorporated in England and Wales)
(Registered number: 6209386)
LEI: 213800LOZA69QFDC9N34

LSE share code: MNDI                  ISIN: GB00B1CRLC47
JSE share code: MNP

15 October 2020

Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance

Underlying EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was €306 million, down 20% on the comparable prior year
period (Q3 2019: €383 million), as lower average selling prices and negative currency effects more than
offset lower costs. Compared to the second quarter of 2020 (‘sequentially’), underlying EBITDA was down
13% (Q2 2020: €353 million). Good volume growth in uncoated fine paper and fibre-based packaging
products and ongoing strong cost control were more than offset by the impact of planned maintenance shuts,
negative currency effects and lower average selling prices.

Andrew King, Group CEO, commented “The decisive action we took in the early stages of the COVID-19
pandemic helped to protect our people, maintain supply of essential products and services, and deliver a
resilient performance. Our people have demonstrated their enterprise and commitment, taking care of
colleagues, communities and customers in these unprecedented times.

I am pleased that sustainable packaging continues to be a focus for our customers. We continue to make
good progress leveraging our award-winning innovation capabilities and customer-centric approach to
optimise packaging design using ‘paper where possible, plastic when useful’.”

In Corrugated Packaging, demand from e-commerce and consumer applications remained strong. We
also saw some recovery in industrial end-uses from the lows of the second quarter. We achieved good
volume growth in Corrugated Solutions measured both year-on-year and sequentially. Given the strong
order position and normalised inventory levels, we are currently in discussions with customers around price
increases for various containerboard grades.

Flexible Packaging demand remained resilient during the period and volumes in our paper bags business
grew year-on-year. Following a strong performance in the first half, we saw some supply chain de-stocking
effects impacting volumes in our consumer flexibles business during the quarter.

We continue to leverage Engineered Materials’ coating technologies to develop sustainable packaging
solutions. As expected, we saw lower personal care component volumes as a key product matures. Demand
in industrial and specialised end-uses continued to be impacted by lockdown restrictions, in particular in
release liner. We are implementing a range of measures to reduce the cost base, including the closure of a
release liner plant in Pleasant Prairie (Wisconsin, US) and engaging with employee representatives on the
restructuring of our personal care components focused operations in Gronau (Germany).

Encouragingly, Uncoated Fine Paper demand improved as lockdown restrictions in Europe, Russia and
Southern Africa eased with a gradual pick-up in activity in schools, offices and commercial printing. Sales
volumes were significantly up sequentially, although they are still down on the comparable prior year
period. Average uncoated fine paper prices were lower than in the first half of the year. Our South African
operations are currently affected by an industry-wide strike. We are engaging with trade unions and
employee representatives to reach an agreement while we continue to deliver products to our customers.
The Uncoated Fine Paper business remains well-positioned in the context of the current market
challenges given our cost competitiveness, product diversification and geographic positioning.
Average input costs were stable sequentially and cost control was strong across the business. Currency
movements had a net negative impact on underlying EBITDA compared to the second quarter, driven by a
weaker US dollar, impacting a number of the Group's globally traded products, coupled with a weaker
Russian rouble and Turkish lira. Given prevailing exchange rates, we anticipate a further net negative
currency impact in the fourth quarter.

To protect our employees and suppliers and minimise execution risk, we decided to postpone most planned
maintenance shuts to the second half of the year. During the quarter, planned maintenance shuts with an
estimated impact on underlying EBITDA of around €35 million (2019: €40 million) were carried out
successfully. Based on prevailing market prices, we continue to estimate that the impact of planned mill
maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA for 2020 will be around €100 million (2019: €150 million), with the
fourth quarter impact expected to be around €55 million (2019: €30 million).

Our major capital investment projects are progressing according to plan. The €67 million capital investment
project to convert a containerboard machine at Steti (Czech Republic) to become fully dedicated to the
production of speciality kraft paper for shopping bag applications is scheduled to be commissioned during
the fourth quarter. This additional capacity (75,000 tonnes) further supports our retail customers in their
efforts to replace unnecessary plastic as they transition to more sustainable packaging solutions that
contribute to the circular economy.

During the period, we paid an interim dividend to shareholders amounting to €237 million. We also redeemed
our 3.375% €500 million Eurobond from available cash. There are no other material short-term debt
maturities. The Group’s financial position remains strong, with liquidity of around €970 million.

Outlook

The macro-economic outlook continues to be uncertain, however we are confident that the Group will
continue to demonstrate its resilience, while remaining well-positioned for when the recovery takes place.
Our confidence is underpinned by Mondi’s integrated high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, culture of
continuous improvement, portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions and the strategic flexibility offered by
our strong cash generation and financial position.

Mondi Group – Interim Dividends ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

This morning in our half-year results announcement we announced the Board
was pleased to resume the payment of dividends. The Board has declared a
dividend of 29.75 euro cents per ordinary share relating to the year ended 31
December 2019. In addition, the Board has declared an interim dividend of 19.00
euro cents per ordinary share for the year ending 31 December 2020.

Both dividends, amounting to a total of 48.75 euro cents per share, will be paid
as interim dividends on Tuesday 29 September 2020 to all Mondi plc ordinary
shareholders on either the UK main register or the South African branch register
on Friday 21 August 2020.

The same timetable will be followed for both.

Mondi plc will pay its dividends in euro. However, ordinary shareholders resident
in the United Kingdom will receive the dividends in sterling (unless shareholders
have elected to receive their dividend in euro). The last date for euro currency
elections will be Monday 7 September 2020. The exchange rate will be set on
Tuesday 15 September 2020.

Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register will
receive the dividends in South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1
to ZAR 20.80457. Therefore, the equivalent gross dividend relating to the year
ended 31 December 2019 in rand cents per ordinary share will be 618.93596 and
the equivalent gross 2020 interim dividend in rand cents per ordinary share will
be 395.28683.

For shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register, the
dividend will, for South African dividends tax purposes, be taxed like local
dividends. As such, for South African tax resident shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register, dividends withholding tax will be
withheld from the dividends payable to these shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net dividend
relating to the year ended 31 December 2019 of 495.14877 rand cents per
ordinary share and a net 2020 interim dividend of 316.22946 rand cents per
ordinary share. Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch
register who are not tax resident in South Africa are exempted from South
African dividends withholdings tax.

For the purposes of South Africa dividends tax reporting, the source of income
for the payment of the dividends is the United Kingdom.



Additional Information

The interim dividends will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi plc had a total of 485,553,780 ordinary shares in issue of which
135,556,939 were held on the branch register, excluding treasury shares, at the
dividend declaration date of 6 August 2020.

Andrew King, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""Mondi delivered a robust performance in the first half of 2020, with underlying EBITDA of €738 million. This reflects the
resilience of our business model, achieved despite starting the year with significantly lower average selling prices
across our key pulp and paper grades and the challenges brought by COVID-19.

We took decisive action in the early stages of the pandemic, moving quickly to safeguard our people, support our
communities and protect the profitability, liquidity and cash flow of the business while seeking to ensure we are well
placed to benefit when the recovery comes.

Sustainable packaging continues to be a long-term priority for our customers and wider society. As a leading producer
of both paper and flexible plastic-based packaging, we are in a unique position to support our customers’ environmental
goals with packaging that is sustainable by design adhering to our principle of paper where possible, plastic when
useful.

The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. Having delivered a robust trading performance in the
first half of the year and given our resilient business model and strong financial position, the Board has revisited the
decision taken in April to suspend the final 2019 dividend and is pleased to resume the payment of dividends.

The Board has declared a dividend of 29.75 euro cents per share relating to 2019. Together with the 2019 interim ordinary
dividend paid in September 2019, this results in a total dividend of 57.03 euro cents per share relating to the 2019
financial year, covered three times by 2019 underlying earnings per share. This is in line with our stated dividend policy
of targeting a cover range on average of two to three times underlying earnings over the business cycle. Furthermore,
the Board has declared a 2020 interim ordinary dividend of 19.00 euro cents per share, bringing the total dividend
declared to 48.75 euro cents per share.

Going into the second half of 2020, heightened macro-economic uncertainties remain. Pricing across our key pulp and
paper grades is below or in line with the average of the first half. Demand for packaging daily essentials remains robust
while we continue to see weakness in certain industrial end-uses. Uncoated fine paper order books have picked up from
the lows seen in the second quarter, albeit we do not expect a near-term recovery to pre-pandemic levels. We have
rescheduled planned mill maintenance shuts which will have an impact on the second half of the year.

We are confident that the Group will continue to demonstrate its resilience in the event of a prolonged macro-economic
downturn, while remaining well-positioned when the recovery takes place. This is underpinned by the Group's integrated
high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, culture of continuous improvement, portfolio of sustainable packaging
solutions and the strategic flexibility offered by our strong cash generation and financial position.

I firmly believe that our embedded safety culture was key in facilitating a fast and effective response to protect our
people, communities and business partners during this pandemic. I am incredibly proud of how our teams have risen to
the challenge and my thanks go to my colleagues for their endurance, enterprise and ongoing commitment.""



Dividend
The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. Having delivered a robust trading performance in the first half
of the year and given our resilient business model and strong financial position, the Board has revisited the decision taken in April
to suspend the final 2019 dividend and is pleased to resume the payment of dividends.

The Board has declared a dividend of 29.75 euro cents per share relating to 2019. Furthermore, the Board has declared a 2020
interim ordinary dividend of 19.00 euro cents per share. Both dividends, amounting to a total of 48.75 euro cents per share (total
of around €236 million), will be paid as interim dividends in accordance with the timetable shown below.

This decision is consistent with our stated cover policy, while ensuring we retain the optionality for further value accretive growth
provided by a strong financial position. Our dividend policy remains unchanged.

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of Logging Industries for the Year 2019

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2019 has been published in
accordance with the UK’s Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). This regulation implements the two EU
Directives in the UK, mandating annual reports by companies in the extractives and logging industries of their payments to governments in countries in which
they operate.

To read details of Mondi’s payments to governments go to www.mondigroup.com/en/corporate-governance/regulatory-reports

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our logging activities and specifically to the disclosure of payments to governments relating to the
logging of primary forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations definition of ‘primary forest’ being:

‘Naturally regenerated forest of native tree species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not
significantly disturbed’.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ‘IFL 2000’ (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute (WRI) and Transparent World) inventory of intact forests
has been used as the base for reporting on the harvesting of primary forests in the Komi Republic, Russia (‘Komi’).

Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi fall within the above definition of primary forests. Our operations in South Africa comprise plantation
forests that are not associated with any primary forests and therefore are excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation. In terms of the Russian Forestry Code and Mondi’s sustainable development policies all logged
areas are regenerated, either naturally or via planting where required, including tending and protection of the young forest stands for the next sustainable
forest cycle. During logging operations protected areas, High Conservation Value (HCV) areas and sensitive biotopes, comprising approximately 24% of the
area, are set aside for conservation.

Exchange rate
Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group’s reporting currency) are translated for this report using the average exchange rate during the
financial year to which it relates.

Further information

For further information regarding the Mondi Group’s approach to sustainably managing our forests, please refer to our Sustainable development report 2019
which can be found at www.mondigroup.com/sd19 and our sustainable forestry policy, one of our issue specific SD policies at

Annual General Meeting

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Mondi plc was held earlier today. In accordance with the arrangements announced on
9 April 2020, the AGM was held with the minimum quorum of two shareholders, facilitated by Mondi.

As notified to the market on 9 April 2020, the Board took the decision to no longer propose a final dividend for the year ended
31 December 2019. Resolution 4 was therefore withdrawn.

All resolutions were passed by shareholders by way of a poll and all valid proxy votes were included in the poll. The
Company's issued share capital on 5 May 2020 (the voting record date) was 485,553,780 ordinary shares of €0.20 each.
Overall approximately 76% of shares were voted. The total number of votes received on each resolution is as follows:

Protecting our people, communities and partners

the Group to play an important role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

All of our sites have implemented personal protection measures and intensified hygiene and social distancing
protocols that meet or exceed local and international guidelines, and, where possible, employees are working
remotely.

A multi-function response team closely monitors the latest developments, assessing risks, providing
guidance, and implementing preventative policies in line with individual government regulations and
recommendations in the countries in which we operate.

Trading update
The Group delivered a robust performance, in line with expectations, during the first quarter of 2020.
Underlying EBITDA of €385 million was 18% below the comparable prior year period (€471 million), driven
mainly by lower pricing across our key paper grades mitigated by lower input cost and our ongoing cost
reduction programmes. Underlying EBITDA was in line with the fourth quarter of 2019 (€381 million).

Our order books held up well in the first quarter, strengthening in consumer and e-commerce end-uses
across our packaging and Engineered Materials businesses as we continued to support our customers.
Towards the end of the quarter and into early April we saw a deterioration in our uncoated fine paper order
book in Europe and South Africa as the effects of the various lockdown measures took hold. We are taking
downtime at our Neusiedler mill (Austria) to manage our inventory levels, while we have temporarily stopped
production at the Merebank mill (South Africa; 270,000 tonnes of annual production capacity), in line with
government regulations. We will consider further such measures as required. In Flexible Packaging, while
we are seeing strength in a number of consumer related applications, particularly in food, beverage and
personal and home care, we are seeing somewhat weaker trading with our customers in building and
construction industries and a mixed picture in industrial and other end-uses.

With the exception of the temporary closure of the Merebank paper mill and temporary closures or other
production interruptions at a small number of our paper bags converting plants, all our facilities have been
in operation throughout the period. Similarly, to date supply chain issues have been manageable, although
we are seeing delays and increased costs in logistics.

The potential impacts of COVID-19 remain very unclear and the pace of change means any effect on
operations and the Group’s financial performance for the year are difficult to predict.
Update on capital expenditure, maintenance shuts schedule and cost mitigation measures
We have moved quickly to protect profitability, liquidity and cash flow while seeking to ensure we are well
placed to benefit when the recovery takes place. Furthermore, we have adjusted our near term priorities to
mitigate the health risks to our on-site employees.

We have postponed non-essential capital expenditure and slowed down some of our major capital projects,
thereby both reducing near term cash outflows and minimising contractors and other non-operating people
on our key sites. As a result, we now expect capital expenditure of around €600 million (previously €700-800
million) in 2020. This is likely to cause limited delays to the commissioning of certain of our capital investment
projects. We have also postponed annual mill maintenance shuts to the second half of the year.

Discretionary spend has been stopped and we continue to actively manage our cost base to mitigate any
impacts.

Strong financial position
Mondi has a strong balance sheet, sector leading investment grade credit ratings, good relationships with a
broad group of banks, and has recently demonstrated its access to the public bond markets with the
successful launch of a €750 million 8-year Eurobond. As at 31 December 2019, the net debt to underlying
EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, well below our single bank debt covenant of 3.5x net debt to underlying EBITDA
(excluding the impact of IFRS16 adjustments).

Mondi currently has a strong liquidity position of around €1.5 billion, comprising €705 million undrawn
committed debt facilities and cash of approximately €800 million, being principally the proceeds from the 8-
year Eurobond issued on 1 April 2020 and other cash in hand.

Our core banks have recently agreed to extend the maturity date of the €750 million Syndicated Revolving
Credit Facility from July 2021 to July 2022. The Group has a €500 million Eurobond maturing in September
2020; there are no other material maturities until 2024.

Dividend
Despite the Group’s strong balance sheet, the proactive measures it is taking to manage the current risks
and the robust trading position to date, it is clear that the operating and trading environment is one of
significantly heightened uncertainty. After due consideration, the Board has decided it is prudent to no longer
propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2019 at the forthcoming AGM.

The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. While it is its intention to pay a dividend,
the Board will consider the appropriateness, quantum and timing of an additional interim dividend payment
relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 when it has a clearer view of the effects of COVID-
19 on the business and outlook.

Commenting on today’s announcement, Andrew King, Group CEO, said:

“Mondi is a resilient business offering packaging and other products for daily consumer needs, and delivering
essential services to the communities around its larger operations. We delivered a robust performance in the
first quarter and in this regard my thanks go to all our colleagues for their courage and commitment during
these challenging times. The Group is financially strong with a robust liquidity position and capital structure.
However, in these unprecedented times we are taking appropriate actions to ensure we remain well-placed
to withstand an extended period of uncertainty.”

Mondi Group - 2019 Final Ordinary Dividend ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

On 27 February 2020 Mondi Group announced, in its Preliminary Results
announcement, that a proposed final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31
December 2019 of 55.72 euro cents per ordinary share will be paid on Thursday
14 May 2020 to all Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on either the UK main
register or the South African branch register on Friday 3 April 2020.

The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the
annual general meeting scheduled for 7 May 2020.

Mondi plc will pay its dividend in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
final ordinary dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive
their dividend in euro). The last date for euro currency elections will be Tuesday
21 April 2020. The exchange rate for this payment will be set on Tuesday 28
April 2020.

Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register will
receive the final ordinary dividend in South African rand cents, converted at a
rate of EUR 1 to ZAR 16.77465. Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary
dividend in rand cents per ordinary share will be 934.68350.

For shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register, the
dividend will, for South African dividends tax purposes, be taxed like local
dividends. As such, for South African tax resident shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register, dividends withholding tax will be
withheld from the dividends payable to these shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net final ordinary
dividend of 747.74680 rand cents per ordinary share. Shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register who are not tax resident in South
Africa are exempted from South African dividends withholdings tax.
For the purposes of South Africa dividends tax reporting, the source of income
for the payment of the dividend is the United Kingdom.

Additional Information

The final ordinary dividend will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi plc had a total of 485,553,780 ordinary shares in issue of which
140,850,910 were held on the branch register, excluding treasury shares, at the
final ordinary dividend recommendation date of 27 February 2020.

Andrew King, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer designate, said:
""Mondi delivered a robust performance in 2019 against a backdrop of challenging trading conditions, with underlying
EBITDA of E1,658 million and ROCE of 19.8%. A solid operational performance, strong cost control and a good
contribution from acquisitions and capital investment projects, partially offset the effects of market pressures in a
number of key pulp and paper grades.

Our capital investment programme to deliver value accretive growth and enhance the ongoing cost competitiveness of
our operations remains on track. Having commissioned the pulp mill rebuild at our Ruzomberok mill (Slovakia) in the
second half of the year, we are making good progress on the related investment in a new 300,000 tonne kraft top white
machine at the same site and previously announced major capital investment projects at our Syktyvkar (Russia) and Steti
(Czech Republic) mills. Smaller expansionary projects underway at a number of our converting packaging operations will
further enhance our production capabilities and product offering to customers.

We completed the Simplification of our corporate structure from dual listed into a single holding company under Mondi
plc in July 2019, simplifying cash and dividend flows, increasing transparency, removing the complexity associated with
the previous structure and enhancing our strategic flexibility.

Offering sustainable packaging solutions has continued to be core to our strategy. With our unique product portfolio and
our EcoSolutions approach, we remain well positioned to support our customers in meeting their sustainability goals
with packaging that is sustainable by design - paper where possible, plastic when useful.

Looking ahead, we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging sectors in which we operate.
Heightened macro-economic uncertainties are likely to continue to affect markets in the short term and, while we are
seeing indications of stability in pricing in certain segments, we start the year with lower prices across our key paper
grades. Input cost relief, our ongoing profit improvement programmes and customer-centric innovation initiatives, and
the benefits from our capital expenditure pipeline will continue to support our performance.

With our robust business model, centred around our high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, our culture of
continuously driving performance and the strategic flexibility our strong cash generation and financial position bring, we
continue to look to the future with confidence.""



Dividend
The Board aims to offer shareholders long-term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three
times on average over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and confidence in the future of the business, the
Board has recommended an increase in the final ordinary dividend to 55.72 euro cents per share (2018: 54.55 euro cents per
share). The final ordinary dividend, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 27.28 euro cents per share, paid on
20 September 2019, amount to a total ordinary dividend for the year of 83.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 9% on the 2018
total ordinary dividend of 76.0 euro cents per share.
The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi plc at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for
7 May 2020 and, if approved, is payable on 14 May 2020 to shareholders on the register on 3 April 2020.
The proposed final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 December 2019 of 55.72 euro cents per share will be paid in
accordance with the following timetable:
