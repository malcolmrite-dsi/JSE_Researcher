REVIEWED ANNUAL GROUP RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2020 
AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION


- Group turnover up 9.6%
- Retail health and beauty sales up 8.4%
- UPD turnover up 11.2%
- Diluted headline earnings per share up 13.7% 
- Dividend of 450 cents per share
- Cash at year-end R2.2 billion 


OVERVIEW
Clicks Group delivered a strong and resilient performance against the background of a global 
humanitarian crisis and a deepening economic recession locally.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 8.4% supported by strong front shop health sales growth 
during the pandemic. UPD reported robust growth of 11.2% and continued to gain market share after 
securing new wholesale and bulk distribution contracts.

Tight cost management, continued working capital efficiency, pleasing health and beauty sales and 
the strong performance of UPD were the main contributors to the group's diluted headline earnings 
per share increasing by 13.7% to 754 cents. 

The board has declared a dividend of 450 cents per share for the full year, based on a dividend 
payout ratio of 60%.

IMPACT OF COVID-19
As essential healthcare service providers Clicks and UPD traded throughout the national lockdown 
which started on 27 March 2020. Management responded decisively to the lockdown, immediately 
implementing measures to reduce the group's cost base to off-set the impact of slower sales, 
with cash preservation being a priority to protect shareholder value.

Trading patterns shifted as customer shopping behaviour changed in response to the various lockdown 
restrictions. 

The accessibility of the Clicks store network proved beneficial, with 74% of stores located in 
convenience and neighbourhood shopping centres. This largely negated the significant slowdown in 
footfall at super regional and regional malls across the country.

Online sales in Clicks increased by 361% off a relatively low base for the second half of the 
financial year, reaping the benefit of the investment in its e-commerce and digital platform over 
the past four years.

The absence of a traditional winter cold and flu season adversely impacted pharmacy sales.  

Clicks stores were restricted to shorter trading hours and limited to selling only essential 
products under lockdown level 5 until 30 April 2020. The group's other retail brand stores all 
closed from the start of the lockdown. The Body Shop reopened from 1 May 2020 while Musica and 
ClaireÂ´s reopened from 1 June 2020 when the country moved to lockdown level 3. The group received 
some rental relief on stores which were closed due to the lockdown.

UPD's business to the private hospital and independent pharmacy channels grew strongly due to 
increased demand for medicines and healthcare products during the pandemic. 

The group incurred Covid-19-related costs of R44 million. This was off-set by focused cost 
management, lower overtime payments owing to restricted trading hours, rental reductions due to 
store closures and government funding for employees unable to work during the lockdown. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 9.6% to R34.4 billion. Retail sales grew by 7.3% and by 3.4% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of 2.2%. Distribution turnover increased by 11.2% 
with price inflation of 2.5% for the year. 

Total income grew by 8.4% to R9.4 billion. The retail margin was maintained at 33.3% while the 
distribution margin strengthened by 30 basis points to 8.5% owing to the benefit of new contracts 
and the higher annual increase in the single exit price (SEP) of medicines.

Retail expenses grew by 6.5% as the group continued to invest in new Clicks stores and pharmacies 
over the past year. UPD expenses, which include the costs related to the new wholesale and bulk 
distribution contracts, grew by 17.9%.

Group operating profit increased by 10.4% to R2.8 billion with the group's operating margin 
expanding by 10 basis points to 8.1%. The retail margin was well managed and increased by 20 basis 
points to 9.1% despite the impact of Covid-19 on the trading environment. The distribution margin 
was maintained at 3.3%. 

Headline earnings grew by 12.2% to R1.9 billion. Earnings per share increased by 11.4% to 
751 cents with headline earnings per share increasing by 11.7% to 754 cents. Diluted headline 
earnings per share grew by 13.7%.

Inventory days reduced from 70 to 66 days as stock levels were tightly managed in the second half 
of the year.  

Cash generated by operating activities before dividends paid totalled R2.3 billion. Capital 
expenditure of R591 million (2019: R647 million) was invested mainly in new stores and pharmacies, 
store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. 

The group returned R822 million to shareholders in dividend payments and R653 million in share 
buy-backs. At year-end the group held cash resources of R2.2 billion.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the international franchise brands GNC, 
The Body Shop and Claire's, increased by 8.4%, driven by competitive everyday pricing, 
differentiated product ranges, the Clicks ClubCard, new stores and online sales. Sales in 
comparable stores increased by 4.1%, with volume growth of 2.1% and inflation of 2.0%.

Clicks opened 39 stores to expand its retail footprint to 743 stores and increased its pharmacy 
network to 585 following the opening of 40 pharmacies. Clicks ClubCard active membership increased 
to 8.6 million and accounted for 78.2% of the brand's sales. 

UPD grew wholesale turnover by 17.0% as the business gained new private hospital and buying group 
contracts. This contributed to UPD increasing its market share from 27.0% to 29.4% at August 2020 
(source IQVIA). UPD's total managed turnover, combining wholesale turnover and turnover managed on 
behalf of bulk distribution clients, increased by 11.7% to R23.6 billion as the business gained 
two distribution contracts.

OUTLOOK
The performance of the past year has again demonstrated that the group's core health and beauty 
markets and business model are resilient. 

The consumer environment is expected to be extremely constrained in the year ahead owing to the 
continuing impact of Covid-19 and the socio-economic challenges arising from the lockdown. 
The first half of the new financial year was initially impacted by protest action at Clicks stores 
in early September and will be further affected by the widespread job losses expected in the 
aftermath of the pandemic.

The business has traded well in weak consumer markets over a sustained period and has adapted to 
the new market dynamics arising out of the Covid-19 crisis. 

The group has a robust balance sheet, generates strong cash flows and the directors remain confident 
in the group's ability to deliver on its medium-term targets.

Ernst & Young Inc., the group's independent auditor, has expressed an unmodified review conclusion 
on the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FINAL DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend for the period ended 
31 August 2020 of 450.0 cents per share (2019: 327.0 cents per share). The source of the dividend 
will be from distributable reserves and it will be paid in cash. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 90.0 cents per ordinary share will be withheld in terms of 
the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a 
dividend of 360.0 cents net of DT. 

The Company has 248 662 647 ordinary shares in issue. Its income tax reference number is 
9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the final dividend:

TRADING UPDATE AND VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT

TRADING UPDATE FOR 23 WEEKS FROM 1 MARCH TO 9 AUGUST 2020

Clicks Group presents the following update to provide insight into the group’s
trading performance against the background of the Covid-19 pandemic and the
resultant national lockdown. This 23-week period covers trading from the start of
the second half of the group’s financial year, including the period immediately
before the country entered varying levels of lockdown from 27 March 2020, and
the subsequent four months of trading.

Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The
Body Shop, GNC and Claire’s, increased by 7.7% over the corresponding 23
weeks in the previous year. Total retail sales grew by 6.3%.

As an essential healthcare service provider Clicks has traded throughout the
lockdown period, although has been restricted to shorter trading hours and was
limited to selling only essential products under lockdown level 5 until 30 April
2020.

Trading patterns shifted as customer shopping behaviour changed in response to
the various lockdown level restrictions and consumers chose to stay home to
reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19.

Online sales in Clicks have shown significant growth since the start of lockdown.
The investment made in its online and digital capability over the past four years
enabled the brand to manage the increased demand and ensure an efficient and
convenient service to customers.

Clicks has experienced a decline in the frequency of customer visits during the
lockdown while the average basket value has increased over this time. The
decline in footfall at super regional and regional malls across the country has
impacted sales in destination stores. However, Clicks is well positioned in this
environment with over 70% of its stores located in convenience and
neighbourhood shopping centres.

Pharmacy sales have been negatively impacted as the country has not
experienced a traditional winter cold and flu season which is generally a strong
driver of sales growth. The incidence of colds and flu has been limited as South
Africans are wearing face masks during the pandemic, social interaction has
been limited, schooling restricted and large numbers of people are working from
home.

The group’s other retail brand stores all closed for the lockdown commencing on
27 March 2020. The Body Shop stores reopened from 1 May 2020 while Musica
and Claire’s stores reopened from 1 June 2020 when the country moved to
lockdown level 3. The group received rental relief on stores which were closed
due to lockdown.

UPD’s turnover for the period grew by 11.4% owing to strong growth from the
private hospital channel due to increased demand for medicines and healthcare
products. Sales growth was further supported by good growth from independent
pharmacies and the benefit of new contracts.

Group turnover for the 23 weeks increased by 10.2%.

TRADING UPDATE FOR 49 WEEKS TO 9 AUGUST 2020

Group turnover increased by 10.0% to R32.3 billion in the 49 weeks to 9 August
2020.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 8.7%. Health and beauty sales in
comparable stores increased by 4.6% with volume growth of 2.6% as selling
price inflation averaged 2.0% for the 49 weeks.

Total retail sales increased by 7.5% and by 3.9% in comparable stores, with
selling price inflation of 2.2%.

UPD increased turnover by 11.7%. Total managed turnover, combining
wholesale turnover and turnover managed on behalf of bulk distribution clients,
increased by 10.6% as the business traded well and benefited from gaining new
private hospital and buying group contracts.

 Segmental turnover
                         Sales growth (%)        Inflation (%)
 Retail                               7.5                  2.2
 Distribution                        11.7                  2.5
 Intragroup turnover                  3.9
 Total group                         10.0                 2.3

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 AUGUST 2020

The group expects diluted headline earnings per share for the year ending 31
August 2020 to increase by between 10% and 15% over the 663.6 cents for the
2019 financial year to between 730 and 763 cents. The figure for 2019 was
restated following the adoption of IFRS 16.

The growth in earnings is supported by the group’s tight cost management,
continued working capital efficiency and the performance of UPD which gained
new contracts and traded strongly throughout the year.

The group’s balance sheet remains robust and the business has continued to
generate strong cash flows throughout the year. The directors plan to declare a
full year dividend within the group’s targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% - 65%.

The financial information in this announcement is the responsibility of the
directors and has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s independent
auditor.

- Retail health and beauty sales up 9.6%
- UPD turnover up 12.3%

- Earnings per share up 10.2%

OVERVIEW
Clicks Group continued its strong growth trend and delivered a highly competitive performance 
against a background of low economic growth, constrained consumer spending and extensive trading 
disruption due to electricity load shedding.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 9.6% as Clicks gained market share across all its 
core product categories. UPD reported strong sales growth of 12.3% and continued to gain market 
share after securing new wholesale contracts.

The strong performances from both the retail and distribution businesses, together with efficient 
capital management, contributed to the group's diluted headline earnings per share increasing by 
14.4% to 338 cents. 

Owing to the economic upheaval arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the board has decided to 
preserve cash and consider an annual dividend at year-end once there is greater certainty.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 9.9% to R16.9 billion. Retail sales grew by 8.6% and by 5.0% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of 2.7%. Distribution turnover increased by 12.3% 
with price inflation of 2.4% for the half-year. 

Total income grew by 8.2% to R4.6 billion, with the group's total income margin declining by 
40 basis points to 27.3%. The retail margin was impacted by higher operating costs at the retail 
Centurion distribution centre due to the implementation of a centralised single picking project. 
The UPD margin strengthened by 20 basis points as the business gained new wholesale contracts.

Retail expenses grew by 7.3% as the group invested in a net 41 new Clicks stores and 44 new 
pharmacies over the past 12 months. Comparable retail costs were contained to an increase of 3.8%. 
UPD expenses, which include the costs related to the new wholesale contracts, grew by 14.5%.

Group operating profit increased by 9.4% to R1.2 billion with the group's operating margin constant 
at 7.4%. The retail and distribution businesses both did well to hold margins despite the low 
inflationary environment and challenging trading conditions.

Headline earnings grew by 13.1% to R851.2 million. Earnings per share and headline earnings per 
share increased by 10.2% and 10.4% respectively to 338 cents.

Working capital continues to be efficiently managed and the group's net working capital improved 
from 37 to 35 days. Retail inventory levels were 12.3% higher owing to increased front shop stock 
levels shipped earlier due to Covid-19 challenges being experienced in China. The new wholesale 
contracts in UPD, together with strategic stock buy-ins due to anticipated supply chain challenges 
in Asia and the annual increase in the single exit price of medicines, have resulted in group 
inventory increasing by 22.1%. These stock levels are expected to normalise in the second half of 
the year. 

Cash generated by operating activities before dividends paid increased by 2.9% to R1.2 billion for 
the six months. Capital expenditure of R309 million (2019: R264 million) was invested mainly in 
new stores and pharmacies, store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. The group 
returned R822 million to shareholders in dividend payments, 20.5% higher than the prior period. 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by R857 million and the group had cash resources of 
R2.3 billion at the end of February 2020.

Subsequent to the reporting period the group repurchased 2 862 264 shares for a total consideration 
of R653.3 million as part of its ongoing capital management strategy aimed at enhancing returns to 
shareholders. The repurchases were made under a closed period mandate approved by the JSE. In order 
to preserve cash no further share repurchases have been made since South Africa entered the 
lockdown period.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, which includes Clicks and the franchise brands GNC, The Body Shop 
and Claire's, increased by 9.6%, driven by competitive pricing, differentiated product ranges, 
the Clicks ClubCard and new stores. Sales in comparable stores increased by 5.8%, with volume 
growth of 3.5% and inflation of 2.3% for the six months.

Clicks opened 17 stores in the six months to expand its retail footprint to 721 stores and 
increased its pharmacy network to 572 following the opening of 27 pharmacies. Clicks increased its 
share of the retail pharmacy market from 24.1% to 24.6% at February 2020 (source IQVIA). 

UPD grew wholesale turnover by 17.6% as the business gained new private hospital and buying group 
contracts. This contributed to UPD increasing its market share from 26.0% to 27.2% at February 2020 
(source IQVIA). 

TRADING UPDATE FOR SEVEN WEEKS TO 19 APRIL 2020
Following the declaration of the state of disaster in South Africa in response to the Covid-19 
pandemic and the subsequent announcement of the national lockdown, Clicks experienced unprecedented 
levels of sales demand by customers across stores nationally, particularly in hygiene and healthcare 
products. However, this trend has reversed during the lockdown period.

Retail sales for the seven weeks to 19 April 2020 (the period), being the first seven weeks of 
the second half of the financial year, increased by 7.9% with health and beauty sales up 9.3%. 
The period includes the first 24 days of the lockdown during which time Clicks has been restricted 
to shorter trading hours and limited to only selling essential products. All Musica, The Body Shop 
and Claire's stores are closed during the lockdown.

UPD's turnover for the period grew by 31.2% due to customers preparing for the Covid-19 impact. 
UPD is well positioned in terms of its scale and logistics capabilities to support all healthcare 
facilities with medicine requirements as the country deals with the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Group turnover for the period increased by 15.9%.

OUTLOOK
Trading conditions are expected to be extremely tough for the remainder of the financial year as 
the extent and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are unknown. This could be compounded by 
electricity load shedding which remains a risk to retail sales, particularly in the higher-demand 
winter season. The recent sharp depreciation in the value of the Rand could impact on selling price 
inflation towards the end of the financial year and place further pressure on constrained consumers.

The group's sustained long-term performance is evidence that the strategy and business model remain 
relevant and resilient. This will be severely tested in the months ahead. The business has a robust 
balance sheet, generates strong cash flows and its plans to open 38 new Clicks stores and 
40 pharmacies in the financial year are unchanged.

Despite the headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic the group is well positioned in its core markets 
to respond to the needs of retail and distribution customers during this time of uncertainty and 
crisis. The directors remain confident in the group's ability to deliver on its medium-term targets. 

The financial information in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's

Clicks Group chief executive Vikesh Ramsunder said the strong trading
performance in the weak consumer economy again demonstrated the resilience
of the Clicks brand and the defensive nature of the health and beauty markets in
which the group trades.
""Our wide range of gifting and value offering, supported by the convenience of
the Clicks chain's extensive retail and pharmacy footprint, ensured that we
maintained our robust sales momentum of recent years and sustained volume
growth.

""This was achieved despite the increasing pressures on consumer disposable
income, negative sentiment and the serious impact of electricity load shedding on
retail trading hours and shoppers in general over the past two months,"" he said.

OVERVIEW
Clicks Group posted another year of strong growth as both the Retail and Distribution businesses 
delivered highly competitive performances in an environment of low economic growth and challenging 
trading conditions. 

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 10.5% on good volume growth as Clicks gained market

comparable stores, with selling price inflation of only 1.5%. Distribution turnover increased by 
4.0% with price inflation of 0.9% for the year. 

Total income grew by 9.7% to R8.7 billion, with the group's total income margin strengthening by 
60 basis points to 27.6%. The Retail margin was impacted by increased transport costs and product 
mix. The UPD margin benefited mainly from gaining new distribution contracts.

Group operating profit increased by 14.2% to R2.3 billion, with the group's operating margin 
expanding by 40 basis points to 7.4%. The Retail and Distribution businesses both improved 
operating margins despite the low inflationary environment and challenging trading conditions.

Working capital continues to be efficiently managed and the group's net working capital improved 
from 36 to 34 days. 

Cash generated by operations increased by 19.5% to R2.9 billion. Capital expenditure of 
R647 million (2018: R671 million) was invested mainly in new stores and pharmacies, store 
refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. 

The group returned R1.2 billion to shareholders in dividend payments (R981 million) and share 
buy-backs (R211 million).

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, which includes Clicks and the franchise brands, GNC, The Body Shop 
and Claire's, increased by 10.5%, driven by competitive pricing, a differentiated product offer 
and new stores. Sales in comparable stores increased by 6.9% and showed strong volume growth of 
5.8%, with inflation of only 1.1% for the year.

Clicks opened its 700th store in August 2019, ending the year on 704 stores, and increased its 
pharmacy network to 545 pharmacies. Clicks increased its share of the retail pharmacy market from 
23.9% to 24.9% at August 2019 (source IQVIA). 

UPD's total managed turnover, combining wholesale and bulk distribution, increased by 17.6% to 
R21.1 billion. The business gained four new distribution contracts in the past year, increasing its 
portfolio of bulk distribution clients to 30. UPD grew wholesale turnover by 6.8% and increased 
its market share from 26.0% to 27.0% at August 2019 (source IQVIA).

OUTLOOK
While the consumer spending environment will continue to be constrained in the year ahead, 
the group has adapted well to trading in this protracted economic downturn and the group is 
confident of sustaining volume growth in the year ahead.

The group operates in growing and defensive health and beauty markets where the strategy and 
business model have proven to be resilient, ensuring that the group's market-leading brands are 
well positioned to increase market share.

(HEPS) for the year ending 31 August 2019 (""the period"") was forecast to

COMMENTARY

OVERVIEW 
Clicks Group delivered another strong health and beauty sales performance in the six months to 
February 2019 in an environment of low inflation, subdued economic growth and constrained 
consumer spending. 

Retail health and beauty sales grew by 8.5%, with good volume growth and market share gains across 
most product categories. 

UPD, the group's pharmaceutical distributor, reported a stellar performance by increasing operating 
profit by 27.2% and continuing to gain market share.

The group's performance for the half-year resulted in diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) 
increasing by 13.2% to 300.1 cents per share. The interim dividend was increased by 15.1% to 
118.0 cents per share. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 6.2% to R15.3 billion. Retail sales grew by 7.7% and by 4.5% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of only 1.0%. Distribution turnover increased by 
5.1% with price deflation of 0.2% for the six months. 

Total income grew by 8.9% to R4.3 billion, with the group's total income margin improving by 
60 basis points to 27.7%. The retail margin expanded owing to more customers switching to Clicks 
private label products and the positive mix impact from the stronger growth of front shop relative 
to pharmacy. UPD's margin benefited mainly from gaining new bulk distribution contracts. 

Retail expenses increased by 7.8% as the group invested in 33 new Clicks stores, 35 pharmacies and 
space extensions in 25 stores over the past 12 months. Comparable retail costs were contained to 
growth of 5.4%. UPD costs were impacted by the new bulk distribution contracts and grew by 12.4%. 

Group operating profit grew by 11.3% to R1 billion, with the operating margin expanding by 
30 basis points to 6.8%. The retail and distribution businesses both improved operating margins 
despite low selling price inflation and challenging trading conditions.

Inventory was tightly managed to an increase of 6.4%. Retail stock days improved from 81 to 79 days. 
UPD increased from 43 to 46 days owing to the additional stock bought in during February before 
the higher increase in the single exit price (SEP) of medicines. Overall working capital continues 
to be efficiently managed and the group's net working capital improved from 41 to 37 days.

Cash generated by operations before working capital changes rose by 13.7% to R1.3 billion for the 
six months. Capital expenditure of R264 million was invested mainly in new stores and pharmacies, 
store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. 

The group returned R686 million to shareholders in dividends and share buy-backs.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, which includes Clicks and the franchise brands of The Body Shop, 
GNC and Claire's, increased by 8.5%, driven by competitive pricing and appealing promotions. Sales 
in comparable stores increased by 5.2% and showed strong volume growth of 4.5%, with inflation of 
only 0.7% for the six months. 

Clicks opened 17 stores in the past six months and expanded its store footprint to 680, including 
496 convenience stores. A total of 18 new pharmacies were opened to extend the pharmacy network 
to 528. Clicks increased its share of the retail pharmacy market from 23.0% to 23.8% at the end 
of February 2019.

UPD's total managed turnover, combining wholesale and bulk distribution, increased by 21.9% to 
R10.2 billion. The business increased its bulk distribution portfolio to 24 clients by gaining 
four new distribution contracts over the past 12 months. UPD increased wholesale turnover by 5.2%, 
with market share growing from 25.4% to 26.0%. 

OUTLOOK
Macroeconomic conditions are not anticipated to improve in the short to medium term and management 
expects the trading environment to remain challenging in the second half of the financial year. 
Electricity load shedding continues to have a negative impact on consumer confidence and trading.

However, the group's core health and beauty markets as well as the business model are resilient and 
the group's market-leading brands are well positioned to increase market share.

In this difficult environment Clicks plans to capitalise on opportunities to accelerate its store 
expansion programme by opening 41 new stores in the financial year, well ahead of the targeted 25 
to 30 stores.

UPD has gained two new bulk distribution contracts which commence late in the second half and will 
also benefit from the slightly higher SEP increase granted for 2019. 

Capital investment of R437 million is planned for the second half of the year, split across the 
store and pharmacy network, and group infrastructure to support the increased scale of the business.

FULL-YEAR EARNINGS FORECAST
The directors forecast that diluted HEPS for the financial year ending 31 August 2019 will increase 
by between 10% and 15% over the 2018 financial year.

The forecast is based on the following key assumptions: 
-  the trading environment will remain constrained in the second half of the financial year and 
   could be further impacted by electricity load shedding; and

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved an interim gross ordinary dividend for the period ended 
28 February 2019 of 118.0 cents per share (2018: 102.5 cents per share). The source of the dividend 
will be from distributable reserves and it will be paid in cash.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 28 February 2019 
     have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements 
     for interim reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings 
     Requirements require interim reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts 
     and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards 
     (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
     and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, 
     as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. 

     The information contained in the interim report has neither been audited nor reviewed by the 
     group's external auditors. These condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared 
     under the supervision of M Fleming CA (SA), the chief financial officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the six months 
     ended 28 February 2019 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the 
     audited annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2018, with the exception of 
     the adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 for which the accounting policies were changed from 
     1 September 2018.

1.2  The segmental analysis for the period ended 28 February 2018 and the year ended 31 August 2018 
     have been restated with the adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. The restatements have been outlined 
     in note 1.8.

1.3  Related party transactions for the current period are similar to those disclosed in the group's 
     annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2018. During the period Clicks Group 
     Limited issued 261 396 ordinary shares to The New Clicks Foundation Trust arising from the 
     unwind of the final 50% of the employee share ownership scheme. No other significant related 
     party transactions arose during the current period.

1.4  In terms of the unwind of the final 50% of the Clicks Group Employee Share Ownership Scheme, 
     8 135 087 ordinary shares were issued to beneficiaries of the scheme and 14 576 648 ordinary 
     ""A"" shares were repurchased by Clicks Group Limited from the Employee Share Ownership Trust. 
     The New Clicks Foundation Trust acquired 261 396 ordinary shares from the vesting of the ESOP 
     scheme as at 28 February 2019.

1.5  During the period, the group acquired 23 850 Clicks Group Limited ordinary shares.

1.6  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial instruments 
     are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments, the investment in 
     Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited and investments held by The New Clicks Foundation Trust 
     which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of financial 
     instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques; 
     if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument 
     is included in level 2. All financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or 
     loss are considered to be level 2 investments, with the exception of investments held by

                                                                           16 221 689    15 229 223

     The group adopted IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a five-step 
     model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue arising from contracts with 
     customers. The group has elected to apply the new standard on a full retrospective basis. 
     The group recognises revenue when goods are sold to the customer at the consideration received. 

     The sale of certain items provides customers with a right of return. When contracts provide 
     customers with a right to return goods, the group recognises a refund liability in trade and 
     other payables and an asset for the right to recover products from a customer in inventories 
     with the difference recognised in retained earnings. The movement in the refund liability was 
     recognised in sales and the right of return asset in cost of sales in the comparative periods. 
     The adjustments resulted in a deferred tax asset being raised. 

     IFRS 9
     The group adopted IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments. The standard covers the recognition, 
     derecognition, classification and measurement of financial instruments, provides guidance on 
     hedge accounting and provides an expected credit loss model to determine the impairment provision 
     of financial assets. The group has elected to apply the new standard on a full retrospective 
     basis. Costs of hedging (forward element) related to forward exchange contracts on foreign 
     purchases previously recognised at fair value through profit or loss are now recognised in other 
     comprehensive income and are recognised in a separate reserve; cost of hedging reserve. 
     The basis adjustment is subsequently reclassified directly from equity. Consequently, cost of 
     sales is increased for the period ended 28 February 2018 and year ended 31 August 2018, 
     since the costs of hedging were previously recognised in cost of sales.

     Classification and measurement
     IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on the basis of the group's 
     business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics 
     of the financial assets. Management has assessed the business models which apply to the financial 
     assets held by the group and the financial instruments have been classified into the appropriate 
     IFRS 9 categories.

     Hedge accounting
     The group has elected to adopt hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 at the date of the 
     initial application. The group applied hedge accounting prospectively, except as stated below.

     Since the adoption of IFRS 9 the group recognises changes in the fair value of foreign currency 
     forwards attributable to forward points in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. 
     The deferred costs of hedging are included within the initial cost of the related hedged item 
     (inventory) when it is recognised. This change has been applied retrospectively for foreign 
     currency forwards in cash flow hedge relationships resulting in the adjustments as per the 
     table noted below.

In January 2011, Clicks Group shareholders approved a broad-based black economic empowerment
transaction, in terms of which the Clicks Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (""ESOP Trust"")
acquired 29.2 million unlisted Clicks Group ""A"" ordinary shares, amounting to 10% of Clicks Group's
issued shares at that time, for the benefit of Clicks Group's employees and the New Clicks Foundation
Trust (""Beneficiaries"") (the ""Scheme"").

As part of the unwind of the first 50% of the Scheme in February 2018, Clicks Group listed 7 979 384
ordinary shares (""Clicks Group Shares""), of which 7 642 904 were offered to qualifying investors by way
of an accelerated bookbuild on behalf of the Beneficiaries who elected to sell their Clicks Group Shares
on 15 February 2018.

As part of the unwind of the second 50% of the Scheme, Clicks Group listed 8 135 087 Clicks Group
Shares on the JSE Limited on 4 February 2019 and these Clicks Group Shares have been placed under
the control of the ESOP Trust. Of these, the ESOP Trust will offer 7 833 494 Clicks Group Shares
(""Bookbuild Shares"") for sale to qualifying investors on behalf of the Beneficiaries who elected to sell
their Clicks Group Shares by way of an accelerated bookbuild (""Bookbuild"").

The Bookbuild Shares will be offered to invited qualifying investors only (as set out in greater detail in the
disclaimer below), subject to the terms and conditions provided to the invited qualifying investors, and will
not be offered to the public in any jurisdiction.

The book for the Bookbuild is open with immediate effect and may close at any time thereafter. Pricing
and allocations will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild
and the price at which the Bookbuild Shares will be placed (""Bookbuild Price"") are at the discretion of
the ESOP Trust and Investec Bank Limited, who will act as the sole bookrunner (the ""Bookrunner"")
pursuant to a placement agreement entered into between the Bookrunner, the ESOP Trust and the Clicks
Group. Details of the number of Bookbuild Shares placed and the Bookbuild Price will be announced as
soon as is reasonably practicable following the closing of the Bookbuild.

The Bookbuild is subject to pricing that is acceptable to the ESOP Trust and the ESOP Trust reserves the
right to amend the quantum of the Bookbuild Shares.

TRADING UPDATE FOR 20 WEEKS TO 13 JANUARY 2019

Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The
Body Shop, GNC and Claire's, increased by 8.6% in the 20 weeks to 13 January
2019 (""the period""), driven by competitive pricing and value promotions in the
deteriorating consumer spending environment.

Health and beauty sales in comparable stores increased by 5.1% and showed
strong volume growth of 4.3% as selling price inflation averaged only 0.8% for
the period.

Total group retail sales increased by 7.8% and by 4.5% in comparable stores,
with selling price inflation of 1.1%.

UPD's total managed turnover, including wholesale turnover and the turnover
managed on behalf of bulk distribution clients, increased by 16.2%.

Clicks Group chief executive Vikesh Ramsunder said the performance over the
period confirmed once again the resilience of the Clicks brand and its appeal to
cash-strapped South Africans. ""Our promotional strategy, centred around the
brand's well-known ""3 for 2"" offers, together with our great everyday pricing,
ensured that we maintained our sales momentum and sustained volume growth
despite the increasing pressures on consumer disposable income.""

""Retail selling price inflation slowed in line with our expectations to around 1%
while UPD experienced deflation of 0.4% over this period. In this low inflationary
environment which is constraining revenue growth, UPD benefited from gaining
four new distribution contracts between April and October 2018. We also expect
some relief in the second half of the financial year from the increase in the single
exit price (SEP) of medicine of 3.78% for 2019.""

""The current pressure on consumer disposable income is unlikely to improve in
the months ahead. However, our core health and beauty markets and business
model are resilient, and we are confident in our ability to trade effectively through
these difficult market conditions,"" said Ramsunder.

The financial information in this trading update has not been reviewed or reported
on by the group's independent auditor.
Clicks Group's interim results for the six months to 28 February 2019 will be
released on SENS on or about 17 April 2019.

COMMENTARY

Overview 
Clicks Group continued its strong growth momentum despite increasingly challenging trading 
conditions in the second half of the financial year. The group encountered several headwinds as 
consumer spending came under further pressure, selling price inflation declined to almost zero and 
the lower incidence of colds and flu compared to last winter depressed medicine sales.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 11.7% as volume growth accelerated over the last year 
and Clicks gained market share in all product categories. 

UPD, the group's pharmaceutical distributor, also performed well as it gained market share and 
maintained its operating margin despite the low increase granted in the single exit price (SEP) 
of medicines in 2018. 

Diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 15.1% to 578 cents. The total dividend 
grew by 18.0% to 380 cents per share, with the dividend payout ratio being increased from 60% to 
62%. The group continues to deliver a high return on equity of 38.2%.

Over the past 10 years the group has returned more than R6.7 billion to shareholders and generated 
a compound annual total shareholder return of 32.5%. Diluted HEPS has grown by a compound rate of 
16.0% per annum and dividend per share by 20.1% per annum.

Financial performance
Group turnover increased by 9.1% to R29.2 billion, with retail sales growing by 10.8% and 
distribution turnover by 8.4%. Selling price inflation for the group averaged only 1.9% for the 
year compared to 5.3% in the previous year. 

Total income grew by 10.5% to R7.9 billion. The group's total income margin strengthened by 
30 basis points to 27.0% owing to the faster growth of the retail business. 

Retail expense growth of 10.3% was contained below sales growth despite the extensive investment 
in new stores and pharmacies. Comparable retail costs increased by 5.1%. UPD continued to 
demonstrate good cost control with expenses up 6.5% on last year.

The group's operating profit increased by 12.6% to reach the R2.0 billion mark for the first time, 
with the group's operating margin expanding by 20 basis points to 7.0%.

Working capital continues to be well managed and the group's net working capital improved from 
37 to 36 days through good trade debtor management and improved creditor days. 

Cash generated by operations increased by 20.7% to R2.5 billion. The group returned R812 million 
to shareholders in dividends. Capital expenditure of R671 million (2017: R518 million) was invested 
mainly in new stores and pharmacies, store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. 
Cash resources increased by R823 million over the previous year and the group ended the year with 
cash of R1.5 billion. 

Trading performance
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The Body Shop, GNC 
and Claire's, increased by 11.7%. Comparable stores sales grew by 6.2%, with selling price inflation 
of only 1.1%, reflecting volume growth of 5.1%.

Clicks opened a record 41 new stores and expanded the store footprint to 663. The pharmacy network 
was increased to 510 as a net 37 pharmacies were opened. Clicks ClubCard increased active membership 
by over 800 000 to 7.8 million, with the loyalty programme accounting for 77.2% of sales.

UPD grew turnover by 8.4% and increased market share from 25.6% to 26.0%. The business increased its 
bulk distribution portfolio to 23 clients by gaining three new contracts. UPD's total managed 
turnover, combining wholesale and bulk distribution, increased by 8.9% to R17.9 billion.

Outlook for 2019
The current pressures on consumer spending are unlikely to abate in the months ahead and the retail 
trading environment will therefore remain challenging.

Selling price inflation is expected to remain low in the first half of the new financial year and the 
SEP increase for 2019 is likely to be only marginally higher than 2018. The group will therefore 
continue to operate in a constrained environment. 

The group's core health and beauty markets and business model are resilient. The business continues 
to trade well in these challenging economic conditions and management is confident of maintaining 
sales momentum and sustaining volume growth in the year ahead.

Capital investment of R700 million is planned for the 2019 financial year as the group continues to 
invest for long-term growth. This includes the opening of 25 to 30 new Clicks stores and 30 to 
35 new pharmacies, and 60 store refurbishments. A significant investment will also be made in the 
retail and pharmaceutical supply chain as well as in IT systems to support the increased scale of 
the group. 

Final dividend
The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend of 277.5 cents per share 
(2017: 234.0 cents per share) and a 38.0 cents per ordinary ""A"" share (2017: 32.2 cents per share). 
The source of the dividend will be from distributable reserves and paid in cash. 

Additional information 
Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 55.5 cents per ordinary share and 7.6 cents per ordinary 
""A"" share will be withheld in terms of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not 
exempt from DT will therefore receive a dividend of 222.0 cents net of DT and ordinary ""A"" 
shareholders will receive a dividend of 30.4 cents net of DT. 

The company has 253 948 352 ordinary shares and 14 576 648 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. 
Its income tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the final dividend:

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2018 have been 
     prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for 
     preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings 
     Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework 
     concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting 
     Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
     Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council 
     and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.

     Ernst & Young Inc., the group's independent auditor, has reviewed the preliminary condensed 
     consolidated financial statements contained above and has expressed an unmodified review conclusion 
     on the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements. Their review report is available 
     for inspection at the company's registered office together with the preliminary condensed 
     consolidated financial statements identified in the auditor's report. These condensed financial 
     statements have been prepared under the supervision of Mr M Fleming CA (SA), the Chief Financial 
     Officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the year ended 
     31 August 2018 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the Audited 
     Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2017.

1.2  The segmental analysis for the year ended 31 August 2017 has been restated due to a change in 
     the composition of reporting segments. Clicks Direct Medicines was previously included in 
     Distribution and is now included in Retail due to a change in management reporting. This has 
     resulted in an increase of turnover of R121.6 million, R24.0 million in total assets and 
     R15.4 million in total liabilities for the Retail segment whilst turnover was increased by 
     R13.8 million, total assets was decreased by R3.6 million and total liabilities was increased 
     by R4.9 million for the Distribution segment. The intragroup elimination for turnover was 
     increased by R135.4 million and the elimination relating to total assets and total liabilities 
     was increased by R20.3 million.

1.3  Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed in the group's 
     annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2017. During the year Clicks Group 
     Limited issued 284 155 ordinary shares to the New Clicks Foundation Trust arising from the 
     unwind of 50% of the employee share ownership scheme. No other significant related party 
     transactions arose during the year.

1.4  In terms of the unwind of 50% of the Clicks Group Employee Share Ownership Scheme, 
     7 979 384 ordinary shares were issued to beneficiaries of the scheme and 14 576 647 ordinary 
     ""A"" shares were repurchased by Clicks Group Limited from the Employee Share Ownership Trust. 
     The New Clicks Foundation Trust sold 284 155 Clicks Group Limited ordinary shares subsequent 
     to acquiring them through the unwind of the scheme. No other equity share transactions 
     occurred during the year.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial 
     instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments, 
     the investment in Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited and investments held by the New Clicks 
     Foundation Trust which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value 
     of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using valuation 
     techniques; if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, 
     the instrument is included in level 2 and if the significant inputs required to fair value an 
     instrument are unobservable, the instrument is included in level 3. The derivative instruments 
     comprise equity derivative hedges which are calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model 
     with reference to the closing share price, 250-day historical volatility, the 12-month trailing 
     dividend yield and the risk-free rate; and forward exchange contracts which are calculated 
     using standard market calculation conventions with reference to the relevant closing market 
     spot rates, forward foreign exchange rates and interest rates. All financial instruments 
     accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are considered to be level 2 investments, 
     with the exception of investments held by the New Clicks Foundation Trust which are considered 
     to be level 1 instruments. There have been no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year. 

     The majority of the non-current and current derivative financial assets are to hedge obligations 
     under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.

CEO RETIREMENT AND SUCCESSION

Shareholders are advised that David Kneale will retire as Group Chief Executive Officer and as an
executive director of the group, effective 1 January 2019. He will then assume the role of Group
Strategic Advisor until 31 August 2019 while he serves his contractual notice period. This will enable
the group to leverage David’s extensive health and beauty retailing expertise and ensure a seamless
transition to the new CEO, Vikesh Ramsunder.

Vikesh Ramsunder (47), the current Clicks Chief Operating Officer, will be appointed as the Group
CEO and as an executive director of Clicks Group on 1 January 2019. Vikesh has been with the group
since 1993 and has held numerous roles across multiple disciplines and business units. Vikesh served
as the UPD Managing Director from 2010 to 2015, overseeing the implementation of UPD’s
successful distribution strategy. He was appointed to his current role as Clicks Chief Operating
Officer in early 2015 where he has been responsible for driving the strong growth in Clicks’ health
and beauty market shares.

Commenting on the leadership changes, Chairman David Nurek said: “David joined the group in
2006 and is an exceptional leader who has spearheaded the strong growth in the company’s core
markets. Under his leadership the group has delivered superior returns to shareholders and seen the
market capitalisation grow to R50 billion, with the group recently joining the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index.
David has built a strong executive leadership team capable of sustaining the company’s commercial
success.

“Vikesh’s appointment confirms the strength and quality of our internal talent. His proven track
record and depth of experience makes him the ideal CEO succession candidate.

“On behalf of the board and the employees, we thank David for his valuable contributions as we look
forward to continuing his legacy of success.”

David Kneale said: “Clicks is the customers’ first choice health and beauty retailer with market-
leading shares across all our key categories and UPD is the leading pharmaceutical wholesaler. I
have been privileged to have led this great team. Vikesh has been developed and mentored as my
successor over several years and is highly respected by both employees and external stakeholders of
the group.

“I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the board and the leadership team and am delighted that I
will continue to contribute in an advisory capacity until my retirement.”

COMMENTARY
OVERVIEW 
Clicks Group reported another strong health and beauty sales performance in the six months to 
February 2018 and produced improved margins, strong cash flows and attractive returns to 
shareholders. 

Retail health and beauty sales grew by 14.3%, with good volume growth in same stores and market 
share gains in all product categories. 

UPD, the group's pharmaceutical distributor, also performed well in maintaining its operating margin 
and gaining market share.

The group's performance for the half-year resulted in diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) 
increasing by 14.8% to 266.3 cents. The interim dividend was increased by 16.5% to 102.5 cents 
per share.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 10.0% to R14.4 billion. Retail sales grew by 13.2% and by 7.2% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of only 2.6%. Distribution turnover increased by 8.0%, 
with selling price inflation averaging 5.7% for the six months. 

Total income grew by 11.7% to R3.9 billion. The group's total income margin improved by 40 basis 
points to 27.1% owing to the favourable mix impact from the faster growth of the retail business. 

Retail expenses increased by 12.4% as the group has invested in 46 new stores, 34 pharmacies and 
space extensions in 24 stores over the past 12 months. Comparable retail costs were up by 6.0%. 
UPD costs were again well contained to an increase of only 5.3%. 

Operating profit grew by 12.2% to R942 million, with the group operating margin expanding by 10 basis 
points to 6.5%.

Working capital continues to be efficiently managed and the group's net working capital improved from 
43 to 41 days. Retail stock days were maintained at 81 days and UPD increased from 42 to 43 days. 

Cash generated by operations totalled R1.1 billion for the six months. The group returned R559 million 
to shareholders in dividends. 

Capital expenditure of R269 million was invested in new stores, pharmacies, store refurbishments and 
the enabling supply chain and information technology capabilities. A further R435 million capital 
investment is planned for the second half. 

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The Body Shop, GNC and 
Claire's, increased by 14.3%, driven by buoyant Christmas trading, appealing promotional offers and 
competitive pricing. Comparable stores sales grew by 8.0%.

Clicks expanded its store footprint to 646 with the opening of a net 24 stores in the past six months. 
A net 20 new pharmacies were opened to extend the pharmacy network to 493. Clicks ClubCard increased 
active membership to 7.5 million as the loyalty programme attracted close to 950 000 new customers 
in the past year. 

UPD increased wholesale turnover by 10.9%, with market share growing from 24.6% to 25.9%. UPD's total 
managed turnover increased by 6.0% to R8.4 billion.

OUTLOOK
Consumer confidence appears to be improving but it is too early for this to translate into increased 
disposable income. Consumer spending is therefore expected to remain constrained for the balance of 
the group's financial year.

However, Clicks is anticipated to continue its growth momentum and will be opening 40 new stores 
this year, well ahead of the target of 25 to 30 stores.

UPD aims to mitigate the impact of the lower single exit price (SEP) increase through continued tight 
cost control and the benefit of four new distribution contracts starting in the second half.

The core health and beauty markets in which the business operates are resilient and the group's 
market-leading brands are well positioned to increase market share in the current environment. 

FULL-YEAR EARNINGS FORECAST
The directors forecast that diluted HEPS for the financial year ending 31 August 2018 will increase 
by between 12% and 17% over the 2017 financial year.

The forecast is based on the following key assumptions: 
-  the trading environment will remain relatively constrained in the second half of the financial 
   year; and
-  retail selling price inflation is anticipated to average between 2% and 3% for the financial year.

Shareholders are advised that this forecast has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's 
independent auditor.

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved an interim gross ordinary dividend for the period ended 
28 February 2018 of 102.5 cents per share (2017: 88.0 cents per share). The source of the dividend 
will be from distributable reserves and it will be paid in cash. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 20.5 cents per ordinary share will be withheld in terms of 
the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a 
dividend of 82.0 cents net of DT. 

The company has 253 948 352 ordinary shares and 14 576 648 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. Its income 
tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the interim dividend:

ordinary shareholder will not be paid unless a written request to the contrary is delivered to the 
transfer secretaries, Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited, by no later than close 
of business on Tuesday, 26 June 2018, being the day the shares trade ""cum"" the dividend. 
Unpaid dividend cheques will be aggregated with other such amounts and donated to a charity to be 
nominated by the directors.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 28 February 2018 have 
     been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for 
     interim reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings 
     Requirements require interim reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts 
     and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards 
     (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
     and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, 
     as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. 

     The information contained in the interim report has neither been audited nor reviewed by the 
     group's external auditors. These condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared 
     under the supervision of M Fleming CA(SA), the Chief Financial Officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the six months 
     ended 28 February 2018 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the 
     Audited Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2017.

1.2  The segmental analysis for the period ended 28 February 2017 and the year ended 31 August 2017 
     has been restated due to a change in the composition of reporting segments. Clicks Direct 
     Medicines is now included in Retail due to a change in management reporting lines. This has 
     resulted in an increase in turnover of R54.3 million and R121.6 million, an increase of 
     R17.5 million and R24.0 million in total assets and an increase of R16.1 million and 
     R15.4 million in total liabilities for the retail segment for the period ended 28 February 2017 
     and 31 August 2017 respectively. Within the distribution segment, turnover was increased by 
     R15.6 million and R13.8 million, total assets was increased by R2.9 million and decreased by 
     R3.6 million and total liabilities was increased by R4.3 million and R4.9 million for the 
     period ended 28 February 2017 and the year ended 31 August 2017 respectively. 

1.3  Related party transactions for the current period are similar to those disclosed in the group's 
     annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2017. During the period Clicks Group 
     Limited issued 284 155 ordinary shares to the New Clicks Foundation Trust arising from the 
     unwind of 50% of the employee share ownership scheme. No other significant related party 
     transactions arose during the current period.

1.4  In terms of the unwind of 50% of the Clicks Group Employee Share Ownership Scheme, 7 979 384 
     ordinary shares were issued to beneficiaries of the scheme and 14 576 647 ordinary ""A"" shares 
     were repurchased by Clicks Group Limited from the Employee Share Ownership Trust. The New Clicks 
     Foundation Trust sold 284 155 Clicks Group Limited ordinary shares subsequent to acquiring 
     them through the unwind of the scheme. No other equity share transactions occurred during 
     the period.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial instruments 
     are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments, the investment in 
     Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited, investments in equity and other similar instruments and 
     a contingent consideration liability which arose from the investment in associate in the prior 
     period are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of financial 
     instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques; 
     if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument 
     is included in level 2. All financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or 
     loss are considered to be level 2 instruments except for investments in equity and other similar 
     instruments which are considered to be level 1 instruments and the contingent consideration 
     liability which arose from the investment in associate in the prior period is considered to be 
     a level 3 liability. There have been no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the period.

1.6  The majority of the current and non-current derivative financial assets are to hedge obligations 
     under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.

In January 2011, Clicks Group shareholders approved a broad-based black economic empowerment
transaction, in terms of which the Clicks Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOP Trust”)
acquired 29.2 million unlisted Clicks Group “A” ordinary shares (the “A Shares”), amounting to 10% of
Clicks Group’s issued shares at that time, for the benefit of Clicks Group’s employees and the New Clicks
Foundation Trust (“Beneficiaries”) (the “Scheme”).

As part of the unwind of the first 50% of the Scheme, Clicks Group listed 7 979 384 ordinary shares
(“Clicks Group Shares”) on the JSE Limited on 5 February 2018 and these Clicks Group Shares have
been placed under the control of the ESOP Trust. Of these, the ESOP Trust will offer 7 642 904 Clicks
Group Shares (“Bookbuild Shares”) for sale to qualifying investors on behalf of the Beneficiaries who
elected to sell their Clicks Group Shares by way of an accelerated bookbuild (“Bookbuild”).

The Bookbuild Shares will be offered to invited qualifying investors only (as set out in greater detail in the
disclaimer below), subject to the terms and conditions provided to the invited qualifying investors, and will
not be offered to the public in any jurisdiction.

The book for the Bookbuild is open with immediate effect and may close at any time thereafter. Pricing
and allocations will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild
and the price at which the Bookbuild Shares will be placed (“Bookbuild Price”) are at the discretion of
the ESOP Trust and Investec Bank Limited, who will act as the bookrunner (the “Bookrunner”) pursuant
to a placement agreement entered into between the Bookrunner, the ESOP Trust and the Clicks Group.
Details of the number of Bookbuild Shares placed and the Bookbuild Price will be announced as soon as
is reasonably practicable following the closing of the Bookbuild.

The Bookbuild is subject to pricing that is acceptable to the ESOP Trust and the ESOP Trust reserves the
right to amend the quantum of the Bookbuild.

Chief executive David Kneale said as a value retailer Clicks appeals to cash-
strapped consumers. “Sales continue to be driven by our strong promotional
offer, with the ""3 for 2"" promotion on Christmas gifting again proving highly
attractive. We are also encouraged by the incremental sales from our online
store over the festive season.”
“Inflation is expected to moderate further in the months ahead, particularly in
UPD which will be impacted by the recently announced SEP increase of only
1.26% for 2018.”

“While we are also not anticipating any easing of the financial pressure on
consumers, we remain confident in our ability to trade through these challenging
market conditions, as demonstrated by our recent performance,” said Kneale.

COMMENTARY

Overview 
Clicks Group delivered another resilient performance in tough retail trading conditions 
and reported robust health and beauty sales, increased margins, strong cash generation 
and enhanced returns to shareholders. 

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 14.7% with strong volume growth and market 
share gains in all product categories. UPD, the group's pharmaceutical distributor, 
also recorded double-digit sales and profit growth. 

Diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 14.5% to 502.1 cents. The total 
dividend was increased by 18.4% to 322 cents per share, with the dividend payout ratio 
moving up to 60%. 

The group continues to deliver a high return on equity of 44.1%.

Financial performance
Group turnover increased by 10.9% to R26.8 billion, with retail sales growing by 13.5% 
and distribution turnover by 11.4%. Selling price inflation for the group averaged 5.3% 
for the year. 

Total income grew by 12.2% to R7.1 billion. The group's total income margin strengthened 
by 40 basis points to 26.7% owing to the favourable mix impact from the faster growth 
in retail. 

Retail expense growth of 12.8% was contained below sales growth despite the investment 
in new stores and pharmacies. Comparable retail costs increased by 6.3%. UPD again 
demonstrated excellent cost control with expenses up only 2.7% on last year.

The group's operating profit increased by 15.4% to R1.8 billion, with the group operating 
margin expanding by 30 basis points to 6.8%.

Inventory was tightly managed with stock days improving from 66 to 65 days. Inventory 
levels were 7.9% higher, well below the rate of sales growth. 

Cash generated by operations increased by 11.3% to R2.0 billion. The group returned 
R677 million to shareholders in dividends. Capital expenditure of R518 million 
(2016: R433 million) was invested mainly in new stores and pharmacies, store 
refurbishments, supply chain and information technology.

Trading performance
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The Body Shop, 
GNC and Claire's, increased by 14.7%. Comparable stores sales grew by 8.6%.

Clicks opened 111 stores, including 80 through the outsourcing agreement with the 
Netcare Group, and expanded the store footprint to 622. The pharmacy network was 
increased to 473 as a net 73 pharmacies were opened. 

Clicks ClubCard increased active membership to 7 million, with the loyalty programme 
accounting for 77.4% of sales in Clicks.

UPD increased wholesale turnover by 12.1%, benefiting from the growth from Clicks and 
the private hospital groups, and the higher increase in the single exit price of 
medicines in the past year. 

Outlook
Low economic growth and political uncertainty are expected to continue to dampen consumer 
confidence and constrain spending in the year ahead.

The core health and beauty markets in which the group operates are defensive and have 
proven to be relatively resilient in challenging trading conditions. The group's 
market-leading brands are well positioned in this environment. 

A record capital investment of R680 million is planned for the 2018 financial year as 
the group continues to invest for long-term growth. This includes the opening of 25 to 
30 new Clicks stores and 30 to 35 new pharmacies, with significant investment in the 
retail and pharmaceutical supply chain to support the increased scale of the group. 

Final dividend
The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend of 234.0 cents per 
share (2016: 196.0 cents per share) and 32.2 cents per ordinary ""A"" share 
(2016: 27.2 cents per share). The source of the dividend will be from distributable 
reserves and paid in cash. 

Additional information 
Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 46.80 cents per ordinary share and 6.44 cents 
per ordinary ""A"" share will be withheld in terms of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary 
shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a dividend of 187.20 cents 
net of DT and ordinary ""A"" shareholders will receive a dividend of 25.76 cents net of DT. 

The company has 245 968 968 ordinary shares and 29 153 295 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. 
Its income tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2017 
     have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings 
     Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of 
     South Africa. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared 
     in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition 
     requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and the 
     SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
     and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council 
     and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - Interim 
     Financial Reporting.

     Ernst & Young Inc., the group's independent auditor, has reviewed the preliminary 
     condensed consolidated financial statements of this preliminary report which appears
     above and has expressed an unmodified review conclusion on the preliminary condensed 
     consolidated financial statements. Their review report is available for inspection 
     at the company's registered office together with the preliminary condensed 
     consolidated financial statements identified in the auditor's report. These 
     condensed financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of 
     Mr M Fleming CA (SA), the Chief Financial Officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the 
     year ended 31 August 2017 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those 
     applied in the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2016.

1.2  Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed 
     in the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016. 
     No other significant related party transactions arose during the current year.

1.3  During the period under review the Clicks Group entered into a long-term rental 
     agreement with the Netcare Group. In terms of the agreement Clicks will manage the 
     37 retail pharmacies in Medicross medical and dental centres and the 44 Netcare 
     hospital front shop operations. This transaction has not resulted in any material 
     impact to either the statement of comprehensive income or the statement of 
     financial position.

1.4  No shares were repurchased during the current year. On 1 February 2017 the company 
     cancelled and delisted 168 795 ordinary shares previously held as treasury shares.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial 
     instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments, 
     the investment in Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited and investments in equity and 
     other similar instruments which are accounted for at fair value through profit or 
     loss. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets 
     are determined by using valuation techniques; if all significant inputs required 
     to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2 
     and if the significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are unobservable, 
     the instrument is included in level 3. The derivative instruments comprise equity 
     derivative hedges which are calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model 
     with reference to the closing share price, 250-day historical volatility, 
     the 12-month trailing dividend yield and the risk-free rate; and forward exchange 
     contracts which are calculated using standard market calculation conventions with 
     reference to the relevant closing market spot rates, forward foreign exchange 
     rates and interest rates. All financial instruments accounted for at fair value 
     through profit or loss are considered to be level 2 investments, with the exception 
     of investments in equity and other similar instruments which are considered to be 
     level 1 instruments. There have been no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during 
     the year. 

     The majority of the non-current and current derivative financial assets are to 
     hedge obligations under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.

COMMENTARY
OVERVIEW
Clicks Group produced another strong health and beauty retail trading performance in 
the slowing consumer spending environment. The Clicks chain again demonstrated its 
resilience and increased sales by 13.1%, reporting good volume growth and market 
share gains in all core merchandise categories. Key to the performance was buoyant 
Christmas trading with customers responding positively to the great value offer and 
differentiated product ranges. 

During the period Clicks implemented a long-term outsourcing agreement with the 
Netcare Group and took over the management of 37 Medicross pharmacies and opened 
Clicks front shops in 41 Netcare hospitals. 

UPD, the group's pharmaceutical distributor, delivered excellent growth in operating 
profit of 22.1% through efficient cost and inventory management.

The group's performance for the six months translated into growth of 13.5% in diluted 
headline earnings per share (HEPS) to 232 cents per share while the interim dividend 
has been increased by 15.8% to 88 cents per share. The group continues to deliver a 
high return on equity of 47.2%.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 8.5% to R13.1 billion, with retail sales growing by 11.8% 
and distribution turnover by 7.5%. Selling price inflation for the group was contained 
to 4.8%.

Total income increased by 10.9% to R3.5 billion. The group's total income margin 
improved by 60 basis points to 26.7% owing to the favourable mix impact with the 
faster growth in retail. 

Retail expense growth of 11.6% was contained below sales growth despite the investment 
in new stores and pharmacies, including the integration of the Medicross pharmacies 
and Netcare front shops. Comparable retail costs increased by 6.4% for the six months. 
UPD demonstrated excellent cost control and reduced expenses by 2.2% over the prior period.

Operating profit increased by 14.7% to R840 million as both retail and distribution 
increased margin, with the group operating margin expanding by 30 basis points to 6.4%.

Inventory was well managed. Days in stock were consistent with the prior period at 
73 days while inventory levels were 7.6% higher, below the rate of sales growth. 

Cash inflow from operations before working capital changes increased by 9.4% to 
R972 million. Capital expenditure of R249 million (H1 2016: R203 million) was invested 
during the first half, mainly in new stores and pharmacies, store refurbishments, 
supply chain and information technology.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of 
The Body Shop, GNC and Claire's, increased by 13.1%, with strong growth in pharmacy 
and front shop health. Comparable store sales grew by 8.4%.

Clicks reached the 600-store mark following the opening of a net 89 new stores. 
The pharmacy network was expanded to 459 as a net new 59 pharmacies were opened.

UPD increased wholesale turnover by 9.6%, ahead of the pharma market growth of 5.6%, 
with market share increasing to 24.6%. The core customers of Clicks and the private 
hospital groups now account for 81.4% of UPD's wholesale turnover. 

OUTLOOK
Consumer spending will continue to be constrained in the months ahead, with low economic 
growth, higher taxes and ongoing political turbulence weighing negatively on disposable 
income and consumer sentiment.

The health and beauty markets in which the group operates are relatively resilient and 
in the current environment management will focus on protecting income, controlling costs 
and managing cash efficiently.

The group remains strongly cash generative and will continue to fund organic growth 
through the operating cash flows produced by the business. Capital investment has been 
increased to R577 million for the full financial year to support the increased scale 
of the group.
 
FULL-YEAR EARNINGS FORECAST
The directors forecast that diluted HEPS for the financial year ending 31 August 2017 
will increase by between 11% and 16% over the 2016 financial year.

The forecast is based on the following key assumptions: 
-  the consumer spending environment will remain constrained in the second half of the 
   financial year; and
-  retail selling price inflation should average between 5% and 6% for the financial year.

Shareholders are advised that this forecast has not been reviewed or reported on by 
the group's independent auditor.

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved an interim gross ordinary dividend for the period 
ended 28 February 2017 of 88.0 cents per share (2016: 76.0 cents per share). The source 
of the dividend will be from distributable reserves and paid in cash. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Dividends Tax of 20% (""DT"") amounting to 17.6 cents per ordinary share will be withheld in 
terms of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not exempt from DT will 
therefore receive a dividend of 70.4 cents net of DT. 

The company has 245 967 313 ordinary shares and 29 153 295 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. 
Its income tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 
     28 February 2017 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
     JSE Limited Listings Requirements for interim reports and the requirements 
     of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings Requirements require interim 
     reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the 
     measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting 
     Standards (""IFRS"") and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the 
     Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial 
     Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information 
     required by IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. 

     The information contained in the interim report has neither been audited nor 
     reviewed by the group's external auditors. These condensed consolidated financial 
     results have been prepared under the supervision of M Fleming CA(SA), the Chief 
     Financial Officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the 
     six months ended 28 February 2017 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with 
     those applied in the Audited Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 
     31 August 2016.

1.2  Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed 
     in the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016. 
     No significant related party transactions arose during the current year.

1.3  During the period under review, the Clicks Group entered into a long-term rental 
     agreement with the Netcare Group. In terms of the agreement Clicks will manage 
     the 37 retail pharmacies in Medicross medical and dental centres and the 
     45 Netcare hospital front shop operations. This transaction has not resulted in 
     any material impact to either the statement of comprehensive income or the 
     statement of financial position.

1.4  No shares were repurchased during the current period. On 1 February 2017, the company 
     cancelled and delisted 170 450 ordinary shares previously held as treasury shares.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial 
     instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative 
     instruments, the investment in Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited and a contingent 
     consideration liability arising from the investment in associate which are 
     accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of financial 
     instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using valuation 
     techniques; if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are 
     observable, the instrument is included in level 2. All financial instruments 
     accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are considered to be level 2 
     investments except for the financial liability relating to the contingent 
     consideration liability arising from the investment in associate which is 
     considered to be a level 3 liability and is not material. There have been no 
     transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.

1.6  The majority of the current and non-current derivative financial assets are to hedge 
     obligations under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.

Chief executive David Kneale said: “The Clicks chain performed well in the
constrained consumer economy, showing good volume growth. Customer
behaviour continues to reflect a shift to shopping later in the festive season and
Clicks reported record trading days in the week ahead of Christmas. We
continued to experience buoyant trading in the period after Christmas, driven
mainly by value promotions across all categories.”
“In the months ahead we expect Clicks to maintain its competitive market
position. This will be driven by our value offer to customers and the continued
expansion of the Clicks store and pharmacy footprint, underpinned by the relative
resilience of the health and beauty markets in which we trade.”

The financial information in this trading update has not been reviewed or reported

JOINT VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: THE AGREEMENT CONCLUDED BY NETCARE WITH
CLICKS TO OUTSOURCE MEDICROSS RETAIL PHARMACIES AND NETCARE HOSPITAL RETAIL
FRONT SHOP OPERATIONS HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMPETITION COMMISSION

Shareholders are advised that the agreements Netcare and Clicks entered into on 8 June 2016 to
outsource their 37 retail pharmacies in the Medicross family medical and dental centres (“Medicross”) and
the hospital retail front shop operations (“front shops”) of the Netcare Hospital division to Clicks (“the
Transaction”) has been approved by the Competition Commission.

Clicks will in due course assume control of all Medicross pharmacies and 45 front shops of the Netcare
Hospital division. The agreement excludes the dispensing of prescriptions in the Netcare Hospital
pharmacies which remain within Netcare’s hospital operations.

The parties wish to confirm that employees involved in these areas of the business will be transferred to
Clicks on terms similar to their current conditions of employment and any other employees indirectly
affected will remain employed by Netcare on their current conditions of employment.

The rationale for the transaction is to offer an enhanced retail service offering to both patients and
consumers by affiliating the pharmacy and the front shops to an experienced retail provider such as Clicks.

As previously mentioned we wish to reiterate that the transaction is non-categorised in terms of the JSE
Listings Requirements for Netcare and Clicks and will have no material impact on the earnings and
financial positions of either Netcare or Clicks.

Shareholders are referred to the joint media statement on the websites of both Clicks
(www.clicksgroup.co.za) and Netcare (www.netcare.co.za).

for the year ended 31 August 2016


Retail turnover up 12.8%
Diluted headline EPS up 14.2%
Total dividend up 15.7%
Return on equity of 49.2%


COMMENTARY

OVERVIEW 
The group's retail businesses, in particular Clicks, delivered another strong trading 
performance in 2016 as all brands strengthened their competitive positions and 
reported market share gains.

The performance for the year translated into a 14.2% increase in diluted headline 
earnings per share to 438.5 cents while the group again delivered a high return on 
equity of 49.2%. 

The total dividend was increased by 15.7% to 272.0 cents per share and together with 
the growth in the Clicks Group share price over the past year represents a total 
shareholder return of 35.3%.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 9.5% to R24.2 billion. Retail sales rose by 12.8%, with 
same store sales increasing 9.8%. Distribution turnover increased by 6.1%. Selling 
price inflation for the group was contained to 4.9%.

Total income increased by 11.0% and the group's total income margin improved by 30 basis 
points to 26.3% owing to the favourable mix impact with the faster growth in retail.

The increase in retail operating expenses of 11.2% was contained below sales growth 
despite the investment in new stores, pharmacies and customer service. Comparable 
retail costs increased by 6.4%. UPD demonstrated excellent cost control in a difficult 
market and restricted expense growth to 7.4%.

Operating profit grew by 12.6% to R1.6 billion as both retail and distribution maintained 
margin in the challenging trading conditions. The group's operating margin increased 
by 20 basis points to 6.5%, benefiting from the stronger retail growth.

Inventory days in stock improved from 68 to 66 days.

Cash inflow from operations before working capital changes increased by 8.7% to 
R1.85 billion. As part of the board's commitment to return surplus cash to shareholders, 
the group returned R876 million to shareholders through dividend payments of 
R586 million and share buy-backs of R290 million. 

Capital expenditure of R433 million was invested in new stores and pharmacies, 
refurbishments, IT systems and UPD infrastructure and warehousing.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of 
The Body Shop, GNC and Claire's, increased by 13.5%, with strong growth across all 
product categories.

The Clicks store footprint was expanded to 511 following the opening of a net 25 new 
stores and the pharmacy network reached 400 as 39 in-store pharmacies were opened 
during the year. Clicks launched an online sales platform which offers a ""click and 
collect"" facility in all stores across South Africa.

Clicks ClubCard membership increased by over one million to reach 6.2 million after 
the successful relaunch of the loyalty programme.

The group has made a considerable investment in improving the quality of customer 
service in store and created over 1 200 new jobs in the past year.

UPD experienced a tough year and grew turnover by 6.1% in a pharmaceutical market 
which has shown minimal volume growth. In addition, the regulated single exit price 
(SEP) increase in 2016 was lower than the previous year. Despite these pressures UPD 
maintained its operating profit margin by driving efficiencies and through good cost 
management.

OUTLOOK
The weak consumer spending environment is expected to continue into 2017 as low economic 
growth, together with ongoing political and social uncertainty, will place further 
financial pressure on consumers.

The core health and beauty markets, as well as the group's business model, are resilient 
and the business will trade through this tough environment by focusing on providing 
value to customers and managing costs efficiently.

Clicks has strong organic growth prospects for the medium to long term, with extensive 
opportunities to expand its store footprint in South Africa.

Record levels of capital expenditure of R577 million will be invested in stores, IT and 
supply chain to support the growth in the business.

Management is confident of the group's ability to sustain performance and deliver on 
its medium-term financial and operating targets.

FINAL DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend of 196.0 cents per 
share (2015: 169.5 cents per share) and a 27.2 cents per ordinary ""A"" share (2015: 
23.5 cents per share). The source of the dividend will be from distributable reserves 
and paid in cash. 

Additional information
Dividends Tax (DT) amounting to 29.40 cents per ordinary share and 4.08 cents per 
ordinary ""A"" share will be withheld in terms of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary 
shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a dividend of 
166.60 cents net of DT and ordinary ""A"" shareholders will receive a dividend of 
23.12 cents net of DT.

The company has 246 137 763 ordinary shares and 29 153 295 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. 
Its income tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the final dividend:
Last day to trade ""cum"" the dividend                         Tuesday, 24 January 2017

being the day the shares trade ""cum"" the dividend. Unpaid dividend cheques will be

directors.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016 
     have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings 
     Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of 
     South Africa. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared 
     in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition 
     requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and the SAICA 
     Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and 
     Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council 
     and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - Interim 
     Financial Reporting.

     Ernst & Young Inc., the group's independent auditor, has reviewed the preliminary 
     condensed consolidated financial statements contained above and has expressed an 
     unmodified review conclusion on the preliminary condensed consolidated financial 
     statements. Their review report is available for inspection at the company's 
     registered office together with the preliminary condensed consolidated financial 
     statements identified in the auditor's report. These condensed financial statements 
     have been prepared under the supervision of Mr M Fleming CA (SA), the Chief Financial 
     Officer of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the 
     year ended 31 August 2016 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those 
     applied in the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2015.

1.2  Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed 
     in the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2015. 
     No significant related party transactions arose during the current year.

1.3  There were no material business combinations during the period under review. 
     The only acquisition was a 25% interest in an associate, Sorbet Brands Proprietary 
     Limited. The contribution of this acquisition to profit for the year has been 
     presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

1.4  Under the general authorities granted by shareholders, 3 360 470 shares were 
     repurchased during the current year.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial 
     instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments 
     that are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of 
     financial instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using 
     valuation techniques; if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument 
     are observable, the instrument is included in level 2 and if the significant inputs 
     required to fair value an instrument are unobservable, the instrument is included 
     in level 3. The derivative instruments comprise equity derivative hedges which are 
     calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model with reference to the closing 
     share price, 250-day historical volatility, the 12-month trailing dividend yield 
     and the risk-free rate; and forward exchange contracts which are calculated using 
     standard market calculation conventions with reference to the relevant closing 
     market spot rates, forward foreign exchange rates and interest rates. All financial 
     instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are considered to 
     be level 2 investments except for the financial liability relating to the contingent 
     consideration on the acquisition of an associate which is considered to be a 
     level 3 liability, and amounts to R2.3 million. There have been no transfers 
     between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.

     The majority of the non-current derivative financial assets are to hedge 
     obligations under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.

JOINT VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: NETCARE TO OUTSOURCE
MEDICROSS RETAIL PHARMACIES AND NETCARE HOSPITAL RETAIL
FRONT SHOP OPERATIONS TO CLICKS

Shareholders are advised that Netcare has entered into a long-term agreement
to outsource their 37 retail pharmacies in the Medicross family medical and
dental centres (“Medicross”) and the 51 hospital retail front shop operations
(“front shops”) of the Netcare Hospital division to Clicks (“the Transaction”).

In terms of the agreement, Clicks will assume control of all Medicross
pharmacies and the front shops of the Netcare Hospital division. The agreement
excludes the dispensing of prescriptions in the Netcare Hospital pharmacies
which remain within Netcare’s hospital operations.

Specific employees involved in these areas of the business will be transferred to
Clicks on terms similar to their current conditions of employment and any other
employees indirectly affected will remain employed by Netcare on their current
conditions of employment.

The rationale for the Transaction is to offer an enhanced retail service offering to
both patients and consumers by affiliating the pharmacy and the front shops to
an experienced retail provider such as Clicks.

The implementation date of the Transaction is expected to be 1 October 2016,
subject to various conditions precedent and regulatory approvals, including
Competition Commission approval.
The Transaction is a non-categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Listings
Requirements for Netcare and Clicks and will have no material impact on the
earnings and financial positions of either Netcare or Clicks.

Shareholders are referred to the joint media statement on the websites of both
Clicks (www.clicksgroup.co.za) and Netcare (www.netcare.co.za).

Group turnover up 13.4%
Diluted headline EPS up 15.1%
Interim dividend up 16.0%
Return on equity of 53.1%


COMMENTARY
OVERVIEW 
Clicks Group performed well against a backdrop of constrained consumer spending, 
increasing financial pressures and growing economic uncertainty in the country. 

The group's retail businesses produced excellent trading performances, particularly 
over the festive and holiday season. Customers responded positively to the strong 
value offer and innovative product ranges which resulted in good volume growth and 
increased market shares across all core merchandise categories.

Diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the half-year increased by 15.1% to 
204.4 cents and the interim dividend was increased by 16.0% to 76.0 cents per share.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 13.4% to R12.1 billion, with retail sales growing by 13.4% 
and UPD by 12.8%. Selling price inflation was contained to 4.4% for the period.

Total income increased by 12.3%. The investment in competitive pricing in Clicks and 
the faster growth in generic medicines in UPD reduced the group's total income margin 
by 20 basis points to 26.1%. 

The increase in retail operating expenses of 11.7% was contained below sales growth 
despite the investment in stores, pharmacies and marketing costs. UPD expenses grew 
by 12.9% and by 8.0% on a comparable basis.

Operating profit grew by 14.4% to R732 million with the operating margin increasing 
10 basis points to 6.1%, benefiting from the stronger retail growth.

Inventory days in stock moved from 71 to 73 days, with inventory levels 17.1% higher 
at the end of February owing to the investment in stock by all businesses ahead of 
supplier price increases.

The group remains highly cash-generative. Cash inflow from operations before working 
capital changes rose 11% to R888 million. Almost R700 million was returned to shareholders 
through dividend payments of R406 million and share buy-backs of R290 million. 

Capital expenditure of R203 million was invested during the first half, mainly on new 
stores and pharmacies, refurbishments and IT systems.

The group's performance translated into a sector-leading return on equity of 53.1%. 

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The Body Shop, 
GNC and Claire's, increased by 14.1%, with strong performances in all product categories.

The Clicks store footprint was expanded to 496, with 384 pharmacies. This is supported by 
60 standalone health and beauty franchise stores.

ClubCard membership increased by almost one million following the successful relaunch of 
the loyalty programme last year, bringing total membership to 5.7 million active customers.

UPD grew turnover by 12.8%, driven partly by the earlier implementation of the annual 
increase in the single exit price (SEP) of medicines which resulted in customers buying 
in stock ahead of manufacturer's price increases. 

OUTLOOK
Clicks Group is well positioned for continued growth despite the weakening outlook for 
consumer spending in the months ahead. 

The core health and beauty markets in which the group trades are relatively resilient 
to economic downturns, with the strong value proposition of the Clicks brand appealing 
to consumers. Clicks also has considerable scope to expand its store and pharmacy 
footprint in South Africa. 

The group continues to invest for long-term growth and record levels of capital expenditure 
of R455 million will be invested in the financial year.

FULL-YEAR EARNINGS FORECAST
The directors forecast that diluted HEPS for the financial year ending 31 August 2016 
will increase by between 10% and 15% over the 2015 financial year.

The forecast is based on the following key assumptions: the consumer spending environment 
will become increasingly challenging in the second half of the financial year; selling price 
inflation will be between 4% and 5% for the year; and the group will continue to invest for 
longer-term growth, mainly in new stores and pharmacies.

Shareholders are advised that this forecast has not been reviewed or reported on by the 
group's independent auditor.

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved an interim gross ordinary dividend for the period ended
29 February 2016 of 76.0 cents per share (2015: 65.5 cents per share). The source of the 
dividend will be from distributable reserves and paid in cash. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Dividends Tax (DT) amounting to 11.4 cents per ordinary share will be withheld in terms 
of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore 
receive a dividend of 64.6 cents net of DT. 

The company has 246 137 763 ordinary shares and 29 153 295 ordinary ""A"" shares in issue. 
Its income tax reference number is 9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the interim dividend:

Last day to trade ""cum"" the dividend                             Friday, 24 June 2016

less due to any ordinary shareholder will not be paid unless a written request to the 
contrary is delivered to the transfer secretaries, Computershare Investor Services Proprietary

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES 
1.1  These condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended 
     29 February 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
     JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of 
     the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings Requirements require preliminary 
     reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement 
     and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") 
     and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
     Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards 
     Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 - 
     Interim Financial Reporting. 

     The information contained in the interim report has neither been audited nor reviewed 
     by the group's external auditors. These condensed consolidated financial results have 
     been prepared under the supervision of M Fleming CA(SA), the Chief Financial Officer 
     of the group.

     The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial results for the 
     six months ended 29 February 2016 are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those 
     applied in the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2015.

1.2  Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed in 
     the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2015. 
     No significant related party transactions arose during the current year.

1.3  There were no material business combinations during the period under review. 
     The only acquisition was a 25% interest in Sorbet Branding Proprietary Limited. 
     The contribution of this acquisition to profit for the period under review was 
     not material.

1.4  Under the general authorities granted by shareholders, 3 360 470 shares were 
     repurchased during the current year.

1.5  The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial 
     instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative instruments 
     that are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of 
     financial instruments that are not traded in active markets are determined by using 
     valuation techniques; if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument 
     are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. All financial instruments 
     accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are considered to be level 2 
     investments and there have been no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.

1.6  The majority of the non-current derivative financial assets are to hedge obligations 
     under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.
