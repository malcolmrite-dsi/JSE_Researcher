The Group commenced the 2020 financial year from a solid base, with growth accelerating for most businesses in the second half of 2019. While recognising
that we would continue to face headwinds in some of our key markets in 2020 due to subdued economic growth, we remained confident in our ability to deliver
solid growth in all key performance indicators. This was achieved in the first two months of 2020, with most businesses outperforming targets for the period
by a healthy margin. However, the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, followed by the declaration of states of disaster and
emergency in a number of countries where we operate, abruptly transformed the operating environment into one of the most challenging periods faced by the
Group and our stakeholders. Despite these challenges we remain resilient as reflected in our underlying operational performance during the six months to 30
June 2020 and a healthy solvency position throughout the period. This resilience is founded on the quality of our client and other stakeholder
relationships, a superior strategic positioning, highly skilled and motivated employees and a generally prudent approach to managing our business.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R3,9 billion declined by 22% on the first six months of 2019, but increased by 18% excluding
the impact of COVID-19 on certain earnings components. Sanlam Personal Finance's net result from financial services decreased by 12%, but was up 2% excluding the 
COVID-19 impact, and up 6% also excluding the R70 million one-off prior year tax adjustment at Sanlam Personal Loans in 2019. Sanlam Emerging Markets' net result 
from financial services declined by 28% (up 27% excluding the impact of COVID-19). Sanlam Investment Group's net result from financial services decreased by 77% 
(up 4% excluding the COVID-19 credit impact), a particularly satisfactory performance under challenging conditions. Santam's net result from financial services
declined by 21% (more than doubling excluding the impact of COVID-19 on provisions). Sanlam Corporate achieved strong growth in net result from financial services
of 39%. The improvement in risk claims experience in the second half of 2019 persisted into 2020, driving a more than doubling in risk profits.

New business volumes increased by 40% under particularly difficult trading conditions. All clusters contributed strong growth, apart from Santam where large
specialist business written in the period resulted in an increase in the unearned premium and reinsurance reserves, reducing growth in net earned premiums
relative to gross written premiums. Life insurance new business volumes were in line with 2019, investment business inflows increased by 64% and general
insurance earned premiums increased by 6%. Overall net fund inflows of R33 billion in 2020 is a particularly satisfactory performance given the challenging
market conditions.

Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 334 cents for the year ended 31 December 2019 was paid on Monday, 20 April 2020 by way of
electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Tuesday, 14 April 2020. Shareholders who have
not yet provided their banking details for dividend payments are requested to do so by contacting Sanlam's transfer secretary, Computershare, at 0861 100

ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IN RESPECT OF SANLAM’S THIRD
PARTY ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS


1. INTRODUCTION

   Sanlam shareholders (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement made on the Stock Exchange
   News Service (“SENS”) of the JSE Limited on 31 October 2018 when Sanlam announced its package of
   broad-based black economic empowerment (“B-BBEE”) transactions. As part of the package of B-BBEE
   transactions, Sanlam also announced that it was in the process of a reorganisation of its third party asset
   management business in order to enhance the competiveness and empowerment of the business.

   The board of directors of Sanlam (the “Sanlam Board”) is pleased to announce that agreement was
   reached in respect of a transaction to establish a leading South African black-owned asset management
   company (the “Transaction”). The Transaction will support Sanlam to grow and enhance its position in this
   important market, whilst also building on the Sanlam philosophy of mutually beneficial partnerships in
   pursuit of shareholder value creation.

   The Transaction will entail:
   (i)    the creation of a new investment holding company (“NewCo”), in which Sanlam will initially hold
          100%. NewCo will hold 100% of the interest in Sanlam Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited
          (“SIH”) which will, in turn, hold the Sanlam Investment Group’s interests in third-party asset
          management businesses in South Africa, other than the investment management business
          conducted by Sanlam Private Wealth Proprietary Limited and the Sanlam Specialised Finance
          division; and

   (ii)    African Rainbow Capital Financial Services Holdings Proprietary Limited (“ARC FS”) purchasing
           shares in NewCo which will give it an effective economic interest of 25% in SIH (the “ARC
           Transaction”).

   Sanlam will own the remaining economic interest in SIH and following implementation of the Transaction,
   the SIH shareholders may allow senior management of SIH to participate in up to 5% of the effective
   economic interest in SIH on market related commercial terms. This is a possible transaction and the details
   will be communicated in the future.

   The Transaction will result in a combined direct and indirect black economic interest in SIH in excess of
   51% in terms of the Amended Financial Sector Code.

   African Rainbow Capital Proprietary Limited (“ARC”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ubuntu-Botho
   Investments Proprietary Limited (“UBI”) which is a material shareholder in Sanlam and accordingly deemed
   a related party in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. ARC holds 50.1% in ARC FS.

2. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

   Promoting inclusive wealth creation in all of the markets where Sanlam operates is a key driver of Sanlam’s
   long-term prosperity and ability to create value for all stakeholders. In the South African context,
   institutional clients require participants in the financial services industry to contribute to inclusive wealth
   creation in a number of ways, including direct B-BBEE ownership. Within the asset management industry,
   empowerment credentials at the entity level where institutional investors transact, is an important
   consideration for clients when awarding business mandates. As a result, it is in Sanlam’s business and
   commercial interest to transform in line with the needs and preferences of its current and potential clients
   by creating a leading black-owned asset management business. Given the broad-based black
   shareholding of Sanlam’s B-BBEE partner, UBI, it will also benefit society by increased participation of
   these shareholders in the success of SIH.

   For Sanlam, the Transaction will contribute to the realisation of its strategy to protect and enhance its
   leadership position in South Africa through inter alia a leading empowerment status and appropriate
   partnerships. This will enhance the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of SIH, positioning it for
   future growth and enabling long term value creation for stakeholders. This is particularly relevant in the
   current challenging operating environment, which is likely to persist in the near term as the country
   recovers from the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

   Being South Africa’s leading black-owned asset manager, will position SIH favourably to attract strong
   institutional investment flows. Furthermore, this transaction will act as a catalyst to establish SIH as a
   strong independent asset manager and will create optionality to enhance the performance of the business
   over time through attracting affiliated managers. Sanlam and SIH therefore expect to realise significant
   synergies through attracting incremental flows to SIH and partnering with ARC FS on other value-accretive
   initiatives.

3. OVERVIEW OF ARC TRANSACTION

3.1. Background to ARC FS

   ARC FS, which is 50.1% owned by ARC and 49.9% owned by the ARC Fund; is the entity that holds all the
   financial services investments in the UBI Group other than the investment in Sanlam which is held directly
   by UBI. The strategic objective of ARC FS is to establish a black-controlled diversified financial services
   group with exposure to key sub-sectors in the financial services sector.

3.2. Price

   ARC FS will purchase shares in NewCo representing 25% of all shares in issue at a price calculated with
   reference to a base value of R787.5 million (the “ARC FS Base Value”). The ARC FS Base Value allows
   for a 25% minority and marketability/liquidity discount, which is appropriate for transactions of a similar
   nature. The ARC FS Base Value will be adjusted with a factor equal to the UBI Facility (see 3.3.below)
   funding rate up to the ARC Transaction effective date in order to determine the purchase price payable by
   ARC FS (the “ARC FS Purchase Price”).

   Based on an anticipated effective date of 1 December 2020, the expected maximum ARC FS Purchase
   Price would be R815.2 million at the current prevailing prime rate.

   If the assets under management of SIH decline by any amount or increase by more than 14% before the
   ARC Transaction effective date, either party may request an adjustment of the ARC FS Purchase Price. An
   adjustment will only be made if agreed and will be done in compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

3.3. Settlement of the ARC FS Purchase Price

   The ARC FS Purchase Price will be settled by ARC FS in part by utilising a portion of the preference share
   facility made available to UBI (“UBI Facility”), which was approved by Shareholders in December 2018, for
   up to 80% of the ARC FS Purchase Price, and from its own resources for the remaining portion.

3.4. Independent fairness opinion

    In terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements, the ARC Transaction is categorised as a small
    related party transaction.

    Accordingly, the Sanlam Board is required to provide the JSE with written confirmation from an
    independent professional expert confirming that the terms of the ARC Transaction are fair insofar as the
    Shareholders are concerned (the “Fairness Opinion”). A positive Fairness Opinion is one of the
    conditions to the ARC Transaction.

    In compliance with paragraph 10.7 (b) of the Listings Requirements, the Sanlam Board appointed BDO
    Corporate Finance (Pty) Ltd (“BDO”) as independent expert to provide it with the Fairness Opinion.

    BDO has furnished an opinion to the Sanlam Board confirming that the terms of the ARC Transaction are
    fair insofar as the Shareholders are concerned. This opinion has been provided to the JSE.

    The opinion of BDO will be available for inspection at Sanlam’s registered office, 2 Strand Road, Bellville,
    Cape Town, 7530, for a period of 28 days from the release of this announcement. It will also be made
    available during this period on request from Sanlam’s Company Secretary. Please email request to Sana-
    Ullah.Bray@sanlam.co.za.

3.5. Conditions and other key terms to the ARC Transaction

    In addition to receipt of a positive Fairness Opinion, the ARC Transaction is subject to certain suspensive
    conditions, including (but not limited to) approvals from the relevant regulatory authorities (including the
    Prudential Authority).

    The definitive transaction agreements to give effect to the ARC Transaction contain warranties and
    indemnities customary for transactions of their nature. The definitive agreements include a shareholders'
    agreement in respect of NewCo which incorporates non-compete undertakings given by ARC FS to
    NewCo and SIH, reserved matters in respect of which shareholders will need to agree and customary pre-
    emptive rights and deemed offer provisions.

3.6. Independent Committee Recommendation

    The Sanlam Board established the Committee of Independent Non-Executive Directors, comprising of all
    non-executive Directors who are independent of Sanlam and UBI, to evaluate matters involving the
    Company and the UBI Group which may give rise to conflicts of interest. Following their consideration of
    these matters in the context of the Transaction, they recommended to the Sanlam Board that Sanlam
    enter into the ARC Transaction. The chairman of the Committee of Independent Non-Executive Directors
    is Mr. E Masilela.

4. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION

   As per the latest audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 prepared in terms of
   IFRS, the segmental net result from financial services for the period was R352 million. SIH’s contribution to
   the consolidated Sanlam Group net asset value was R348 million.
   The net proceeds of the ARC Transaction will be received on the effective date of the ARC Transaction.
   Sanlam would seek to reinvest such proceeds to support its broader strategy including that of SIH.

   Sanlam will consolidate its effective economic interest in NewCo and SIH.

5. EFFECTIVE DATE

   The effective date of the ARC Transaction will be dependent on the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions
   to the Transaction and is expected to occur during the last quarter of 2020.

Trading Statement – 2020 Interim Results

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam is currently compiling its interim results for the
six months ended 30 June 2020. This trading statement provides an indication of a
range for headline earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to
equity holders of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. Sanlam's interim results will be released on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) on Thursday, 10 September
2020.

As communicated to shareholders in the Group’s operational update released on
Wednesday, 10 June 2020, the operating environment across the Group’s footprint
deteriorated substantially since the end of February 2020 as governments implemented
strict measures to control the spread of Covid-19. These included the declaration of
states of disaster and emergency in a number of countries where we operate, involving
severe limitations on people movement and economic activity. Global growth estimates
were revised down sharply, including for all of the Group’s key markets. This, together
with persistent uncertainty around the eventual impact of Covid-19, drove significant
volatility in equity, interest rate and currency markets. These conditions continue to
impact on the Group’s results for 2020.

Despite the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the Group’s earnings for the six months to
30 June 2020 as outlined in this trading statement, the Group’s operations remained
resilient and the Group sustained its strong capital position. The Group solvency cover
ratio exceeded 180% at 30 June 2020 with the ratio remaining well within our target
range throughout the worst of the recent market turbulence. Sanlam Life Insurance
Limited’s solvency cover ratio at 30 June 2020 was well in excess of the 253% ratio
reported at 31 December 2019. Funding levels of the participating policyholder
portfolios also remain sound.

Net operational earnings for the six months to 30 June 2020 were adversely impacted
by the following:

•   Lower investment-related fee income at Sanlam Investment Group and Sanlam
    Personal Finance as a result of negative investment market returns in the first half of
    2020, which depressed average assets under management and participating fee
    income.
•   Marked-to-market losses at Sanlam Specialised Finance due to a widening in
    corporate credit spreads, which, in the absence of defaults, will reverse in future
    reporting periods.                                                                                  
•   Increased doubtful debt provisioning at Sanlam Specialised Finance and the
    Group’s retail credit businesses, attributable to the deteriorating economic
    environment, continued restrictions on economic activity and pressure on clients’
    disposable income.
•   Negative investment return earned on insurance funds held by the Sanlam
    Emerging Markets general insurance businesses, in line with the downturn in equity
    markets.
•   Support of some R1 billion provided by Santam to clients with contingent business
    interruption cover.
•   Negative net investment return earned on the capital portfolio reflects the weaker
    equity market performance and additional expected credit losses recognised in
    terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 in respect of rising
    sovereign credit risk in Lebanon.

Net operational earnings are therefore expected to decline by between 35% and 45%.
Unrealised losses due to fair value changes and increases in doubtful debt provisions
account for a major part of this reduction in earnings. Some of this may reverse over
time.

Despite the decline in net operational earnings, HEPS are expected to increase by
between 5% and 15% compared to the first six months of 2019, supported by the
following:

•   The one-off IFRS 2 charge of R1.7 billion recognised in 2019 in respect of the share
    issuance to the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment special purpose
    vehicle (B-BBEE SPV).
•   A turnaround in fund transfers relating to the treatment of Sanlam shares held in
    policyholder portfolios as treasury shares, the consolidation of the Sanlam
    Foundation and B-BBEE SPV, and the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect
    of assessed losses in policyholder funds, from a net loss in 2019 to a net profit in the
    first half of 2020.

These items recognised in terms of IFRS represent non-economical profits and losses
for the shareholders’ fund, which are excluded from net operational earnings but
included in headline earnings.

Given the significant uncertainty around the eventual outcome of Covid-19 and the
trajectory of economic recovery, a prudent approach was applied in valuing the Group
operations at 30 June 2020. This resulted in generally lower valuations and
necessitated an impairment of the carrying values of certain operations. In addition to
the HEPS impact highlighted above, earnings attributable to equity holders of the
company for the six months ended 30 June 2020 will therefore also be affected by
these impairment charges. The following key assumptions were adjusted:

•   Non-life businesses
    o Economic assumptions were revised downwards in the current uncertain
      environment, in respect of both economic growth forecasts and future investment
      returns. This affected the valuations of the investment management,
      administration and SEM general insurance operations.
    o Top-line growth was reduced across the board for non-life operations, through
      lower net fund inflow assumptions for investment management businesses and
      lower premium/fee income growth at other businesses.                                                                                 
  o The valuation of the non-life operations in Lebanon was reduced to zero as a
      meaningful economic recovery, as well the potential to repatriate profits, is not
      expected in the foreseeable future.
  o Most of the premium paid for synergies as part of the Saham Finances
      acquisition has been written off. Realisation of the synergies will take longer than
      originally anticipated due to the slowdown in economic growth across the Saham
      Finances footprint as a result of Covid-19. We remain confident that the
      synergies can be realised, but decided to rather allow these to emerge as
      positive future experience variances.
  o The valuation of Shriram Capital in India was reduced in line with the lower listed
      share prices of Shriram Transport Finance Company and Shriram City Union
      Finance.
• Life insurance business
  o Persistency assumptions were strengthened at 30 June 2020. Despite no
      noticeably poorer persistency experience in the first half of 2020, it is anticipated
      that rising unemployment and increasing pressure on disposable income in
      South Africa may result in adverse persistency in future periods.
  o The valuation of the life insurance business in Lebanon was reduced to zero in
      line with the non-life operations.

The lower valuations resulted in an impairment of intangible assets recognised in
respect of the Saham Finances acquisition (circa R5.8 billion) and the equity-accounted
carrying value of Shriram Capital (circa R1.8 billion). These contributed the bulk of total
impairments of circa R7.8 billion to be recognised in the six months to 30 June 2020.
Foreign currency translation gains in respect of these investments, which are
recognised directly against equity, however limited the overall reduction in net asset
value to circa R1.5 billion.

Impairment charges are excluded from HEPS and only affect EPS. EPS are
commensurately expected to decline by more than 100% compared to the first six
months of 2019. Impairment charges do not impact on cash earnings and therefore the
Group’s dividend payment capability.

Shareholders are advised that the Group expects HEPS and EPS for the six months
ended 30 June 2020 to fall within the following ranges:


                            6 months to           6 months to            6 months to

Operational Update – June 2020

The Group had a solid start to the 2020 financial year as communicated to shareholders
in the Covid-19 update released on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service in March
2020. Most of the operational trends experienced in the second half of 2019 persisted in
the first two months of 2020. The operating environment, however, deteriorated
substantially since the end of February 2020 as governments implemented strict
measures to control the spread of Covid-19. These included the declaration of states of
disaster and emergency in a number of countries where we operate, involving severe
limitations on people movement and preventing face-to-face sales in most of our
businesses. These were in line with similar measures implemented globally. Global
growth estimates were revised down sharply, driving significant volatility in investment
markets across the world.

Despite these headwinds, we achieved acceptable results for the four months to 30
April 2020, testimony to the resilience afforded by our diversified operations and the
skills and exemplary dedication of our employees under difficult conditions.

The Group responded rapidly to the lockdown enforced in South Africa, our largest
market, from midnight 26 March 2020 as well as the lockdowns and curfews
implemented around the same time in our other markets. Close to 90% of our office
staff were enabled to work effectively from home. We will continue to carefully manage
employees returning to work in line with the amendments to lockdown levels, with the
health and safety of our staff being the priority. Our aim is for the majority of our
employees to continue to work from home for the foreseeable future to reduce the risk
of infection and to prepare the business for a new way of work post Covid-19.

Our designation as an essential service in South Africa excludes our tied and
independent advisors in line with the measures in our other markets. As a result, new
business volumes were significantly impacted since the last week of March in the
absence of face-to-face sales. Our investment in digital businesses such as MiWay and
Sanlam Indie, as well as digital sales tools for our advisors, alleviated this pressure to
some extent. The available digital sales tools are, however, more targeted at the
middle-income and affluent market segments. The Sanlam Sky intermediated
distribution channel and many of our other emerging markets channels are still
predominantly based on personal interaction, with a commensurately more pronounced
negative impact on new business sales in these areas. Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF)
accelerated the development of digital tools for Sanlam Sky, which will be launched in
the near future. Accelerated digital enablement is also a key focus for Sanlam Emerging
                                                                                 
Markets (SEM). The slowdown in economic activity following the introduction of the
lockdowns places further pressure on new business growth potential.

The key investment markets where we operate followed global trends, recording
negative returns across the board. Long-term interest rates in South Africa increased
substantially, while reference interest rates in our other key markets were more stable.

The investment market volatility impacted our financial results in four main areas:

•   Investment related fee income at Sanlam Investment Group (SIG) and SPF were
    suppressed by negative investment market returns and commensurately lower
    assets under management.
•   Increasing credit spreads and volatility in the share prices of listed preference
    shares are reflected in marked-to-market losses at Sanlam Specialised Finance
    (SanFin).
•   Credit risk is rising as a result of the deteriorating economic environment, requiring
    an increase in corporate credit provisioning at SanFin.
•   Investment return earned on insurance funds at SEM’s general insurance
    businesses in Africa was adversely affected by negative investment market returns.

Investment return earned on the Group’s capital portfolios were also affected, but this
was to a large extent alleviated by the hedging strategy in place in the South African life
insurance capital portfolio as well as foreign currency translation gains from the weaker
Rand exchange rate.
                                                                                   
The weaker average Rand exchange rates did not have an overall material impact on
the Group’s operational earnings for the four-month period due to offsetting positive and
negative foreign currency translation differences. The latter primarily relates to the
negative investment return on insurance funds in SEM and the weaker Angolan
Kwanza.

Earnings

Net result from financial services declined by 21% on the first four months of the 2019
financial year. Excluding the negative investment market impact highlighted above, net
result from financial services increased by a pleasing 13%.

o SPF’s net result from financial services declined by 13%. This is largely attributable
  to lower income from life investment products in Glacier where the business shares
  in the actual return earned on the underlying portfolios (refer table above). Excluding
  this, net result from financial services increased by 5%. Risk profits in the Recurring
  Premium business increased strongly, supported by growth in the size of the book
  as well as continued positive claims experience. No Covid-19 mortality claims have
  been received up to the end of April 2020. A small number of sickness benefit
  claims were lodged. The Glacier LISP platform also performed well, with the decline
  in investment markets more than offset by strong net fund inflows. Lower investment
  markets suppressed fee income in the Savings business, contributing to only
  marginal earnings growth. Sanlam Sky experienced a decline in net result from
  financial services, attributable to Covid-19 support to advisers, higher new business
  strain and negative expense assumption changes. The latter two relate to higher
  assumed acquisition and maintenance unit cost due to the negative impact of Covid-
  19 on new business volumes and expected in-force units at the end of 2020.
  Sanlam Personal Loans increased its bad debt provisions by some R50 million
  (Sanlam’s share after tax) to allow for increased credit risk under prevailing
  conditions.

o The decline in equity markets and lower valuations for unlisted properties in North
  West Africa adversely affected investment return earned on SEM’s general
  insurance funds in Africa (refer table above) due to the approximate 40% and 30%
  respective exposures to equities and properties in the portfolio. This more than
  offset an otherwise satisfactory performance. Net result from financial services                                                                               
   declined by 27% as a result. Excluding the general insurance float returns in Africa,
   net result from financial services increased by 29%. Life insurance earnings from the
   Africa portfolio declined slightly on 2019, with satisfactory growth in Botswana,
   Namibia and Nigeria countered by negative investment variances in North West
   Africa. The African general insurance portfolio had a good start to the year from an
   underwriting perspective, achieving a margin within the 5% to 9% target range. All
   key markets delivered improved performances compared to 2019. The negative
   return on insurance funds, however, contributed to an overall negative net insurance
   margin for the four-month period. The Other international region achieved overall
   strong growth. All major businesses in the region contributed to the performance,
   including continued strong profit growth from Shriram General Insurance. It should
   be noted that Sanlam reports the Shriram Capital results with a three-month lag.
   The impact of Covid-19 and regulations in India that allows credit clients a 6-month
   repayment holiday therefore does not yet reflect in these results.

o SIG’s contribution to net result from financial services decreased by 134% (up 19%
  excluding the impact of investment market volatility on SanFin as highlighted
  above). The asset management and wealth management businesses achieved
  sterling growth of 20% despite the pressure on assets under management (the
  average JSE/FTSE Swix index was 10% lower in the first four months of 2020
  compared to the same period in 2019). Earnings benefited from increased
  performance fees, strong net fund inflows at Sanlam Multi Manager and Satrix
  towards the end of 2019 and start of 2020, high demand for currency, equity
  protection and bond derivatives at Sanlam Structured Solutions, increased
  brokerage income at Sanlam Private Wealth and stringent expense management.
  SanFin experienced a decline in net result from financial services from R82 million in
  2019 to a loss of R350 million in 2020, due to rising credit spreads and marked-to-
  marked losses on listed preference shares (refer above), as well as additional credit-
  related provisions of R175 million after tax as credit risk rose in the wake of
  deteriorating economic conditions. The latter includes the first default of R100 million
  net of taxation. In terms of the Group’s accounting policies, 50% of the movement in
  credit spreads in 2020 was transferred to the asset mismatch reserve held in
  respect of non-participating policyholder business. This portion of the movement in
  spreads is attributed to changes in illiquidity premiums that should reverse over
  time. In line with the asset mismatch reserves held in respect of SPF and Sanlam
  Corporate, the SanFin asset mismatch reserve is recognised in future earnings at a
  rate of 16% per annum.

o Santam’s earnings for the period were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. A
  number of claims for Events Cancellation and Travel Insurance were covered in
  terms of its policies and are in the process of being settled in line with the policy
  conditions. A small minority of commercial and corporate policyholders have cover
  that includes protection against contagious or infectious diseases. This cover is
  provided under either the Contingent Business Interruption (CBI) or the Cancellation
  of Bookings sections of their policies. CBI insurance covers the interruption of a
  business as a result of a localised outbreak of a contagious or infectious disease
  that has directly impacted the business’s operations and caused a loss. Losses as a
  result of governmental restrictions on activity, such as a national lockdown, or the
  existence of a global pandemic, are however not covered. This view is in line with
  the majority of counterparts and reinsurers in the general insurance industry, both                                                                                 
   locally and globally. Provisions for claims from these policies were raised based on
   best estimates of the exposures; however, given the lockdown and the complex
   nature of these claims, significant uncertainty exists over the quantum of the claims
   provisions.

   The lockdown resulted in an otherwise very subdued claims environment for the
   month of April 2020, notably impacting the motor class of business. Santam and
   MiWay respectively provided premium refunds and discounts on motor policies as
   well as other premium relief support to personal and commercial policyholders
   amounting to R327 million. Support of R42 million is also provided to SMME and
   other suppliers.

   Despite these discounts, pressure on top line growth in the current environment and
   the Covid-19 provisions, Santam’s conventional business still managed to achieve
   an underwriting margin at the midpoint of its 4% to 8% target range.

o The management actions implemented by Sanlam Corporate in the past 18 months
  in respect of the repricing of loss-making schemes and improved claims
  management continued to yield positive results, with Group Risk profit reflecting a
  major improvement on the comparable four-month period in 2019. Sanlam
  Corporate’s net result from financial services increased by a particularly satisfactory
  34% as a result.

Net operational earnings decreased by 26%. This is the combined effect of the 21%
decline in net result from financial services and a combined decrease in net investment
return and project expenses from R633 million in the first four months of 2019 to R320
million in 2020. As indicated above, net investment return on capital was shielded from
the full impact of the investment market downturn by hedging strategies applied to the
South African life capital portfolio and foreign currency translation gains.

Headline earnings increased by 40% (44% increase in diluted headline earnings per
share). The decrease in net operational earnings was more than offset by a low 2019
comparative base, which included the one-off accounting cost of R1.7 billion recognised
in terms of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 2 in respect of the B-
BBEE share issuance. Excluding the IFRS 2 charge from the comparative base,
headline earnings declined by 22%.

Business volumes

New business volumes of R96 billion increased by 33% on the first four months of the
2019 financial year. The lockdowns and curfews imposed since the end of March 2020
and throughout April had a significant adverse impact on new business sales
performance. This is reflecting in the table below, which expresses new business sales
in April 2020 as a percentage of the average monthly new business written in the first
three months of 2020. At a Sanlam Group level, overall new business volumes in April
2020 were 12% lower than the average for the three months to 31 March 2020. Sanlam
Corporate was the most severely affected cluster as trustee activity largely stalled in the
first few weeks of the lockdown. The level of engagement and quotes found some
traction recently. The impact of the lockdowns and curfews are not yet fully reflecting in
these results due to timing differences between the writing and recognition of new                                                                                
business. New business production in April and May were in general between 50% and
70% lower than targets across many businesses. Sanlam Sky was more severely
impacted as highlighted before, with new business sales some 90% lower than target.

Sanlam Group                                       88%

o   Overall new business volumes at SPF increased by a healthy 18% in the first four
    months of 2020.

    Sanlam Sky new business sales grew by 19%, supported by Capitec Bank funeral
    business, a good start to the year for group recurring business and R37 million of
    new business sales contributed by African Rainbow Life. The lockdown since the
    end of March 2020 had a severe impact on the traditional individual life
    intermediated channel, which is primarily focused on worksites and face-to-face
    sales. New business volumes through this channel declined by 5%, with a further
    deterioration expected in the months to follow.

    The Recurring Premium sub cluster, primarily focused on the middle-income market,
    reflects the pressure on disposable income in this market segment, aggravated by
    the Covid-19 lockdown. New business volumes increased by 1%, with strong growth
    at BrightRock, Sanlam Indie and MiWay Life largely offset by lower sales of
    traditional risk and savings solutions.

    Glacier grew its new business sales by 19%, benefiting from sound demand for
    traditional life annuities, living annuities and international products. Glacier’s money
    market fund also experienced favourable demand.

o   SEM recorded overall new business growth of 43%. The African general insurance
    portfolio exceeded its budget for the period, which allows for a more muted growth
    target as focus remains on the quality of new business. This includes the non-
    renewal of loss-making schemes that cannot be repriced appropriately. Life
    insurance and investment new business volumes in Africa increased markedly on
    2019, with the latter benefiting from large new mandates in Kenya and Namibia.
    North West and East Africa were the main contributors to the growth in new life                                                                                  
    business. The Other international region achieved double-digit growth in life and
    general insurance business, exceeding targets for the period. Shriram Life and
    General Insurance continued to contribute strong growth. Pacific&Orient achieved
    reasonable results under difficult circumstances, as was the case in Lebanon, where
    the country is facing major economic and political challenges. MCIS in Malaysia had
    a slow start to the year, with the mix of business also changing to lower margin
    group business.

o   New business volumes at SIG increased by 42%, with the value of new mandates
    awarded to the South African Investment Management business increasing by 33%,
    while Wealth Management delivered more than double the 2019 level of new
    business. New business at the International businesses exceeded expectations and
    rose by 59%.

o The lockdown and economic slowdown negatively impacted premium growth at
  Santam. Despite these conditions, satisfactory growth in gross written premium was
  achieved, excluding the premium relief noted above. The Santam Commercial and
  Personal intermediated business continued to experience strained growth in the
  current economic climate exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19 on new business
  acquisition in April 2020. The Santam Specialist business reported strong growth in
  the corporate property and engineering businesses, while the growth in the travel
  insurance, aviation, transport and marine businesses were negatively impacted by
  Covid-19 in March and April 2020. MiWay maintained its positive growth momentum
  up to the start of the lockdown, after which new business growth was negatively
  affected. Santam Re continued to expand its third-party business and foreign
  currency premium growth benefited from the weakening Rand.

o   Sanlam Corporate achieved 68% growth in new business volumes for the four
    months to April 2020 despite a marked slowdown in April 2020 due to the Covid-19
    lockdown. Sales were, however, skewed towards low margin business.

o   Net VNB decreased by 22% (down 18% on a constant economic basis) largely due
    to lower new life business sales during the lockdown periods, with the higher margin
    businesses such as Sanlam Sky more severely affected. Lower forecasted volumes
    for the full-year increased allowance for acquisition and maintenance unit costs in
    the year-to-date VNB calculations. VNB margins declined commensurately.

o   Overall net fund inflows of R14 billion were 17% lower than the R16 billion achieved
    in the comparable four-month period in 2019. Net inflows at SIG declined due to
    some large client withdrawals, while all other clusters experienced higher net
    inflows.

o   No marked changes in persistency trends were experienced in the first four months
    of 2020.

Capital and solvency

The Group remains well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital Requirement
(SCR) cover ratio amounted to 201% on 31 March 2020 (Sanlam Life Insurance
Limited: 269%). The reduction in the Group cover level from 211% as at 31 December
                                                                                
2019 is largely reflective of the adverse investment market returns in 2020, which
depressed funding levels in the smoothed bonus and participating annuity portfolios.
Funding levels for the larger portfolios were between 84% and 94% at 31 March 2020
but has since recovered to between 92% and 101% in line with the recovery in global
investment markets.

Discretionary capital increased slightly from end-December 2019 to some R360 million,
with no significant movements in the first four months of the year. Future generation of
discretionary capital will be sufficient to fund any planned bolt-on acquisitions.
SEM announced at the beginning of June that it acquired the remaining stake in the
Nigerian insurance business FBN Insurance from its partner, FBN Holdings Plc
(FBNH). This gives the Group 100% ownership of FBN Insurance Limited (FBNI) and
its subsidiary, FBN General Insurance Limited. FBNH held 65% of FBN Insurance,
while Sanlam held 35%. The effective date for Sanlam taking full control of FBN
Insurance was 1 June 2020. The acquisition price was funded from available debt
capacity to further enhance the return on the investment. This is not a categorised
transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

This transaction is in line with our business strategy to deepen our presence in our
existing markets and highlights and enhances our long-standing commitment to the
Nigerian market. Sanlam exercised its pre-emptive right to acquire the remaining
shareholding of FBNI and in line with our partnership philosophy that underpins our
business model, we will introduce local shareholding at an appropriate time in the
future. The transaction reflects our belief and confidence in the value and future of the
business as well as the skilled management team and staff. Moreover, we are
committed to Nigeria and view it as a key market on the continent. The African
continent as a whole remains important and an integral part of Sanlam’s future growth.

Outlook

We continue to actively manage the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our
priority remains the health and safety of our employees. We are also providing support
to our clients, intermediaries and vulnerable suppliers across our businesses.

The impact of the pandemic on the communities and economies where we operate can
only be managed effectively through concerted efforts between government, business
and labour organisations. We are actively providing our support through the relevant
business associations. In addition, we have to date contributed more than R200 million
to solidarity and other Covid-19 relief funds across our footprint.

We are well positioned to weather the headwinds with a robust balance sheet and
solvency position, diversification across geographies, lines of business and market
segments, and an admirable depth of skills in our businesses as well as at a Board
level. Paul Hanratty and Abigail Mukhuba joining Sanlam as Chief Executive and
Financial Director respectively will further add to the years of experience at an
executive level.
                                                                               
We are, however, cautious about prospects for the remainder of the 2020 financial year
given uncertainty around the eventual impact of Covid-19. The position remains fluid,
but the gradual lifting of lockdown requirements in a number of markets, including South
Africa, should provide some relief to economic activity. Average investment market
levels, credit spread movements, potential credit defaults, the relative strength of the
Rand exchange rate, the level of long-term interest rates and the level of new business
production are some of the key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net
result from financial services, headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported
for the six months to 30 June 2020 and the 2020 full year. Potentially lower valuations
of strategic investments at the end of June 2020 may also require impairment of
intangible assets in terms of IFRS.

o New business growth potential and persistency risk remain under pressure in the
  context of anticipated deep economic recessions in many markets as well as
  continued limitations on engagement opportunities for our advisors after the end of
  April 2020. The current level of new business growth is therefore not expected to
  continue with downside risk to VNB.

o Investment market volatility is also likely to persist that may, together with rising
  corporate and retail credit risk from the economic fallout, further suppress earnings.

o The eventual claims experience from Covid-19 also remains uncertain, both at
  Santam as well as our life insurance operations. Our pandemic reserve of some
  R760 million is available to absorb any increased claims due to Covid-19 at the life
  insurance businesses.

WITHDRAWAL OF RESOLUTIONS 5.2 AND 7.2 OF THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Shareholders are referred to the Notice of Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) issued on 13
March 2020 and, in particular, Ordinary Resolutions 5.2 and 7.2.

Sanlam advises that it has withdrawn Ordinary Resolution 5.2 (“Re-Election of PB Hanratty as
a non-executive director”) and Ordinary Resolution 7.2 (“The Appointment of PB Hanratty as a
member of the Audit Committee”). The reason and effect for withdrawing the aforementioned
two resolutions are due to Mr Hanratty being appointed as the Group CEO, subsequent to
preparing and issuing the Notice of AGM. To this end, he ceases to be an independent non-
executive director with effect from 11 June 2020 as he prepares to assume his new role as
executive director on 01 July 2020. Noteworthy to highlight, is that Sanlam continues to comply
with the requirement relating to one-third of directors who have been proposed for rotation.

All other agenda items for the Annual General Meeting remain unchanged and will be put to
Shareholders for approval on 10 June 2020 at 14h00 following the Virtual Meeting process.
Shareholders are herewith advised that the withdrawal of Ordinary Resolutions 5.2 and 7.2
from the AGM, does not affect the proxy forms already submitted in respect of the remainder
resolutions. An amended proxy form has been uploaded onto the Sanlam website.

REPURCHASE, CANCELLATION AND DELISTING OF TREASURY SHARES

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam has repurchased 116,363,639 ordinary shares of 1 cent
each held in treasury by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanlam Life Insurance Limited (“Sanlam
Life”) (“Treasury Shares”) at a repurchase price of R56,29 per share (in aggregate
R6,550,109,239) (the “Repurchase”).

The Repurchase was executed in accordance with the requirements of Section 48 of the
Companies Act No. 71 of 2008.

The Treasury Shares were acquired by Sanlam Life in terms of general authorities to repurchase
shares approved by Sanlam shareholders during the annual general meetings held on 7 June
2006, 6 June 2007, 4 June 2008, 3 June 2009, 9 June 2010 and 8 June 2011 respectively
(“General Authorities”). Following the Repurchase, the Company applied to the JSE Limited
(“JSE”) for the cancellation and delisting of the Treasury Shares and accordingly, the Treasury
Shares will be cancelled and delisted on the JSE from commencement of business on 18 May
2020.

The Repurchase constitutes a transfer to, and subsequent cancellation of the Treasury Shares
previously acquired by Sanlam Life pursuant to the General Authorities and is cash neutral for the
Sanlam Group.

The Treasury Shares represented 4,97% of the issued share capital of the Company immediately
prior to their cancellation. Following the cancellation, the issued share capital of the Company now
comprises 2,226,974,408 ordinary shares of 1 cent each.

The Sanlam Group notes the recommendations outlined in the Joint Communication 1 of 2020
issued by the Prudential Authority and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority on 16 April 2020
(“Joint Communication”), in particular, the expectations that consideration be given to the
temporarily suspension of discretionary dividend distributions, including share buybacks and cash
bonuses to executives. The Repurchase will not result in any cash flow to any holders of Sanlam
shares outside of the Sanlam Group and has no impact on the Sanlam Group’s solvency position.

The Sanlam Group remains solvent and liquid and well capitalised. The board will take the Joint
Communication into account in its future deliberations.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Sanlam Group’s auditors.

Planning Commission, and Chair of several influential entities in South Africa, namely V&A

Operational update: COVID-19 pandemic

COVID-19 has spread at an alarming rate since its outbreak, being declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organisation. Government and central bank responses
globally have been unprecedented to limit the impact of the virus on public health and to
stem the unavoidable consequences for economic growth. These events contributed to
investment market turmoil not seen since the global financial crisis.

The JSE recently issued guidance in South Africa, requesting that shareholders and other
stakeholders be informed of the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of listed
companies. In line with this guidance and our transparent communication approach, this
update provides information in respect of Sanlam’s financial performance for the first two
months of the 2020 financial year as well as the possible impact of COVID-19 on Sanlam’s
operations and financial position.


RESULTS FOR THE TWO MONTHS ENDED 29 FEBRUARY 2020

Consistent with performance trends in the second half of 2019, the Group had a pleasing
start to the 2020 financial year, with strong growth in most key performance indicators
compared to the first two months of 2019:

•   Net result from financial services increased by more than 10%.

    o All clusters contributed strong growth, apart from Sanlam Personal Finance whose
      operating earnings were impacted by increased new business strain and lower
      earnings at Glacier. The decline in investment markets in the first two months of
      2020 had a negative effect on Glacier’s market-related earnings from products in
      which it shares in the actual investment return earned on the underlying portfolio.
    o The widening of credit spreads related to the COVID-19 outbreak detracted from
      Sanlam Investment Group’s earnings; the overall cluster however still achieved
      solid growth.
    o The underwriting margin of the former Saham general insurance portfolio showed
      pleasing improvement compared to the 2019 full-year results, augmented by higher
      return on insurance funds.

•   New business volumes increased by more than 30%. All lines of business reflect strong
    double-digit growth.

    o All clusters achieved very strong growth, with a welcome improvement in
      investment business flows at Sanlam Emerging Markets and Sanlam Investment
      Group’s international business.
    o Apart from Lebanon, the former Saham portfolio continued to perform in line with
      expectations.

•   The net value of new covered business (VNB) written increased by some 5% on 2019.

    o Sanlam Personal Finance achieved strong growth, which was partly offset by lower
      contributions from Namibia, Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco (change in mix of business
      and lower margins) and Sanlam Corporate (slower start to the year than 2019 in
      recurring premium life business).

COVID-19 OPERATIONAL IMPACT

The operating environment deteriorated substantially since the end of February 2020 as
governments implemented strict measures to control the spread of the virus. Global growth
estimates were revised down sharply (a global recession is now predicted by most
economists), driving the significant downturn in global investment markets.

The impact on Sanlam’s operations is summarised below, based on investment market
indicators as at close of business 25 March 2020. Sanlam remains well capitalised and
resilient despite the volatile conditions we are facing. This is an outcome of our prudent
reserving basis and capital management philosophy, well-embedded and appropriate risk
management processes, as well as our diversification across geographies, market
segments and lines of business. Shareholders are reminded that conditions remain fluid
and uncertain. The financial position reflected in this announcement will consequently
change over time.

Business continuity

States of disaster and emergency have been implemented in a number of countries,
involving limitations on people movement, with a number of countries imposing lockdowns.
South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Cote d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Malaysia, India and the United
Kingdom are some of the markets where Sanlam operates that are currently under some
form of lockdown.

The majority of business units within the Sanlam Group have completed their pandemic
response plans, aimed at protecting the health and safety of all staff. The main focus of
these plans includes:

•   Compliance with regulatory restrictions on the movement of people;
•   Emphasis on personal hygiene;
•   Employee distancing techniques in work environments;
•   Limitations around international and domestic travel;
•   Maximum use of remote working;
•   Self-isolation where staff have travelled or might have been exposed to the virus;
•   Access control measures dealing with visitors to worksites; and
•   Continuous communication to staff, clients and other stakeholders.

Most of Sanlam’s operations in South Africa, including Santam, has been classified as
essential services. During the lockdown period, the Group will operate on a limited staff
basis, with only core critical staff on site. We should therefore be able to service our
clients, albeit not at the usual levels of service. Sanlam Emerging Markets’ operations are
also operating at limited capacity where restrictions on movement is in place. The ability to
write new business is affected, as elaborated on in the Outlook section below.

The following table reflects year-to-date movements in the key market indicators that has

The market movements experienced in March are similar to the economic shock scenario
disclosed in Sanlam’s annual financial statements for solvency sensitivity analyses. The
shock scenario includes a 30% decline in equities, a 25% increase in interest rates and a
20% devaluation of emerging market currencies against developed market currencies.

Solvency

Sanlam Life Insurance Limited (Sanlam Life) is the largest life insurance company in the
Group and the most significant contributor to Group solvency.

The capital portfolio backing Sanlam Life’s R8 billion required capital is invested in zero
cost collars. The investment market volatility therefore did not have a significant impact on
the value of the portfolio. Pricing to roll the derivatives has, however, deteriorated
significantly. As a result, maturing tranches are currently being rolled into cash, which will
continue in the near term.

The decline in investment markets had a muted impact on Sanlam Life’s Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio. This is attributable to the protection provided by the zero
cost collars in the capital portfolio as well as the change in the equity symmetrical
adjustment allowed for in the SCR calculation, which dampens the impact of severe
investment market volatility. This is in particular the case for the solo entity (regulatory)
SCR cover, where the Sanlam Life participations (investments in subsidiaries and
associates) provide stability to the solvency ratio. The Sanlam Life solo solvency cover is
estimated at 258% on 25 March 2020 compared to 253% at 31 December 2019. The
estimate is based on the year-end sensitivity analysis.

The Sanlam Life internal view is used for management purposes, as it represents Sanlam
Life’s contribution to Group Solvency. It is based on the R8 billion of required capital
allocated to the Sanlam Life covered business and excludes the value of participations,
any excess capital held on the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as cash held for dividend
payments. A target SCR cover ratio of 170% to 210% has been set for the internal view. At
the lower end of the target range (170%), Sanlam Life can withstand at least two economic
shocks (refer key features of economic shock above) without breaching the minimum SCR
cover ratio of 100%. The internal view SCR cover ratio amounted to 206% at 31 December
2019, at the upper end of the target range. It is estimated at 188% on 25 March 2020, well
within the target range. The estimate is based on the year-end sensitivity analysis.

Solvency levels within the other Group subsidiaries remained at appropriate levels, given
the relatively larger exposure to cash and fixed-interest securities within these businesses.

Portfolio funding levels

Sanlam Life has the most material exposure to products that provide financial guarantees
to policyholders, which include the following main lines of business:

•   Fixed-term guarantee plans

    Fixed-term guarantee plans are matched with appropriate fixed-interest instruments on
    a cash-flow duration basis. As both the assets and liabilities are valued on a consistent
    basis, movements in interest rates do not result in mismatch profits or losses. Credit
    risk is the main financial risk assumed by Sanlam under these contracts.

•   Smoothed bonus portfolios

    These products aim to provide a smoothed return to policyholders over time through
    the bonus declaration philosophy. The main smoothed bonus portfolios include
    (policyholder liabilities as at 31 December 2019) the Individual Life Stable Bonus
    Portfolio (R27 billion), the Group Stable Bonus Portfolio (R11 billion), the Monthly
    Bonus Fund (R7 billion) and With-Profit Annuities (R5 billion). The funding levels of
    these portfolios were between 80% and 90% on 25 March 2020 compared to close to
    100% funding levels at 31 December 2019. Should future investment returns earned on
    the portfolios be in line with the long-term investment return assumptions disclosed in
    the Group’s 2019 annual financial statements, the funding levels of these portfolios can
    be restored to 100% through the declaration of lower bonuses in the next three years.
    Should markets deteriorate further or underperform for an extended period, other
    management actions are available to manage the funding levels in combination with
    shareholder capital injections. These include the cancellation of non-vested bonuses,
    except for With-Profit Annuities or fully vesting smoothed bonus portfolios. The
    balanced mandates of these portfolios from an asset class perspective, together with
    foreign exposure of some 30%, provide a buffer to funding levels.

    Products offering financial guarantees to policyholders within the Sanlam Emerging
    Markets portfolio are mostly matched by interest-bearing securities. No material
    mismatch profits or losses have occurred in these portfolios.

Investment-related earnings

•   Sanlam Investment Group

    Credit spreads on listed debt have widened to historic high levels. This contributed to
    negative unrealised marked-to-market losses year-to-date of some R470 million after
    tax at Sanlam Specialised Finance (Sanfin) as at 25 March 2020. In the absence of any
    actual defaults, these unrealised losses will reverse in future as the higher spreads
    unwind to maturity, i.e. it simply causes timing differences in earnings recognition. Any
    narrowing of spreads going forward, will accelerate this reversal. The current
    circumstances are likely to lead to an increase in credit counterparties experiencing
    distress. These exposures will be proactively managed with an emphasis on obtaining
    security where possible, and maximising recovery should any defaults actually occur.

    All required margins/collateral have to date been received as required in respect of the
    equity-backed lending business.

    Derivative structures (including interest rate, equity and currency derivatives) are
    requiring an increased need for margins/collateral to be posted by Sanfin. The Group
    has a well-established liquidity risk management framework to ensure sufficient liquidity
    during stressed market conditions such as those currently being experienced. All
    margin/collateral requirements have been and are projected to be met from internal
    resources, and will continue to be prudently and proactively managed within the
    liquidity risk management limits of the Group.

•   Sanlam Personal Finance

    As highlighted in the 2019 annual results financial review and referred to above,
    Glacier’s product offering includes a line of business where it participates in the actual
    investment return earned on the underlying portfolio. This product contributed some
    R200 million to Glacier’s net result from financial services for the 2019 full year. As at
    25 March 2020, earnings from this line of business amounted to a loss of some R90
    million after tax.

•   Sanlam Emerging Markets

    The weaker equity markets in Namibia, India, Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire have a
    negative impact on investment variances in the life portfolios. Return on insurance
    funds held in the Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire general insurance portfolios are also
    negatively affected given the equity exposure within the asset mix.

    COVID-19 is likely to result in a further deterioration of economic conditions in
    Lebanon, aggravated by the sovereign debt defaults in March 2020, which may require
    credit provisioning to be recognised in terms of IFRS 9 in finalising the Group’s interim
    results for the six months to 30 June 2020, in addition to the provisions recognised in
    the Group’s 2019 annual results.

Claims and persistency experience

To date we have not been exposed to any major change in claims and persistency
experience.

•   Life insurance business

    The development of claims experience will be dependent on, among others, the
    infection rate in the markets where we provide cover, the ability of the local healthcare
    infrastructure to cope with the number of individuals requiring hospitalisation and the
    eventual mortality rate. The swift action taken by many governments, in particular
    lockdowns, should limit infection rates and mortality experience.

    The Group’s policy liabilities at 31 December 2019 included a pandemic reserve of
    R760 million that was created specifically for an event of this nature a number of years
    ago. This reserve is available to cover increased mortality experience emanating from
    COVID-19.

    Sanlam’s geographic diversification also provides resilience.

•   General insurance business

    Santam

    Santam is in the process of reviewing all relevant policy wordings in order to assess
    potential insurance exposure relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine how
    Santam’s policies may respond to any claims made.

    Sanlam Emerging Markets

    The impact of COVID-19 on general insurance claims is, among others, dependent on
    governments’ response to the pandemic. Some governments are considering
    requirements for insurers to pay medical costs even if this is not covered under the
    policy contracts, or to contribute voluntarily to relief funds. Despite limited contractual
    exposure in many instances, measures implemented by governments may therefore
    still have an impact.

    Business Interruption (BI) Insurance

    The vast majority of property policies are written on a named perils basis and do not
    provide cover for BI. Where BI cover is provided, it is generally restricted to direct
   business interruption as a consequence to damage to property (usually fire or
   machinery breakdown only).

   Health Insurance

   Exposure to COVID-19 claims is dependent on policy conditions, which vary between
   countries. These conditions in general exclude pandemics and/or pandemics where
   quarantine is implemented.

Outlook

Economic growth in all of the Sanlam markets will be lower than anticipated, with some
expected to enter recessions, including South Africa. This poses risk to growth in new
business volumes as well as persistency experience. Increased pressure on corporate
earnings will also heighten credit risk. New business volumes are furthermore restricted by
the lockdowns in a number of markets, limiting advisors’ ability to conduct business. We
do have a number of digital sales channels across the Group, which includes digital
enablement of advisors. Sales through these channels will provide some relief.

Equity, interest rate and currency markets are expected to remain volatile in the
foreseeable future. Moody’s downgrade of South Africa’s sovereign rating to below
investment grade on 27 March 2020 is expected to add to volatility in the South African
markets. Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange
rate and the level of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on
the growth in net result from financial services, operational earnings and Group Equity
Value to be reported for the six months to 30 June 2020 and the year to 31 December
2020.

Sanlam is well positioned to weather the current conditions - we have a solid balance
sheet, strong operational processes and some of the best expertise available in the
market.

The final 2019 ordinary dividend of 334 cents per share that was declared on 11 March
2020 will be paid on Monday 20 April 2020.

(1) Weighted average number of shares excludes Sanlam shares held directly or indirectly through consolidated 
investment funds in policyholder portfolios, as well as Sanlam shares held by the Group's Broad-Based Black Economic 
Empowerment special purposes vehicle (B-BBEE SPV) that is consolidated in terms of International Financial Reporting 
Standards. These shares are treated as shares in issue for purposes of normalised weighted average number of shares, 
which are used for the per-share metrics for the Shareholders' fund information.
(2) PVNBP = present value of new business premiums and is equal to the present value of new recurring premiums plus 
single premiums.

The Group achieved a solid operational performance in 2019, with growth of 14% and 15% respectively in net operational
earnings and the net value of new covered business (VNB) written. The 37% increase in net fund inflows is a particular
highlight.

We recognised from the outset that we will face a number of headwinds in 2019. Low economic growth in some of our key
markets, heightened global geopolitical risks as well as volatility in investment and currency markets did not bode well
for growth in our key performance indicators. Our diversification across geographies, market segments and lines of
business provided significant resilience, enabling us to continue delivering value to all our stakeholders.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R9.7 billion increased by 9%, with solid contributions from
most major businesses. Relatively stronger investment market returns in 2019 augmented this performance, contributing to
the 14% growth in net operational earnings.  New business volumes increased by 12% despite low investor confidence in
South Africa and lower investment inflows in the UK, Namibia and Kenya. Life insurance new business volumes increased
marginally, investment business inflows grew by 14% and general insurance earned premiums were 22% higher.

Shareholders are advised that a final cash dividend of 334 cents per share was declared for the year ended 31 December
2019, an increase of 7.1% on the prior year dividend. This represents 3% real growth in the Sanlam dividend. The South
African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect of this dividend. The dividend in full will be subject to the
20% withholding tax, where applicable, which result in a net dividend, to the shareholders who are not exempt from paying
dividend tax, of 267.2 cents per share. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share capital as at the
date of the declaration is 2,069,106,282 excluding treasury shares of 274,231,765 at 31 December 2019. The company's tax
reference number is 9536/346/84/5.

The dividend is payable on Monday, 20 April 2020 by way of electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in
the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 17 April 2020. The last date to trade to qualify for this dividend
will be Tuesday, 14 April 2020, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 15 April 2020. Share certificates
may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 15 April 2020 and Friday, 17 April 2020, both days
included. Shareholders who have not yet provided their banking details for dividend payments are requested to do so by

Trading Statement - 2019 Annual Results

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam is currently compiling its annual results for the
year ended 31 December 2019. This trading statement provides an indication of a range
for headline earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity
holders of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements. Sanlam's annual results will be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) on Thursday, 12 March 2020.

The Group achieved satisfactory growth in net result from financial services as well as
investment return earned on its capital portfolios for the 2019 financial year, contributing
to estimated combined growth of between 8% and 18% from these sources of earnings.

The Group also concluded a share issuance to a new Broad-Based Black Economic
Empowerment (B-BBEE) entity (B-BBEE Entity) as approved by Sanlam shareholders in
December 2018 and notified on SENS in March 2019 (B-BBEE Share Issuance). The B-
BBEE Share Issuance positions Sanlam as the foremost empowered insurance and
investment management group in South Africa.

Headline earnings for the year ended 31 December 2019 are impacted by the following:
*   A one-off expense of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2 Share Based Payment in respect of the B-BBEE Share
    Issuance, as reported to shareholders in our 10-month operational update in
    December 2019.
*   The value of business acquired (VOBA) intangible assets recognised in 2018 upon
    the first-time consolidation of Saham Finances and Nucleus as Group subsidiaries
    contributed an additional amortisation charge of some R250 million in 2019.
*   Profits and losses recognised in terms of IFRS in respect of the treatment of Sanlam
    shares held in policyholder portfolios as treasury shares, the movement in deferred
    tax assets recognised in respect of assessed losses in policyholder funds and the
    consolidation of the Sanlam Foundation and B-BBEE Entity (Fund transfers), declined
    from a R106 million net profit in 2018 to a net loss of R868 million in 2019. The
    consolidated results of the B-BBEE Entity included in the 2019 Fund transfers
    comprises interest paid on the external funding and administration costs incurred of
    some R600 million.

Given the size of these items, headline earnings of the Group for the year ended 31
December 2019 are expected to decrease by between 15% and 25% compared to 2018.
Earnings attributable to equity holders for the year ended 31 December 2019 are further
impacted by the profit on deemed disposal of Saham and Nucleus of R2,8 billion in 2018.
These were one-off earnings that increased the comparative base, contributing to an
expected decrease in earnings attributable to equity holders of between 35% and 45%
compared to 2018.

Excluding the one-off IFRS 2 charge, the additional amortisation of intangible assets, the
Fund transfers and the profit on disposal of Saham and Nucleus referred to above,
headline earnings and earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group would have
increased by between 10% and 20%, reflecting the solid underlying operational
performance by the Group.

The weighted average number of shares used for HEPS and EPS is not impacted by the
B-BBEE Share Issuance as the Sanlam shares held by the B-BBEE Entity is treated as
treasury shares upon consolidation. These shares will, however, be treated as issued
shares for purposes of the Group's disclosed per share management information, such
as net result from financial services per share and Group Equity Value per share.
Shareholders are advised that the Group expects HEPS and EPS for the 2019 year,
expressed as growth on the prior period, to fall within the following ranges:


                              12 months to        12 months to

Operational Update - December 2019

The Group maintained a solid operational performance in the 10 months to 31 October 2019,
especially in the context of persisting challenging operating conditions in our largest markets.
Highlights for the four month-period since the end of June 2019 include continued strong net fund
inflows at Sanlam Investment Group (SIG), traction in Glacier's new business sales, as well as a
marked improvement in Sanlam Corporate and Santam's risk underwriting profits. Overall new
business volumes increased by 6%. The net value of new covered business (VNB) written
increased by 13%, supported by a change in the mix of business to more profitable lines of
business and a lower comparable risk discount rate at the end of October 2019. Net result from
financial services grew by 12%, contributing to a 16% rise in net operational earnings. Saham
continues to outperform its top-line target.

Operating conditions remained challenging in South Africa with no major improvement expected
in the country's economic growth in the short to medium term. The medium-term budget policy
statement (MTBPS) by the Minister of Finance highlighted the need to implement the structural
reforms proposed in National Treasury's recently-released economic strategy document. The
MTBPS contributed to a downgrade by Moody's of South Africa's sovereign credit rating outlook
to negative. The continued policy and political uncertainty weighed on the South African currency
and investment markets, which significantly underperformed global markets. Despite these
headwinds, we continued to grow strongly in all of our South African businesses, testimony to the
quality of our business and our people, their ability to execute in tough times and delivery from
the new growth initiatives that we launched in recent years, such as BrightRock, Sanlam Indie,
MiWay Life and the Capitec Bank partnership.

The South African equity markets recorded muted growth in the first 10 months of 2019 compared
to global indices, with the JSE/FTSE Swix Index delivering a return of 7.1% compared to a
negative return of 13.6% in the first 10 months of 2018. Average equity markets as measured by
the JSE/FTSE Swix Index were, however, still some 4.9% lower than the comparable 10-month
period in 2018.

Economic conditions in the other emerging markets where we operate remained broadly
unchanged from the first half of 2019. The exceptions were Angola and Lebanon. The Angolan
currency collapsed since the Central Bank removed the band within which it protected the
currency, exacerbating inflationary pressure in our general insurance business and contributing
to foreign currency translation losses of R111 million since 30 June 2019 on exposure that cannot
be settled due to foreign currency liquidity constraints. Pressure on the Lebanese economy and
general operating environment intensified following social unrest and political uncertainty. The
Indian businesses continue to perform well despite a slowdown in economic growth.
We remain focused on our core competencies: delivering shareholder value under challenging
conditions while at the same time executing future growth strategies. This is founded in our
diversified profile as well as a federal management model that supports dual focus on operational
and strategic delivery.

Results

The constant currency information included in this operational update has been presented to
illustrate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and is the responsibility of the Group's
board of directors (""Board""). It is presented for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature
may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in equity, result of operations or
cash flows. All references to constant currency information are based on the translation of foreign
currency results for the 10 months to 31 October 2019 at the weighted average exchange rate
for the 10 months to 31 October 2018, which is also applied for the translation of comparative
information. The major currencies contributing to the exchange rate movements are the British
Pound, United States Dollar, Indian Rupee, Botswana Pula, Moroccan Dirham, Angolan Kwanza
and the Nigerian Naira (negative movements in the table below indicate a strengthening in the
rand exchange rate):

The constant currency information has not been audited or reviewed by Sanlam's external
auditor.

All comparative information is for the 10 months ended 31 October 2018 unless otherwise
indicated. Any reference to the Saham structural impact refers to the impact of Sanlam acquiring
the remaining 53% interest in Saham Finances effective 1 October 2018.

The salient features of the Group's performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2019 are:

*         New business volumes of R199 billion, up 6% on the first 10 months of the 2018 financial
          year (3% in constant currency and excluding the Saham structural impact).

      o    Overall new business volumes at Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) were in line with 2018,
           a marked improvement compared to the first six months of 2019.

           Sanlam Sky new business sales grew by 9% (52% excluding the one-off Capitec Bank
           credit life mandate included in the comparative base). Sales through the traditional
           individual life intermediated channel continued to perform well, increasing by a healthy
           11%. Sales of Capitec Bank funeral business, launched in May 2018, continue to exceed
           expectations, contributing some R900 million to new business volumes. Safrican and
           Group Benefits are having a slower year.

           The recurring premium sub cluster, primarily focused on the middle-income market,
           reflects the pressure on disposable income in this market segment, with new business
           volumes only marginally up on 2018. Good demand for single premium retirement
           annuities, the MiWay Life and Sanlam Indie offerings as well as Sanlam Personal Loans
           credit life was offset by lower sales of traditional individual life recurring premiums risk and
           savings products.
                                                                                                 2|P age
        Despite persisting uncertainty, Glacier experienced a welcome improvement in life and
        non-life sales, exceeding sales targets in recent months. New business sales for the 10
        months to 31 October 2019 were only slightly down on the previous year.

    o   SEM recorded overall new business growth of 37% (10% up in constant currency and
        excluding the Saham structural impact). Trends were broadly in line with the first-half 2019
        performance. Saham continues to outperform its top-line targets by a considerable
        margin, partly offset by lower investment business flows in Namibia and Kenya. Nigeria
        also continued to contribute strong growth.

    o   New business volumes at SIG increased by 6%, a strong performance under difficult
        conditions. The value of new mandates awarded to the South African Investment
        Management and Wealth Management businesses increased by 14% and 34%
        respectively. The International businesses experienced a 26% slowdown in new business
        inflows.

    o   Santam achieved slightly more subdued growth in conventional business gross written
        premiums compared to the first-half performance.

    o   The comparative base for Sanlam Corporate includes large one-off mandates awarded in
        2018 that were not expected to repeat in 2019. The cluster's new business volumes
        commensurately declined by 20% despite exceeding the target for the period by a healthy
        margin.

    o   Net VNB increased by 13% (up 6% on a constant economic basis) with all clusters
        contributing good growth. Overall net VNB margins improved by some 21 basis points on
        a constant economic basis on the comparable 2018 period.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R43.5 billion were 20% higher than the R36.2 billion achieved
        in the comparable 10-month period in 2018. SIG attracted strong net inflows of R18.5
        billion compared to R8.7 billion in the comparable period.

    o   Persistency trends remained in line with the first half of 2019.

*   Net result from financial services increased by 12% on the first 10 months of the 2018
    financial year (up 6% excluding the Saham structural impact and in constant currency).

    o   SPF's net result from financial services increased by 7%, supported by strong growth at
        Glacier. The improved relative investment market performance in 2019 compared to the
        first 10 months of 2018 benefited fee income from Glacier's participating products.

    o   SEM's net result from financial services increased by 36% (12% excluding the Saham
        structural impact and in constant currency). All key regions contributed strong growth,
        apart from Namibia where increased new business strain and lower general insurance
        earnings limited net profit growth to 2%. India in particular continued its strong growth in
        operational earnings. Claims experience in Saham remains under pressure, with the
        overall general insurance underwriting margin below the 5% to 9% target range. Saham
        continues to implement corrective measures, including repricing and improved claims
        management. The investment performance has, however, been better than expected,
        which partly offset the lower underwriting result.

    o   SIG's contribution to net result from financial services decreased by 6%. The South
        African asset management and wealth management businesses continued to do well and
        achieved 30% growth in net result from financial services despite the 4.9% lower average                                                                                         
        equity markets in the period that suppressed fee income. One-off income earned in the
        alternative businesses supported the performance, augmented by improved performance
        fees in the third-party business and diligent cost management. Sanlam Specialised
        Finance's net result from financial services declined by 16%, largely due to the increased
        provisioning in respect of certain corporate credit exposures.

    o   As indicated above, claims experience improved at Santam since the end of June 2019.
        Underwriting margin within the conventional business moved well above the midpoint of
        the target range of 4% to 8%.

    o   Repricing of loss-making schemes, combined with improved claims management, are
        yielding positive results at Sanlam Corporate, with Group Risk profit reflecting a major
        improvement on the comparable 10-month period in 2018. Actual disability claims
        experience continued at elevated levels.

*   Net operational earnings increased by 16%. This is the combined effect of the 12% growth
    in net result from financial services and a 62% combined increase in net investment return
    and project expenses. Net investment return benefited from the relatively stronger investment
    market returns.

*   Diluted headline earnings per share declined by 20%, but increased by 2% per share if the
    B-BBEE IFRS 2 charge is excluded. Headline earnings reflect the combined effect of:
    o The 16% increase in net operational earnings;
    o The one-off accounting cost of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of IFRS 2 in respect of
         the B-BBEE share issuance in the first half of the year.
    o A 185% increase in the amortisation of intangible assets following the first-time
         consolidation of Saham and Nucleus in 2018.


Capital

The Group's operations remain well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio amounted to 216% on 30 September 2019 (Sanlam Life
Insurance Limited: 262%).

Discretionary capital available at the end of June 2019 has been fully utilised for corporate
transactions amounting to some R770 million. Some R630 million was utilised for the acquisition
of the Thesis Group in the United Kingdom (UK) and the capitalisation of African Rainbow Life,
which received its insurance licence in July. The Thesis Group augments the scale of the Group's
private wealth, advice and asset management operations in the UK. Focus in the UK is now on
embedding the recent acquisitions made, with no further transactions planned for the foreseeable
future.

Future generation of discretionary capital will be sufficient to fund the planned bolt-on acquisitions
across the portfolio.

Outlook

We do not expect improvement in the economic conditions of the major territories where the
Group operates in the short term. New business growth potential will commensurately remain
under pressure. Investment market volatility is also expected to persist, aggravated by Brexit and
the finalisation of a trade deal between the United States and China.
                                                                                            
Continuation of the recovery in the South African mass affluent new business performance is
largely dependent on developments in the political environment. New business growth in the
South African entry-level market will be impacted by the diminishing base effect from the launch
of the Capitec Bank funeral product in May 2018. Outside of South Africa, new business growth
in other emerging markets is expected to remain strong, supported by the base effect of the
Saham structural impact.

Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and the level
of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net result
from financial services, normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for
the year to 31 December 2019. Currency volatility in Angola and the weakening operating
environment in Lebanon are particular risk factors.

The focus will remain on delivering results from Saham and finalising the third-party asset
management B-BBEE transaction approved by Sanlam shareholders in December 2018.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by Sanlam's
external auditors. Sanlam's annual results for the year ending 31 December 2019 are due to be
released on 12 March 2020. Shareholders are advised that this is not a trading statement as per
paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

(1) Comparative information at 31 December 2018
(2) Weighted average number of shares excludes Sanlam shares held directly or indirectly through consolidated investment funds in policyholder 
    portfolios, as well as Sanlam shares held by the Group's Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment special purposes vehicle (B-BBEE SPV) that is consolidated
    in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards. These shares are treated as shares in issue for purposes of normalised weighted average number of 
    shares, which are used for the per-share metrics for the Shareholders' fund information.
(3) PVNBP = present value of new business premiums and is equal to the present value of new recurring premiums plus single premiums.

Operating conditions remained challenging in South Africa with the economy contracting by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Subdued economic growth of less
than 1% is expected for the 2019 year. Despite weak operating environments in South Africa and Namibia, as well as the general adverse effect of international 
political and economic turmoil on emerging markets, the Group achieved a pleasing operational performance in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Solid organic 
growth was augmented by the Saham Finances corporate activity in the second half of 2018, contributing to a 13% increase in net result from financial services, 
19% growth in the value of new covered business (VNB) written and 19% higher net fund inflows.

The Group's strategic intent of sustainable value creation for all key stakeholders remains firmly in place and we continued to execute on all strategic
pillars in the first half of 2019.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R5 billion increased by 13% on the first six months of 2018 (up 10% in constant currency).

Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) grew its net result from financial services by 9%, attributable to strong earnings growth at Glacier and Sanlam Sky. A prior
year tax adjustment of R70 million at Sanlam Personal Loans (SPL) had a positive impact on the after-tax results. Excluding higher new business strain and
the prior year tax adjustment, net result from financial services increased by 12%. Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM) grew its net result from financial
services by 50% including structural activity and exchange rate differences. Organic growth in constant currency amounted to 18%. Sanlam Investment Group's
(SIG) net result from financial services increased by 7% (3% in constant currency), a satisfactory performance under challenging conditions. The 18% decline in
Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services is the result of weaker group risk claims experience as well as a lower contribution from Sanlam Employee
Benefits Investments from a high base in 2018. Santam's net result from financial services declined by 13%, the combined effect of a decline of 34% in the 
underwriting results, an 8% increase in float income of conventional insurance and a more than doubling in Santam's share of earnings from SEM general 
insurance businesses.

New business volumes increased by 4% despite low investor confidence in South Africa and lower investment inflows in Namibia and Kenya. The Saham Finances
corporate activity increased the growth by some 3%. Life insurance new business volumes increased by 2%, investment business inflows were in line with 2018
and general insurance earned premiums increased by 25%. Overall net fund inflows of R22.9 billion in 2019 is a particularly satisfactory performance given
the challenging market conditions. The value of new life insurance business written in the first half of 2019 increased strongly by 19% on the comparable
period in 2018.

Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 312 cents for the year ended 31 December 2018 was paid on Monday, 15 April 2019 by way of
electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 12 April 2019. Shareholders who have
not yet provided their banking details for dividend payments are requested to do so by contacting Sanlam's transfer secretary, Computershare, at 0861 100
913 or +27(0)11 373 5000.

Trading Statement – 2019 Interim Results

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam is currently compiling its results for the six
months ended 30 June 2019. This trading statement provides an indication of a range
for headline earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity
holders of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements. Sanlam's interim results will be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) on Thursday, 5 September 2019.
The Group achieved satisfactory growth in net result from financial services as well as
investment return earned on its capital portfolios for the first half of the 2019 financial
year, contributing to estimated combined growth of between 8% and 18% from these
sources of earnings.

The Group also concluded a share issuance to a new Broad-Based Black Economic
Empowerment (B-BBEE) entity (B-BBEE Entity) as approved by Sanlam shareholders
in December 2018 and notified on SENS in March 2019 (B-BBEE Share Issuance). The
B-BBEE Share Issuance positions Sanlam as the foremost empowered insurance and
investment management group in South Africa.

Headline earnings for the six months to 30 June 2019 are impacted by the following:

•   A one-off expense of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2 Share Based Payment in respect of the B-BBEE
    Share Issuance, as reported to shareholders in the four-month operational update
    on 5 June 2019.
•   The value of business acquired (VOBA) intangible assets recognised in 2018 upon
    the first-time consolidation of Saham Finances and Nucleus as Group subsidiaries
    contributed an additional amortisation charge of some R200 million in the first six
    months of 2019.
•   Profits and losses recognised in terms of IFRS in respect of the treatment of Sanlam
    shares held in policyholder portfolios as treasury shares, the movement in deferred
    tax assets recognised in respect of assessed losses in policyholder funds and the
    consolidation of the Sanlam Foundation and B-BBEE Entity (Fund transfers),
    declined from a R209 million net profit in 2018 to a net loss of R102 million in 2019.
    The consolidated results of the B-BBEE Entity included in the 2019 Fund transfers
    comprises interest paid on the external funding and administration costs incurred of
    some R110 million.

Given the size of these items, headline earnings and earnings attributable to equity
holders of the Group for the six months to 30 June 2019 are expected to decrease by
between 25% and 35% compared to the first half of 2018. Excluding the one-off IFRS 2
charge, the amortisation of intangible assets and the Fund transfers referred to above,                                                                              
headline earnings and earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group would have
increased by between 8% and 18%, reflecting the solid underlying operational
performance by the Group.

The weighted average number of shares used for HEPS and EPS is not impacted by
the B-BBEE Share Issuance as the Sanlam shares held by the B-BBEE Entity is treated
as treasury shares upon consolidation. These shares will, however, be treated as
issued shares for purposes of the Group's disclosed per share management
information, such as net result from financial services per share and Group Equity
Value per share.

Shareholders are advised that the Group expects HEPS and EPS for the 2019 interim
period, expressed as growth on the prior period, to fall within the following ranges:

                                Six months to         Six months to    Six months to
                                30 June 2019          30 June 2019     30 June 2018

Executive management changes at Sanlam as it embeds its Pan Africa strategy

In terms of paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are
advised of the following executive changes at Sanlam Group with effect from 01 August 2019.

The Group's Financial Director, Mr Heinie Werth, will take over a new role as Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of Sanlam Emerging Markets, the business cluster that is responsible for
Sanlam's businesses across 33 countries in Africa (Sanlam Pan Africa), as well as the Group's
other emerging markets business in India, Lebanon and Malaysia.

Mr Junior Ngulube, who is the CEO of Sanlam Pan Africa and due to retire in 18 months, will
take on the role of Vice Chairman of SPA.

Mr Wikus Olivier, currently the Executive Head: Group Finance will act in the position of interim
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with effect from 01 August 2019 until the Group commences a
recruitment process to fill the role of Group Financial Director permanently.

The Group said these executive changes are part of succession planning and support its
resolve to execute its Pan-Africa and emerging markets strategy in this bigger cluster for the
success of the broader Group.

Sanlam Group CEO, Mr Ian Kirk said: ""For us to successfully achieve our objectives on the
continent and beyond, we need to have the best people in the right jobs and with the right level
of support. Having two senior executives of the calibre and stature of Mr Werth and Mr Ngulube
demonstrates our determination to deliver on our strategy and the unique Pan African
leadership opportunity we have created over the years, especially following our acquisition of
SAHAM Finances.

""We will immediately start the process to recruit a new Group Financial Director and we will
inform the market about our progress in due course. We are confident that Wikus has the
requisite skills and is well poised to support the Group acting in the CFO role. He has been with
Sanlam for 19 years in a variety of roles, including accounting, finance and tax and has worked
closely with Heinie and I for many years.""
Mr Werth, who will continue in his role as an Executive Director on the Sanlam Limited Board,
was previously the CEO of Sanlam Developing Markets (SDM) and SEM for 10 years from 2006
until 2016 when he took up his current position as the Group's Financial Director.

Earlier this year, he assumed the additional responsibility for the businesses in Lebanon, India
and Malaysia.

Mr Ngulube, who joined Sanlam in 2016 as the first CEO of the newly established Sanlam
Corporate business cluster, will retain his membership of the Group's Executive Committee
reporting to the Group CEO and will remain a Director on the Board of Santam Limited.

""The geographic spread, size and complexity of the SEM cluster as well as the size of the
investment we have made to acquire SAHAM Finances is unprecedented within Sanlam and
possibly in the industry. I believe that the combined and complementary efforts of Heinie and
Junior will assist to take the SEM Cluster, and the Sanlam Group as a whole, to an unparalleled
competitive position,"" Mr Kirk concluded.

Operational Update – June 2019

The Group achieved a satisfactory operational performance in the four months to 30
April 2019, despite persisting headwinds in South Africa, our largest market, and
international political and economic turmoil affecting emerging markets in general.
Pleasing organic growth was augmented by the impact of the Saham Finances
acquisition in the second half of 2018, contributing to 10% growth in the value of new
covered business (VNB) written (17% on a constant economic basis), 30% rise in net
fund inflows and a 9% increase in net result from financial services. There is continued
progress in bedding down the Saham Finances acquisition.
Operating conditions remained challenging in South Africa with subdued economic
growth as anticipated. A favourable change in corporate investment confidence and
foreign direct investment flows, key drivers of economic activity and employment, are
inextricably linked to the future policy direction of the newly elected South African
government and realistic proposals to resolve the governance, operational and financial
challenges faced by state-owned enterprises, in particular Eskom. Our mass affluent
and high net worth client segments remained cautious in the run-up to the May
elections, the announcement of the new cabinet and any potential policy
announcements. This was consistent with our experience in the last three quarters of
2018.

The South African equity markets recorded robust growth in the first four months of
2019 in line with global trends, with the JSE/FTSE Swix Index delivering a return of
12.1% compared to a negative return of 2.7% in the first four months of 2018. May saw
some reversal of this performance. Average equity markets as measured by the
JSE/FTSE Swix Index were, however, still some 8% lower than the comparable four-
month period in 2018. After a benign claims environment in 2018, Santam experienced
an elevated level of claims in 2019.
Apart from Namibia, economic conditions in the other emerging markets where we
operate are more conducive to growth. India in particular is expected to maintain strong
economic growth with the renewed mandate provided to the governing party in recent
elections providing some policy certainty.
As announced early in March 2019, we concluded the 5% share issuance to the new
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) entity as approved by Sanlam
shareholders in December 2018. The shares were issued at a price of R70 per share,
representing a discount of some 10% to the 3-day volume-weighted average price
(VWAP) at the time. The issuance raised total capital of R7.8 billion, with a net cash
component of R4.8 billion after allowing for the net vendor funding provided by Sanlam.
Participation by the new shares in the recent Sanlam dividend reduced the net cash
proceeds to R4.5 billion.
Sanlam is now positioned as the foremost-empowered insurance and investment
management group in South Africa. The issuance also restored the discretionary capital
portfolio to an appropriate level.
As communicated in the 2018 circular to shareholders, the issuance impacts on
earnings per share in 2019 through both an increase in the number of shares in issue
as well as the R1.7 billion one-off accounting cost recognised in headline earnings in
terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 2 Share-based Payment).
We remain focused on our core competencies in our centenary year: delivering
shareholder value under challenging conditions while at the same time executing future
growth strategies. This is founded in our diversified profile as well as a federal
management model that supports dual focus on operational and strategic delivery.

The constant currency information included in this operational update has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and is the
responsibility of the Group's board of directors (""Board""). It is presented for illustrative
purposes only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial
position, changes in equity, result of operations or cash flows. All references to constant
currency information are based on the translation of foreign currency results for the four
months to 30 April 2019 at the weighted average exchange rate for the four months to
30 April 2018, which is also applied for the translation of comparative information. The
major currencies contributing to the exchange rate movements are the British Pound,
United States Dollar, Indian Rupee, Botswana Pula, Moroccan Dirham, Angolan
Kwanza and the Nigerian Naira (negative movements in the table below indicate a

The salient features of the Group's performance for the four months to 30 April 2019
are:
•       New business volumes of R72 billion, up 7% on the first four months of the 2018
        financial year (3% in constant currency and excluding Saham Finances).

    o    Overall new business volumes at Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) declined by
         9% due to lower demand at Glacier.

         Sanlam Sky experienced strong growth of 90%. Sales through the traditional
         individual life intermediated channel increased by a healthy 12%, augmented by
         good growth at Group Benefits and Safrican as well as an exceptional
         performance of the Capitec Bank funeral product. The Capitec Bank credit life
         business was not renewed effective 1 May 2019. Unlike the strategic multi-year
         arrangement to distribute products through Capitec Bank's retail footprint, the
         credit life business is subject to annual renewal based on a competitive bidding
         process. Sanlam Sky's quoted pricing in 2019 reflected an expected heightening
         in claims risk given the prevailing distressed environment, which proved
         uncompetitive. The R566 million of credit life new business and related VNB of
         R36 million written in 2018 will therefore not repeat in 2019.

         The recurring premium sub cluster experienced marginal growth of 1% in new
         business sales. Good demand for single premium retirement annuities, the
         MiWay Life offering and Sanlam Personal Loans credit life was offset by flat
         sales of traditional individual life risk products and lower sales of other lines of
         business.

         Investor confidence in Glacier's target market remained under pressure, in line
         with trends experienced since the second quarter of 2018. This contributed to a
         12% decline in Glacier's new business volumes from the high base in the first
         quarter of 2018.

    o    SEM recorded overall new business growth of 34% (4% lower in constant
         currency and excluding Saham Finances). The Pan Africa and Other emerging
         markets portfolios grew by 36% (6% lower in constant currency and excluding
         Saham Finances) and 21% (11% in constant currency) respectively. Good
         growth was achieved in most countries and lines of business apart from
         investment business in Namibia and Kenya. Excluding these, as well as Saham
         Finances, new business volumes in the Pan Africa portfolio increased by 16% in
         constant currency.

         New business volumes in Namibia declined by 14%, attributable to lower
         investment inflows. New life business grew by more than 20%, with the entry-
         level market segment continuing to perform well.

         Strong growth in investment business supported overall growth of 21% in
         Botswana new business sales (14% in constant currency). Life business had a
         slow start to the year, reflecting a decline of some 6% combined with a change in
         mix to savings business.

         Saham Finances' new business contribution increased by 173% (142% in
         constant currency), supported by the structural activity in 2018. The year-to-date
         performance reflected a pleasing outperformance of targets.
        Rest of Africa (excluding Saham Finances) new business volumes declined by
        15% (25% lower in constant currency) due to the lower investment management
        mandates in Kenya. Excluding this, new business volumes increased by some
        30%, with strong growth in most regions.

        The Indian and Malaysian businesses achieved double-digit growth, with
        Malaysian life business finding particularly satisfactory traction.

    o   New business volumes at Sanlam Investments Group (SIG) increased by 8%
        (6% in constant currency), a strong performance under difficult conditions. The
        value of new mandates awarded to the South African Investment Management
        and International businesses increased by 7% and 11% respectively. Growth at
        Private Wealth was subdued, reflecting investor caution in the high net worth
        market.

    o   Within Santam, the conventional insurance business achieved acceptable growth
        in gross written premiums, while the alternative risk transfer business recorded
        strong growth, specifically relating to the risk financing lines of business.

    o   Sanlam Corporate had a strong start to the year, more than doubling its new
        business contribution. Both recurring and single premium sales achieved
        exemplary growth.

    o   Net VNB increased by 10% (up 17% on a constant economic basis) with all
        clusters contributing good growth. Overall net VNB margins improved by some
        27 basis points on a constant economic basis on the comparable 2018 period.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R15.9 billion were 30% higher than the R12.2 billion
        achieved in the comparable four-month period in 2018. SIG attracted strong net
        inflows of R8.4 billion compared to R3.5 billion in the comparable period. Net
        fund inflows at SPF declined due to the lower single premium inflows at Glacier.

    o   Persistency trends remained in line with the second half of 2018.

•   Net result from financial services increased by 9% on the first four months of the
    2018 financial year (up 3% excluding Saham Finances and in constant currency).

    o   Sanlam Personal Finance's net result from financial services increased by 17%,
        supported by strong growth at Glacier and Sanlam Sky. The improved relative
        investment market performance in 2019 compared to the first four months of
        2018 benefited fee income from Glacier's participating products. Sanlam Sky's
        contribution reflects higher profit releases from the growing in-force book, as well
        as positive mortality experience and improved investment variances.

    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets' net result from financial services increased by 51%
        (25% excluding Saham Finances and in constant currency). The Pan Africa and
        Other emerging markets portfolios grew their net operating earnings by 62%
        (25% excluding Saham Finances and in constant currency) and 37% (25% in
        constant currency) respectively.
    Saham Finances' net result from financial services were below target, due to
    persisting high motor claims experience in Morocco, fire claims in Ivory Coast
    and some exposure to the cyclone damage in Mozambique, which resulted in an
    overall underwriting margin at the lower end of its 5% to 9% target range. The
    claims experience in Morocco is in line with industry experience, with repricing
    and claims management key areas of focus. We have seen an improvement in
    float return in some markets. Good progress has been made in evaluating the
    optimal strategic asset allocation of the float balances in Morocco and Ivory
    Coast.

    Most other businesses in the Rest of Africa portfolio achieved good growth.

    The Indian operations are the largest contributor to the Other emerging markets
    portfolio. Indian net result from financial services increased by some 40% (28%
    in constant currency), supported by strong growth in the credit and general
    insurance businesses. The credit businesses benefited from an increase in
    lending books as well as lower provisions following an improvement in credit
    quality. Shriram General Insurance's operating earnings were supported by a
    relaxation of claims reserves in the third party motor book based on recent
    claims experience.

o Sanlam Investments' contribution to net result from financial services decreased
  by 15% (19% in constant currency). The South African asset management and
  wealth management businesses did well to achieve 1% growth in net result from
  financial services despite the 8% lower average equity markets in the period that
  suppressed fee income. Investor caution also impacted negatively on brokerage
  income. Provisions in respect of credit exposures in Sanlam Specialised Finance
  and the International businesses had a negative impact of some R70 million
  gross of tax.

o   As indicated above, claims experience weakened at Santam following a benign
    claims environment in 2018. The first four months of 2019 were characterised by
    a number of significant catastrophe events, including fires in the Betty's Bay area
    in January, hail damage in Newcastle in March and the storm and flood damage
    in Kwazulu-Natal during April. In addition, significant crop insurance losses
    relating to hail were experienced. These events negatively impacted the net
    underwriting margin of the conventional insurance business, which ended slightly
    below the bottom end of Santam's target range of 4% to 8% of net earned
    premiums. The operating results of the alternative risk transfer business were
    positively impacted by growth in net income from clients with solid contributions
    from both Centriq and Santam Structured Insurance.

o   Claims experience at Sanlam Employee Benefits also weakened compared to
    the first four months of 2018, in particular lump sum disability claims. This had an
    adverse impact on profitability at Sanlam Group Risk, contributing to an overall
    decline in Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services.
•   Diluted headline earnings per share declined by 40%, but increased by 9% per
    share if the B-BBEE IFRS 2 charge is excluded. Headline earnings reflect the
    combined effect of:
     o The 9% increase in net result from financial services;
     o A 79% improvement in net investment return earned on the capital portfolios in
        line with the relatively stronger investment market performance in the first four
        months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018;
     o A one-off accounting cost of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of IFRS 2 in
        respect of the B-BBEE share issuance, which is in line with the financial effects
        disclosed to shareholders in the 2018 circular. Of this cost, only R594 million
        constitutes an economic cost to Sanlam shareholders in management's view,
        being the excess discount granted to the B-BBEE investment vehicle above
        what would have been a market-related discount of some 5% for a normal
        private placement of shares.
     o A 5% increase in the weighted number of shares in issue following the share
        issuances in 2018 and 2019.


Capital

The Group's operations remain well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio amounted to 2.3 times on 31 March 2019 (Sanlam Life
Insurance Limited: 2.5 times).
The Group started the year with a negative discretionary capital balance of R3.7 billion.
The portfolio was augmented in the first four months of 2019 by inflows of some R5.1
billion, which included the capital raised from the B-BBEE issuance, excess dividend
cover in respect of the 2018 dividend paid in 2019 and excess investment return earned
on the Sanlam Life covered business operations. The latter represents investment
return earned up to the end of April 2019, which is subject to investment market
volatility. A few small bolt-on transactions were concluded during the period, which
utilised some R124 million of discretionary capital. These cash flows contributed to a
discretionary capital balance of some R1.3 billion at 30 April 2019.

Outlook

We do not expect a major recovery in the economic conditions in South Africa and
Namibia for the remainder of 2019. New business growth potential will commensurately
remain under pressure. Investment market volatility is also expected to persist,
aggravated by increased tensions in the trade war between the United States and
China.

A recovery in the South African mass affluent and high net worth new business
performance is largely dependent on developments in the political environment. New
business growth in the South African entry-level market will be impacted by the
diminishing base effect from the launch of the Capitec Bank funeral product in May
2018 and the loss of the credit life business. Outside of South Africa, new business
growth in other emerging markets is expected to remain strong, supported by the base
effect of the Saham Finances acquisition in the last quarter of 2018.
Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and
the level of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on the
growth in net result from financial services, normalised headline earnings and Group
Equity Value to be reported for the six months to 30 June 2019.

The focus will remain on delivering results from the Saham Finances acquisition and to
deliver value from the package of B-BBEE transactions approved in December 2018,
once implemented.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Sanlam's interim results for the six months ending 30 June
2019 are due to be released on 4 September 2019. Shareholders are advised that this
is not a trading statement as per paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements.

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

We made major progress in executing on our strategic pillars during 2018. Our federal model and diversified profile are major contributors, enabling a dual focus 
on growing our existing operations while also concluding new corporate transactions to drive enhanced future growth. This diligent focus on strategic execution 
enabled us to achieve solid growth in 2018 and double-digit average growth rates in most key performance indicators over the last 10 years. Highlights for the 
year include two major transformative transactions that positions us well for sustainable future growth: the acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances 
in October 2018 and the approval of a package of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) transactions by shareholders in December 2018. Growth of 14% in 
the value of new covered business (VNB) on a consistent economic basis and more than R2 billion in positive experience variance is testimony to Sanlam's resilience 
in difficult times.

We entered 2018 with renewed optimism in South Africa. The election of Mr Cyril Ramaphosa as president of the African National Congress and South Africa boded 
well for an improved operating environment. Corporate and individual investor confidence soared, but it was unfortunately short lived. It was soon realised that 
it will take longer than expected to transform the positive changes into enhanced economic growth. Investor confidence faded as a result, compounded by international 
developments including a steady rise in the US Federal Reserve policy interest rate, the uncertainties surrounding Brexit and an escalating trade war between the 
US and China. Operating conditions in South Africa remained challenging as a result, with pedestrian economic growth, negative returns on the local equity market 
and currency volatility. The negative return of 9% for the JSE/FTSE All Share index compared to a positive return of 21% in 2017 had a pronounced impact on RoGEV 
and earnings growth in 2018.

Economic growth in a number of the other key emerging markets where we operate were also constrained. In addition, equity markets across most of these markets 
recorded declines, placing severe pressure on our ability to grow earnings and create value for our clients. The currencies of oil-producing countries, Nigeria and 
Angola in particular, remained weak.

Despite these challenges, the Group delivered robust overall growth in key performance indicators, supported by our diversification across geographies, market 
segments and lines of business.

The key highlights and challenges for the year are:

HIGHLIGHTS                                                   CHALLENGES
Adjusted RoGEV of 19.4% per                                  Weak investment markets impacted on Sanlam Investment Group (SIG) and Sanlam Personal Finace (SPF)

Saham Finances acquisition concluded and consolidated
 from 1 October 2018
Package of BBBEE transactions approved and successful 
 book build of R5,5 billion in March 2018, increasing 
 issued share capital by 3% 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The board of directors of Sanlam (""Board"") is committed to ensuring the continued practice of good corporate governance and have decided on the following:

i)      Independent non-executive directors who have served on the board beyond 9 years would come up for rotation at the AGM on an annual basis going forward. 
        Mr Anton Botha and Mr Sipho Nkosi would stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting (""AGM"") of the Company being held on 05 June 2019. 
ii)     Dr Van Zyl would step down as chair of the Board on or before the AGM of 03 June 2020.  A suitable independent non-executive chairman would take his place.
        He would remain a non-executive director of the Board. He would step down as a member of the nominations committee.
iii)    Mr Chris Swanepoel will officially retire in November 2020 (when he reaches the age of 70 - Sanlam's retirement age) and he has requested that he formally 
        retire on 03 June 2020 at the AGM.
iv)     The intention of the Board is to appoint further independent non-executive directors in order to strengthen the independence at the board and board committee
        levels.

The above steps and timeframes is to ensure that Sanlam attracts the highest caliber of independent non-executive Board directors to the Company and this would take 
some time to implement through its structures. Sanlam continues to ensure the highest levels of corporate governance as governance standards develop in South Africa.

  it was decided to further enhance focus on the management of Sanlam assets within the SIG cluster, while at the same time creating a third party asset manager
  that can more effectively compete with leading independent asset managers. The Sanlam Asset Management division and the part of Sanlam Structured Solutions
  responsible for the Sanlam assets were accordingly combined with SCM to form the new Sanlam Specialised Finance sub cluster.
  Comparative Shareholders' Information has been restated accordingly, apart from Group Equity Value (GEV) that has not been restated for Sanlam Asset Management. 
  The valuation of Sanlam Asset Management as a separate business was only finalised during 2018. Comparative GEV valuations are not available with the business 
  accordingly transferred to Sanfin with effect from 1 January 2018 for GEV purposes. As it is an intra cluster transfer, it does not have an impact on GEV or 
  RoGEV for the overall SIG cluster. As part of the restructuring, operational responsibility for the Group's term finance margin business was also transferred 
  from the Group Office to Sanlam Specialised Finance. Comparative information was not restated for this change in operational responsibility based on materiality.

- Non-annuity assets and business flows at Sanlam Private Wealth have been reclassified from Assets under Management to Assets under Administration in line with 
  industry practice. Business flows relating to these assets are commensurately excluded from new business volumes and net fund flows. Comparative 2017 information 
  for SIG and the Group has been restated as follows:

  - New business volumes decreased by R9 016 million
  - Net fund flows increased by R2 568 million
  - Reclassification of assets amounting to R98 446 million from assets under management to assets under administration.

- Savings business written through the Sanlam Sky distribution channels are recognised within the SPF Savings business with effect from 2018. Comparative 
  information has not been restated. The 2018 SPF Savings results include new business volumes of R118 million and VNB of negative R15 million relating to business 
  formerly recognised in Sanlam Sky.

All growth percentages reflected in this review are relative to the 12 months ended 31 December 2017, unless otherwise indicated.

The 3% new shares issued through an accelerated book build in the first quarter (refer Capital management section) had a 2.3% dilutive effect on earnings per share 
metrics due to an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. In addition, the acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances, 
for which the capital was raised, only completed and started contributing to earnings from 1 October 2018.

Corporate activity during 2017 and 2018 impacts on the comparability of the Group's results. The following were the largest transactions:

- SPF acquired a 53% stake in BrightRock with effect from 1 September 2017. Shares acquired subsequent to the initial acquisition has increased Sanlam's stake 
  to 55.1% at 31 December 2018.

- SPF started Indie as a new greenfields business in 2017, with initial losses recognised in earnings in both 2018 and 2017.

- SEM sold its stake in the Enterprise Group in Ghana with an effective date of 1 July 2017.

- Absa Consultants and Actuaries (renamed ACA Employee Benefits (ACA)) was acquired effective 1 April 2018.

- Saham Finances is consolidated with effect from 1 October 2018; before this date, the Group's investment in Saham Finances was recognised as an equity-accounted 
  investment. The table below provides a summary of Sanlam's participation in Saham Finances' earnings, new business volumes, VNB and net fund flows based on the 
  changes in shareholding:

Group Equity Value

GEV amounted to R134 billion or 6 341 cents per share at 31 December 2018. Including the dividend of 290 cents per share paid during the year, a RoGEV per share 
of 11.6% was achieved. This was lower than the 13% target for the year. Strong growth in VNB, all-time high positive experience variances from covered business, 
good returns from the investment in Santam, the profit realised from the foreign exchange hedge implemented for the Saham Finances acquisition and the benefit of 
a weaker rand exchange rate on the valuation of non-South African operations provided support to returns in 2018. This was, however, not sufficient to compensate 
for the pronounced negative impact of weaker equity markets across most regions, higher risk discount rates (RDR) and the write-off of goodwill recognised in 
respect of the Saham Finances and other smaller acquisitions in terms of the Embedded Value methodology. The capital raising during 2018 (refer Capital management section below) 
occurred at a price of R87 per share, in excess of GEV per share at the time. This supported RoGEV per share by some 1% compared to the absolute RoGEV of 10.6% 
for 2018. 

Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact of lower investment return than the long-term assumptions, interest rate changes and other one-off effects 
not under management control, and assuming normalised exchange rate movements, amounted to 19.4% - well in excess of the target.

Group operations yielded an overall return of 11.6% in 2018, the combination of 11% return on covered business and 12.2% on other Group operations. All clusters 
achieved satisfactory growth in GEV, apart from SIG, where valuations were severely suppressed by the negative equity market performance. Adjusted RoGEV for group 
operations amounted to 20.1% and 14.5% for SIG, which better reflects the underlying operational performance. 

The covered business operations delivered a very strong operational performance. Adjusted RoGEV amounted to 19.9%, with all businesses exceeding the Group 
hurdle rate by a healthy margin, apart from the SIG businesses. The latter is predominantly due to negative expense experience variances and assumption changes
at Sanlam Investments and Pensions in the UK.

The main components contributing to the return on covered business are included in the table below:

Return on covered business for the year ended 31 December 2018

 Capital portfolio                                           -0,2      -0,2
Foreign currency translation differences and other           -1,6       0,3
Return on covered business                                   11,0      18,8

The main items contributing to the return from covered business are:

- Expected return on covered business increased in 2018 relative to 2017 based on the slightly higher RDR applied at the end of 2017 and the change in mix of 
  the book to the higher-RDR SEM businesses.

- Value of new covered business: Despite the higher RDR in 2018, VNB still contributed 3.7% to the overall return. As highlighted in the Business volumes section, 
  Sanlam Sky, Sanlam Corporate and SEM Namibia made particularly satisfactory progress in growing their VNB.

- Operating experience variances reached an all-time high, exceeding R2 billion for the first time (2017: R1.6 billion), up 35%. 
  - Risk experience variances of R535 million increased by 20% on 2017, driven by favourable experience across most lines of business in SPF, including Sanlam Sky. 
    SEM also achieved overall positive experience, albeit slightly lower than 2017. Claims experience weakened further at SEB, contributing to negative experience 
    variances of R96 million compared to negative R43 million in 2017.

  - Our focus on client centricity is a major factor in our success to maintain good persistency under challenging economic conditions. Positive persistency 
    experience variances of R147 million in 2018 (up from R67 million in 2017) is a particularly satisfactory achievement. SPF's negative variance of R45 million 
    is largely due to lower than expected continuations of single premium savings products. Persistency across risk products remained resilient. Dedicated focus 
    on managing the in-force book contributed to an improvement in SEM's experience from negative R3 million in 2017 to positive R99 million in 2018.
  - Working capital experience variances include a one-off reserve release of R47 million. Excluding this, experience was in line with 2017, commensurate with 
    short-term interest rate trends during the year.

  - Credit spread experience increased by 10% in line with growth in the corporate debt book managed by Sanfin.

  - Other experience variances of R436 million include an amount of R272 million relating to a reduction in cost of capital following the release of R1.5 billion 
    of allocated capital from Sanlam Life's covered business (refer Capital management section below), which should be regarded as one-off. The remainder 
    comprises of a number of smaller variances.

- After strengthening the persistency and maintenance expense bases in 2017, no significant operating assumption changes were required in 2018. Modelling 
  improvements and other result from the continuous refinement of actuarial models and are small relative to the size of the in-force book. 

- RDR's increased across most of the portfolio in 2018 compared to a decline in the prior year. RoGEV from economic assumption changes were accordingly 
  negative in 2018 compared to a positive contribution in 2017.

- Negative returns from equity markets in a number of countries in 2018 had a 5.1% negative impact on RoGEV in 2018 (1.2% positive in 2017). The hedging 
  strategy applied in the Sanlam Life capital portfolio, the largest component of adjusted net worth, provided downside protection to returns on the overall 
  capital portfolio.

- Foreign currency translation differences and other include forex gains from a weaker rand exchange rate (R393 million), which was more than offset by the 
  write-off of goodwill acquired in terms of actuarial guidance (R1.2 billion). The goodwill write-off is net of R300 million of profit realised on the Saham 
  Finances forex hedge that is attributable to covered business. 

The main components contributing to the return on other Group operations are:

Weighted return on other Group operations                    12,2      12,9

Other Group operations achieved a return of 12.2%:

- Sanlam Capital Markets within Sanfin is valued at net asset value for GEV purposes, with profits earned in this business the main contributor to RoGEV from 
  investments valued at net asset value. Losses recognised against equity-backed empowerment transactions and the non-recognition of income on the Mayfair 
  collateralised loan (refer Earnings section below) are the main drivers behind the decline in RoGEV in 2018.

- The Group's investment in Santam is valued at its listed share price, which significantly outperformed the market with a return of more than 14% in 2018, 
  compared to the 9% negative return of the JSE/FTSE All Share Index.

- The majority of the Group's other operations (excluding Santam and Nucleus) is valued on a discounted cash flow (DCF) basis. The benefits of the Group's diversified 
  profile are evident in the overall 11.7% return earned from these businesses, with negative operating and economic assumption changes largely offset by 
  foreign currency translation gains. 

  The impact of lower equity markets is noticeable in the 4.3% negative operating assumption changes. More than half of this relates to SIG, where future fee 
  income assumptions were reduced in line with lower than expected assets under management. A prudent valuation approach was also followed for Saham Finances 
  and the Indian businesses. It is our usual approach to keep valuations at or close to transaction prices shortly after acquisitions, which was applied for 
  Saham Finances' local currency valuation. Valuations of the Indian credit businesses were kept broadly unchanged in local currency given recent liquidity   
  constraints in the Indian market. This is also in line with movements in the listed share prices. 

  Economic assumption changes (-3.7%) reflect the higher RDR as referred to above. 
 
  The valuation of the non-South African operations benefited from the weaker rand exchange rate. This was augmented by some R1 billion of profit realised 
  on the Saham Finances forex hedge. The total hedge profit amounted to R1.3 billion after tax, of which R300 million is attributable to covered 
  business (refer above). Overall, foreign currency translation gains contributed 5.8% to the RoGEV of businesses valued on a DCF basis.
 
The low return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:

- Net corporate expenses of R109 million recognised in net result from financial services.

- The low-yielding nature of liquid assets held in the discretionary capital portfolio.

- Funding cost in respect of the temporary debt incurred for the Saham Finances acquisition.

- An increase in the present value of future corporate expenses, with additional investment in capacity, including new appointments to the Executive committee. 

Earnings

Normalised attributable earnings increased by 5% in 2018, the aggregate of an 8% decline in normalised headline earnings and a substantial increase in profit 
recognised on the (deemed and actual) disposal of subsidiaries and associates.

Net result from financial services

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R9 billion increased by 4% on 2017, with substantial growth in Santam's contribution. 

Corporate activity supported the results, as well as a benign claims environment at Santam in 2018 compared to large catastrophe events during June and 
October 2017 in the comparable period. Normalising for these, net result from financial services were marginally up on 2017.

SPF net result from financial services declined by 5% (also down 5% on a gross basis). Excluding corporate activity and new growth initiatives, SPF's contribution 
were 1% down on 2017 due to the major impact that the weak equity market performance had on fund-based fee income at Glacier, the Closed Book and 
Savings business units.

Sanlam Sky and African Rainbow Life Insurance's gross profit contribution increased by 3%, the combination of 5% growth at Sanlam Sky and initial expenses of 
R25 million incurred in 2018 to create the new African Rainbow Life Insurance business (planned launch date in the first half of 2019). Strong new business 
growth at Sanlam Sky (refer Business volumes section) contributed to higher new business strain being recognised in 2018 in terms of the Group's prudent 
accounting policies, which recognise upfront acquisition costs incurred in respect of insurance contracts in earnings as opposed to capitalising and spreading 
it over the duration of the policies. Excluding the additional new business strain, Sanlam Sky's gross result from financial services increased by 10%, reflecting 
the increase in the size of the in-force book. Mortality experience improved in 2018, but was more than offset by a slight weakening in persistency experience and 
negative investment and other variances. 

The Recurring premium sub cluster's gross result from financial services grew by 8%. Excluding BrightRock, gross result from financial services was 15% higher 
than 2017. BrightRock is experiencing very strong growth as a relatively young company, with new business strain exceeding profit releases from the in-force book. 
It therefore still contributes operating losses to the SPF earnings. Strong growth in risk profits (excluding BrightRock) was partially offset by 3% and 4% 
respective declines in the profit contributions of the Savings and Closed Book businesses. Risk profits benefited from the increased size of the in-force book, 
improved claims experience and flat new business strain following no growth in new business volumes from the traditional risk business channels (excluding BrightRock). 
Earnings from the Savings and Closed Book businesses were negatively affected by the weak investment market performance that depressed growth in assets under management, 
and declining units in the Closed Book.

Glacier's Life investments profit was severely impacted by the weak investment market performance as well as negative modelling and assumption changes. The Life 
investments portfolio includes products where Glacier participates in the absolute investment return earned on the underlying asset base. These products experienced 
marginal negative investment returns in 2018 compared to double digit positive returns in 2017, contributing to a R317 million decline in fee income. Weak investment 
returns and net outflows of guaranteed business also placed pressure on fee income from the other lines of savings business. The Linked Investment Savings Plan (LISP) 
business's profit increased by 9%. The weakening in the rand exchange rate and good demand for international products protected the overall assets under management 
of the LISP business from the weak South African equity market performance. Cost saving initiatives also had a positive effect.

Strategic business development (SBD) profits increased by 7%. Growth in the size of the Sanlam Personal Loans book supported 12% growth in the business's profit 
contribution. Bad debt provisioning increased in line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which was adopted with effect from 2018.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by 14%; up 21% excluding the increase in new business strain recognised in terms of the Group's prudent 
accounting policies. Excluding corporate activity, earnings were marginally up on 2017 (up 8% excluding increased new business strain). Gross of tax and 
non-controlling interest, result from financial services also increased by 14%. Changes in the rand exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the 
translated SEM earnings, apart from India as indicated below.

Gross result from financial services from the Pan-Africa portfolio increased by 14%:

- Namibia's gross result from financial services declined by 23%. Corporate activity resulted in Bank Windhoek changing from a subsidiary to an associated 
  company of Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH) in 2017. As a subsidiary, Bank Windhoek's gross earnings were included in the CIH gross result from
  financial services, with the Bank Windhoek non-controlling interest being recognised as a separate component in net result from financial services. As an
  associate, only CIH's effective stake in Bank Windhoek's earnings is recognised in gross result from financial services. Excluding this change in accounting
  treatment, as well as the additional new business strain in the life insurance business (refer below), gross result from financial services increased by 9%.

  Life insurance gross result from financial services declined by 22%, primarily due to a significant increase in new business strain emanating from the strong 
  growth in entry-level market new business volumes. Excluding this, operating earnings increased by 24%. Group life claims experience improved in the second 
  half of the year, with overall risk profit increasing on 2017. Fund withdrawals by the Government Institutions Pension Fund of R2 billion at the end of 2017 
  and a further R1 billion in 2018, combined with a weak equity market performance, depressed fee income and gross result from financial services of the asset 
  management business, with the latter declining by 10%. Santam Namibia struggled to grow its premium base under challenging operating conditions, with gross 
  written premiums declining by 5% and gross result from financial services declining by 17%. Earnings from credit business declined by 22% (up 7% excluding the
  impact of the change in accounting treatment of Bank Windhoek), with the relatively low growth reflecting the weak general operating environment in Namibia and 
  liquidity constraints within the banking sector.

- The Botswana operations achieved mixed results with an overall increase of 5% in gross result from financial services. Life insurance profit increased by 14%. 
  Annuities underperformed due to low new business volumes, but this was more than offset by good growth in the funeral, group credit life and term 
  assurance lines. Letshego's gross earnings were in line with 2017, the combined effect of limited growth in the size of the loan book, additional bad 
  debt provisions recognised in terms of IFRS 9 and some one-off expenses. A new business plan has been developed under the auspices of a new chief executive 
  to address the underperformance. The decline in the Botswana equity market placed pressure on the asset base and fee income of the investment management 
  business, which did well to increase its gross earnings by 1% despite the challenging conditions. Earnings contributions from the other Botswana businesses 
  were broadly in line with the prior year.

- The Rest of Africa gross result from financial services increased by 48%:
 
  - The Saham Finances contribution almost doubled, supported by corporate activity in 2018 and 2017. The table below provides an analysis of the Saham Finances 
    earnings on a 100% basis for both years, which eliminates the distortion caused by changes in shareholding at a Sanlam level. The average exchange rates used 
    for translation purposes were R/MAD 1.417 and R/MAD 1.388 for 2018 and 2017 respectively.

Key features for 2018:

- Gross written premiums increased by 4% (8% in local currency). Refer Business volumes section below for more information.

- Gross underwriting profit decreased by 9%, with life insurance earnings decreasing to a loss of R448 million (2017: loss of R419 million) due to 
  investments in growth, and general insurance earnings being in line with 2017. 

- The general insurance combined ratio amounted to 95.9% (2017: 94.4%). The following items impacted on the general insurance results:

  - One-off incentives of R28 million were paid to staff as part of the post-acquisition integration process.

  - General insurance claims experience weakened at Saham Maroc during the year, impacted by an increase in motor claims frequency and one-off fire claims in 
    the fourth quarter of 2018, which is traditionally a strong quarter for the Moroccan business.

  - Angola's loss declined from R40 million in 2017 to R29 million in 2018. An improvement in claims experience was partially offset by a higher cost base. 
    Exchange rate weakness contributed to higher expense inflation.

  - Lebanon also experienced a better claims environment, with a combined ratio of 88.2% in 2018 (2017: 91.2%). Underwriting profit increased by 107% as a
    result, despite the pressure on premium growth (refer Business volumes section below).

  - The other regions recorded lower earnings from direct insurance, primarily due to pressure on premium growth in Cote d'Ivoire.

  - Reinsurance profit increased by 11% from R232 million on 2017 to R257 million in 2018.

- Investment return earned on insurance funds declined by 45%. The underlying portfolios included legacy equity exposures, which benefited from positive 
  investment market returns in 2017, while most markets declined in 2018. The difference in relative market performance contributed R725 million to the 
  decline. The strategic asset allocation of these portfolios will be reassessed as part of the planned capital management activities following the 
  acquisition and Saham Finances becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary.  

Relative investment market returns and a number of one-off items impacted on the Saham Finances earnings for 2018. The table below provides an analysis of

A number of synergies have been identified during the acquisition phases. Good progress has already been made, with net synergies of USD1 million after tax 
and minorities realised in 2018, after allowing for integration costs.

- The other Rest of Africa operations had a disappointing year. Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe achieved strong growth, with their combined gross earnings 
  increasing by 66%. This was, however, more than offset by underperformance in other large regions and the impact of the Ghana disposal in 2017. Ghana contributed 
  R30 million to the 2017 gross earnings.

  - The Zambian health business experienced one-off losses of R32 million, which includes bad debt provisions in respect of amounts owing by the former 
    outsourced partner. The health business was transferred to Saham Finances in the latter part of 2018, who has a strong track record of managing this 
    line of business profitably in Africa. A turnaround in prospects is already evident. The Zambian life business also had a difficult year, with low new 
    business production and one-off costs relating to a cost reduction initiative contributing to a break-even position. Corrective actions have been implemented, 
    including the pending appointment of a new chief executive as well as increased distribution support from a SEM cluster level.

  - Gross result from financial services of the Malawian life business exceeded the 2018 budget, but still declined by 23% from a high base in 2017. Profitability 
    of the general insurance business was under pressure from high claims and expense experience.

  - The Tanzanian life business had a good year and grew its earnings contribution by 15%. This was, however, not sufficient to compensate for underperformance 
    in the general insurance business. Regulatory changes in the general insurance industry in Tanzania included a change to a ""no premium no cover"" regime. 
    This had a one-off impact on both current year production and terminations within the in-force book. Combined with weaker claims experience, it reduced the 
    2018 general insurance earnings by R36 million compared to 2017.

  - The Kenya operations recorded a 17% decrease to R25 million. The life insurance business gained traction and achieved strong growth. The asset management 
    business exceeded expectations for the year and more than doubled its contribution, partly assisted by the acquisition of a controlling stake in the former 
    Pinebridge investment management business during 2017. These good performances were, however, more than countered by one-off restructuring and administration 
    costs of some R20 million. A new group chief executive with in depth insurance experience has been appointed, augmenting the appointment of the new life 
    insurance chief executive in 2017. This substantially strengthens the management team and prospects of the business. Cluster level distribution support will 
    also be provided in 2019 to accelerate new business production.

Other emerging markets delivered 4% growth in gross result from financial services. 

- The Indian businesses had a solid year, increasing their gross result from financial services by 3% in rand terms (10% in local currency). Shriram Transport 
  Finance delivered growth of 14% in local currency, supported by good growth in its loan book. The Shriram City Union Finance loan book also grew by double 
  digits, but a decline in net interest margin limited its operating earnings growth to 9% in local currency. Liquidity constraints in the Indian market 
  increased funding costs for the business. Shriram General Insurance earnings grew by 13% in local currency, attributable to an improvement in underwriting 
  margin. Expansion costs incurred by the life insurance business were recognised as project expenses in the initial two years of the initiative to take 
  cognisance of the fact that the growing in-force book will take some time to reflect in higher earnings. Recognition of these costs within project expenses 
  was discontinued on 30 June 2018 and reallocated to gross result from financial services with effect from 1 July 2018, limiting growth in life insurance 
  operating earnings to 2% in local currency.

- The Malaysian operations achieved satisfactory growth in 2018. Life insurance profit increased by 23% (17% in local currency), benefiting from positive 
  investment variances and lower administration costs. A more diversified book of business contributed to an improvement in the general insurance claims experience, 
  with operating earnings from this line of business increasing by 12% (6% in local currency).

The 18% increase in tax on financial services income includes prior year tax adjustments in Botswana and Kenya.

The 3rd party Sanlam Investments gross result from financial services declined by 5% on 2017, attributable to a R47 million decrease in performance fees
from R58 million in 2017 to R11 million in 2018. This is due to a slight underperformance of some 0.3% in the larger portfolios, attributable to the severe
devaluation of properties in the first quarter of 2018 and underperformance in the emerging markets fund. Excluding performance fees, gross operating
earnings increased by 8%, a particularly satisfactory result given no growth in the average level of the South African equity market in 2018. Satrix
achieved meaningful earnings growth, with the positive impact of net fund inflows more than offsetting fee pressures in a highly competitive market. The
third party component of Sanlam Structured Solutions also had a good year, benefiting from a number of new structuring transactions. The other business
units experienced a decline in earnings in line with generally no growth in assets under management, but with administration costs increasing in line with
inflation.

Wealth Management gross result from financial services decreased by 16% (3% down excluding Summit Trust that was disposed of during 2017 and one-off
performance fees earned from a specific client arrangement in 2017). The 3% decline is substantially due to administration costs incurred in respect of
operational system upgrades.

The International business' gross results were positively impacted by Nucleus being consolidated after its listing (compared to equity-accounting as an
associate up to 30 June 2018), strong growth in assets under administration at the Ireland-based platform business due to third party inflows and increased
international allocation in the South African portfolios, and property development profits earned by Artisan. Excluding the change in accounting treatment
of Nucleus, gross results were up 12%.

Sanlam Specialised Finance did well to grow the profit contribution of the Sanlam Asset Manager and the related division of Sanlam Structured Solutions by
4% against the backdrop of weak equity markets. The Structured Solutions business earned higher structuring fee income and recognised its share in the
margin earned on the Sanlam Life bond that matured in August 2018. The proceeds from the Sanlam Life bonds are invested in a portfolio of matching assets,
with Structured Solutions sharing in the net margin earned over the period until maturity. The remainder of the operations were negatively impacted by
losses of some R40 million relating to equity-backed empowerment transactions following a decline in the underlying share prices and some R70 million in
respect of the non-recognition of income on the Mayfair collateralised loan. A prudent approach is followed in respect of the exposure during the winding
up of Mayfair Holdings and Mayfair Speculators.

Following a year of major catastrophe events in 2017, Santam experienced a relatively benign claims environment in 2018. Combined with acceptable growth in
net earned premiums, it contributed to a 37% increase in gross result from financial services (41% after tax and non-controlling interest). The
conventional insurance book achieved an underwriting margin of 9% in 2018 (6% in 2017), well in excess of its 4% to 8% target range. Profit from the motor
and property books, the largest lines of business, increased by 144%. This was driven by an absence of large catastrophe events and fewer large commercial
fires. The aggregate profit contribution from other insurance classes declined by 32%. Engineering and accident and health did well due to limited claims
activity. Liability business experienced a number of large claims, including the listeriosis outbreak early in 2018, while the Guarantee business
experienced losses in the difficult economic environment.

The management expense ratio increase compared to 2017, mainly due to increased variable incentive costs in 2018, increased direct acquisition costs to
support growth initiatives at MiWay, as well as additional underwriting risk management costs incurred to improve the loss ratio across all lines. A
provision was also raised to account for the liquidity concerns at a third-party collection agency that went into voluntary curatorship. The 16% increase
in gross result from financial services from the SEM investments reflect the benefit of the Saham Finances corporate activity. Excluding Saham Finances,
gross earnings from the SEM investments were in line with 2017 due to the weaker general insurance performance in the SEM Rest of Africa portfolio and
solid results from SGI in India (refer SEM section above).

Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services increased by 4% (3% on a gross basis), with the muted growth caused by ongoing high group risk claims
experience. This conceals an overall good operational performance. SEB earnings declined by 3% due to a R66 million (39%) decline in risk profits.
Mortality and disability claims experience weakened significantly in the second half of the year, which is likely to require further rerating of premiums
in 2019. The administration units turned profitable in 2018, a major achievement after many years of operating losses. The healthcare businesses reported
satisfactory double digit growth in gross earnings, while ACA made a first time contribution of R54 million, well in excess of the business plan. The new
corporate solutions team established in 2018 contributed to an increase in cluster costs from R7 million in 2017 to R32 million in 2018.

Normalised headline earnings

Normalised headline earnings of R9,1 billion are 8% down on 2017. This is the combined effect of the 4% increase in net result from financial services, a
57% decline in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio, a 53% (R139 million) increase in amortisation of intangible assets as well as an
increase in net project expenses from R114 million in 2017 to R136 million in 2018.

Net investment return was negatively impacted by:
- A decline in equity and fixed interest markets across most regions where the Group operates;
- Impairment of corporate credit exposures in Kenya of some R86 million; and
- Investment return lost on capital redeployed for strategic acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.

The amortisation of the value of business acquired intangible asset recognised upon the consolidation of Saham Finances contributed R117 million to the
R139 million increase in the amortisation charge.

Net project expenses include R56 million one-off expenses incurred by SIG on new data capabilities and platforms (including big data and advanced
analytics) (2017: R8 million), R22 million due diligence and related expenses in respect of the Saham Finances acquisition (2017: R8 million), Shriram Life
Insurance expansion cost of R8 million up to 30 June 2018 (2017: R26 million) and R44 million of SEM cluster level project-related expenses 
(2017: R42 million).

Normalised attributable earnings

Normalised attributable earnings increased by 5% from R11 billion in 2017 to R11.5 billion in 2018. The biggest contributors to profit on disposal of
subsidiaries and associates of R2.8 billion is the change in accounting treatment of Saham Finances (R1.8 billion) and Nucleus (R0.7 billion) from
associated companies to subsidiaries. In terms of IFRS, when an associated company becomes a subsidiary, the former investment in the associated company
must be derecognised as a deemed disposal at fair value, with the subsidiary being fully recognised as an acquisition at fair value. In essence, the profit
on disposal of the associate is reflected in higher intangible assets being recognised on acquisition date of the subsidiary. The 2017 comparative profit
on disposal of subsidiaries and associates comprised substantially of R1.2 billion realised on the disposal of the Enterprise Group in Ghana. Impairment
charges largely relate to the impairment of the investments in Letshego (R105 million) and CIH (R96 million). Letshego's operational performance did not
improve in 2018, requiring a further impairment of the investment. The CIH impairment follows the decline in the Bank Windhoek performance and share price
due to pressure in the Namibian banking sector.

Business volumes

New business volumes increased by 1% amidst pressure on investor confidence in South Africa and a high comparative base in Botswana. Life insurance new
business volumes increased by 21%, investment business inflows declined by 8% and general insurance earned premiums increased by 19%, with the latter in
particular benefiting from corporate activity. Net fund flows increased by 12%, with all clusters apart from SIG achieving sterling growth.

Sanlam Sky's new business increased by an exceptional 71% (83% excluding the savings business transferred to the SPF Savings business). The annual 
R566 million Capitec credit life new business recognised in the first half of the year was augmented by strong demand for the new Capitec funeral product,
which generated new business of R433 million. The traditional individual life intermediary channel continued on its growth path, growing new business sales
by 13%. Safrican's performance improved in the second half of the year, achieving 9% growth for the full year.

New business volumes in the Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic Business Development increased by 20%. Risk business sales increased by 51%. Strong
organic growth at BrightRock was augmented by the structural impact of the acquisition concluded during the course of 2017. Excluding BrightRock, new risk
business sales were up 3%, with MiWayLife providing the growth. Savings and personal loans credit life sales increased by 10%, with strong demand for
retirement annuities partially offset by lower traditional endowment sales.

Glacier new business grew marginally by 1%. Primary sales onto the LISP platform improved by 5%, an acceptable result given the pressure on investor
confidence in the mass affluent market. Secondary sales into Glacier funds declined by 4% - wrap inflows were down 7% as conversions of platform assets
slowed, but with good demand for global stock feeder funds and the artificial intelligence fund providing some relief. Life investments sales experienced
an overall decline of 1% with a significant change in mix of business from endowments to guaranteed plans and life annuities.

The BrightRock contribution and good sales of single premium LISP business supported an overall 22% rise in SPF's net fund inflows.

Namibia did exceptionally well to increase new business volumes by 22% despite weak economic conditions. Both life and investment new business grew
strongly. Within the life insurance segment, the mix of business changed to the more profitable entry-level market.

The main detractor from new business growth in the Botswana business was the investment line of business, which declined by 24%. This line of business is
historically more volatile in nature. Life insurance new business volumes declined by 3%, with lower funeral and annuity sales offsetting good growth in
group life business.

The 68% new business growth in the Rest of Africa portfolio is largely due to corporate activity relating to Saham Finances.

- The Saham Finances growth of 124% was supported by corporate activity. On a 100% basis, gross written premiums increased by 4% (8% in local currency) 
  (life insurance up 8%, general insurance up 3% and reinsurance up 1%) and net earned premiums by 9%.
    - Morocco achieved 10% growth in gross written premiums, an acceptable performance in a competitive market. Renewals of contracts with national banks
      supported 11% growth in Saham Assistance gross written premiums.
    - Saham Angola gross written premiums decreased by 31%, entirely attributable to a weaker Kwanza exchange rate. In local currency, the business continued to
      deliver good growth. All lines of business achieved double digit growth rates.
    - The Lebanese insurance market contracted by 3% in 2018, reflective of the weak economic environment. The Saham Finances business did well to limit its
      decline to only 1.5%, half of the industry average. The motor class had a particularly difficult year as a slowdown in retail credit extension depressed
      vehicle sales.
    - The CIMA region experienced competitive pressures in the motor market and lower demand for fire insurance from exploration companies. This contributed to
      growth of only 4% in general insurance gross written premiums from the other Saham Finances regions. Life and health insurance provided some support, with
      overall growth of 7% across all lines of business.
    - Reinsurance premiums were broadly in line with 2017.
- The remainder of the Rest of Africa portfolio (excluding the Ghana disposal) increased by 8%. Kenya, Malawi and Rwanda underperformed, with strong growth
  in the other regions. The areas of underperformance are receiving attention, through a combination of management changes and cluster level distribution
  support.

The Indian insurance businesses continued to perform well, achieving double digit growth in both life and general insurance. Within the life insurance
business, group single premiums from the credit businesses' client bases did particularly well.

The Malaysian businesses are finding some traction after a period of underperformance, increasing their overall new business contribution by 3%. New
business production is not yet meeting expectations, but the mix of business improved at both businesses.

Net fund flows increased threefold, with most regions contributing to the strong growth.

Low investor confidence had a pronounced effect on SIG's new business volumes, which declined by 13%. The international businesses attracted strong new
inflows (up 57%), but this was more than offset by declines in South Africa across all business units. Institutional new inflows remained weak for the 
full year, while retail inflows also slowed down significantly after a more positive start to the year. A number of strategic initiatives aimed at gaining
market share are being implemented, including closer cooperation with Glacier and the package of BBBEE transactions approved by shareholders in 
December 2018. Improved investor confidence will, however, remain a key determinant of future growth. Lower new business volumes, coupled with an 
R8.5 billion withdrawal of a low margin index tracking fund managed for an institutional client on an outsourced basis, contributed to a 61% reduction 
in net fund flows from R18.7 billion in 2017 to R7.2 billion in 2018.

Gross written premiums at Santam increased by 11% (9.5% excluding the impact of the Santam Structured Insurance acquisition in 2017); 6% on a net earned
basis. Conventional insurance gross written premiums increased by a satisfactory 7%, while alternative risk transfer premiums grew by 40% (26% excluding
corporate activity). Intermediated personal and commercial lines of business, MiWay and Namibia experienced pressure on growth amidst difficult economic
conditions. The property class grew by 12% following strong growth in the corporate property market due to reinsurance capacity constraints. The motor
class grew by 6%, with an 8% higher contribution from MiWay. Within the specialist classes, accident and health grew by 11% on the back of strong demand
for travel insurance. Crop insurance premiums declined by 12% following lower take-up. The liability and transportation classes recorded growth of 2% and
1% respectively amidst a focus on profitability. Growth of 3% in engineering reflects the impact of fewer large construction contracts within an industry
under pressure.

Sanlam Corporate had an exceptional year, more than doubling life insurance new business volumes. Single premiums grew by 109%, while recurring premiums
increased by a particularly satisfactory 56%. Life licence business has been reclassified from SIG to Sanlam Corporate in 2018, which supported overall 
new business growth of 176%. The new business performance also reflects a substantial improvement in net fund inflows.

Overall Group net fund inflows of R41.5 billion in 2018 is a particularly satisfactory performance given the challenging market conditions and large
institutional withdrawal at SIG.

Value of new covered business

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 50bps and 60bps increase in the South African nine- and five-
year benchmark rates respectively during 2018 resulted in a commensurate rise in the risk discount rate, with a 6% negative effect on overall VNB growth.
VNB margins were also some 13 basis points lower due to the higher discount rate. The strong growth in Sanlam Sky and SEB new business volumes were the
main contributors to particularly satisfactory growth of 14% in net VNB on a consistent economic basis (CEB) (8% based on the actual economic basis at the
end of 2018). Overall net VNB margins declined from 2.94% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018 (on a CEB), largely due to the underperformance in East Africa and a
relatively larger contribution from the lower margin SEB business.

SPF achieved overall growth of 7% (14% on a comparable basis). The strong growth in new business volumes at Sanlam Sky had a major positive effect on VNB,
which increased by 16% (25% on a comparable basis). Capitec contributed R80 million. The Sanlam Sky VNB margin declined slightly from 8.88% in 2017 to
8.30% in 2018 due to a change in mix of business to lower margin group business. The Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic Business Development
achieved growth of 13% (23% on a CEB, and 20% on an CEB and excluding BrightRock). MiWayLife made a welcome first contribution of R11 million, augmented by
good growth at BrightRock, a change in mix to more profitable lines of business, positive modelling changes and lower acquisition costs. VNB margins
improved commensurately. Glacier experienced an 8% decline in VNB (6% on a comparable basis) due to the change in mix from higher margin endowment business
to guaranteed and annuity business.

Net VNB at SEM declined by 3% (up 6% on a CEB and excluding Ghana and Saham Finances). Namibia did exceptional well pursuant to the strong growth in
entry-level market sales, growing its net VNB by more than 20%. Most other businesses contributed satisfactory growth, apart from Botswana, Kenya, Uganda
and Malawi that underperformed in line with their weak new business production and declining file sizes. Nigeria's contribution was broadly in line with
2017 despite strong new business growth, due to a one-off regulatory increase in capital requirements that resulted in a higher cost of capital charge.
Saham Finances contributed R38 million compared to R20 million in 2017.

The good growth in Sanlam Corporate recurring and single premium business, combined with modelling improvements, supported a 64% (71% on a comparable
basis) increase in the cluster's VNB contribution.

Capital management

The Group started the year with discretionary capital of R2 billion, after allowing for the ACA acquisition. A number of capital management actions during
2018 affected the balance of available discretionary capital, including the $1 billion (R13 billion) Saham Finances transaction. Discretionary capital at
the end of 2018 was negative due to the approved BBBEE share issuance not being concluded before year-end as we are still awaiting regulatory approvals.

Sanlam shareholders approved a BBBEE equity raising at the extraordinary general meeting held on 12 December 2018, with the cash raised from this issuance
earmarked to repay the internal (R1.7 billion) and external (R2 billion) debt incurred as partial funding for the Saham Finances acquisition and to restore
the discretionary capital portfolio to an appropriate level. All regulatory approvals have been received, apart from Mauritius. [Once these approvals are
granted, we will proceed with the issuance, subject to the Sanlam share price being within the R74 - R86 range approved by shareholders.]
Discretionary capital amounted to a negative R3.7 billion at 31 December 2018, equal to the combined internal and external debt. Cash proceeds of 
R4.6 billion will be raised at the lower end of the share issuance range (R74), which will restore the discretionary capital portfolio to some R1 billion.

Movements in discretionary capital during 2018 included the following:

- The excess cash operating earnings cover in respect of the dividend paid in 2018.
- Capital of R1.8 billion released from the covered business operations in Sanlam Life. As communicated in the Group's 2017 annual results announcement,
  capital allocated to the covered business operations on the Sanlam Life balance sheet was reduced by R1.5 billion in the first half of 2018. Investment
  return earned on the Sanlam Life capital base in 2018 (R313 million) was also available for release.
- Capital of R5.5 billion was raised through an accelerated book build at the end of March 2018 as partial funding for the acquisition of the remaining stake
  in Saham Finances.
- Corporate activity during 2018 included:
  - The acquisition of the remaining 53% stake in Saham Finances for R12.9 billion at the hedged rate of R13.24 (after allowing for Santam's contribution to
    increase its effective stake in Saham Finances from 7% to 10%). The actual exchange rate on payment date was R14.77, with the forex hedges providing
    protection of some R1.5 billion on close-out.
  - SIG acquired 69% and 100% stakes in Catalyst Fund Managers' South African and foreign operations respectively for a total consideration of R418 million.
    The acquisition significantly enhances SIG's property management offering in line with the strategic investment in alternative asset management
    capabilities. In line with this strategy, SIG also invested R102 million for a 30% stake in Phoenix Infraworks, a specialist infrastructure investment
    business.
  - Sanlam Private Wealth acquired a wealth management book for R96 million.
  - SEM sold a stake in the Kenyan-based Sanlam Investments East Africa asset management business to its local partner, realising R101 million. This disposal
    compliments SEM's Pan-Africa partnership model.
- Investment return, taxation on the forex hedges and other small movements utilised R104 million.

Solvency

All of the major life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of December 2018. The Sanlam Group SCR cover ratio of
215% remained largely in line with the 218% cover at 31 December 2017. As indicated in previous results announcements, a Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)
target cover range of between 170% and 210% has been set for Sanlam Life Insurance Limited's (Sanlam Life) covered business. The R8 billion of IFRS-based
required capital allocated to these operations at the end of December 2018 translated into a SCR cover of 221%. The SCR cover ratio for the Sanlam Life
entity as a whole at 264% exceeded the covered business ratio at the end of December 2018 due to the inclusion of discretionary and other capital held on
the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as investments in Santam and other Group operations that are not allocated to Sanlam Life's covered business
operations (i.e. not included in the R8 billion allocated capital referred to above).

Dividend

Applying the Group's dividend policy, the Board decided to increase the normal dividend per share by 7.6% to 312 cents. This is well within our target
range of 2% to 4% real growth given the 2018 average inflation rate of 4.6%. It will maintain a cash operating earnings cover of approximately 1.05 times.

The South African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect of this dividend. The dividend will in full be subject to the 20% withholding tax,
where applicable, which will result in a net final dividend, to the shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 249.6 cents per share. 
The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share capital as at the date of the declaration is 2 070 079 299 excluding treasury shares of 
161 909 748 at 31 December 2018. The company's tax reference number is 9536/346/84/5.

Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 312 cents for the year ended 31 December 2018 is payable on Monday, 15 April 2019 by way of
electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 12 April 2019. The last date to trade
to qualify for this dividend will be Tuesday, 9 April 2019, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 10 April 2019. Share certificates may
not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 10 April 2019 and Friday, 12 April 2019, both days included.

Summarised financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018

Accounting policies and basis of presentation 

Basis of presentation

Introduction
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical-cost basis, unless otherwise indicated, in accordance with The JSE Listings Requirements,
the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), SAICA Financial Reporting Guides
as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council , the information required by 
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the requirements of the Companies Act , No. 71 of 2008 (as amended), in South Africa. The financial statements are 
presented in South African rand rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.

The following new or revised IFRS and interpretations became effective in the current financial year and have therefore been applied:

- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)

The following new or revised IFRS and interpretations have effective dates applicable to future financial years and have not been early adopted:

- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRS 17- Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2022)

IFRS 16: Leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17: Leases for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The group
does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date. IFRS 16 has one model for lessees which will result in almost all leases being included on
the statement of financial position. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and the liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. In addition, the nature of expenses related to those leases will now change as IFRS 16 replaces
the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. The accounting for 
lessors will not significantly change.

As lessor: This new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on how the group (as lessor) accounts for leases due to the carry forward of the
lessor accounting model from IAS 17. However, the group anticipates an impact as a result of the enhanced disclosures for lessors required by IFRS 16
namely: components of lease income and risk management with respect to exposure to residual asset risk.

As lessee: The standard will affect primarily the accounting of the group's operating leases.  As at the reporting date, the group has non-cancellable
operating lease commitments of R2 765 million. However, the group has not yet determined to what extent these commitments will result in recognition of an
asset and a liability for future payments and how this affects the group's profit and classification of cash flows.

Some of the commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value assets and some commitments may relate to arrangements that will not
qualify as leases under IFRS 16.

As lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a:
- Retrospective approach; or
- Modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.

The lessee applies the election consistently to all of its leases. The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore,
the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with no
restatement of comparative information.

When applying the modified retrospective approach the leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease-by-
lease basis, whether to apply a number of practical expedients on transition. The Group is assessing the potential impact of using these practical
expedients.

The Group is not required to make any adjustments for any leases in which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.

IFRIC 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments was issued in June 2017. The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax
treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12. Initial work performed, indicates that there will be limited impact on the financial
statements as a result of this standard interpretation.

IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017. The standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. Initial work performed on the impact of IFRS 17 indicates that there will be a significant impact
on the underlying valuation models, systems and processes. The Group is in the process of assessing the requirements of the standard against current data,
processes and valuation models and is expected to finalise this assessment during 2019.

Other: The Group does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Group.

3. Normalised earnings per share

In terms of IFRS, a consolidation reserve is created for differences in the valuation bases of long-term policy liabilities and assets supporting those
liabilities. Certain investments held in policyholder portfolios may not be recognised at fair value in terms of IFRS, whereas the valuation of the related
policy liabilities is based on the assets at fair value. Similarly, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of assessed tax losses in policyholder funds
increases the Group's net assets without a corresponding increase in policy liabilities. These create mismatches with a corresponding impact on the
shareholders' fund. A separate reserve is created for these valuation differences owing to the fact that they represent accounting differences and not
economic gains or losses for the shareholders' fund.  The number of shares in issue must also be reduced with the treasury shares held by the
policyholders' fund for the calculation of IFRS basic and diluted earnings per share.  This is, in management's view, not a true representation of the
earnings attributable to the Group's shareholders, specifically in instances where the share prices and/or the number of shares held by the policyholders'
fund varies significantly. The Group therefore calculates normalised earnings per share to eliminate these impacts.

and liabilities.

Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique
based on assumptions that are supported by prices from observable current market transactions are categorised as level 2.

Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments
The principles with regards to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities,measuring impairment allowances for 
financial assets, and hedge accounting have been amended due to the implementation of the new accounting standard, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments,
applicable to all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Sanlam has implemented the standard, other than the hedging provisions
which have not yet been adopted, on a modified retrospective basis and therefore comparatives are not restated and the impact of the adoption is
recognised in equity on 1 January 2018.

The key changes introduced by IFRS 9 are as follows:
1. Classification and measurement - financial assets are required to be measured and classified based on the cash flow characteristics of the 
   instrument and the business model under which the asset is managed. The classification and measurement of financial liabilities is largely 
   unchanged, with the exception of the amendment requiring that the own credit risk component of fair value movements on liabilities designated
   at fair value through profit or loss now be presented in other comprehensive income.
2. Impairment - IFRS 9 introduces an expected credit loss model. This entails the recognition of an allowance for expected credit loss looking 
   one year into the future or over the lifetime of the financial asset if the credit risk relating to the financial asset has increased 
   significantly. The impairment model is therefore ""forward looking"", replacing the incurred loss model as previously required by IAS 39.
  
The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a reduction in total equity of R441 million on 1 January 2018. The impact is primarily a result of the 
recognition of expected credit losses in associated entities as well as isolated incidents of changes in the classification and measurement of 
certain financial instruments.

The majority of financial assets were measured at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39, and continue to be under IFRS 9, either 
because they are mandatorily measured as such, or through designation.

The changes in classification and measurement are as follows:
- Certain financial assets, predominantly interest bearing investments, previously measured at amortised cost under IAS 39, have been reclassified
  to fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9. The remeasurement impact on opening retained earnings is an increase of R6 million.
- The change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or 
  loss is presented in other comprehensive income under IFRS 9. In the current period, this portion of the movement in such instruments was immaterial.

Impairment of financial assets
Based on the impairment methodology described above, the Group has determined that the application of IFRS 9's impairment requirements at 1 January 2018
results in additional impairment allowances in a number if equity-accounted associates.

The total impact on the balance of associates and opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 is negative R428 million. The impact of applying the
expected credit losses model in subsidiary entities resulted in a decrease in net asset value of R19 million.

IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
This standard relates to the measurement, classification and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers of the Sanlam Group. 

The key factors in the application of IFRS 15 are as follows:
- A five-step model is applied to determine when to recognise revenue from contracts with customers, and at what amount.
- Revenue is recognised when (or as) Sanlam satisfies a performance obligation and transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the
  amount to which the company expects to be entitled and that is allocated to that specific performance obligation.
- Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time, as or when control of the goods or 
  services is transferred to the customer.
- More extensive and detailed disclosure are required in terms of IFRS 15.

The Group has assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on opening retained earnings and concluded that there is no quantitative impact for Sanlam. 

8.2   Restatement of Group cash flow statement

Management reassessed the presentation of the Group's cash flow statement in respect of cash flows relating to the acquisition and disposal 
of investments that are backing its core operations. These were previously classified as investing cash flows and created a disconnect between 
operating and investing cash flows, as these investments are funded by cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment 
contracts, which are treated as operating cash flows. Management concluded that presenting acquisitions and disposals of investments as part of 
operating cash flows more accurately reflects to the users of the financial statements, the link between the ability to generate cash from 
investment and insurance contracts and the utilisation of those cash flows on various investments. 

                                                                                        2017

Operational Update – December 2018

The Group made significant strategic progress in the four months since the end of June up to the
end of October 2018. During this period, we concluded the largest transaction in Sanlam’s history
by finalising the acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances. This transaction creates
a unique footprint and competitive advantage for Sanlam across the African continent to drive
future growth. It also simultaneously afforded us the opportunity to utilise the need to raise equity
funding for the acquisition to propose a package of Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment
(B-BBEE) transactions to Sanlam shareholders. The proposed B-BBEE transactions will position
us well to gain market share in those areas of the South African market where we do not have a
leading position and where enhanced empowerment credentials create a strategic advantage,
including third party asset management, employee benefits, health and the entry-level market
segment. These transactions remain subject to approval by Sanlam’s shareholders.

The Group clusters continued to execute their operational strategies and delivered an overall
resilient performance for the 10 months ended 31 October 2018. This is a pleasing result in the
context of weak economic conditions in a number of our territories, including South Africa our
largest market, and significant volatility in global investment and currency markets. The South
African equity market had a particularly weak month in October.

Sanlam’s 2018 centenary year reflects the core competencies of the Group: being able to deliver
shareholder value under challenging conditions while at the same time executing future growth
strategies. This is founded in our diversified profile as well as a federal management model that
supports dual focus on operational and strategic delivery.

The Saham Finances integration is progressing well. The Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM)
management structure is being aligned to a new line of business focus to support the expanded
cluster and to deliver on the strategic opportunities identified as part of the acquisition. Activities
in pursuit of unlocking the synergies embedded in the business case have already commenced.

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2018 are:

•         New business volumes of R188 billion, up 3% on the first 10 months of the 2017 financial
          year with major trends remaining in line with the first-half 2018 performance.

      o    Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) achieved overall new business sales growth of 7%. The
           recurring premium sub cluster continued to deliver strong growth in excess of 20% (7%
           excluding the structural contribution of the BrightRock acquisition). Solid growth in
           retirement annuities and tax free savings solutions in the savings business was partly
           offset by a flat performance from individual life risk business (excluding BrightRock).

           Sanlam Sky grew its new business volumes by some 80%, supported by the Capitec
           credit life business written in the first half of the year and strong demand for the Capitec
           funeral product. Excluding Capitec and the impact of the biennial renewal of the Zionist
           Christian Church scheme that occurred in 2017, Sanlam Sky sales increased by 10%.
           Individual life recurring premium business (excluding Capitec) increased by 14%.
           Safrican’s performance improved since the end of June 2018, but with new business sales
           remaining lower than the high comparative base in 2017.

           Glacier increased its new business contribution by 4% on the first 10 months of 2017.
           Growth of 8% in primary LISP sales was suppressed by marginally lower secondary sales
           into wrap funds and 1% growth in traditional life investment sales. The change in mix of
           business to less profitable lines of business experienced in the first half of 2018 persisted.

      o    SEM recorded overall new business growth of 14%, including the impact of structural
           activity (Saham Finances, Sanlam Investments East Africa and the Ghana disposal) in
           2017. In constant currency and excluding structural activity, new business volumes
           increased by 17%.

           Despite the difficult economic conditions in Namibia, new business volumes in this region
           increased by more than 20%, with strong contributions from both life and investment
           business. The more profitable entry-level market segment, in particular, continued to
           perform well.

           A recovery in annuity market share in Botswana was offset by lower individual life risk and
           investment business sales from a high base in 2017, contributing to an overall decline of
           20% in new business volumes. This did not impact on growth in VNB, due to the change
           in mix to the more profitable annuity line of business.

                                                                                               
        Rest of Africa new business volumes increased by 46% (24% in constant currency and
        excluding structural activity). Most regions and lines of business contributed to the growth
        in constant currency, apart from Kenya, Malawi life business and Tanzania general
        insurance business. This is in line with the trends reported in the Group’s interim results
        for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Saham Finances’ new business production
        remained in line with expectations.

        The Indian operations delivered growth of 5% (11% in constant currency) with solid growth
        in both the life and general insurance businesses in constant currency. The Malaysian life
        insurance business continued with its turnaround and achieved double digit growth in new
        business sales. The Malaysian general insurance business improved its mix of business,
        but with overall new business sales still marginally lower than the comparable period in
        2017. Overall, Malaysian new business sales increased by 6% (down 1% in constant
        currency).

    o   New business volumes at Sanlam Investments Group (SIG) declined by 10%. The
        international businesses did well and attracted 43% higher new mandates in 2018. This
        was offset by lower volumes at the South African wealth and asset management
        businesses, reflecting the difficult operating environment.

    o   As reported in the Group’s 2018 interim results announcement, Sanlam Employee
        Benefits (SEB) attracted large new mandates subsequent to the end of June 2018. New
        life business volumes more than doubled as a result.

    o   Net value of new life business (VNB) increased by 7% (up 12% excluding structural
        activity and on a constant economic and currency basis). VNB margins have been largely
        maintained on a per product basis. Double digit growth was achieved across most regions
        on a constant economic and currency basis, including South Africa where strong growth
        at Sanlam Sky and SEB supported the results. Detracting from the overall performance
        were Kenya and Malawi, where the underperformance in life new business had a major
        negative impact on VNB.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R36.2 billion were 5% higher than the R34.6 billion achieved
        in the comparable 10-month period in 2017. All clusters contributed strong growth, apart
        from SIG that was impacted by an R8.5 billion withdrawal of lower margin passive
        mandates managed on behalf of an institutional client.

    o   Persistency experience trends remained in line with the first half of 2018.

•   Net result from financial services increased by 2% on the first 10 months of the 2017 financial
    year (3% in constant currency and excluding structural activity).

    o   Sanlam Personal Finance’s net result from financial services declined by 5%. This is
        largely due to increased new business strain, the structural impact of the BrightRock
        acquisition and a reduced impact from modelling and assumptions changes. Excluding
        these, Sanlam Personal Finance achieved net operating profit growth of 5% on the first
        10 months of 2017, an acceptable performance in the context of the weak investment
        market performance that impacted on fund-based fee income.

    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net result from financial services increased by 4% (3% in
        constant currency and excluding structural activity). Saham Finances, Nigeria, Rwanda
        and Uganda delivered strong organic growth. Detracting from the results were: higher new
        business strain in Namibia following the strong growth in entry-level market sales, weaker
        group life claims experience in Namibia and Botswana, prior year tax corrections at

                                                                                         
        Letshego and underperformances in Kenya, Zambia and the Tanzania general insurance
        business.

    o   Sanlam Investments’ contribution to net result from financial services decreased by 2%,
        attributable to lower performance fees and the negative impact of the weak equity market
        performance on growth in assets under management.

    o   Santam continued to benefit from a benign claims environment, with its underwriting
        margin for the first 10 months of 2018 slightly above the upper end of its 4% to 8% target
        range.

    o   SEB experienced a weakening in mortality and disability claims experience since the end
        of June, contributing to a marginal decline in Sanlam Corporate’s net result from financial
        services. All other lines of business achieved growth.

•   Normalised headline earnings declined by 10%, attributable to a 55% decline in net
    investment return. The JSE/FTSE Swix Index recorded a negative return of 16% in the first
    10 months of 2018, compared to a positive performance of 15% in the comparable period in
    2017. The equity hedges in the Sanlam capital portfolios protected the Group from negative
    investment returns, in particular during October 2018 when the South African equity market
    experienced a significant decline. The JSE/FTSE Swix Index declined by 6% during the
    month.

•   Diluted headline earnings per share, which include fund transfers recognised in respect of
    Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, declined by 10%.


Capital

The Group’s operations remain well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio amounted to 2.4 times on 30 September 2018 (Sanlam Life
Insurance Limited: 3 times).

The Group had excess capital of some R10 billion available for redeployment at the end of June
2018. This has been fully utilised as partial payment for the Saham Finances acquisition referred
to above. The proceeds from the proposed B-BBEE transactions, which include an equity
issuance, will be utilised to settle the short-term debt incurred as partial funding for the Saham
Finances transaction and to restore the discretionary capital portfolio to an appropriate level. The
proposed B-BBEE transactions are subject to, among others, shareholder approval at an
extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 12 December 2018.

Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain subdued in our largest
markets for the remainder of 2018. Investment market and currency volatility are also expected
to persist. We commensurately do not foresee any significant improvement in the operational
trends experienced in the first 10 months of 2018.

Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and the level
of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net result
from financial services, normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for
the full 2018 financial year.

external auditors. Sanlam’s annual financial results for the year ending 31 December 2018 are

POSITIONING THE SOUTH AFRICAN OPERATIONS FOR GROWTH THROUGH ENHANCED
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT


1. INTRODUCTION


    Sanlam is pleased to announce to its shareholders (""Shareholders"") that it has reached agreement
    in respect of a series of agreements, as detailed below, that would significantly strengthen its South
    African operations and position the Company for future growth through enhancing its economic
    empowerment credentials.

    The Company:

    •   has entered into an agreement pursuant to which it will, subject to the fulfilment of certain
        suspensive conditions, issue 111 349 000 new Sanlam ordinary shares (""Sanlam Shares"")
        constituting 5% of the Sanlam ordinary share capital net of Treasury Shares (as defined in
        paragraph 9 below) (""Subscription Shares"") to an entity held by new and existing broad based
        black economic empowerment (""B-BBEE"") shareholders (""Subscription SPV"") to substantially
        broaden the base of Sanlam’s empowerment beneficiaries and has entered into a binding term
        sheet pursuant to which it will, subject to the fulfilment of certain suspensive conditions, provide
        financial assistance in connection with the subscription for the Subscription Shares (together
        the ""B-BBEE Transaction""); and
    •   as a separate transaction to the B-BBEE Transaction, has entered into a binding term sheet
        pursuant to which it will, subject to the fulfilment of certain suspensive conditions, grant a
        R2 000 000 000 (two billion Rand) facility to Ubuntu-Botho or a wholly owned subsidiary of
        Ubuntu-Botho (""Ubuntu-Botho Issuer"") (""Ubuntu-Botho Facility"") enabling Ubuntu-Botho to
        invest in certain Sanlam subsidiaries as part of Sanlam’s South African strategy to enhance
        Sanlam’s empowerment at an operational (business unit) level and also to invest in financial
        services businesses that are complementary to Sanlam’s strategy.


    Collectively the B-BBEE Transaction and the Ubuntu-Botho Facility are referred to as the
    ""Proposed Transactions"" and the agreements to give effect to the Proposed Transactions are
    referred to as the ""Transaction Agreements"".

                                                                                                         
Sanlam, as a successful diversified pan-African financial services player, has a strong track record
of value creation for all its Shareholders and other stakeholders. Sanlam’s leading pan-African
position was strengthened with the recent successful conclusion of the SAHAM Finances
transaction. Notwithstanding, Sanlam still generates some 70% of its Net Result from Financial
Services from South Africa, and this large South-African contribution is expected to continue for the
foreseeable future. The Proposed Transactions will support Sanlam to grow and consolidate its
position in this important market, whilst also building on the Sanlam philosophy of mutually
beneficial partnerships in pursuit of shareholder value creation.


The International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") cost relating to the Proposed
Transactions as illustrated in the pro-forma IFRS financial effects in paragraph 9
of this announcement represents a cost of 0.9% of the Company’s market
capitalisation. Based on the Group’s assessment of the economic cost of the Proposed
Transactions rather than IFRS cost, the Proposed Transactions represent a cost of 0.6% of its
market capitalisation. This is considered to be at the lower end of the range of comparable B-BBEE
transactions, with most of the comparable transactions focused only on increasing shareholding at
a Company level. The Proposed Transactions have a wider reach by also introducing strategic B-
BBEE stakes at an operational/business unit level. The Board believes that strengthening the
Group’s empowerment credentials on a Company and subsidiary level will, over time, yield
economic benefits that will outweigh the costs of the Proposed Transactions, ensuring sustainable
value creation for shareholders.


The proceeds from the B-BBEE Transaction will be used to redeem the short-term debt facilities
incurred as partial funding to acquire the 53.37% SAHAM Finances shareholding, enabling Sanlam
to retain its balance sheet flexibility and strength, in line with its prudent balance sheet management
strategy.


From a rating agency point of view, based on Sanlam management’s current projections, the
Proposed Transactions will not have a negative impact on Sanlam’s solvency position or credit
rating. The dividend cover ratio will also remain within the policy range of 1.0x – 1.2x, supporting
dividend growth in line with the 2% - 4% real growth communicated to the market.


This announcement sets out the rationale and the salient terms of the Proposed Transactions,
including the suspensive conditions, effective date, related party considerations, board opinion and
recommendations as well as the pro forma financial effects.


                                                                                                     
2. RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS


  Re-enforcing Sanlam’s South African operations


  Sanlam, as a successful diversified pan-African financial services player, has a strong track record
  of value creation for all its Shareholders and other stakeholders and is consistently looking for ways
  to strengthen its market share in South Africa in areas where it is considered underweight relative
  to its main competitors, including third party asset management, health administration, employee
  benefits and the growing entry level market.


  In South Africa, where inclusive economic participation and wealth creation remains a challenge,
  public interest and commentary on B-BBEE continues to feature strongly with the need to facilitate
  more citizens’ access to economic activity and participation in wealth creation, which will be a
  fundamental factor in driving higher and sustained economic growth. The South African financial
  services client base, in particular institutional clients, require participants in the industry to contribute
  to inclusive wealth creation in a number of ways, including direct B-BBEE ownership. The level of
  empowerment, both at listed company level as well as the subsidiary with whom they transact, is
  an important consideration for institutional clients in awarding business mandates. Contributions in
  excess of the requirements of the Financial Sector Charter (""FSC"") are becoming increasingly more
  important. As a result, it is in Sanlam’s business and commercial interest to transform in line with
  the needs and preferences of its current and potential clients, key to this is that it is seen to continue
  contributing to economic transformation and inclusive wealth creation.


  Transformation in South Africa is defined broadly to include, among others: economic
  transformation to reduce wealth inequality; transforming our staff to reflect the demographic profile
  of our client base and societies where we operate; transforming our distribution channels and
  operations in line with technological and regulatory developments; and most importantly,
  transforming everything we do in line with the changing needs and preferences of our clients.


  Sanlam’s empowerment strategy is based on protecting and enhancing the Group’s leadership
  position in South Africa through inter alia a leading empowerment status and appropriate mutually
  beneficial partnerships and is also focused on improving black employment equity, building mutually
  beneficial partnerships with black owned companies and enhancing black management control,
  access to financial services and black enterprise development. This ensures a holistic approach to
  transformation in pursuit of sustainable wealth creation, enhanced economic growth, a more
  supportive South African business environment and positioning Sanlam favourably from a
  competitive perspective.


  The Proposed Transactions are a deliberate strategic move to enhance the Group’s empowerment
  status and strategic partnerships, both at Group level as well as specific operational business unit
  level, in support of long term value creation for all stakeholders. Achieving a clear leadership                                                                                                    
  position in empowerment by leveraging Sanlam’s partnership business model will position the
  Group well in its efforts to gain profitable market share in the identified strategic areas to the benefit
  of shareholders.

On completion of the B-BBEE Transaction, Sanlam will be a Level 1 Contributor with a black
economic ownership level (combined direct and indirect), as measured in terms of the FSC, in
excess of 35% and a direct black economic ownership level, as measured in terms of the FSC, of
over 18%. This would place Sanlam in a strong, market leading position in terms of empowerment.


Enhancing Broad Based participation at a group level


The B-BBEE Transaction will extend the benefits of empowerment to include a broad range of
participants, with 80% of the beneficiaries of the B-BBEE Transaction being new broad-based black
empowerment participants in the following categories, which have been identified by Sanlam and
Ubuntu-Botho:
    •   Professional black women;
    •   Rural and urban poor black women groups;
    •   Black youth and black youth groups;
    •   Black business partners and broad based black groups (including community organisations
        and black business partners of Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho); and
    •   Employees of the Sanlam Group.


The 80% participation in the B-BBEE Transaction will be held via a trust to be created for the
ultimate benefit of broad based black economic empowerment participants (the ""Master Trust"").
Each category of beneficiary will have its own trust which will be entitled to 20% of the benefits
received by the Master Trust, and will be created by the trustees of the Master Trust, on the same
terms, mutatis mutandis, as the Master Trust Deed, as soon as practically possible after the
implementation of the B-BBEE Transaction (the ""Beneficiary Trust(s)"").


Ubuntu-Botho, as the anchor empowerment shareholder in Sanlam, has a substantial interest in
ensuring that the B-BBEE Transaction and its composition, benefit and advance Sanlam's long-
term business and commercial interests. Ubuntu-Botho will take the lead and control of the process
of selecting the participants and beneficiaries of the Beneficiary Trusts. Sanlam will also propose
empowerment participants and beneficiaries for Ubuntu-Botho’s consideration.


Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber, a subsidiary of Ubuntu-Botho, will benefit from the remaining 20%,
acknowledging Ubuntu-Botho’s demonstrated commitment to Sanlam as its single largest
shareholder over the last few years.
                                                                                                       
   Enhancing broad based empowerment on key operating subsidiary level and strengthening
   and expanding the strategic partnership with Ubuntu-Botho


   The strategic partnership between Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho has been one of the most successful
   business relationships in South Africa. Since the maturity of the original empowerment transaction
   between Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho, Ubuntu-Botho has continued to support Sanlam’s strategy in
   South Africa, extending and expanding the relationship. To date, over 1 000 000 (one million)
   people have benefitted from the disbursement of funds through Ubuntu-Botho and the Sanlam
   Ubuntu-Botho Community Development Trust.


   As part of Sanlam’s South African strategy and to enhance Sanlam’s empowerment at an
   operational (business unit) level, Sanlam is proposing to make available the Ubuntu-Botho Facility
   subject to the fulfilment of the Suspensive Conditions detailed in Paragraph 5.


   The Ubuntu-Botho Facility is intended to be utilised to strengthen Sanlam’s competitive position,
   while also strengthening the strategic, long-standing and mutually beneficial partnership with
   Ubuntu-Botho.


   Through the Ubuntu-Botho Facility, Sanlam will enable Ubuntu-Botho or its subsidiary to:
       •   acquire a direct or indirect interest in certain key operating subsidiaries of the Sanlam
           Group in areas where Sanlam does not have a leading position, in particular third-party
           asset management, and the growing entry level market. This will enhance the
           empowerment status and competitiveness of these subsidiaries; and
       •   invest in financial services companies that will be complementary to the broader Sanlam
           Group’s vision and strategy.


   The Ubuntu-Botho Facility will be utilised only as and when transactions which meet the
   aforementioned criteria are available and will be subject to the terms and conditions of the
   agreement supporting the Ubuntu-Botho Facility (the ""Ubuntu-Botho Facility Agreement"")
   including approval by the Independent Committee, consisting of all non-executive Directors who
   are independent of Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho, to evaluate matters involving the Company and the
   Ubuntu-Botho Group, ( the ""Independent Committee"") and the Board on a case by case basis.


3. SALIENT TERMS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS


3.1. The B-BBEE Transaction


   The Subscription Shares will be issued to Subscription SPV at the Subscription Price (defined
   below) which will be determined on the Determination Date. The Determination Date will be a date
   falling after the fulfilment of all suspensive conditions to the B-BBEE Transaction, and will be agreed
   by the Independent Committee and the Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber (having regard to prevailing
   market conditions) and approved by the Board, as the date with reference to which the Subscription
   Price will be determined.


The 3 day volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") of a Sanlam Share is utilised as a reference
to determine the Subscription Price in order to align the Subscription Price as far as practically
possible with the Standard Bank Funding Package requirement which utilises the 3 day VWAP of
a Sanlam Share to determine the starting share cover ratio. The Standard Bank Funding Package
is defined below.


In agreeing the Determination Date, the Independent Committee will consider the prevailing market
conditions and seek to balance the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders in determining
the optimal pricing, funding mix and timing of the B-BBEE Transaction.


The Independent Committee will not agree a Determination Date where the 3 day VWAP of a
Sanlam Share will be (i) above R86.00, which will cause the Subscription Price to be above R 77.40
(after a discount of 10% to a price of R 86.00), or (ii) below R74.00 which will cause the Subscription
Price to be below R66.60 (after a discount of 10% to a price of R 74.00). The Subscription Date
may, subject to the fulfilment of all relevant suspensive conditions, fall on any date on or prior to 30
June 2019.


Given the length of the period required to fulfil all suspensive conditions to the B-BBEE Transaction,
with an ultimate long-stop date of 30 June 2019, and the possibility of stock market volatility over
this period, the use of a price range allows the Independent Committee to consider relevant share
price movements and the optimal funding mix to enable Subscription SPV to subscribe for the
Subscription Shares when agreeing the Determination Date.


The parties to the B-BBEE Transaction


Subscription SPV
    •   The sole purpose of Subscription SPV is to acquire and hold the Subscription Shares and
        raise funding for the acquisition of the Subscription Shares.


B-BBEE SPV
    •   B-BBEE SPV is a newly established black economic empowerment entity which will hold
        100% of the ordinary shares of Subscription SPV. The sole purpose of B-BBEE SPV is to
        (i) hold the ordinary shares in Subscription SPV, to (ii) raise funding pursuant to the issue
        of preference shares to The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (""the First-Ranking
        Preference Shares"") and preference shares to Sanlam or one of its subsidiaries (the
        ""Sanlam SPV Subscriber"") (""the Second-Ranking Preference Shares"") and to (iii)
        partially fund Subscription SPV for the purpose of subscribing for the Subscription Shares.
        B-BBEE SPV is owned as to 80% by the Master Trust and as to 20% by Ubuntu-Botho
        Subscriber.

                                                                                                      
Collectively the B-BBEE SPV and Subscription SPV are referred to as the ""B-BBEE SPV Group"".


       The Master Trust and Beneficiary Trusts
           •   The purpose of the Master Trust and the Beneficiary Trusts will be to create long-term and
               sustainable empowerment through a broad-based group of black beneficiaries.


       Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber
           •   Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber is held as to 20% by the Sanlam Ubuntu-Botho Community
               Development Trust and 80% as to Ubuntu-Botho.
           •   Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber will be entitled to appoint the majority of the directors on the board
               of B-BBEE SPV and Subscription SPV.


Funding of the B-BBEE Transaction


To enable Subscription SPV to subscribe for the Subscription Shares at the Subscription Price,
Subscription SPV will require an amount of between R7 415 843 400 (seven billion four hundred and
fifteen million eight hundred and forty-three thousand four hundred Rand) and R8 618 412 600 (eight
billion six hundred and eighteen million four hundred and twelve thousand and six hundred Rand). The
B-BBEE SPV Group has secured the funding for the aforementioned amount through:


(i)        the Standard Bank Funding Package consisting of first ranking preference shares to be issued
           by B-BBEE SPV to Standard Bank (""First Ranking Preference Shares"") and a loan by
           Standard Bank or another financial institution to Subscription SPV (""Equity Secured
           Funding""); and


(ii)       the Second Ranking Preference Shares consisting of second ranking preference shares to be
           issued by B-BBEE SPV to Sanlam SPV Subscriber.


The funding requirement will be split 50/50 between the Second Ranking Preference Shares and the
Standard Bank Funding Package. The final mix of the funding will be determined by the Subscription
Price and is estimated to be as follows:



       R‘ million                                                     Funding Requirement Mix


                                                                Lower end of the         Upper end of the
                                                                            range                    range

       3 Day VWAP                                                          R 74.00                 R 86.00

      Total Standard Bank Funding Package                                R3 708.0                 R4 309.2
      Second Ranking Preference Shares                                   R3 708.0                 R4 309.2

       The Second Ranking Preference Shares are expected to be funded by Sanlam SPV Subscriber
       from a combination of discretionary capital of between R2 808 000 000 (two billion eight
       hundred and eight million Rand) and R3 409 200 000 (three billion four hundred and nine million
       two hundred thousand Rand) made available by Sanlam, and the issuance of preference
       shares in the market as to R900 000 000 (nine hundred million Rand).


       The Standard Bank Funding Package will be advanced to the B-BBEE SPV Group, on fulfilment
       of all relevant suspensive conditions to the B-BBEE Transaction including fulfilment of a starting
       share cover ratio of around 2.5x for the portion representing the First Ranking Preference
       Shares and around 1.7x for the portion that represents the Equity Secured Funding.


       The final size and split of the Standard Bank Funding Package between the First Ranking
       Preference Shares and the Equity Secured Funding is a function of the Subscription Price. In
       agreeing the Determination Date, the Independent Committee and the Board will ensure the
       most optimal funding mix at the lowest cost whilst also satisfying the starting share cover ratios.
       The Standard Bank Funding Package will not exceed R4 309 206 300 (four billion three
       hundred and nine million two hundred and six thousand three hundred Rand).


       The holder of the First Ranking Preference Shares and the lender under the Equity Secured
       Funding will only have recourse to the balance sheets of B-BBEE SPV and Subscription SPV
       respectively with no recourse to the Sanlam Group balance sheet.


3.2. The Ubuntu-Botho Facility


       Sanlam or a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanlam (""Sanlam Subscriber"") will subscribe for the
       preference shares issued by Ubuntu-Botho Issuer (the ""Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares"")
       in an amount of up to R2 000 000 000 (two billion Rand) in aggregate, in multiple tranches until
       31 December 2020.


       There is no set schedule for subscribing for Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares. The subscription
       by Sanlam Subscriber for each tranche of Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares will be subject to
       the terms and conditions of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility Agreement and approval of the
       Independent Committee and the Board on a case by case basis.


       The Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares will be redeemable cumulative non-participating
       preference shares to be issued by the Ubuntu-Botho Issuer. The dividend in respect of the

                                                                                                        
    Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares will be calculated at a rate of 85% of the Prime Rate for an
    initial period of 7 years after the date on which the first tranche is issued and if refinanced for a
    further period of 3 years (at the sole discretion of Sanlam Subscriber) will be at the prevailing
    market related rate at refinance date based on the level of security available for the extension
    period.


    The Ubuntu-Botho Preference Shares will be secured by pledge and cession by African
    Rainbow Capital Financial Services (""ARC FS"") of the investments acquired with the proceeds
    received from the Ubuntu-Botho Facility and a pledge and cession of investments (which will
    preferably be listed investments), acceptable to Sanlam Subscriber. ARC FS will also provide
    the Company with financial covenants which will be calculated with reference to the directors’
    valuation of investments held by ARC FS relative to the nominal value of the Ubuntu-Botho
    Preference Shares not redeemed and any unpaid and accrued dividends thereon.


    Given the security package and the strategic nature of the planned investments, Sanlam Board
    believes that the terms of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility appropriately reflect an appropriate balance
    between financial and strategic benefits to the Sanlam Group.


    Utilisation of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility
    The details set out below are provided to Shareholders for information purposes only and fall
    outside of the scope of the Proposed Transactions. They provide an indication of how the
    Ubuntu-Botho Facility will be utilised by Ubuntu-Botho in the future in support of Sanlam’s
    strategy for empowerment and transformation.


    Sanlam, African Rainbow Capital (""ARC"") and ARC FS have reached in-principle agreement,
    subject to the conclusion of definitive agreements, to enter into the potential transactions
    described below which will be subject to the JSE listings requirements. A full terms
    announcement will be made once definitive agreements have been concluded. In addition to
    these potential transactions, Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho will continue to explore other areas of
    cooperation which could potentially lead to synergies for the Sanlam Group and that could
    unlock long term value for shareholders by enhancing the competitiveness of its business units.


•   Third Party Asset Management: In order to enhance the competitiveness of its third-party
    asset management business Sanlam will engage in a restructuring of its South African
    businesses and introduce ARC FS as a 25% shareholder in the business (the ""Sanlam
    Investments Transaction""). Sanlam and ARC FS may jointly explore opportunities for further
    transactions with other asset management companies.
•   Life Insurance – entry level market: Sanlam is supporting the formation of a new black
    managed insurance company that will focus on the underserviced lower to middle income
    market segment as well as small and medium sized businesses. Sanlam Life Insurance
    Limited (""Sanlam Life""), ARC FS and a consortium comprising key black management (the
    ""Management Consortium"") have incorporated a new black managed financial services                                                                                                        
     business named African Rainbow Life. African Rainbow Life will have a significant B-BBEE
     shareholding and will be held as to 51% by Sanlam Life, and 49% by ARC FS and the
     Management Consortium. African Rainbow Life will be black managed and will focus on
     distributing financial services products through work site marketing and by accessing informal
     groups.


  Should these potential transactions be concluded, Sanlam expects to have broad based black
  economic ownership (as measured in terms of the FSC) in excess of 51% at operating business
  unit level in these areas.


4. CROSS SHAREHOLDING TRANSACTION


  It is envisaged that ARC FS will assist Sanlam in the execution of its South African strategy and
  therefore, in addition to providing the Ubuntu-Botho Facility, and to further align the strategic
  interests of Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho, Sanlam and ARC have reached in-principle agreement ,
  subject to the conclusion of definitive agreements and such agreements becoming unconditional in
  accordance with their terms, for Sanlam or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanlam to acquire a 25%
  stake in ARC FS from ARC which will inter alia hold the strategic investments acquired via the
  Ubuntu-Botho Facility as part of the Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho business partnership. If definitive
  agreements are concluded, a full terms announcement will be made and the transaction will be
  subject to the requirements of the JSE Listings Requirements.


5. SUSPENSIVE CONDITIONS


  The B-BBEE Transaction is conditional, inter alia, on the fulfilment of the following suspensive
  conditions by no later than 30 June 2019:


  •   the requisite shareholder approval being obtained from Shareholders at the general meeting of
      Shareholders to be held on 12 December 2018 (""the General Meeting"");
  •   B-BBEE SPV Group obtaining the requisite funding pursuant to the Standard Bank Funding
      Package and Second Ranking Preference Shares to enable Subscription SPV to subscribe for
      the Subscription Shares;
  •   fulfilment of a starting share cover ratio of around 2.5x under the First Ranking Preference

7. RELATED PARTY CONSIDERATIONS


  B-BBEE Transaction


  As B-BBEE SPV and Subscription SPV will be controlled by Ubuntu-Botho Subscriber, an associate
  of a material shareholder of Sanlam (as contemplated in the JSE Listings Requirements) and a
  related person to Dr. Patrice Motsepe, deputy Chair of Sanlam (as contemplated in the Companies
  Act), the following related party considerations are applicable in respect of the Proposed
  Transactions:


              Issue of the Subscription Shares
               As Subscription SPV is a related person to Dr. Motsepe as contemplated in the
               Companies Act, the issue of the Subscription Shares to Subscription SPV requires
               approval by Shareholders by way of special resolution in terms of section 41 of the
               Companies Act.
               In addition, as:
                   •   Subscription SPV is an associate of Ubuntu-Botho; and
                   •   the Subscription Shares will be issued at a discount to the 30 day VWAP of
                       the Sanlam Shares to the date on which the Subscription Price is agreed
                       between the Company and B-BBEE SPV,
               the issue of the Subscription Shares requires the approval by Shareholders as a
               specific issue for cash under the JSE Listings Requirements which further require the
               Board to obtain a fairness opinion. The Board has obtained a fairness opinion from
               Deloitte & Touche which will be made available in the circular to be posted to
               Shareholders on or about 12 November 2018 that will provide full details of the
               Proposed Transactions (the ""Circular"").


               As a related party whose associates are participating in the specific issue for cash (as
               contemplated in the JSE Listings Requirements), Ubuntu-Botho is not entitled to cast
               any votes in respect of this special resolution

                                                                                                    
        Provision of funding through subscription for the Second Ranking Preference
        Share


         As B-BBEE SPV is a related person to Dr. Motsepe as contemplated in the Companies
         Act, the provision of financial assistance to B-BBEE SPV pursuant to the Second
         Ranking Preference Shares requires the approval of Shareholders by way of special
         resolution in terms of section 45 of the Companies Act.


         In addition to the approval of Shareholders, the Company is required to obtain a
         fairness opinion in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The Board has obtained
         a fairness opinion from Deloitte & Touche which will be made available in the Circular.


         Whilst Ubuntu-Botho is not precluded by the Companies Act or the JSE Listings
         Requirements from voting on such resolution, Ubuntu-Botho has informed the
         Company that it will not cast any votes on this resolution.


Granting of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility


As Ubuntu-Botho is a related person to Dr. Motsepe as contemplated in the Companies Act,
the provision of financial assistance to Ubuntu-Botho pursuant to the Ubuntu-Botho Facility
Agreements requires the approval of Shareholders by way of special resolution in terms of
section 45 of the Companies Act.


Ubuntu-Botho may utilise some of the proceeds from the issue of the Ubuntu-Botho Preference
Shares to subscribe (directly or indirectly) for shares in certain subsidiaries of the Company. To
the extent that funding is utilised for such purpose, it requires the approval of Shareholders by
way of special resolution in terms of section 44 of the Companies Act.


The Ubuntu-Botho Facility Agreement is deemed to be an agreement with a related party in
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and accordingly, subject to compliance with the related
party transaction provisions of the JSE Listings Requirements. By virtue of its size it is deemed
a small related party transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and does not require
the approval of Shareholders under the JSE Listings Requirements. However, the Company is
required to obtain a fairness opinion in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The Board has
obtained a fairness opinion from Deloitte & Touche which will be made available in the Circular.


Whilst Ubuntu-Botho is not precluded by the Companies Act or the JSE Listings Requirements
from voting on such resolution, Ubuntu-Botho has informed the Company that it will not cast
any votes on this resolution.

                                                                                               
8. BOARD OPINION AND RECOMMENDATIONS


  The Board established the Independent Committee, consisting of all non-executive Directors who
  are independent of Sanlam and Ubuntu-Botho, to evaluate matters involving the Company and the
  Ubuntu-Botho Group which may give rise to conflicts of interest, and following their consideration
  of these matters, make recommendations to the Board. The chairman of the Independent
  Committee is Mr. SA Nkosi, the lead independent Director. The Independent Committee has
  appointed JP Morgan as Independent Financial Advisor to advise it in connection with the Proposed
  Transactions.


  The Board appointed Deloitte & Touche as Independent Expert to provide the fairness opinion in
  respect of the issue of the Subscription Shares by the Company, the subscription for the Second
  Ranking Preference Shares by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the terms
  of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility to the related party, Ubuntu-Botho (or its associates). Deloitte & Touche
  have concluded that the terms of the B-BBEE Transaction and the Ubuntu-Botho Facility are fair to
  Shareholders. Their opinion will be set out in the Circular.


  The Board has considered the terms of the Proposed Transactions, together with the fairness
  opinion by the Independent Expert and is of the opinion that the terms and conditions thereof are
  fair to Shareholders and accordingly recommend that Shareholders vote in favour of the required
  resolutions to implement the Proposed Transactions which will be proposed at the General Meeting.


9. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS


  The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the Proposed Transactions on:


  •   Sanlam’s IFRS Financial Information; and
  •   Sanlam’s Shareholders’ Information;


  based on the most recently published reviewed consolidated interim financial results and
  Shareholders’ Information of the Sanlam Group for the six months ended 30 June 2018, adjusted
  on a pro forma basis for the conclusion of the acquisition of the remaining interest in SAHAM
  Finances on 9 October 2018.


  The pro forma financial information and the pro forma Shareholders’ Information have been
  prepared using IFRS accounting policies and a basis of preparation and presentation of the
  Shareholders’ Information respectively that are consistent with those applied in the published
  consolidated financial statements and the Shareholders’ Information of Sanlam for the six months
  ended 30 June 2018, and the consolidated annual financial statements and Shareholders’
  Information for the year ended 31 December 2017, but with specific clarification that the treasury
  share adjustment upon consolidation of the Subscription SPV is recognised in the consolidation
  reserve which forms part of other reserves in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

                                                                                                     
   The actual Sanlam share price and other observable market information at implementation date of
   the Proposed Transactions will affect the actual impact of the Proposed Transactions on the
   financial information and Shareholders’ Information.


   The pro forma financial information and the pro forma Shareholders’ Information is the responsibility
   of the directors of Sanlam and was prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not, because of
   its nature, fairly present Sanlam’s IFRS financial position and results of its operations or
   Shareholders’ Information after the Proposed Transactions. It does not purport to be indicative of
   what the financial results would have been, had the Proposed Transactions been implemented on
   a different date.

9.1. The Proposed Transactions

   The B-BBEE Transaction will be implemented through a series of inter-related steps resulting in
   Sanlam issuing the Subscription Shares to Subscription SPV at the Subscription Price. As the
   Subscription Price will be determined at a 10% discount to a Sanlam share price within a range of
   R74 (seventy-four Rand) to R86 (eighty-six Rand), two scenarios are presented in respect of the
   B-BBEE Transaction: a scenario based on the bottom end of the range (""R74-scenario"") as well as
   a scenario based on the upper end of the range (""R86-scenario"").


   The B-BBEE Transaction meets the requirements of an equity-settled IFRS 2: Share-based
   Payment (""IFRS 2"") arrangement and will result in a once-off share-based payment charge. This
   once-off charge is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the six
   months ended 30 June 2018 as administration costs.


   The following adjustments are made in determining the economic cost of the Proposed
   Transactions for purposes of the pro forma Shareholders’ Information for the six months ended 30
   June 2018:


    •    IFRS 2 requires that the cost of the B-BBEE Transaction be measured taking cognisance of
         the effective discount of the Subscription Price relative to the prevailing listed price. The B-
         BBEE Transaction is an alternative to a general market issuance, similar to the share issuance
         conducted by Sanlam in March 2018. Such a comparable market issuance would have
         occurred at a discount of around 5%, in the Board’s view, in line with the March 2018
         transaction. The economic cost of the B-BBEE Transaction is measured for purposes of the
         pro forma Shareholders’ Information after taking into account the difference between a market
         related discount of 5% and the effective discount of 10% implied by the Subscription Price.
         The economic cost of the B-BBEE Transaction for purposes of the pro forma Shareholders’
         Information is commensurately R412 000 000 (four hundred and twelve million Rand) and
         R479 000 000 (four hundred and seventy-nine million Rand) lower than the IFRS charge at
         the R74-scenario and R86-scenario respectively.


                                                                                                      
 •   The Second Ranking Preference Shares funding provided by Sanlam in terms of the B-BBEE
     Transaction will be partially funded through the issuance of preference shares by a subsidiary
     of Sanlam in the market. Due to Sanlam’s strong balance sheet and credit rating, the cost of
     funding relating to these preference shares is lower than the proportional investment return
     earned on the Second Ranking Preference Shares. Sanlam will therefore earn a margin on
     the portion of the Second Ranking Preference Shares funded through the back-to-back
     preference share issuance, with the capitalised value of this margin of R80 000 000 (eighty
     million Rand) recognised as part of RoGEV in the Shareholders’ Information at initial
     recognition. Capitalisation of this margin at initial recognition is not permitted in terms of IFRS,
     with the margin being recognised in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
     over time on an accrual basis.
 •   The Ubuntu-Botho Facility will be funded through the issuance of preference shares (on a
     back-to-back basis) by a subsidiary of Sanlam at a funding cost lower than the yield on the
     Ubuntu-Botho Facility. The funding cost is lower due to Sanlam’s strong balance sheet and
     credit rating. The capitalised value of this margin (R73 000 000 (seventy three million Rand)
     in respect of the portion to be utilised for the Sanlam Investments Transaction) is similarly
     recognised as part of RoGEV for purposes of the pro forma Shareholders’ Information.
     Capitalisation of this margin at initial recognition is not permitted in terms of IFRS, with the
     margin being recognised in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over time
     on an accrual basis.


The IFRS share-based payment charge represents a cost of 0.9% for both the R74-scenario and
R86-scenario of the Sanlam market capitalisation (excluding Treasury Shares), while the economic
cost of the Proposed Transactions for purposes of the pro forma Shareholders’ Information as
described above, represents a cost of 0.6% for the R74-scenario and R86-scenario of the Sanlam
market capitalisation (excluding Treasury Shares). It is estimated that of the IFRS charge, 80% is
associated with new broad based beneficiaries and 20% is associated with the Ubuntu-Botho
Group.


Shareholders also need to be aware that the once-off IFRS charge is presented in the pro
forma financial information in relation to the Group’s consolidated financial statements and
consolidated Shareholder’s Information for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The once-
off IFRS charge will proportionally have a different impact when viewed against the full year
earnings, as opposed to when it is presented against the earnings for the six months.


Based on management’s judgement and application of the control principles contained in IFRS 10:
Consolidated Financial Statements (""IFRS 10""), management concluded that Sanlam will need to
consolidate the B-BBEE SPV Group for IFRS purposes for the initial term of the B-BBEE
Transaction. As a result, the Subscription Shares held by the Subscription SPV in Sanlam will be
treated as treasury shares for IFRS purposes (i.e. it will be excluded from Shares and weighted
average number of Shares for accounting purposes). The treasury shares will be included in the
consolidation reserve that forms part of the IFRS shareholders’ equity in line with the Group’s basis

                                                                                                      
     of presentation. In respect of the Shareholder’s Information, management concluded that
     consolidation of the B-BBEE SPV Group does not reflect the economic result of the B-BBEE
     Transaction. The B-BBEE SPV Group is commensurately not consolidated for purposes of the
     Shareholders’ Information.

Notes and assumptions

1. Notes below are applicable to both the R74-scenario and R86-scenario
2. The information reflected in the ""Before the Proposed Transactions"" column has been extracted
   from the reviewed consolidated interim financial results and Shareholders’ Information of Sanlam
   for the six months ended 30 June 2018 as published on SENS on 6 September 2018, adjusted on                                                                                                         
   a pro forma basis for the conclusion of the acquisition of the remaining interest in SAHAM Finances
   on 9 October 2018.
3. The Sanlam information reflected in the ""Pro forma after the Proposed Transactions – Scenario A""
   column has been calculated on the basis that all of the steps to implement the Proposed
   Transactions have been completed, but before any drawdowns granted in respect of the Ubuntu-
   Botho Facility have occurred.
4. The Sanlam information reflected in the ""Pro forma after the Proposed Transactions – Scenario B""
   column has been calculated on the basis that all of the steps to implement the Proposed
   Transactions have been completed, and that a portion of the Ubuntu-Botho Facility has been
   utilised for the Sanlam Investments Transaction.
5. The effects on basic EPS, diluted EPS, HEPS, diluted HEPS, RoGEVPS, NRFSPS and NHEPS
   are calculated on the basis that the Proposed Transactions were effective on 1 January 2018, while
   the effects on NAVPS, NTAVPS, GEVPS and shareholders’ fund at net asset value per share are
   calculated on the basis that the Proposed Transactions were effective on 30 June 2018 for purposes
   of presenting the pro forma financial information and the pro forma Shareholder’s Information.

The full pro forma financial information will be set out in the Circular, together with a report from Ernst

Executive review
Operating conditions were very challenging during the first six months of 2018 across a number of markets where Sanlam operates. 
Investment market volatility, a stronger average Rand exchange rate and a weak South African economy in particular dampened growth 
prospects for our key performance indicators. The Group's well-diversified profile across geographies, market segments and client 
offerings again provided resilience against these headwinds, enabling us to deliver an acceptable operational performance for the six 
months ended 30 June 2018. Annualised adjusted Return on Group Equity Value (RoGEV) per share of 18,2% exceeded the 2018 target of 13%,
further strengthening our track record of consistent shareholder value creation.

Economic growth in many markets remains below longer-term potential, in particular in our South African and Namibian markets. As 
anticipated, it will take some time for improved business and consumer sentiment in South Africa to translate into accelerated economic 
growth. Some remaining uncertainty around government policy is having a prolonged effect. Following growth of more than 2% in the last
three quarters of 2017, the South African economy shrank by 2,2% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2018. Mining, manufacturing and 
agricultural production recorded the largest declines. Full year growth prospects remain pedestrian at just above 1%. A lack of growth 
in formal employment, higher tax rates and inflationary pressure dampened disposable income and demand in our core middle-income market 
in South Africa. Although we have experienced some recovery in Glacier's new business performance in the first quarter of 2018, affluent 
investors remain cautious. The Namibian economy is still struggling from weak public sector investment, coupled with stagnant private sector
credit extension. The economies and currencies of Nigeria and Angola also remained under pressure, but the increase in oil prices over the 
last few months should provide improved prospects for these economies going forward. The economic outlook in the other Africa regions where 
we operate is improving, with favourable conditions and a positive outlook in India and Malaysia.

The South African and international investment markets experienced significant volatility during the first six months of 2018. The 
South African equity market rallied into December 2017, finding support from record-level global stock markets as well as the favourable 
outcome of the ruling party's elective conference. Optimism improved further at the beginning of 2018 with the appointment of 
Cyril Ramaphosa as South African president and the subsequent cabinet changes. These favourable conditions were, however, short lived as
global markets were gripped by fears of an accelerated interest rate hiking cycle by the US Federal Reserve and the risk of a trade war
between the US, Europe and China that could have severe consequences for global economic growth. This spurred a global stock market 
sell-off and resulted in a decline across  most major investment markets towards the end of June 2018, aggravated in South Africa by
government policy uncertainty that fuelled anxiety with local and foreign investors in the second quarter. The Mining Charter, Eskom, 
State-Owned Enterprises' finances and the National Health Insurance proposals are the main factors. South African long-term interest rates
also reacted positively to the political developments in the first quarter. This trend reversed as global geopolitical risk heightened,
with both the five-year and nine-year benchmark rates closing higher at the end of June 2018 than 31 December 2017 and 30 June 2017.

The sharp strengthening of the Rand exchange rate in 2017 and the first part of 2018 is reflecting in a stronger average exchange rate 
in the first half of 2018 relative to the same period in 2017, suppressing the overall translated results of Sanlam Emerging Markets as 
well as Sanlam Investment Group's international operations.

The Group's primary indicator of shareholder value creation remains Return on Group Equity Value (RoGEV). Given the nature of the Group's
diversified business, we consider this measure of performance the most appropriate since it incorporates the result of all the major 
value drivers in the business. The annualised RoGEV per share for the six months to 30 June 2018 of 13,7% exceeded the target of 13%,
despite weaker investment markets and the rise in long-term interest rates, finding support from a relatively weaker Rand at 30 June 2018
compared to the end of December 2017 as well as a strong performance of the Santam share price. Annualised adjusted RoGEV per share, 
which excludes investment market and currency volatility as well as changes in interest rates and other factors outside of management's
control, also exceeding the 13% target at 18,2%. Annualised actual and adjusted RoGEV per share excludes annualisation of the positive 
impact that the new share issuance in April 2018 had on GEV per share (refer Group Equity Value section below).

Net result from financial services increased by 8% (10% in constant currency). Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM), Santam and Sanlam Corporate 
achieved strong growth, which offset softer contributions by Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) Sanlam Investment Group (SI). Investments in 
new growth initiatives (predominantly BrightRock) and lower market-related and annuity profits at Glacier were the main contributors to a 
2% decline in SPF's contribution.Excluding new growth initiatives, SPF achieved growth of 4%. Lower performance fees and a decline in 
Sanlam Capital Markets' operating earnings from a high base in 2017 contributed to an overall 9% decline in SI's net result from 
financial services.

The new ordinary shares issued in April 2018 in anticipation of the Saham Finances acquisition (refer Responsible capital allocation and
management section that follows) resulted in a 1,6% increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue, with a similar dilution 
in earnings per share. The dilution will decrease once the increased participation in Saham Finances' earnings is consolidated from the 
effective date of the transaction.

New business volumes declined by 1% (in line with 2017 in constant currency), an acceptable performance under difficult conditions. All 
clusters achieved solid growth, apart from SI where the SA Investment Management and Wealth Management units experienced lower inflows.
Growth of 6% in the net value of new covered business (VNB) (on a consistent economic basis and excluding the impact of structural 
activity) fell short of our expectations, reflecting weak growth in SPF middle-income market risk business, lower margin mix of business
at Glacier and declines at Sanlam Corporate and SEM's Rest of Africa region (excluding Saham Finances).

Good progress has been made in finalising the acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances. A number of synergies have been 
identified. We are also expanding disclosure in respect of Saham Finances' performance in this interim results announcement (refer below).
Finalising the terms of a broad-based black economic empowerment share issuance to provide funding for this transaction is at an advanced 
stage (refer Responsible capital allocation and management section below).

Strategic initiatives
The Group's strategic intent of sustainable value creation for all key stakeholders remains firmly in place, underpinned by the Group's
vision to:

- Lead in client-centric wealth creation, management and protection in South Africa.
- Be a leading Pan-African financial services group with a meaningful presence in India and Malaysia.
- Play a niche role in wealth and investment management in specific developed markets.

The Group's vision and strategic intent is pursued through a strategy focussed on four pillars:

- Profitable top-line growth through a culture of client-centricity.
- Enhancing resilience and earnings growth through diversification.
- Extracting value through innovation and improved efficiencies.
- Responsible capital allocation and management.

Continuous transformation of the Group to remain relevant in a changing world is key. We define transformation broadly to include among
others economic transformation to reduce wealth inequality, transforming our staff to reflect the demographic profile of our client base
and societies where we operate, transforming our distribution channels and operations in line with technological and regulatory 
developments and most importantly, transforming everything we do in line with the changing needs and preferences of our clients. 
Transformation therefore underpins the Group's strategy in its entirety as a key focus area under each of the strategic pillars.

We continued to execute on all strategic pillars in the first half of 2018.

Profitable top-line growth through a culture of client-centricity
Solid overall new business growth was achieved by all clusters apart from SI, where improved investor confidence is not yet reflecting in 
an increased allocation of institutional mandates. Below benchmark performance also contributed to the muted net inflows. Our portfolios 
were not well positioned for the run in the South African market post the political changes at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018, while 
the larger than benchmark exposure to Steinhoff in 2017 also detracted from the performance levels. Wealth Management and Implemented 
Consulting inflows in the retail segment were also under pressure in a competitive environment. Strong inflows were experienced in Satrix 
index-tracking funds, with Satrix Managers consolidating its position as the leading business in the retail segment of this market. Santam 
achieved commendable growth of 13% in gross written premiums (9% excluding structural growth) in a very competitive market. VNB was affected
by a slow start to the year at Sanlam Corporate and SPF's Safrican group schemes and Individual Life businesses (excluding BrightRock), a 
change in mix of business at Glacier to less profitable linked products and an under performance in SEM's Rest of Africa region (excluding 
Saham Finances).

Saham Finances delivered in line with its business plan, achieving 13% and 39% organic growth in overall new business volumes and VNB 
respectively in constant currency, the latter being off a low base. SPF concluded new credit life underwriting and distribution agreements
with Capitec Bank in the first half of 2018. The annual credit life premiums received in the first half of 2018 contributed R566 million 
to new business volumes. The roll-out of funeral products has also commenced, with solid initial demand. BrightRock performed well and 
exceeded its new business and VNB targets.

Prospects on this key metric for the remainder of the year are more promising, as outlined in the Outlook section that follows.

Diligent focus on client centricity and the quality of new business written also enhances the resilience of the life insurance in-force 
book, with satisfactory persistency being maintained despite the economic pressures in the core South African middle-income market.

In line with historic trends, positive experience variances persisted.

Enhancing resilience and earnings growth through diversification
The acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances is progressing in line with expectations. A number of regulatory approvals have 
been received. The main other condition precedent is the demerger of the non-financial services activities within the Saham Finances Group,
with good progress achieved to date. The conclusion of this acquisition will significantly enhance the Group's geographical (Francophone 
West Africa and North Africa) and line of business (general insurance) profile. A number of synergies were identified during the 
acquisition of the initial 47% stake. Our ability to extract these synergies will be strengthened through obtaining the controlling stake.
Saham Finances' management team is fully supportive of the acquisition and the future partnership with Sanlam. Their track record of 
execution positions us well to realise the synergies, which include:

- Growing the Saham Finances life insurance operations. Life insurance currently contributes less than 20% of Saham Finances' operating 
  profit. Sanlam's life insurance expertise elsewhere in Africa positions us very well to grow this line of business across the Saham 
  Finances footprint, which spans across a number of markets with favourable demographic profiles, strong economic growth prospects and 
  low insurance penetration. Focus remains on further accelerating growth in this line of business.
- Utilising the Saham Finances general insurance expertise to grow the other SEM general insurance businesses in Africa. This will be 
  implemented over time in line with Saham Finances' operational capacity.
- Expanding the Saham Finances product offering in assistance and health insurance across other SEM markets. SEM's current health insurance
  offering in Zambia and Uganda have already been transferred to Saham Finances, with feasibility studies in respect of the roll-out of 
  assistance business in Southern Africa progressing well.
- Optimising reinsurance across the SEM general insurance footprint while also expanding the general insurance specialist classes of 
  business offering in conjunction with Santam. The intention is to achieve this by amending Santam's participation in SEM's African 
  general insurance businesses to focus largely on reinsurance and specialist lines.
- Optimising capital management within the Saham Finances Group. Sanlam's extensive capital management expertise will be utilised to 
  identify and extract any excess capital in the Saham Finances operations.
- Utilising the combined SEM and Saham Finances footprint to provide a compelling one-stop service offering to multi-nationals operating 
  across the African continent. Initiatives in this area have already resulted in new mandates being concluded with annualised premiums in 
  excess of R50 million. 
- The Santam Board approved increased participation by Santam in Saham Finances, in terms of which Santam's effective stake in Saham Finances
  will increase from 7% to 10%.

Extracting value through innovation and improved efficiencies
Embedding new investments was a key focus area in the first half of 2018. In SPF the working relationship with BrightRock is largely 
established, with the business exceeding its new business targets by a healthy margin. BrightRock products will be launched under the 
Sanlam brand in 2019.

MiWay Life and Indie are tracking behind their business plans in the first half of 2018. We are monitoring progress and will adjust their
strategies as experience develops. However, the distribution and digital capabilities honed in these businesses make Sanlam well-placed to 
secure and establish affinity distribution partnerships with strong external brands. The first such partnership to market is Capitec Bank, 
but others are being actively explored.

The business intelligence (BI) project, aimed at extracting value through big data and data analytics, is making good progress, with 
business demand for test cases exceeding our initial forecasts. The current focus is on using BI to improve underwriting accuracy, to have 
better and more targeted engagements with clients and to consolidate our data management. The latter is an important component in preparing
for the extensive data requirements emanating from the new International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for insurance accounting 
(IFRS 17) that will apply from the 2021 financial year. Of fundamental importance is that our BI initiative is not about the technology, but
about changing the way we work with data to ensure a much more explorative and interactive relationship with data, which will drive improved 
business performance in the longer term.

Responsible capital allocation and management
Discretionary capital of R2,4 billion was released during the first half of 2018 through the excess cash dividend cover in respect of the
2017 financial year as well as a reduction in the capital allocation to Sanlam Personal Finance and Sanlam Corporate. The latter is largely
attributable to more effective balance sheet management, as outlined in the 2017 Integrated Report. We also conducted an accelerated book 
build process at the end of March 2018 (with the new shares issued and listed in April 2018) to raise R5,5 billion (net of dividends paid)
as partial funding for the Saham Finances acquisition. Deployment of discretionary capital during the first half of 2018 was limited to a 
few small transactions, resulting in a discretionary capital balance of R9,9 billion at the end of June 2018. This is earmarked for the 
Saham Finances acquisition.

Our intention at concluding the third phase of the Saham Finances acquisition was to fully finance the transaction through shareholders' 
equity, in line with the Group's capital management philosophy. Given the level of discretionary capital available, this necessitated a 
new share issuance. This would have been the first equity raising since demutualisation in 1998 and it is unlikely that we would do a 
further issuance in the foreseeable future. It therefore provided us with a unique opportunity to concomitantly enhance the Group's 
empowerment credentials by increasing our direct black shareholding to a leading position in South Africa, which has become an important
consideration for institutional clients in addition to the overall direct and indirect shareholding as reflected in the Financial Sector
Scorecard. As it takes some time to structure an empowerment issuance, the equity raising was split into two phases - an initial issuance
to de-risk the transaction, and a second phase to introduce a broad-based empowerment component.

To de-risk the acquisition, we issued 3% new shares in April through the accelerated book build process. This placed us in a position that
we could, if required, temporarily finance the remainder of the transaction through debt while we finalise an empowerment issuance, without
putting the Group's credit rating at risk. Our intent is that this will now be followed by the second phase, being a further 5% issuance to
a broad-based black empowerment vehicle. This equity raising will provide the remaining funding for the acquisition and will restore the 
discretionary capital portfolio to an appropriate level for future bolt-on acquisitions. It will also increase Sanlam's direct black 
shareholding to an industry-leading 19%, which will position us well to gain institutional business in employee benefits, third party asset 
management, health and distribution. We recognise that this is a follow-on empowerment transaction and the intent is therefore to limit any
dilution to shareholders to an acceptable level, well below that of primary transactions. This issuance will also be subject to shareholder 
approval together with the Group's BBBEE strategy.

Outlook
Economic growth prospects in our key markets are not expected to improve for the remainder of the year and will continue to impact on our
ability to accelerate organic growth. Structural growth and new initiatives such as the Capitec Bank agreements should, however, support 
operational performance in the second half of the year. Particularly pleasing is the conclusion of investment-related mandates of 
R5 billion by Sanlam Corporate in July 2018, which will make a marked contribution to VNB and new business volumes. On the negative 
side, SI received notice of an R8 billion outflow of low margin index-tracking funds managed on an outsourced basis. We continue to 
attract flows into the Satrix index-tracking funds and the impact of the withdrawal on profitability should therefore be minimal.Focus 
also remains on addressing the few areas within the wider Group that failed to deliver to target in the first six months, so as to get
them back on track for the financial year.

Shareholders need to be aware of the impact that the level of interest rates and financial market returns and volatility have on earnings
and GEV. Relative movements in these elements may have a major impact on the growth in normalised headline earnings, VNB and GEV to be 
reported for the 2018 financial year.

We will continue to diligently execute on the strategic priorities identified in the Group's 2017 Integrated Report.

Comments on the results
Introduction
The Sanlam Group's International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2018 are
presented based on and in compliance with IFRS, specifically IAS34 on Interim Financial Reporting. The basis of presentation and
accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and Shareholders' information are in all material respects consistent with those
applied in the 2017 Integrated Report and Annual Financial Statements, apart from the application on IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 as described 
below and a restructuring at Sanlam Investment Group (SIG) as outlined below.

Following the creation of the Central Credit Manager (CCM) within Sanlam Capital Markets (SCM), it was decided to further enhance focus
on the management of Sanlam assets within the SIG cluster, while at the same time creating a third party asset manager that can more 
effectively compete with independent asset managers. The Sanlam Asset Management division and Sanlam Structured Solutions were 
accordingly combined with SCM to form the new Sanlam Specialised Finance sub cluster. Comparative Shareholders' fund information has 
been restated accordingly, apart from GEV and RoGEV where the transfer of businesses were done on 1 January 2018.

Most of the Group's businesses achieved a solid underlying performance in the first half of 2018 despite challenging economic and 
investment market conditions. Highlights and lowlights for the six months include the following:

Operating environment
Economic conditions
Economic conditions in South Africa and Namibia during the first six months of the 2018 financial year were not conducive to growth, as 
elaborated on in the Executive review.

Equity markets
The South African equity market delivered a relatively weaker performance with the FTSE/JSE Swix Index (inclusive of dividends) recording
negative returns of 4,8% for the six months to 30 June 2018, compared to a positive return of 3,3% in the comparable six-month period in
2017. On average, the Swix was 8,5% higher in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The MSCI World Index total return
in Rand of 11,2% was well in excess of the 6% return for the first half of 2017.

Interest rates
The South African nine- and five-year interest rates increased by 30 and 50 basis points respectively since the end of 2017, and by 20 and
30 basis points respectively compared to the 30 June 2017 levels. Movements in interest rates commensurately had a negative impact on VNB 
growth and RoGEV for the first six months of 2018. The South African All Bond Index return of 4% in the first half of 2018 was in line with
the 2017 comparable performance.

Foreign currency exchange rates
The South African Rand strengthened sharply against most currencies during 2017 and the first part of 2018, weakening into the latter part 
of the six months to 30 June 2018. Average exchange rates during the first half of 2018 were commensurately stronger relative to the first 
six months of 2017. This had a negative impact on the Rand-based earnings, new business volumes, net fund flows and VNB performance of the 
Group's non-South African operations that are translated at average exchange rates. The weakening of the Rand since December 2017, however, 
had a positive impact on the valuation of non-South African operations for GEV purposes. The exchange rate of the Rand against the 
currencies to which the Group has major exposure is summarised in the table below.

Group Equity Value
GEV amounted to R128,7 billion or 6 090 cents per share at 30 June 2018. Including the dividend of 290 cents per share paid during the six 
months, an annualised RoGEV per share of 13,7% was achieved for the first half of 2018. This exceeded the 13% target for 2018, due to 
strong returns from SEM, Sanlam Corporate and the listed Santam shareholding. Positive experience variances persisted, exceeding R1 billion
for the six months, while the depreciation in the Rand exchange rate during the six months to June 2018 benefited the returns of the 
non-South African operations. Higher long term interest rates, however, diluted RoGEV for the period. The capital raising at the end of 
March 2018 was done at a share price above GEV per share, contributing 1,2% to RoGEV. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact 
of lower investment return than the long-term assumptions, interest rate changes and other one-off effects not under management control,
and assuming normalised exchange rate movements, amounted to 18,2% - also in excess of the target.

The covered business operations achieved a good overall performance despite lower than expected investment returns and the negative 
impact of higher long term interest rates on the valuation of the in-force book of business. The main items contributing to the return
from covered business included the following:

- Expected return on covered business was broadly in line with the comparable period in 2017.
- Value of new covered business contributed to similar returns in 2018 than in the first half of 2017 despite the pressure on growth 
  (refer business volumes section below).
- Operating experience variances increased markedly in the first half of 2018, attributable to a good mix of positive risk experience, 
  credit spreads and working capital management profits. The release of R1,5 billion of capital from the South African operations had a 
  one-off positive impact of some R290 million on cost of capital.
- The increase in the risk discount rate in 2018 due to higher long term interest rates had a negative impact on returns of some 1%.
- Equity and interest rate markets underperformed in the first half of 2018 compared to actuarial assumptions, contributing to an overall
  negative variance of some 1%, more than double the negative variance experienced in the comparable six months in 2017.

Other Group operations achieved a return of 6,7% for the six months. The returns from non-South African operations benefited from the 
weakening in the Rand exchange rate against most currencies during the six-month period. This was, however, largely offset by higher risk 
discount rates following the increase in long term interest rates in India, Namibia, Malaysia and the CIMA region, as well as lower long
term economic growth forecasts used in the valuation models. Low growth in assets under management at the South African investment
management businesses also had a negative impact on valuations. Apart from these businesses, underlying operational performance in general 
supported valuations and returns during the first half of 2018. The Group's investment in Santam is valued at its listed share price, which
achieved a strong return of 9,2% in the first half of 2018.

The negative return on discretionary and other capital is largely due to low investment return earned on foreign currency held as hedge for
the Saham Finances acquisition and an increase in Group-level support costs in response to a more complex regulatory environment.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R4,4 billion increased by 8% on the first six months of 2017 (10% in constant
currency), with strong growth in Santam, SEM and Sanlam Corporate.

The following structural activities impacted on growth in net result from financial services at a cluster level, but with a net immaterial
overall impact on the Group results:

- SEM:
 - The acquisition of a 16,6% additional stake in Saham Finances in May 2017;
 - The acquisition of a 75% interest in PineBridge's East African investment management business, effective July 2017; and
 - The disposal of SEM's interests in the Enterprise Group in Ghana with effect from 1 July 2017.
- SPF:
 - The acquisition of a 53% interest in BrightRock with effect from October 2017; and
 - Initial losses from new initiatives - MiWay Life and Indie.
- SI:
 - The disposal of Summit Trust in 2017.
- Sanlam Corporate:
 - The acquisition of ABSA Consultants and Actuaries with effect from 1 April 2018.
- Santam:
 - The acquisition of RMB-SI in 2017.

SPF delivered a resilient performance for a mature business in an environment of low economic growth and a weak equity market performance.
The 2% decline in net result from financial services is largely attributable to the initial losses from new growth initiatives, including 
BrightRock. Excluding these losses, net result from financial services increased by 2%.

- The Recurring premium sub cluster achieved 10% growth in net result from financial services (20% excluding new initiatives). Profit from
  risk business benefited from favourable claims experience and lower new business strain, the latter due to the low growth in new risk 
  business volumes (excluding BrightRock). Earnings from the savings business were supported by higher average assets under management. 
  Despite the negative investment market performance in the first half of 2018, average market levels in 2018 were still higher than the 
  comparable six months to June 2017. The sub cluster also benefitted from a reallocation of expenses to Glacier.
- Sanlam Sky grew its net result from financial services by 8% despite a major increase in new business strain following the strong growth 
  in individual life recurring premium risk business, which generates relatively more new business strain than group life. Excluding the 
  increase in new business strain, net result from financial services increased by 23%.
- Glacier, which incorporates single premium life investments and the Linked Investment Service Providers (LISP) platform recorded a 26% 
  decline in net result from financial services, the combined effect of a 33% decline in profit from life investments and 9% from the LISP 
  platform. The decline from life investments can be ascribed to lower market-related fee income from products where Glacier participates
  in actual investment return, negative annuity modelling changes, lower annuity mortality experience variances and a reallocation of 
  expenses from the recurring premium sub cluster. Expense reallocation from the recurring premium sub cluster is also the driver behind 
  the decline in profitability of the LISP platform.
- Strategic business development includes Sanlam Personal Loans, Sanlam Trust, Multi-Data and Sanlam Reality. Continued investment to 
  improve the attractiveness of the Reality platform is the main driver behind the decline in net result from financial services from this 
  sub cluster. Sanlam Personal Loans' contribution increased by 5%, broadly in line with growth in the lending book.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by 18% including structural activity and exchange rate differences. Organic growth in 
constant currency amounted to 17%.

- Namibia's net result from financial services declined by 3% (down 23% on a gross basis). Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH) sold 14,5% 
  of its stake in Bank Windhoek during 2017, resulting in Bank Windhoek becoming an associate of CIH. CIH's participation in Bank Windhoek's 
  earnings is commensurately equity accounted on a net basis from the transaction date and not consolidated on a gross basis as in the past.
  This is the main contributor to the variance in the level of growth in Namibia's gross and net result from financial services. The 
  decrease in net result from financial services is largely due to higher new business strain following strong growth in entry-level market
  risk business, negative group life claims experience and lower participation in Bank Windhoek's earnings following the disposal in 2017.
  Excluding the higher new business strain, net result from financial services increased by 12%.
- The Botswana operations' contribution to net result from financial services declined by 4%  after a one-off allowance for prior year tax 
  under provisions at Letshego of R36 million after non-controlling interest. In constant currency and excluding the tax adjustment, net 
  result from financial services increased by 20%. All operations achieved double-digit growth, apart from investment management and general 
  insurance. The life insurance business in particular recovered from a weak first half performance in 2017 when annuity new business volumes 
  were under severe pressure. Investment management earnings declined by 5% due to low growth in average assets under management and foreign
  currency translation differences. Restructuring costs in the general insurance business suppressed profit growth.
- Saham Finances' net result from financial services increased by 102% (103% in constant currency), with organic growth of 41% supported by
  the impact of the additional 17% stake acquired in May 2017. Organic growth in gross written premium amounted to 10% in constant currency, 
  with net earned premiums increasing by 13%. All regions contributed satisfactory growth in written premiums apart from Lebanon, which
  reflects the impact of a challenging operating environment. Profitability in Lebanon is commensurately under pressure. Currency weakness 
  in Angola is similarly placing pressure on this region's cost base and underwriting performance. This was, however, more than offset by
  overall good performances from the other regions and particularly strong growth in reinsurance profits. The efforts to optimise reinsurance
  within the Saham Finances Group is bearing positive results. The general insurance operations achieved an overall net underwriting margin in 
  excess of 10%, exceeding both the prior year and current year targets. Life insurance profits also experienced strong growth, albeit from 
  a small base.
- Net result from financial services in India rose 30% (41% in constant currency). Growth in earnings was supported by the one-off 
  de-monetisation related provision recognised in 2017. Excluding this, net result from financial services increased by 19% on a comparable 
  basis, with all operations contributing to the strong growth.
- The Rest of Africa operations had a disappointing six months, with net result from financial services declining by 47% excluding 
  structural activity (31% in constant currency). Including structural activity (disposal of the Ghana operations and acquisition of 
  PineBridge East Africa), net result from financial services declined by 56% (47% in constant currency). Weak performance in Malawi, 
  Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia more than offset strong growth from the other regions. Nigeria and Zimbabwe performed particularly well, 
  increasing their contribution to net result from financial services by 106% and 25% respectively. Life insurance profit in Malawi 
  declined from a high base in 2017, which was supported by favourable claims experience. New regulations in Tanzania require that no 
  general insurance cover can be provided from 2018 if premiums have not been received in cash. Sanlam General Insurance Tanzania is 
  still adapting to the new environment, experiencing a significant decline in written premiums and commensurately underwriting profit.
  A recovery is only expected from 2019. Lower new business volumes in Zambia is placing pressure on the file size and profitability.
- High group life claims experience suppressed the profit contribution of the Malaysian businesses, hiding a satisfactory recovery in the
  operational performance of both the life and general insurance business. The life insurance business reported a marginal loss as a result
  of the high claims experience. The general insurance business stemmed its declining profit trajectory of the last few years, with only a 
  marginal decrease in result from financial services. Both businesses are experiencing improved new business traction, which bodes well 
  for future earnings growth.

SI's net result from financial services declined by 9% (7% in constant currency), with declines at the Investment Management SA and
International businesses more than offsetting satisfactory growth from the Wealth Management sub cluster.

- The Investment Management SA net result from financial services declined by 8% on 2017 due to low growth in assets under management, a
  decline in performance fees and losses from  new initiatives.
- Wealth Management net result from financial services increased by 7%, but declined by 2% on a gross basis. Brokerage income benefited 
  from higher trading volumes, achieving double-digit growth. This was, however, offset by a reallocation of funds by clients to 
  international products on which the business earns lower fees, and an increase in administration expenses relating to system upgrades. 
  The effective tax rate declined in 2018 due to prior year under provisions recognised in the comparable period, resulting in the 
  disparate growth on a net and gross basis.
- The International business experienced a 19% decline in net result from financial services (2% down on a gross basis). The decline on a
  gross basis is largely attributable to a stronger average Rand exchange rate and lower fee income earned from the Sanlam capital 
  portfolio. The portfolio included significant foreign cash balances in 2017 held as hedging for offshore acquisitions, which were 
  subsequently used to settle the related transactions. Prior year tax under provisions increased the effective tax rate in 2018, resulting
  in the disparate growth on a net and gross basis.
- Sanlam Specialised Finance consists of Sanlam Capital Markets (SCM), including the Central Credit Manager (CCM), Sanlam Portfolio 
  Management (SPM) and Sanlam Structured Solutions (SSS). SPM and SSS achieved strong growth in net result from financial services (10% and
  42% respectively). Good deal flow in SSS and diligent expense management supported the results. SCM experienced a 17% decline in net 
  result from financial services mainly due to the impact of widening credit spreads on debt exposure and after-tax losses of R22 million 
  recognised in respect its Steinhoff exposures. Substantially all Steinhoff listed debt positions have been closed at a realised loss of
  R10 million after tax and a net loss of R12 million after tax was recognised on a residual Steinhoff equity position, the value of which
  is now immaterial.

Santam increased its net result from financial services by an exceptional 70%.

- A benign claims environment in the first half of 2018 contributed to an overall 8,4% underwriting margin for conventional business, which 
  exceeded the upper end of its 4% - 8% target range. This is in sharp contrast to the 4,2% underwriting margin of the comparable 2017
  period, which included abnormal weather-related catastrophe claims of some R100 million after tax and non-controlling interests. The 
  2018 results include claims relating to the listeriosis outbreak early in 2018 of some R40 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
- Investment return on insurance funds (float income) decreased by 11% due to lower investment market returns.
- Santam's share of earnings from the SEM general insurance businesses increased by 42% after tax.

The 26% increase in Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services is the aggregate of 22% organic growth and a 4% contribution from 
the first-time inclusion of ABSA Consultants and Actuaries (ACA), which was acquired effective 1 April 2018.

- Sanlam Employee Benefits' (SEB) contribution increased by 33% (28% excluding ACA). SEB Investments grew earnings by 43% due to lower new 
  business strain (ascribed to lower annuity new business volumes) and favourable annuity mortality experience. Also supporting the results
  were an increase in working capital profit and a decline in administration-related losses.
- The Healthcare business increased its profit contribution by a satisfactory 16%.

Normalised headline earnings of R4,9 billion are 10% up on 2017. This is the combined effect of the 8% increase in net result from 
financial services, an 18% increase in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio, a 4% decline in amortisation of intangible
assets and equity participation costs and a 31% increase in net project expenses.

Net investment return benefited from structural activity as well as interest earned on the capital raised through the accelerated book build.

Net project expenses include Shriram Life Insurance expansion cost of R22 million, due diligence and related costs incurred on investigating
and concluding transactions of R19 million and one-off restructuring and small project costs of R6 million. Shriram Life Insurance is 
incurring an abnormal level of branch establishment costs as it aggressively expands its own distribution footprint. These costs are 
recognised as project expenses while expansion activities are significant relative to the size of the in-force book, to avoid distorting
the underlying operational performance of the business. Once profit releases from the in-force book reach an appropriate size, the costs
will be reallocated to net result from financial services on a prospective basis. The remainder of project expenses are one-off in nature
and related to specific corporate actions.

Normalised attributable earnings increased by 1%. The relatively lower growth in normalised attributable earnings compared to normalised
headline earnings relates to the following:

- A decline in profit recognised on the disposal of subsidiaries and associates from R150 million in 2017 to R3 million in 2018. Disposals
  in the comparable period related mostly to the final liquidation of Santam's former international operations.
- Net equity-accounted non-headline earnings decreased from R173 million in 2017 to a loss of R5 million in 2018. The profit recognised in
  2017 related primarily to the disposal by CIH of a partial stake in Bank Windhoek (refer above).
- Impairments of R74 million were recognised in the first half of 2018 compared to R21 million in the comparable 2017 period. Current year 
  impairments relate primarily to the investments in Letshego and Blue Ink.

Business volumes
New business volumes declined by 1% amidst pressure on new inflows at SI in South Africa. Life insurance new business volumes increased by 
9%, investment business inflows declined by 6% and general insurance earned premiums increased by 12%.

SPF's new business sales increased by 8%, with improved investor confidence reflecting in a recovery in Glacier's single premium performance.

- The Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic business development grew new business volumes by 29%, the combined effect of 34% growth 
  in recurring premium business (68% of total new business sales) and 20% growth in single premiums (32% of total new business sales). 
  Excluding the first-time contribution of BrightRock, new business volumes increased by a pleasing 15% (recurring premiums by 12%).
  Individual Life risk business sales (excluding BrightRock) increased by 1%. Dedicated focus on this line of business over the last few
  years enabled SPF to regain leading market share, contributing to a moderation in growth opportunities as market forces become more
  competitive. Growth was furthermore impacted by pressure on disposable income in the middle-income market. The other lines of business
  achieved overall good growth, with particularly strong sales of recurring premium retirement annuities, single premium endowments and 
  credit life business.
- Sanlam Sky's new business increased by an exceptional 77%. This includes the 2018 annual premium in respect of the recently concluded
  credit life agreement with Capitec Bank of R566 million. Individual life recurring premium new business increased by 12% to R526 million,
  with strong growth of 23% in risk business. Group recurring premium sales (excluding Capitec Bank credit life) declined by 50% from a 
  high base in 2017 to R102 million. The comparable 2017 period included the biennial renewal of the Zionist Christian Church scheme and
  two large schemes written by Safrican. The pipeline of new business at Safrican is promising, with new schemes in excess of R150 million
  already concluded subsequent to 30 June 2018.
- Glacier new business increased by 6%, a welcome turnaround from the declining new business trends in the prior year. As anticipated, the
  mix of business changed to lower margin linked products as investor confidence improved. The LISP business achieved growth of 7%, while 
  demand for traditional life investments were in line with the first half of 2017.

The increase in single premium business had a major positive impact on SPF's net fund inflows, which increased by 71% from R4 billion in 
2017 to R6,8 billion in 2018.

SEM new business volumes increased by 13% (up 7% in constant currency and excluding structural activity).

- New business volumes in Namibia increased by 25%. New life business declined by 14%, with lower affluent market sales more than offsetting
  sterling growth in the more profitable entry-level market. New investment business, which is volatile in nature, increased by 39%.
- In Botswana, new investment business declined by 24% from a high base in 2017 (which reflected a more than 60% increase compared to the 
  first half of 2016). New life business declined marginally, but with a change in mix to the more profitable group life and annuity lines
  of business. Overall new business sales were down 18%.
- Rest of Africa new business volumes grew by 12% (23% in constant currency). Excluding structural activity, new business volumes increased
  by 17% (up 30% in constant currency). Investment business flows were the main driver of the overall growth, with life insurance business 
  under pressure in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. This contributed to a weak VNB performance in the Rest of Africa region (excluding Saham 
  Finances). Tanzanian general insurance earned premiums also disappointed, as highlighted before.
- Saham Finances new business increased by 75%. Structural activity augmented organic growth of 13% in net earned premiums. As indicated
  before, all regions contributed satisfactory growth, apart from Lebanon.
- The Indian life insurance business continued to perform well, growing its new business contribution by 18% in constant currency. The 
  general insurance business experienced more muted growth of 10% in constant currency following a decision to reduce exposure to crop
  business, contributing to overall constant currency growth of 12% on the first half of 2017 (4% at actual exchange rates).
- The Malaysian businesses are showing early signs of a turnaround in performance with overall growth of 5% in new business volumes (2% 
  in constant currency). The life business grew new business volumes by 16% (12% in constant currency), a satisfactory performance compared
  to prior year new business trends. The general insurance business still struggled with a decrease of 6% in net earned premiums (9% in 
  constant currency). The mix of business, however, improved with less reliance on motor cycle business.

Net fund flows increased by 72% from R1,9 billion in 2017 to R3,2 billion in 2018. Most regions contributed to the growth.

After strong new business flows in 2017, SI experienced lower new business volumes in the first half of 2018 with an overall decline of 9%.
As highlighted before, renewed investor confidence has not yet had any positive impact on institutional inflows, while relative under
performance also had a negative impact. The Wealth Management cluster could not match their new business flows of 2017, while the 
International businesses experienced strong growth in their new business flows from our predominantly South African client base. The 
decline in new business also reflects in net fund inflows, which decreased from R9,2 billion in 2017  to R3,4 billion in 2018. The SA 
Investment Management businesses experienced the largest decline from a high base in 2017.

Gross written premiums at Santam increased by 13%. Organic growth was augmented by structural growth from the acquisition of RMB-SI during
2017. Motor and property, which contributes 71% of total gross written premium, increased by a solid 10% in a very competitive market. 
Alternative risk, which includes the RMB-SI business, increased by 44%. Accident and health and guarantee business also grew strongly.
Engineering, liability and transportation are the only lines of business that recorded declines in gross written premiums. Net earned 
premiums increased by 5%, with high levels of reinsurance in the alternative risk and specialised lines. 

Sanlam Corporate new business volumes include life licence investment business with effect from 2018. This business, which was previously
recognised in the SI cluster, is the main driver behind the 25% growth in new business. Life business declined by 9%, the combined effect 
of 13% growth in recurring premiums and a 13% decline in single premiums. Annuity business in particular had a slow start to the year. 
The pipeline of new business for the remainder of the year is promising, with R5 billion of single premium business already concluded 
subsequent to the end of June 2018.

Overall net fund inflows of R17,2 billion in 2018 is a satisfactory performance given the challenging market conditions and a high base 
in 2017.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 20bps and 30bps increase in the South African 
nine- and five-year benchmark rates respectively in 2018 compared to 30 June 2017 resulted in a commensurate increase in the risk discount
rate, with a 2% negative impact on VNB growth. VNB margins were in general maintained on a per product basis, with the decline in average 
margins attributable to a change in mix to less profitable product lines, in particular at Glacier and Sanlam Corporate. The 
underperformance in life new business in SEM's East Africa region also suppressed overall VNB margins.

SPF achieved overall growth of 6% (10% on a comparable economic basis). This includes a first-time contribution by BrightRock of R21 million. 
Sanlam Sky VNB grew by 20%, largely reflective of the individual life new business performance. The VNB contribution from Capitec Bank 
credit life agreement offset the effect of lower new business at Safrican as well as the biennial renewal of the ZCC scheme that was 
included in the 2017 comparable period. Funeral product sales were also recently activated through the Capitec Bank channel, with pleasing 
initial sales volumes. The strong growth in new business at the Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic Business Development supported
their VNB, which increased by 28% excluding BrightRock (47% including BrightRock). Glacier's VNB declined by 20% due to the change in 
business mix to the less profitable linked products.

Net VNB at SEM declined by 12% (down 9% in constant currency). Excluding structural activity, VNB increased by 10% in constant currency. 
All regions contributed strong organic growth, apart from East Africa, where the underperformance in life business had a significant 
negative impact on VNB.

Lower Sanlam Corporate annuity single premium business contributed to a decline in the cluster's VNB. The performance is expected to
improve in the remainder of the year in line with the large new mandates concluded subsequent to 30 June 2018 and a further good pipeline
of new business.

Capital management
The Group started the year with discretionary capital of R2 billion, after allowing for the ABSA Consultants and Actuaries acquisition. A

at 30 June 2018.

Discretionary capital at 30 June 2018                      9 850

Movements in discretionary capital during the first half of 2018 included the following:

- The excess cash operating earnings cover in respect of the dividend paid in 2018.
- Capital of R1,7 billion released from the covered business operations in Sanlam Life. As communicated in the Group's 2017 annual results 
  announcement, capital allocated to the covered business operations on the Sanlam Life balance sheet was reduced by R1,5 billion in the 
  first half of 2018. Investment return earned on the Sanlam Life capital base in the first half of 2018 (R248 million) is also available 
  for release.
- Capital of R5,5 billion was raised through an accelerated book build at the end of March 2018 as partial funding for the acquisition of
  the remaining stake in Saham Finances.
- Corporate activity was limited in the first half of 2018, consuming only R128 million of discretionary capital. The largest transaction 
  concluded was the acquisition of a stake in Phoenix Infraworks, an infrastructure specialist investment manager, for R92 million. This
  acquisition augments the alternative investment classes offering to the SI client base.
- Investment return and other small movements added R82 million.

The acquisition of the remaining stake in Saham Finances will require total funding of R13 billion after allowing for an R864 million 
contribution from Santam to increase its effective interest in Saham Finances from 7% to 10%, which exceeds the current balance of
available discretionary capital. A 5% share issuance is planned to provide the remaining funding and also to restore the discretionary 
capital balance to an appropriate level for funding of bolt-on acquisitions, as outlined in the Executive review.

The Saham Finances acquisition was hedged at an average rate of R13,24. The unrealised fair value gain on the hedging instruments amounted
to R403 million after tax at 30 June 2018. The profit was recognised directly in the Statement of Changes in Equity in terms of the hedge 
accounting applied under IFRS. The eventual profit or loss realised at payment date will be recognised as an adjustment to the acquisition 
price. The investment is expected to meet Sanlam's hurdle rate at the hedged exchange rate, taking cognisance of the expected depreciation 
of the rand against the US$ over the long term.

Solvency
All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of June 2018. The new solvency regime 
(previously referred to as Solvency Assessment and Management) became effective on 1 July 2018 with the promulgation of the new Insurance 
Act, 2017. A Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) target cover range under the new regime of between 1,7 times and 2,1 times has been set for
Sanlam Life Insurance Limited's (Sanlam Life) covered business. The R8 billion of IFRS-based required capital allocated to these operations
at the end of June 2018 translated into a SCR cover of 2,3 times. The SCR cover ratio for the Sanlam Life entity as a whole at 2,9 times
exceeded the covered business ratio at the end of June 2018 due to the inclusion of discretionary and other capital held on the Sanlam Life
balance sheet as well as investments in Santam and other Group operations that are not allocated to Sanlam Life's covered business operations
(i.e. not included in the R8 billion allocated capital referred to above). The Sanlam Group SCR cover ratio of 2,3 times remained broadly in
line with the 2,2 times cover at 31 December 2017. The Group will increasingly focus on the Group SCR cover as the main solvency measure.

Dividend
The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large shareholder base.

Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The preparation of the Group's reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial statements was supervised by the financial director, 
Heinie Werth CA (SA).

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
specifically IAS 34 - interim financial reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, 
Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

The policy liabilities and profit entitlement rules are determined in accordance with prevailing legislation, generally accepted actuarial
practice and the stipulations contained in the demutualisation proposal. There have been no material changes in the financial soundness 
valuation basis since 31 December 2017, apart  from changes in the economic assumptions.

The accounting policies and basis of preparation for the IFRS financial statements and shareholders' information are in all material respects
consistent with those applied in the 2017 annual report apart from the adoption of new IFRSs at the beginning of the 2018 financial year and
the changes in segmental reporting referred to below. The effect of the new IFRSs on the Sanlam Group is described below.

The following new or revised IFRSs and interpretations have been applied in the 2018 financial year:

- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments
  The principles with regards to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, measuring impairment allowances for 
  financial assets, and hedge accounting have been amended due to the implementation of the new accounting standard, IFRS 9 - Financial 
  Instruments, applicable to all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Sanlam has implemented the standard, other than the
  hedging provisions which have not yet been adopted, on a modified retrospective basis and therefore comparatives are not restated and the
  impact of the adoption is recognised in equity on 1 January 2018. The effects of adoption on the Statement of Financial Position as at 
  1 January 2018 are shown in note 10.1 of the condensed interim financial statements.

The key changes introduced by IFRS 9 are as follows:
1. Classification and measurement - financial assets are required to be measured and classified based on the cash flow characteristics of 
   the instrument and the business model under which the asset is managed. The classification and measurement of financial liabilities is 
   largely unchanged, with the exception of the amendment requiring that the own credit risk component of fair value movements on liabilities 
   designated at fair value through profit or loss now be presented in other comprehensive income.
2. Impairment - IFRS 9 introduces an expected credit loss model. This entails the recognition of an allowance for expected credit loss 
   looking one year into the future or over the lifetime of the financial asset if the credit risk relating to the financial asset has 
   increased significantly. The impairment model is therefore 'forward looking', replacing the incurred loss model as previously required 
   by IAS 39.

- IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
  This standard relates to the measurement, classification and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers of the Sanlam Group.

The key factors in the application of IFRS 15 are as follows:

- A five-step model is applied to determine when to recognise revenue from contracts with customers, and at what amount.
- Revenue is recognised when (or as) Sanlam satisfies a performance obligation and transfers control of goods or services to a customer 
  at the amount to which the company expects to be entitled and that is allocated to that specific performance obligation.
- Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time, as or when control of the 
  goods or services is transferred to the customer.
- More extensive and detailed disclosure are required in terms of IFRS 15.

Sanlam has adopted the standard using the modified retrospective basis and therefore comparatives are not restated and the impact of the 
adoption is recognised in equity on 1 January 2018.

Impact on the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15
The Group has assessed the impact that the initial application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 had on its consolidated financial statements. The 
impact of the adoption of these standards on the Group's equity as at 1 January 2018 is based on assessments undertaken across the Group to
date and is summarised below.

IFRS 9
The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a reduction in total equity of R441 million on 1 January 2018. The impact is primarily a result of
the recognition of expected credit losses in associated entities as well as isolated incidents of changes in the classification and 
measurement of certain financial instruments.

The majority of financial assets were measured at fair value through profit and loss under IAS39, and continue to be under IFRS 9, either
because they are mandatorily measured as such, or through designation.

The changes in classification and measurement are as follows:

- Certain financial assets, predominantly interest bearing investments, previously measured at amortised cost under IAS 39, have been
  reclassified to fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9 as the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criterion are no
  longer met. The remeasurement impact on opening retained earnings is an increase of R6 million.
- The change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through 
  profit or loss is presented in other comprehensive income under IFRS 9. In the current period, this portion of the movement in such 
  instruments was immaterial.

Impairment of financial assets
Based on the impairment methodology described above, the Group has determined that the application of IFRS 9's impairment requirements
at 1 January 2018 results in additional impairment allowances in a number if equity-accounted associates.

The total impact on the balance of associates and opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 is negative R428 million. The impact of
applying the expected credit losses model in subsidiary entities resulted in a decrease in net asset value of R19 million.

Disclosure
Additional disclosures in terms of IFRS 9 in respect of changes in classification and measurement will be presented in the annual 
financial statements in accordance with the disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 on the initial application of IFRS 9.

IFRS 15
The Group has assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on opening retained earnings and concluded that there is no quantitative 
impact for Sanlam. Please refer to notes 2 and 3 of the condensed interim financial statements for additional disclosures provided.

The following new or revised IFRSs and interpretations, effective in future years and not early adopted, may have an impact on future results:

- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts (effective 1 January 2021)

  The impact of the application of these revised standards and interpretations in future financial reporting periods on the Group's 
  reported results, financial position and cash flows are still being assessed. The Group is currently engaged in projects to implement 
  the requirements of IFRS 17. The IFRS 17 project is currently focused on finalising gap analyses at this early stage and the Group will 
  provide an update on the expected financial effects in future reporting periods.
 
Changes to segmental reporting are described above.

EXTERNAL REVIEW
The appointed auditors, Ernst & Young Inc, reviewed the interim condensed financial statements and Shareholders' information of the Group
at 30 June 2018. These reviews were conducted in accordance with International Standards on Review Engagements 2410, ""Review of Interim
Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"". Copies of the unqualified review reports of Ernst & Young Inc 
are presented below.

Independent auditors' review report on Sanlam Limited interim Shareholders' information
To the directors of Sanlam Limited

Introduction
We have reviewed the accompanying interim Shareholders' Information of Sanlam Limited for the six months ended 30 June 2018, comprising 
Group Equity Value; Change in Group Equity Value; Return on Group Equity Value; Shareholders' fund at net asset value; Shareholders' fund 
income statement and Notes to the shareholders' fund information as set out below, and the basis of accounting set out above.

Directors' responsibility for interim financial information
The directors of Sanlam Limited are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial information in accordance
with the basis of accounting set out above, for determining that the basis of preparation is acceptable in the circumstances, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial information that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information. We conducted our review in accordance with 
International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, ""Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor 
of the Entity"". ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim
financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the basis of accounting set out above. This standard also
requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial information in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily 
consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate
the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim Shareholders' Information 
for the six months ended 30 June 2018 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of accounting set out above.

Basis of accounting
Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to the Sanlam Limited Shareholders' Information above, which describes the basis of 
accounting. The Sanlam Limited Interim Shareholders' Information is prepared to provide additional information in respect of the Group 
shareholders' fund in a format that corresponds with that used by management in evaluating the performance of the Group. As a result the 
Sanlam Limited Interim Shareholders' information may not be suitable for another purpose.

1.  Earnings per share
For basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the treasury shares held by subsidiaries, 
consolidated investment funds and policyholders. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted weighted 
average number of shares in issue.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the shares not yet issued under the Sanlam 
Share Incentive Scheme and treasury shares held by subsidiaries, consolidated investment funds and policyholders.  Diluted earnings per 
share is calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted diluted weighted average number of shares in issue.

Refer above for normalised earnings per share, which is based on the economic earnings attributable to the shareholders' fund, and in
management's view should also be used when evaluating the Group's economic performance.

9.Fair value disclosures
Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy
Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of 
the inputs used in determining the measurements. It should be noted that these disclosures only cover assets and liabilities measured at
fair value.

Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for
identical assets and liabilities.

Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments
measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are supported by prices from observable current market transactions are 
categorised as level 2.

Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

10.2 Restatement of Group cash flow statement
Management reassessed the presentation of the Group's cash flow statement in respect of cash flows relating to the acquisition and disposal
of investments that back core operations. These were previously classified as investing cash flows which created a disconnect between 
operating and investing cash flows, as the originating insurance and investment contracts cash flows are respectively treated as operating
cash flows. Presenting acquisitions and disposals of investments as part of operating cash flows more accurately reflects to the users of
the financial statements, the link between the ability to generate cash from investment and insurance contracts and the utilisation of these
cash flows on various investments.

Operational Update – June 2018

Operating conditions remained challenging during the first four months of 2018 across a
number of markets where Sanlam operates. Despite these conditions, the Group’s well-
diversified profile enabled us to deliver a satisfactory operational performance for the
four months ended 30 April 2018.

Economic growth in many markets remains below longer-term potential, in particular in
our large South African and Namibian markets where only modest growth is expected
for 2018. In South Africa, business and consumer sentiment improved following the
political changes in December and early 2018. As anticipated, it will take some time for
the improved confidence to transpire into accelerated economic growth. Economic
conditions in Namibia continue to be impacted by liquidity constraints emanating from
its twin deficit, while the economies and currencies of Nigeria and Angola remained
under pressure. The economic outlook in the other Africa regions where the Group
operates is slowly improving, while conditions in India and Malaysia remain robust.

The first four months of 2018 were also characterised by significant volatility in South
African and international investment markets. Global stock markets reached record-
levels during 2017. The South African market also rallied into December 2017, finding
support from the global market performance as well as the favourable outcome of the
ruling party’s elective conference. Optimism improved further with the appointment of
Cyril Ramaphosa as South African president and the subsequent cabinet changes.
Indications were that the South African market would continue its rally following these
developments, but this was short lived as global markets were halted by fears of an
accelerated interest rate hiking cycle by the US Federal Reserve and heightened global
geopolitical risk. This spurred a global stock market sell-off and resulted in a decline
across investment markets at the end of Q1 2018. The South African equity market
recovered somewhat during April 2018, but still recorded negative returns for the first
four months of 2018 compared to positive returns in the comparable period, impacting
negatively on the investment return earned on the Group’s capital portfolio on a relative
basis. South African interest rate markets also reacted positively to the political
developments, with long term rates declining since 31 December 2017.

The sharp strengthening of the Rand exchange rate in 2017 and 2018 is reflecting in a
stronger average exchange rate in 2018 relative to the first four months of 2017,
suppressing the overall translated results of Sanlam Emerging Markets as well as
Sanlam Investments’ international operations.

The acquisition of the remaining interest in Saham Finances is progressing according to
plan. The first phase of funding for the transaction was concluded at the end of March
2018 through an accelerated book build equity issuance. An additional 5% equity

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the four months to 30 April 2018
are:

-         New business volumes of R69 billion, down 3% on the first four months of the
          2017 financial year largely due to lower inflows at Sanlam Investments.

      o    Sanlam Personal Finance achieved overall new business sales growth of 11%.
           Strong growth in the recurring premium sub cluster was augmented by a good
           recovery at Glacier, which benefited from the improved investor sentiment. This
           was, however, partially offset by a decline at Safrican in the entry level market
           from a high base in 2017.

           Sanlam Sky’s more profitable individual life recurring premium risk business
           achieved strong growth of 18% on the comparable 2017 period. Group life risk
           business, however, declined by 59% due to lower new business sales at
           Safrican. Safrican wrote two large new schemes in the first four months of 2017,


                                                                                     2|P age
    which did not repeat in 2018. Overall risk business sales declined by 15% as a
    result.

    New business volumes in the recurring premium business cluster increased by
    29% (16% excluding the structural contribution from BrighRock), the combined
    effect of 35% and 20% growth in recurring and single premiums respectively.
    Individual life risk business experienced pressure in the first four months of 2018,
    increasing by only 1%. The mix within the individual life risk business, however,
    changed to the more profitable lines of business. New savings business sales
    grew by 21%, with most product lines contributing double digit growth.

    As highlighted above, Glacier new business volumes benefited from renewed
    investor sentiment and recorded growth of 11%, but with the mix of business
    changing to the less profitable linked products as anticipated.

o   Sanlam Emerging Markets recorded overall new business growth of 19%,
    including the impact of structural activity (Saham Finances, Sanlam Investments
    East Africa and Ghana disposal) in 2017. In constant currency, new business
    volumes increased by 23% (up 17% in constant currency and excluding
    structural activity). Notwithstanding the difficult economic environment, Namibia
    had a solid start to the year with 18% new business growth in the first four
    months of 2018. Strong growth of 31% in investment business was partially
    offset by a 17% decline in new life business flows. The mix of life business,
    however, changed favourable towards the higher margin entry-level market.

    A recovery in annuity market share in Botswana supported overall growth of 13%
    in new business volumes from this market (15% in constant currency).

    Rest of Africa new business volumes increased by 34% (43% in constant
    currency and 27% excluding structural activity in constant currency). Most
    regions contributed to the growth in constant currency, apart from Malawi, which
    had a slow start to the year. Saham Finances’ new business production was in
    line with the business plan, with the Angola operations in particular holding up
    well in a difficult environment.

    The Indian operations delivered growth of 3% (11% in constant currency) with
    double digit contributions from both the life and general insurance businesses in
    constant currency. The life insurance business in Malaysia achieved some
    traction and reported new business growth of 12% (10% in constant currency)
    during the first four months of 2018. The Malaysian general insurance business
    is still performing below its new business expectations, but its profitability
    improved by more than 20%.

o   Sanlam Investments experienced a 16% decline in new business volumes from a
    high base in 2017. We anticipated that the improved investor sentiment will not
    reflect in institutional inflows before the end of 2018.

o   Sanlam Employee Benefits had a slow start to 2018, experiencing a decline in
    both life recurring premium risk business and single premiums of some 20%. The
    future pipeline of new business appears promising.


                                                                               3|P age
    o   Net value of new life business (“VNB”) increased by 2% (broadly in line with
        2017 excluding structural activity and on a constant economic and currency
        basis). The relatively low level of growth is largely attributable to the change in
        mix of business at Glacier and the lower new business volumes at Safrican and
        Sanlam Employee Benefits, which resulted in a flat VNB performance from the
        South African businesses. Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net VNB increased by
        14% excluding structural activity and on a consistent economic and currency
        basis. Namibia and Botswana experienced strong growth from a low base,
        supported by improved contributions from Saham Finances, India, Malaysia and
        Nigeria. VNB margins have been largely maintained on a per product basis.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R10.1 billion were down on the R12 billion achieved in
        the comparable four-month period in 2017, due to some large outflows from the
        institutional business at Sanlam Investments. SPF achieved a marked
        improvement, reflective of the new business growth at Glacier.

    o   Persistency experience trends remained in line with 2017.

-   Net result from financial services increased by 11% on the first four months of the
    2017 financial year (up 6% in constant currency and excluding structural activity as
    well as the de-monetisation related provision in India in 2017).

    o   Sanlam Personal Finance’s net result from financial services declined by 2%.
        This is due to increased new business strain, the first-time inclusion of
        BrightRock’s operational losses, costs associated with the MiWay Life and Indie
        new initiatives and lower market-related fee income in Glacier from products
        where shareholders share in the underlying portfolio investment returns.
        Excluding these, Sanlam Personal Finance achieved net operating profit growth
        of 7% on the first four months of 2017.

    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net result from financial services increased by 34%,
        with good growth from most key regions. Namibia was the exception, impacted
        by new business strain from the strong entry-level market new business
        performance and persistent high risk claims experience in the group life and
        affluent markets. The comparative 2017 period included provisions of R110
        million (SEM’s share net of tax) relating to de-monetisation in India, which
        supported the overall growth. Saham Finances delivered good growth in
        operating earnings and remains in line with the business plan.

    o Sanlam Investments’ contribution to net result from financial services decreased
      by 4%, attributable to lower performance fees, the impact of the stronger
      average rand exchange rate and a high comparative base in the capital markets
      business.

        The current status of the Group’s exposure to Steinhoff International is as
        follows:

        1. The local bonds held by the Group were redeemed in full, reversing the
           unrealised marked-to-market losses incurred in 2017. These realised gains in


                                                                                   4|P age
           2018 are recognised against the spread risk reserve (SRR) in line with the
           treatment of the 2017 unrealised losses.

        2. The pricing of the foreign bonds improved significantly during 2018. We
           utilised this as an opportunity to substantially exit the EUR26 million exposure
           by the end of May 2018. The bonds were sold at a realised loss of some R14
           million (R10 million after tax) relative to the original cost price. The reversal of
           the unrealised losses incurred in 2017 was recognised against the SRR in
           line with the treatment of the local bonds. The realised loss compared to the
           original cost prices is recognised in net result from financial services, the
           majority of which was included in the April results.

        3. Collateralised lending granted by Sanlam Capital Markets to the Mayfair
           group:
              a. We obtained possession of the 20.7 million Steinhoff shares held as
                  direct pledge for the R804 million loan in 2017. This reduced the
                  outstanding balance of the loan to R655 million (R472 million after
                  tax). 7.2 million of the Steinhoff shares were sold at a profit of R28
                  million in 2018. Unrealised losses of R37 million have been incurred in
                  respect of the remaining 13.5 million Steinhoff shares based on a
                  share price of R1.92. The net after-tax loss of R7 million has been
                  recognised in net result from financial services.

               b. We are party to the S155 processes initiated with creditors of Mayfair
                  Holdings and Mayfair Speculators to recover the remaining loan
                  balance. This process to date indicates that the value of net assets
                  held by these entities will be sufficient to repay the Sanlam Capital
                  Markets loan.

    o   Santam experienced a particularly benign claims environment, compared to the
        first four months of 2017 that included a number of large catastrophe claims.
        This resulted in a substantial increase in its underwriting margin for the four-
        month period to above the 4% to 8% target range. Premium growth was
        acceptable in a tough economic environment.

    o   Sanlam Employee Benefits and Sanlam Healthcare achieved strong growth in
        net result from financial services, supporting overall growth of 22% for the
        Sanlam Corporate Cluster. Sanlam Employee Benefits benefited from lower new
        business strain due to lower new business levels.

-   Normalised headline earnings per share increased by 5% compared to the first four
    months of the 2017 financial year. A relatively weaker investment market
    performance in 2018 supressed the solid growth in net result from financial
    services.

-   Diluted headline earnings per share, which include fund transfers recognised in
    respect of Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, increased by 7%
    compared to the first four months of the 2017 financial year. The additional share
    issuance in April 2018 had a marginal impact on earnings per share due to the
    weighting applied in the year of issuance.


                                                                                      5|P age
Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its Capital Adequacy Requirements under the current solvency regime
5.4 times on 31 March 2018 after allowing for the annual dividend payment to Sanlam
Limited. Under the new Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) regime being
implemented in South Africa, Sanlam Life Insurance’s Solvency Capital Requirement
cover ratio amounted to 2.85 times on 31 March 2018 after the dividend payment to
Sanlam Limited.

The Group had excess capital of R2 billion available for redeployment at the end of
December 2017 after allowing for the acquisition of Absa Consultants and Actuaries,
which was finalised in the first four months of 2018. No other significant transactions
were concluded during the period.

The Saham Finances acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals, which is
expected in the second half of the year.

The discretionary capital portfolio was augmented in the first four months of 2018 by the
new share issuance in April (R5.5 billion after allowing for the dividend payable in
respect of the new shares), the excess dividend cover relating to the dividend payment
in April 2018 (R690 million) and the release of R1.5 billion from the capital allocated to
the South African life insurance operations (as indicated in the 2017 results
announcement). This increased the level of available discretionary capital to R9.6 billion
at 30 April 2018. This capital has been earmarked for the Saham Finances acquisition,
which will require cash resources of R13.9 billion based on the average hedged rate of
$1/R13.24. The deficit will be funded from short term debt facilities as previously
communicated to the market. A second share issuance of some 5% is planned for the
second half of the year, with the intention to use it as an opportunity to further enhance
the Group’s empowerment credentials. Proceeds from this issuance will be used to
redeem the short term debt facilities and to augment the discretionary capital pool. We
intend proposing the planned share issuance to shareholders for approval in the fourth
quarter of 2018.


Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain subdued in our
largest markets for the remainder of 2018 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key
operational performance indicators. The improved investor sentiment in South Africa is,
however, expected to support new business growth in Glacier and Sanlam Investments
during the remainder of the year.

The change in mix to less profitable lines of business in Glacier is expected to continue.
Sanlam Personal Finance’s new business volumes and VNB will benefit from the newly
concluded funeral and credit life underwriting arrangements with Capitec, an exciting
new growth initiative. Sanlam Employee Benefits’ VNB performance will similarly benefit
from the new business pipeline referred to above.




                                                                                  6|P age
Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and
the level of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on the
growth in net result from financial services, normalised headline earnings and Group
Equity Value to be reported for the first half of the 2018 financial year.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Sanlam’s interim financial results for the six months ending
30 June 2018 are due to be released on 5 September 2018. Shareholders are advised
that this is not a trading statement as per paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements.

                                    Results of Placing

Sanlam is pleased to announce the completion of the placing announced on 27 March
2018 (the ""Placing"").

A total of 65 517 241 new ordinary shares (the ""Placing Shares"") in the Company have
been placed by J.P. Morgan Securities plc (""J.P. Morgan"") and Deutsche Bank AG.
London Branch (“Deutsche Bank”) (the ""Joint Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners"") with institutional investors at a price of ZAR87.00 per Placing Share (the
""Placing Price"") raising gross proceeds of approximately ZAR5 700 million. The Placing
Price represents a discount of 5.0% to the closing share price of a Sanlam ordinary share
on Tuesday, 27 March 2018 and represents a discount of 6.8% to the 30-day volume
weighted average price as of 27 March 2018. The Placing Shares being issued represent
approximately 3.0% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital of 2 166 471 806
prior to the Placing.

The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects
with the existing ordinary shares of the share capital of the Company, including the right
to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of
issue of the Placing Shares.

Subject to the approval by the JSE Limited (“JSE”), listing and trading of the Placing
Shares on the exchange operated by the JSE (""Admission"") is expected to commence at
09h00 on Tuesday, 3 April 2018. Investors will receive Placing Shares listed and
trading on the JSE. In addition, subject to approval by Namibian Stock Exchange
Limited, the Placing Shares will also be listed on the Namibian Stock Exchange. The
Placing is conditional upon, among other things, Admission becoming effective and the
placing agreement not being terminated in accordance with its terms prior to Admission.


Total issued ordinary share capital

Following Admission becoming effective, the Company's issued share capital will
comprise 2 231 989 047 ordinary shares. This figure may be used by shareholders in the
Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are
required to notify their beneficial interest in, or a change to their beneficial interest in, the
Company’s ordinary shares under section 122 of the South African Companies Act, 71
of 2008 (""South African Companies Act"").

No action has been taken that would permit an offering of the Placing Shares or

purpose is required.

This announcement does not constitute or form part of an offer for sale or solicitation of
an offer to purchase or subscribe for securities in the United States, Australia, Canada,
Japan or any other jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. The
Placing Shares have not been and will not be registered under the the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (""Securities Act"") or under the securities laws of any
state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered, sold or transferred,

United Kingdom or elsewhere.

In member states of the European Economic Area (""EEA"") which have implemented the
Prospectus Directive (each, a ""Relevant Member State""), this announcement and any
offer of Placing Shares if made subsequently is directed exclusively at persons who are
""qualified investors"" within the meaning of the Prospectus Directive (""EEA Qualifying
Investors""). For these purposes, the expression ""Prospectus Directive"" means Directive

implemented in a Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing

respect of the Placing. As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance

Information to distributors

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU
Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (""MiFID II""); (b)
Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing
MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the ""MiFID II Product
Governance Requirements""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in
tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II
Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Placing
Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such
Placing Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and
investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as
defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as

Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Placing Shares
may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Placing Shares
offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Placing
Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital
protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other
adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who
have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The
Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual,
legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an
assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a
recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take
any other action whatsoever with respect to the Placing Shares.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the Placing Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

27 March 2018

                                    Sanlam Limited
         Proposed placing of new ordinary shares to raise up to ZAR 5,700 million

Sanlam today announces its intention to conduct a non pre-emptive cash placing of new ordinary
shares in the Company (the ""Placing Shares"") to institutional investors, as at the date of this
announcement (the ""Placing""), to raise up to ZAR5,700 million of gross proceeds based on the
closing share price as at 27 March 2018.

On 8 March 2018, Sanlam and Santam Limited announced that final agreements had been
concluded to acquire an additional 53.37% shareholding in SAHAM Finances S.A. (“Saham”),
increasing their stake, via Sanlam Emerging Markets Ireland Limited (“SEMIL”), to 100% (the
“Saham Acquisition”). SEMIL first acquired a 30% stake in Saham in February 2016 and
subsequently acquired a further 16.63% stake in May 2017, bringing the total held by SEMIL in
Saham prior to the implementation of the Saham Acquisition to 46.63%.

The net proceeds from the placing will be used to part fund the Saham Acquisition. If the placing
and the Saham Acquisition had been implemented by 31 December 2017, Sanlam’s group
solvency ratio (as measured by the Solvency Assessment and Management regime currently being
implemented in South Africa and expected to be effective from 1 July 2018) would have reduced
by approximately 0.13 times from the 2.18 times cover ratio as at that date. The placing will allow
Sanlam to maintain a conservative level of leverage.

The implementation of the Saham Acquisition remains subject to the fulfilment or waiver, as the
case may be, of a number of conditions precedent including, inter alia, the receipt of all necessary
regulatory approvals and the implementation by SAHAM S.A. of a corporate restructure in order
to divest itself of all its investment holdings, assets and liabilities other than the Saham interest. In
the event that the Saham Acquisition does not complete, post the completion of the Placing, the
net proceeds will be added to available discretionary capital of the Company.

The Placing is being conducted through an accelerated bookbuild process (the “Bookbuild”),
which will be launched immediately following this announcement. J.P. Morgan Securities plc,
which conducts its South African investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan (""J.P. Morgan"")
and Deutsche Bank AG. London Branch (“Deutsche Bank”) are acting as joint global coordinators
and joint bookrunners (the ""Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners"") in respect of
the Placing. The Bookbuild will open with immediate effect following this announcement.

The Placing will be made outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and inside the US to qualified
institutional buyers within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as amended in
transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. In South Africa, the
Placing will only be made by way of separate private placements to: (i) selected persons falling
within one of the specified categories listed in section 96(1)(a) of the South African Companies
Act, 71 of 2008, as amended (""South African Companies Act""); and (ii) selected persons, acting
as principal, acquiring Placing Shares for a total acquisition cost of R1,000,000 or more, as
contemplated in section 96(1)(b) of the South African Companies Act (""South African
Qualifying Investors"").

The Placing Shares will be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its existing
general authority to issue shares for cash, granted by shareholders at the annual general meeting
of the Company held on Wednesday, 7 June 2017.

The price per ordinary share at which the Placing Shares will be placed (the ""Placing Price"") will
be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild, the Placing
Price and allocations are at the discretion of the Company and the Joint Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners. The Placing Price will be announced as soon as practicable on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") after the close of
the Bookbuild.

The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with
the existing ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company, including the right to receive all
dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue of the Placing
Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, the Placing Shares are being offered cum dividend and
investors who will be allocated shares as part of the Placing will be eligible to receive the 2017
dividend to be paid by the Company on Monday, 9 April 2018.

Subject to the approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placing Shares on the JSE
(""Admission"") is expected to commence at 09h00 Tuesday, 3 April 2018 (or such time and/or
date as may be agreed between the Company and the Joint Global Coordinators and Joint
Bookrunners). Investors will receive Placing Shares listed and trading on the JSE. In addition,
subject to approval by Namibian Stock Exchange Limited, the Placing Shares will also be listed
on the Namibian Stock Exchange.The Placing is conditional upon, amongst other things,
Admission becoming effective and the placing agreement between the Company and the Joint
Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners not being terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to Admission.

Pursuant to the terms of the placing agreement, Sanlam has agreed to customary lock-up
arrangements for a period of 120 days from the date of the Placing.

District of Columbia), Australia, Canada or Japan or any other jurisdiction where such an
announcement would be unlawful. The distribution of this announcement may be restricted by law
in certain jurisdictions and persons into whose possession this announcement or other information
referred to herein comes should inform themselves about and observe any such restriction. Any
failure to comply with these restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any
such jurisdiction. No action has been taken that would permit an offering of the Placing Shares or
possession or distribution of this announcement in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose
is required.

This announcement does not constitute or form part of an offer for sale or solicitation of an offer
to purchase or subscribe for securities in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan or any other
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. The Placing Shares have not been
and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state or other
jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered, sold or transferred, directly or indirectly,
in or into the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable
securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States. There is no public offering
of the Placing Shares in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere.

In member states of the European Economic Area (""EEA"") which have implemented the
Prospectus Directive (each, a ""Relevant Member State""), this announcement and any offer of
Placing Shares if made subsequently is directed exclusively at persons who are ""qualified
investors"" within the meaning of the Prospectus Directive (""EEA Qualifying Investors""). For
these purposes, the expression ""Prospectus Directive"" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and
amendments thereto, including Directive 2010/73/EU, to the extent implemented in a Relevant
Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State.
In the United Kingdom, this announcement is directed exclusively at, and any investment or

amended) (the ""Order""); or (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Order, and/or (iii) other persons to whom an offer of the Placing Shares may otherwise be lawfully
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as ""UK Relevant Persons""). Persons
in the United Kingdom who are not UK Relevant Persons and persons in other Relevant Member
States who are not EEA Qualifying Investors should not take any action on the basis of this
announcement and should not act or rely on it.

In South Africa, the Placing will only be made by way of separate private placements to: (i)
selected persons falling within one of the specified categories listed in section 96(1)(a) of the South
African Companies Act; and (ii) selected persons, acting as principal, acquiring Placing Shares for

offer to the public as contemplated in the South African Companies Act; (ii) this announcement
does not, nor does it intend to, constitute a “registered prospectus” or an “advertisement”, as
contemplated by the South African Companies Act; and (iii) no prospectus has been filed with the
South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (""CIPC"") in respect of the
Placing. As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance and form requirements
for a prospectus set out in the South African Companies Act and the South African Companies
Regulations of 2011, and has not been approved by, and/or registered with, the CIPC, or any other
South African authority.

in section 1(3)(a) of the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of
2002, as amended and should not be construed as an express or implied recommendation, guide
or proposal that any particular transaction in respect of the Placing Shares or in relation to the
business or future investments of Sanlam, is appropriate to the particular investment objectives,
financial situations or needs of a prospective investor, and nothing in this announcement should
be construed as constituting the canvassing for, or marketing or advertising of, financial services
in South Africa.
No prospectus or offering document has been or will be prepared in connection with the Placing.
Any investment decision in connection with the Placing must be made on the basis of all publicly
available information relating to Sanlam's shares. Such information has not been independently

This announcement does not purport to identify or suggest the risks (direct or indirect) which may
be associated with an investment in Sanlam's ordinary shares.

Information to distributors

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive
2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10
of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local
implementing measures (together, the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements""), and
disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any
""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may
otherwise have with respect thereto, the Placing Shares have been subject to a product approval
process, which has determined that such Placing Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target
market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible
counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution
channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Target Market Assessment""). Notwithstanding the
Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Placing Shares may
decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Placing Shares offer no
guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Placing Shares is compatible
only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone
or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any
losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the
requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment
of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any
investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with
respect to the Placing Shares.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Placing Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Notes
(1) Normalised headline earnings = headline earnings, excluding fund transfers.
(2) The main contributor to the variance in growth between normalised headline earnings and diluted headline earnings is
    the one-off deferred tax asset recognised in 2016 in respect of assessed losses in the South African policyholders' fund
    upon the introduction of the Risk Policy Fund.
(3) PVNBP = present value of new business premiums and is equal to the present value of new recurring premiums plus single premiums.
(4) New covered business margin = value of new covered business as a percentage of PVNBP.
(5) Growth in Group Equity Value per share (with dividends paid, capital movements and cost of treasury shares acquired 
    reversed) as a percentage of Group Equity Value per share at the beginning of the year.

Executive review

Sanlam's strategy has remained largely unchanged since 2003. We highlighted before that our strategy is by no means unique, 
but that our ability to execute has set us apart from our peers. This diligent focus on execution enabled us to achieve
satisfactory growth in 2017 and double-digit average growth rates in most key performance indicators over the last 10 years.

(1) Margin for 2007 financial year

We anticipated that we would face significant headwinds in 2017. Our core South African market has experienced
significant political and policy uncertainty since 2015, which severely suppressed business and investor confidence.
Private sector investment largely stalled as a result, with the economy entering a period of pedestrian growth.Downgrades 
in South Africa's sovereign credit ratings to below investment grade amidst regular reports of the extent of corruption
in the country, dealt further blows to an already fragile environment. This largely prevented South Africa from sharing 
in the benefits of an improved global economic environment. Sentiment changed abruptly in December 2017 following the
outcome of the African National Congress' national elective conference and renewed optimism that South Africa's challenges
will be addressed through close cooperation between government, business and labour. The local equity and bond markets 
responded with year-end rallies after remaining subdued for a large part of the year. The rand also strengthened further
from its end-2016 closing position, contributing to much stronger average exchange rates in 2017 against most of the 
major currencies.

The economies of oil-dependent countries where we operate, in particular Nigeria and Angola, experienced pressure from
low oil prices, negatively affecting economic growth, currency exchange rates and liquidity. High levels of government
debt in Namibia impacted on public sector expenditure, liquidity in the banking sector and economic growth. Operating
conditions elsewhere where we operate were, however, in general more supportive of growth in 2017. India in particular
started to recover from demonetisation and the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, while non-oil commodity-based
economies benefited from improved terms of trade.

The following also impacted on our performance in 2017:

- The South African general insurance market experienced the highest level of weather-related claims in recorded history
  during 2017. Santam, being the largest general insurer in South Africa, commensurately experienced a significant
  deterioration in the underwriting results of its property line of business.
- Internal challenges in Kenya and Malaysia have not been fully resolved, affecting both top-line and operational earnings
  growth in these countries. Internal challenges in Kenya are being addressed, while Malaysia has launched a number of
  operational initiatives to improve performance. Both countries have significant future growth potential and turnaround
  strategies in these operations are high on the agenda for Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM) management.

Despite these challenges, the Group delivered robust overall growth in all key performance indicators. Progress on all
strategic pillars contributed to the resilient performance.

Group Equity Value

GEV amounted to R121.8 billion or 5 940 cents per share at 31 December 2017. Including the dividend of 268 cents per
share paid during the year, a RoGEV per share of 14.8% was achieved for 2017. This exceeded the 13.2% target for the
year, due to strong growth in VNB and positive experience variances, investment market returns in excess of long-term
assumptions, lower risk discount rates (RDR) and profit realised on the disposal of the Enterprise Group in Ghana. These
factors more than offset the negative effect of a stronger rand exchange rate, write-off of goodwill recognised in
respect of the BrightRock, Saham Finances and Rwandan acquisitions in terms of the EV methodology, as well as IFRS
impairments of the investments in Pacific & Orient and Letshego that also affects RoGEV. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which
excludes the impact of higher investment return than the long-term assumptions, interest rate changes and other one-off
effects not under management control, and assuming normalised exchange rate movements, amounted to 15.8% - well in excess
of the target.

South African nine-year and five-year long-term interest rates declined by 20bps and 60bps respectively in 2017, with a
corresponding decline in the RDR used to value the Group's South African businesses for GEV purposes. A discounted cash
flow (DCF) valuation basis is used for essentially all of the Group's operations, with the decline in RDR having a
positive effect on the end-2017 valuations and RoGEV for 2017. This positive impact was augmented by a relatively
stronger equity market performance, which supported assets under management and hence GEV valuations at SI and SPF. After
strengthening significantly in 2016, the rand ended the year slightly stronger against most of the currencies where we
operate.

The Group's covered business operations achieved a good overall performance, exceeding the Group hurdle rate by a healthy
margin, despite the economic headwinds faced in a number of countries during 2017. Most businesses achieved returns in 
excess of 20%, with the notable exception being Sanlam UK, which was affected by the stronger rand exchange rate. The main 
items contributing to the return from covered business are:

- Expected return on covered business declined in 2017 relative to 2016 based on the lower RDR applied at the end of 2016.
- Value of new covered business: The strong new business performance in 2016 persisted into 2017, despite the challenging 
  conditions in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. VNB benefited from the change in mix to more profitable business and 
  contributed 3.6% to the overall return.
- Operating experience variances increased markedly in 2017. Particularly satisfactory is the improved diversification in
  the source of positive experience. Risk experience was broadly in line with 2016, despite weaker claims experience in 
  Namibia and SEB. Similarly, our businesses did well to maintain robust persistency experience under challenging conditions.
  Our South African middle income market reflected some deterioration in some products, which was largely offset by good
  persistency at Sanlam Sky and successful premium updates at SEB. SEB was able to increase premium rates following the weak 
  claims experience in 2016 while retaining clients. The Central Credit Manager (CCM) is optimising the Group's exposure to
  credit assets, which contributed to a significant increase in positive credit spread experience. As highlighted before,
  the embedded value of covered business does not capitalise any future profits to be earned by the CCM, while only partial
  allowance is made for SPF and SEB's profit sharing. Most of the credit spread profit is therefore recognised as experience 
  variances. Other experience variances include the decline in cost of capital following the release of capital from the 
  South African covered business operations (refer Capital management section below).
- Operating assumption changes had a negative effect on RoGEV in 2017. Assumptions were relaxed in certain areas of 
  consistently strong positive risk experience where the actuarial basis has moved too far from actual experience. The 
  persistency basis was strengthened in line with the 2017 experience. The maintenance expense assumption changes relate
  largely to a strengthening in the unit cost assumptions applied to the closed book in SPF. In addition to various modelling
  improvements, one-off expense allowances were also increased in line with new regulatory requirements, in particular the 
  introduction of IFRS17, the new insurance accounting standard issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, 
  effective 2021.
- The RDR's declined to a lesser extent in 2017 than 2016, contributing to a lower RoGEV from economic assumption changes.
- The relatively stronger investment market performance in 2017 is the main driver behind the improved contribution from 
  investment variances, which supported assets under management and commensurately fee income earned in 2017 and into the 
  future. Investment return earned on the capital portfolio was in line with expectations, as the largest part of the portfolio
  is invested in hedged equities.
- On a relative basis, the rand strengthened by a significantly lower margin than in 2016, with a commensurately lower negative
  impact from foreign currency translation differences.

The main components contributing to the return on other Group operations are:

Weighted return on other Group operations                    12,9      10,5

Other Group operations achieved a return of 12.9%. The following impacted on RoGEV in 2017:

- Modelling changes had a negative impact of some R460 million on the valuation of the South African investment management 
  businesses.
- The Shriram Capital valuations benefited from a relaxation of the prudent assumptions applied at the end of 2016 in the
  aftermath of demonetisation. This was to some extent offset by lower valuations of Letshego and Pacific & Orient in Malaysia
  following their operational under performance (refer below) and foreign currency translation losses recognised in respect 
  of the investment in Saham Finances.

The Group's investment in Santam is valued at its listed share price, which achieved a strong return of 18% in 2017.

The low return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:

- Net corporate expenses of R115 million recognised in net result from financial services.
- A relatively low level of return earned on the portfolio's exposure to low yielding liquid assets.
- Hedging of the Saham Finances transactions (including the additional 16.6% stake acquired during 2017 and the anticipated 
  acquisition of the remaining 53.4% interest in 2018). (Refer Capital management section below.) The transactions were 
  partly hedged through forward exchange contracts and the acquisition of foreign currency, which earns a very low rate 
  of interest due to the US Dollar denomination. The marked-to-market differences on the hedging instruments of R562 million
  after tax, that were recognised in other comprehensive income in terms of IFRS, were excluded from RoGEV as these will be 
  capitalised against the investment once finalised in 2018.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R8.5 billion increased by 7% on 2016 (10% in constant 
currency), with substantial growth in SEM and Sanlam Investments' (SI) contributions.

Structural activity that influenced growth in 2017 included the following:

- The acquisition of a 30% stake in Saham Finances at the end of February 2016, followed by an additional 16.6% investment
  in May 2017;
- 23% direct stakes acquired in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General Insurance at the end of September 2016;
- The disposal of SEM's interests in the Enterprise Group in Ghana with effect from 1 July 2017;
- The acquisition of a 75% interest in PineBridge's East African investment management business, effective July 2017; and
- The acquisition of a 53% interest in BrightRock with effect from October 2017.

Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) achieved strong growth in new recurring premium risk business, contributing to a 13%
increase in new business strain recognised in terms of Sanlam's prudent accounting policies. This suppressed operational
earnings growth at SPF, while Santam's performance was depressed by the abnormally large catastrophe events during June
and October 2017. Excluding these, net result from financial services increased by 10% (12% in constant currency):

SPF delivered a solid performance for a mature business in an environment of stagnant economic growth, low investor 
confidence and a lacklustre equity market performance for a large part of 2017. The restructuring of SPF into a more agile
and focused business was largely completed in 2017. SPF now comprises of the following main businesses:

- Sanlam Sky, which focuses on funeral insurance business.
- Recurring premiums sub cluster, which is responsible for all recurring premium risk and savings business. Included in 
  the sub cluster are: Sanlam Individual Life (traditional recurring premium risk business), Sanlam Savings (traditional 
  recurring premium savings business), Closed Book, BrightRock, MiWay Life and Indie.
- Glacier, which incorporates single premium life investments and the Linked Investment Savings Plan platform (LISP).
- Strategic business development, which focuses on Sanlam Personal Loans, Sanlam Reality and is an incubator for new initiatives.

The profit contribution from each business unit is presented in the following table:

As indicated, SPF's operational earnings for 2017 were impacted by a 13% rise in new business strain. BrightRock in addition
added a maiden loss of R32 million in 2017, as this business is still in its growth phase, with profits released from the 
in-force book not sufficient to fully offset its new business strain. Excluding these, SPF's net result from financial services
increased by 9%.

Sanlam Sky grew its profit contribution by 3%. Excluding additional new business strain, its gross result from financial
services increased by 10%. Mortality experience weakened slightly, albeit still positive overall, while positive expense 
assumption changes recognised in 2016 did not repeat in 2017. These contributed to R67 million lower earnings in 2017 relative
to 2016.

The Recurring premium sub cluster's gross result from financial services declined by 4%. Excluding additional new business 
strain and the BrightRock maiden contribution, the gross result from financial services was 6% higher than 2016. The relatively
low level of growth is largely attributable to the following:

- Benefit improvements for accidental injury cover products and improved persistency experience that resulted in a lower 
  release of reserves, in particular in respect of level premium business, suppressed profit growth from Risk business;
- Lacklustre investment market performance for a large part of the year limited growth in the average level of assets under 
  management and commensurately asset-based fee income earned from Savings business and the Closed Book;
- Investments in MiWay Life and Indie of R113 million in 2017 compared to R80 million in 2016;
- Partly offset by the reallocation of administration costs to Glacier (refer below).

Glacier achieved sterling growth of 17%. Life investments achieved profit growth of 29%, largely due to positive annuity 
mortality experience and spread risk reserve releases. The LISP business's profit declined by 5%. Growth in average assets
under management slowed down following lower net fund flows and weak investment market performance during the year. A reallocation
of administration costs from the Recurring premium sub cluster to Glacier also occurred as part of the restructuring in 2017.

Strategic business development (SBD) profits increased by 3%. Growth in the size of the Sanlam Personal Loans book supported
13% growth in the business's profit contribution. Bad debt experience remained broadly in line with 2016. Net losses of 
R24 million were incurred in respect of other SBD activities, mostly related to initiatives aimed at further embedding and
improving the benefits and attractiveness of the Reality loyalty scheme.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by 15% including structural activity and exchange rate differences. Organic
growth in constant currency amounted to 10%.

Namibia's net result from financial services increased by 14% (down 7% on a gross basis). Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH) 
sold 14.5% of its stake in Bank Windhoek during the year, resulting in Bank Windhoek becoming an associate of CIH. CIH's 
participation in Bank Windhoek's earnings is commensurately equity accounted on a net basis from the transaction date and not
consolidated on a gross basis as in the past. This is the main contributor to the variance in the level of growth in Namibia's 
gross and net result from financial services. The performance of the life businesses improved since June 2017 as group life 
claims experience stabilised. Mismatch profits also increased compared to 2016. Bank Windhoek's profit contribution declined, 
attributable to the lower effective stake in the business as well as higher cost of capital and lower interest income emanating
from the liquidity pressure experienced by Namibian banks.

The Botswana operations achieved mixed results with an overall decline of 6% in net result from financial services (-1% in
constant currency). Life insurance profit declined by 12% (8% in constant currency) due to lower annuity new business volumes 
and asset mismatch losses recognised following credit-related provisions. Letshego, the second largest profit contributor, 
achieved growth of 5% (10% in constant currency). This was lower than expectations, due to low growth in advances and an 
increase in provisioning in respect of its East African exposure. The underperformance contributed to an impairment charge 
of R103 million against the carrying value of SEM's effective interest in Letshego (refer below). The asset base of the 
investment management business benefited from the large new mandate awarded by the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund (BPOPF)
in 2016, supporting 17% growth in its profit contribution (23% in constant currency).

The Rest of Africa operations achieved growth of 26% in net result from financial services. Excluding the structural impact 
of the Saham Finances and PineBridge acquisitions and the disposal of the Enterprise Group investments in Ghana, net result
from financial services decreased by 5% (up 20% in constant currency). All businesses achieved growth in excess of 20% in 
constant currencies, apart from Kenya and Tanzania that reported declines in operating earnings. Kenya continues to experience
cost pressures from low new business volumes, aggravated by one-off net credit-related provisions of some R20 million in 2017. 
Tanzania also underperformed due to lower new business volumes. Saham Finances tracked the business plan, contributing net
result from financial services of R243 million in 2017 (R264 million in constant currency) compared to R88 million in 2016. 
Structural activity is the main contributor to the significant increase in Saham Finances contribution.

Net result from financial services in India rose 42% (54% in constant currency); 19% (29% in constant currency) excluding 
profit contributed by the 23% direct stakes acquired in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General Insurance during 2016.
Shriram Transport Finance fully recovered from the impact of demonetisation in 2016 and grew its profit contribution by 38% 
(48% in constant currency). Double digit growth in the size of the loan book, recoveries from the equipment finance book and
cost efficiency gains supported the strong performance. Shriram City Union Finance was more severely impacted by demonetisation
as well as the introduction of Goods and Services Tax in 2017, given its exposure to small and medium enterprises. One-off 
consulting costs and higher minimum wages also placed pressure on its profit contribution, which declined by 28% (23% in 
constant currency). The insurance businesses recorded strong growth in operating earnings as their in-force books continue
to expand. The Shriram General Insurance results were also positively impacted by R95 million of net realised profits 
recognised on the disposal of held-to-maturity fixed-interest instruments included in the float portfolio. Due to these 
disposals, the remaining held-to-maturity instruments in the portfolio are also required to be valued at fair value in terms
of IFRS. The unrealised fair value gains on these instruments of R241 million (SEM's share) are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the Statement of Changes in Equity, and will be recycled to net result from financial services and 
the IFRS Statement of Comprehensive Income on disposal.

The Malaysian businesses had another disappointing year. Net result from financial services declined
by 61% (48% in constant currency), the aggregate of a 56% decline in general insurance earnings and a 4%
lower contribution from the life insurance business. Growth in general insurance business premiums remained
under pressure, with insufficient diversification of the product lines and further losses of market share
in the core motorcycle market. The comparable 2016 period included one-off IBNR releases that furthermore increased the 
comparative base. Focus remains on product innovation and branding initiatives to regain market share and to expand its 
product lines. De-tariffing of the general insurance industry in the second half of 2017 did not have a significant impact
on relative market pricing. The life insurance business continues to be under pressure from low new business production,
resulting in negative expense experience. Weaker mortality claims experience also affected the 2017 earnings. 

SI achieved overall growth of 12% in its net result from financial services (17% in constant currency), with sterling
performances from Capital Management and the International businesses.

The Investment Management SA net result from financial services declined by 20% on 2016, attributable to the following:

- A R47 million after tax decline in performance fees. Some R40 million of the decline relates to performance fees earned 
  by the Private Equity business in 2016 from the listing of Dis-Chem, with the remainder attributable to a relatively lower 
  level of outperformance of the relevant benchmarks.
- Low growth in the average level of assets managed on behalf of the Sanlam life businesses. Net outflows from the legacy
  life book persisted, while the redeployment of discretionary capital further reduced assets under management. The legacy 
  life book managed by SI is running off while SPF's open architecture approach results in only  portion, albeit increasing,
  of its new business being managed by SI. A weak equity market performance in the first half of the year aggravated the 
  pressure on fee income earned from these portfolios, which declined by some 9%.
- The establishment of the CCM resulted in a reallocation of earnings of R12 million (after tax) from the SA Investment
  Management business to Capital Management.

These factors were partly offset by good growth in fees from third party and collective investment portfolios, which
benefited from good net inflows during 2016 and 2017. Key focus areas to mitigate the impact of anticipated further outflows 
from the legacy life book include:

- Growing third party inflows as well as the share of open architecture business managed on behalf of SPF;
- Expanding capabilities in alternative asset classes to attract new inflows; and
- Stringent focus on cost efficiencies.

As indicated to the market in December 2017, Sanlam Investments' exposure to Steinhoff International (Steinhoff) equity 
instruments in Sanlam and third party portfolios was largely at or slightly above its index weighting. The collapse in the 
Steinhoff share price in December 2017 will therefore not have a disproportional impact on future fee income.

Wealth Management net result from financial services increased by 14%, supported by strong growth in performance fees and
lower start-up losses incurred in new business units.

The International business experienced a sharp turnaround in profitability following the restructuring in 2016. Net result
from financial services grew by 92% (116% in constant currency). Fee income benefited from the rise in global equity markets,
augmented by a lower recurring cost base after the restructuring. The comparable period also included one-off restructuring costs.

Capital Management achieved 19% growth in its net result from financial services. One-off income from equity structuring and
financing deals and the revaluation of property finance deals contributed some R50 million (after tax). Sanlam's largest
exposure to Steinhoff instruments are within the Capital Management business:

- Steinhoff equities serve as partial security for some of the loans granted by the collateralised lending business. 
  The maximum exposure, attaching no value to any security held, amounts to R580 million after tax. Significant progress has
  been made since December 2017 to obtain additional security and updated valuations for the security instruments. Allowing 
  for the current best estimate value of security held, an after-tax adjustment of R37 million was raised in respect of this 
  exposure. The eventual security value realised may differ from current best estimates with a potential positive or negative
  earnings impact in 2018.
- The non-participating policyholder portfolios managed by the CCM have exposure to foreign debt instruments of R368 million,
  which reflected an unrealised marked-to-market (MTM) decline of R157 million at 31 December 2017. These portfolios also have
  exposure to South African debt instruments of R771 million, which traded at unrealised MTM declines of R71 million. The MTM 
  declines from these exposures were largely absorbed by discretionary margins held by the Group for such events. In the absence
  of actual defaults,the MTM declines will reverse up to the maturity date of the instruments. The utilisation of these margins
  did not affect GEV, as no value has been placed thereon in the Embedded Value of Covered Business.

Santam did exceptionally well to increase its net result from financial services by 5% despite the major catastrophe events 
highlighted before. Underwriting results increased by 1%, while the contributions from float income and SEM investments 
grew by 5% and 50% respectively.

An underwriting margin of 6% was achieved in 2017 (6.4% in 2016) including the catastrophe events, which decreased underwriting 
profit by R156 million after tax and non-controlling interest. The 2017 performance is in the middle of the target range of
4% to 8%, testimony to the resilience of its diversified insurance book. Net earned premiums increased by 8%, while the
combined administration cost and float margin ratio remained broadly in line with 2016.

Santam Commercial and Personal experienced the costliest 12 months for natural catastrophe losses in Santam's history. 
The business was challenged by the Western Cape storms, devastating Garden Route fires, further large commercial and corporate
fire claims and flash flooding, and hail events in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Underwriting margins were under less pressure
than expected due to the benefits of the diversified portfolio and reinsurance support. Santam Commercial and Personal's 
year-on-year premium growth showed a significant increase mainly due to book acquisitions and dedicated focus on the Sanlam 
tied advisors and Santam Direct. There was a sustained focus on improving the profitability of the business, in particular
the commercial property business.

Santam Specialist has a leadership position across most segments in which it operates and leverages this position across
distribution channels and specialist intermediaries. The Santam Specialist business experienced competitive trading
conditions, and underwriting results were negatively impacted by a number of large corporate property claims. The
engineering class of business achieved excellent underwriting results with limited claims activity during 2017. The
liability class was impacted by a number of large claims and estimate adjustments, and reported underwriting results
significantly lower than the strong results achieved in 2016. The crop insurance business was negatively affected by
significant hail claims during the weekend of 30 December 2017; it, however, still achieved an excellent underwriting
result, mainly due to low incidents of drought claims during this period.

MiWay delivered solid premium growth on the back of new business offerings, although a slowdown in growth occurred during
the second half of the year due to the increased focus on profitability during 2017. The disciplined underwriting
resulted in excellent underwriting results following an improvement in the claims ratio net of catastrophe reinsurance
recoveries to 56.9% (2016: 62.7%).

Santam Re continued to contribute to Santam's diversification strategy and its ability to create long-term value, and
remains the main vehicle for Santam reinsurance optimisation. It continued to build partnerships with international
reinsurers with portfolios of good standing.

The growth in float income is largely the function of prevailing short-term interest rates and the level of float
balances.

Santam continued to provide comprehensive technical support to SEM business partnerships. This included product, pricing,
underwriting and reinsurance input, which together with Saham Finances structural growth contributed to strong earnings
growth from the SEM investments.

The 9% increase in Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services is the aggregate of 29% growth in the Healthcare
contribution and 4% growth at Sanlam Employee Benefits (SEB). The Healthcare businesses benefited from income earned on
new business as well as cost efficiencies. At SEB, increased allowance for one-off project expenses and high disability
and mortality claims experience partly offset good growth at the investments business, which benefited from positive
annuity mortality experience and asset mismatch profits.

Normalised headline earnings of R9,8 billion are 18% up on 2016. This is the combined effect of the 7% increase in net
result from financial services, a 146% increase in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio, a 3% increase
in amortisation of intangible assets and equity participation costs as well as an increase in net project expenses from
R29 million in 2016 to R114 million in 2017.

Net investment return benefited from the relatively stronger investment market performance in 2017 and the base effect of
the R192 million additional deferred tax expense recognised in 2016 after the increase in the effective CGT rate in South
Africa from 19% to 22%. This more than offset the R250 million lower after-tax investment income earned following the
redeployment of discretionary capital during 2016 and 2017. As communicated to shareholders in December 2017, the Group
had index-weighted exposure to Steinhoff shares in the South African capital portfolio. The collapse in the Steinhoff
share price contributed to some R120 million lower investment return earned on the portfolio after tax.

Net project expenses include Shriram Life Insurance expansion cost of R26 million, due diligence and related costs
incurred on investigating and concluding transactions of R47 million and one-off restructuring and small project costs of
R41 million. Shriram Life Insurance is incurring an abnormal level of branch establishment costs as it aggressively
expands its own distribution footprint. These costs are recognised as project expenses while expansion activities are
significant relative to the size of the in-force book, to avoid distorting the underlying operational performance of the
business. Once profit releases from the in-force book reach an appropriate size, the costs will be reallocated to net
result from financial services on a prospective basis. This is anticipated to occur in the next three years. The
remainder of project expenses are one-off in nature and related to specific corporate actions.

Normalised attributable earnings increased by 35% from R8.1 billion in 2016 to R11 billion in 2017. The biggest
contributor to profit on disposal of subsidiaries and associates of R1.3 billion is the R1.2 billion realised on the
disposal of the Enterprise Group investments in Ghana. Impairment charges largely relate to the impairment of the
investments in Letshego (R103 million) and Pacific & Orient (R161 million) due to the operational underperformance in
these businesses.

Business volumes

New business volumes declined by 1% amidst pressure on single premiums in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Life
insurance new business volumes increased by 2%, investment business inflows declined by 5% and general insurance earned
premiums increased by 16%. Excluding structural activity, exchange rate differences and the R4.6 billion new mandate
received from the BPOPF in 2016, new business volumes increased by 1%.

SPF's new business sales declined by 5%, with lower discretionary single premium savings volumes concealing a solid
recurring premium performance.

Sanlam Sky's new business increased by 12%. The change in mix between risk and savings business continued to improve in
2017, supporting exceptional growth in VNB (refer below). Individual life recurring premium new business increased by 8%,
with a 32% decline in savings business partly offsetting 15% growth in risk business. Group recurring premium sales were
supported by a number of large new schemes written by Safrican and the biennial renewal of the Zionist Christian Church
(ZCC) scheme, increasing by 26%. Excluding the ZCC scheme, group recurring premium business increased by 9% against a
high comparative base, which also included large new schemes at Safrican in 2016.

New business volumes in the Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic Business Development increased by 10%. Risk
business sales grew by 18%, supported by the first-time inclusion of BrightRock from October 2017 and more than 20%
growth in credit life business. Excluding BrightRock, new risk business achieved solid growth of 8% against a high
comparative base. Savings business sales increased by 8%, the combination of good growth in retirement annuities and
lower demand for endowments and tax-free savings products.

Glacier new business declined by 6%. The LISP business was severely impacted by the heightened investor risk aversion,
contributing to 9% and 17% declines in discretionary non-life and secondary new business sales respectively. Demand for
life licence LISP solutions were more resilient with new business volumes increasing by 3%. Traditional life investment
single premiums grew by 1%.

The slowdown in single premium business had a negative impact on SPF's net fund inflows, which declined from R16.5
billion in 2016 to R8.5 billion in 2017.

SEM new business volumes declined by 8% (up 8% in constant currency, excluding structural activity and the BPOPF mandate
in 2016).

New business volumes in Namibia declined by 1%. New life business growth of 12% was more than offset by a 5% decline in
the more volatile single premium investment business. The life business growth was, however, skewed towards lower margin
lines of business following good entry-level market sales in 2016, contributing to a disappointing VNB performance (refer
below).

The Botswana results include the impact of a stronger average rand exchange rate, as well as a high comparative base
attributable to the R4.6 billion asset management mandate received from the BPOPF in 2016. Excluding the BPOPF, new
business sales grew by 22% in constant currency. The investment manager continued to perform well, growing its new
investment mandates by some 27% in constant currency (excluding the BPOPF from the comparable base). New life business
sales (up 9% in constant currency) improved in the second half of the year after a major competitor increased its annuity
pricing. Annuity volumes were, however, still lower than 2016 and at lower margins, contributing to lower VNB (refer
below).

Rest of Africa new business volumes grew by 22% (36% in constant currency). Excluding structural activity, new business
volumes decreased by 15% (up 1% in constant currency). All countries in the region contributed growth in excess of 20% in
constant currency, apart from Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania. Kenya continued to struggle to gain traction amidst a very
competitive market and internal challenges, while in Zambia, focus on the quality of new business written resulted in a
decline in recurring premium business, which offset good single premium growth. A decline in agency headcount and lower
productivity negatively affected the Tanzania new business performance. A particular highlight is Nigeria's new business
growth of almost 50% in constant currency in a difficult operating environment. Nigeria is now the third largest
contributor to Rest of Africa new business volumes after Kenya and Saham Finances. Saham Finances is tracking the
business case.

The Indian insurance businesses continued to perform well, growing their new business contribution by 66% in 2017 (6% in
constant currency and excluding structural activity). New life and general insurance business sales increased by 51% and
74% respectively. The life business continued to benefit from the investments made in growing its distribution footprint.
Business from the Shriram City Union Finance client base exceeded targets, while volumes are also expanding from the
Shriram Transport Finance base. Shriram General Insurance exceeded its new business targets for 2017, but the mix of
business still needs more attention.

Malaysia's new business performance continued to disappoint, with both the life and general insurance businesses
experiencing some 24% decline in new business volumes (down 13% in constant currency). Progress with diversifying the
lines of business still lags expectations. Several initiatives are being implemented to address the current under
performance.

Net fund flows declined from R10.9 billion in 2016 to R2.1 billion in 2017. This is mainly due to the R4.6 billion BPOPF
inflow included in the comparative base, a negative R542 million exchange rate impact and more than R3 billion of
investment fund withdrawals in Namibia by the Government pension fund.

SI's new business growth of 2% in constant currency (flat at actual exchange rate) is a solid performance in an
environment of low investor confidence in South Africa. Net fund inflows increased threefold from R5.2 billion in 2016 to
R16.1 billion in 2017, a particularly pleasing result. The South African asset manager gained further traction in the
institutional market, partly offset by lower retail flows that were to a larger extent impacted by negative investor
sentiment. The Wealth Management business recorded net outflows of R755 million. These relate mainly to R3.2 billion of
outflows from low margin non-annuity products, mostly share incentive scheme mandates. The International business
achieved a sterling turnaround in net fund flows, from an outflow of R4.7 billion in 2016 to a net inflow of R3.6 billion
in 2017 (some R4 billion in constant currency). Most of the International business units achieved improved net inflows.

Gross written premiums at Santam increased by 15%. Organic growth of 9% was augmented by the first-time contribution from
acquisitions. The three main lines of business, being motor, property and alternative risk, achieved double-digit organic
growth, a robust performance in a highly competitive market. Net earned premiums grew by 8%, after allowing for
reinsurance and reinstatement premiums of R160 million payable in respect of the catastrophe events.

Sanlam Corporate regained some recurring premium risk market share as competitors repriced risk business after a period
of weak claims experience, driving exceptional growth of 45% in this line of business. The more volatile single premium
business experienced marginally lower volumes than 2016, but with a promising pipeline for the first half of 2018.

Overall net fund inflows of R34.6 billion in 2017 is a satisfactory performance given the challenging market conditions
and a high base in 2016.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 20bps and 60bps decline in
the South African nine- and five-year benchmark rates respectively during 2017 resulted in a commensurate decline in the
risk discount rate, with a 3% positive impact on VNB growth. VNB margins were only marginally affected by the lower
discount rate. VNB margins were in general maintained on a per product basis, with the rise in average margins
attributable to a change in mix to more profitable product lines, in particular at Sanlam Sky and the Recurring premium
sub cluster. Net VNB commensurately increased by 15%, an exceptional performance in a challenging environment.

SPF achieved overall growth of 21% (17% on a comparable basis). The change in business mix in Sanlam Sky contributed to a
46% increase in its VNB contribution (35% on a comparable basis) and an increase in VNB margin from 7.12% in 2016 to
8.88% in 2017. The good growth in new risk business at the Recurring premium sub cluster and Strategic Business
Development similarly supported VNB, which increased by 42% (38% excluding BrightRock). VNB margins in these businesses
improved from 2.92% to 3.46%. Glacier's VNB declined by 7% due to the weak new business performance and the reallocation
of administration costs from the Recurring premium sub cluster.

Net VNB at SEM declined by 3% (up 6% in constant currency). Excluding structural activity, VNB increased by 3% in
constant currency. All regions contributed strong organic growth, apart from Namibia, Botswana and Tanzania. Namibia VNB
was in line with 2016 despite the rise in new life business volumes. This is largely attributable to the change in mix to
lower margin business, while the decline in annuity sales in Botswana contributed to a 9% decline in its constant
currency contribution. Tanzania also experienced lower VNB in line with the decline in new life business.

The good growth in Sanlam Corporate recurring premium risk business enabled a 14% increase in the cluster's VNB
contribution.

Capital management

The Group started the year with discretionary capital of R550 million, after allowing for the BrightRock acquisition and
a portion of the acquisition consideration in respect of the additional 16.6% stake in Saham Finances. A number of
capital management actions during 2017 affected the balance of available discretionary capital, which amounted to 
R2 billion at 31 December 2017.

Discretionary capital at 31 December 2017                   2 000

The discretionary capital portfolio was augmented by the following inflows:

- The excess cash operating earnings cover in respect of the dividend paid in 2017.
- Capital of R1.4 billion released from the covered business operations in Sanlam Life. As communicated in the Group's
  2016 annual results announcement, capital allocated to the covered business operations on the Sanlam Life balance sheet
  can be reduced by R2 billion over time. Investment return earned on this capital base is also available for release. The
  first R500 million was released from the capital base in 2017, together with the net investment return of R862 million
  earned during the year. The remaining R1.5 billion will be released from the base during 2018.
- The introduction of the CCM enabled the transfer of credit exposures from the Sanlam Capital Markets balance sheet to
  Sanlam Life. This released R350 million of the capital allocated to the Sanlam Capital Markets business.
- Disposals of Group operations yielded R1.6 billion, with the main contribution from the Enterprise Group disposal
  announced earlier in 2017. Sanlam Investments also disposed of the developed market component of Summit Trust, retaining
  the Mauritian-based operations.
- Investment return and other small movements added R98 million.

A net total of R2.8 billion was redeployed in 2017 in respect of new transactions, which included the following major
acquisitions:

- We entered into agreements for the acquisition of Absa's employee benefits and actuarial consulting business to add scale
  to SEB's offering. The transaction remains subject to final regulatory approval.
- Sanlam Investments acquired a 30% stake in EasyEquities, an innovative low-cost investment platform, which significantly
  enhanced the Cluster's reach into the lower income markets and complement its Satrix index-tracking offering.
- Debt funding of up to USD140 million was considered as part of the funding model for the acquisition of the additional
  16.6% stake in Saham Finances. The Enterprise Group disposal eliminated the need for debt funding, with this portion of
  the acquisition consideration (R1.9 billion) also funded from discretionary capital.
- The acquisition of a controlling stake in PineBridge Investments East Africa (renamed to Sanlam Investments East Africa)
  and other smaller transactions utilised some R260 million. The PineBridge acquisition provides the Group with a
  meaningful investment management capability in East Africa for future growth in this line of business.
- Sanlam Emerging Markets acquired the non-controlling interests in the Soras Group in Rwanda for R113 million and invested
  R94 million to capitalise its Ugandan business, which expanded its products lines through the acquisition of a general
  insurance business.

Subsequent to the 2017 year-end, we concluded agreements to acquire the remaining 53.4% stake in Saham Finances. This
transaction significantly enhances the strategic positioning of Sanlam as the leading insurance provider in Africa, and
will accelerate the extraction of synergies from the combined footprint. The transaction price of USD 1 050 million will
be funded from a combination of available discretionary capital, debt and a Sanlam Limited share issuance within the limits
of current approvals and the Group's risk appetite.

The rand experienced significant volatility during 2017, weakening in the latter half of the year as uncertainty around
the outcome of the African National Congress' national elective conference heightened. General market consensus was that
the rand could weaken further depending on which candidate was elected as the new party president. As the acquisition of
the remaining stake in Saham Finances was only viable below a certain rand/USD exchange rate, we decided to partially
hedge the transaction through a combination of foreign currency acquisitions and forward exchange contracts. USD602
million of the total USD1 050 million consideration was hedged at an average exchange rate of R14.12. The unrealised fair
value loss on the hedging instruments amounted to some R562 million after tax at 31 December 2017. The loss was
recognised directly in other comprehensive income in terms of the hedge accounting applied under IFRS. The
eventual profit or loss realised at payment date will be recognised as an adjustment to the acquisition price. The
investment will meet Sanlam's hurdle rate at the hedged exchange rate, taking cognisance of the expected depreciation of
the rand against the USD over the long term.

Solvency

All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of December 2017. The
total admissible regulatory capital (including identified discretionary capital) of Sanlam Life, the holding company of
the Group's major life insurance subsidiaries, covered its capital adequacy requirements (CAR) 5.8 times under the
current solvency regime.

As indicated in previous results announcements, South Africa is implementing a new solvency regime (Solvency Assessment
and Management - SAM) modelled on the European Solvency II regime with an anticipated effective date of 1 July 2018. A
Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) target cover range under SAM of between 1.7 times and 2.1 times has been set for
Sanlam Life Insurance Limited's (Sanlam Life) covered business. The R9.5 billion of IFRS-based required capital allocated
to these operations at the end of December 2017 translated into a SCR cover of 2.3 times. The SCR cover ratio for the
Sanlam Life entity as a whole at 2.7 times exceeded the covered business ratio at the end of December 2017 due to the
inclusion of discretionary and other capital held on the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as investments in Santam and
other Group operations that are not allocated to Sanlam Life's covered business operations (i.e. not included in the R9.5
billion allocated capital referred to above). The Sanlam Group SCR cover ratio of 2.2 times remained in line with the 2.2
times cover at 31 December 2016. The Group will increasingly focus on the Group SCR cover as the main solvency measure.

Dividend

The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large
shareholder base. Sustainable growth in dividend payments is an important consideration for the Board in determining the
dividend for the year. The Board uses cash operating earnings as a guideline in setting the level of the normal dividend,
subject to the Group's liquidity and solvency requirements. Dividend cover of cash operating earnings is managed broadly
within a 1 to 1.1 times range to target consistent real growth of between 2% and 4% in the Group's normal dividend
payment. The operational performance of the Group in the 2017 financial year enabled the Board to increase the normal
dividend per share by 8% to 290 cents. This will maintain a cash operating earnings cover of approximately 1.1 times.

The South African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect of this dividend. The dividend dwill in full be subject
to the 20% withholding tax, where applicable, which will result in a net final dividend, to shareholders who are not exempt
from paying dividend tax, of 232 cents per share. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share capital as at 
the date of the declaration is 2 010 956 721 excluding treasury shares of 155 515 085 at 31 December 2017. The company's tax
reference number is 9536/346/84/5. Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 290 cents for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is payable on Monday, 9 April 2018 by way of electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded 
in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 6 April 2018. The last date to trade to qualify for this dividend 
will be Tuesday, 3 April 2018, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 4 April 2018.

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 4 April 2018 and Friday, 6 April 2018,
both days included.

Summarised financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017

Accounting policies and basis of presentation

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements for abridged reports, and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial
statements. The Listings Requirements require abridged reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts
and the measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to
also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, from which the summary consolidated financial
statements were derived, are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the previous consolidated annual financial statements.

The policy liabilities and profit entitlement rules are determined in accordance with prevailing legislation, generally
accepted actuarial practice and the stipulations contained in the demutualisation proposal. There have been no material
changes in the financial soundness valuation basis since 31 December 2016, apart from changes in the economic
assumptions.

The basis of presentation and accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and Shareholders' information are in
all material respects consistent with those applied in the 2016 annual report.

The preparation of the Group's audited annual results was supervised by the Financial Director, Heinie Werth CA(SA).

The following new or revised IFRS and interpretations have effective dates applicable to future financial years and have
not been early adopted:

- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2021)

IFRS 9: Financial Instruments will replace IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Group will be 
adopting this standard from 1 January 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and will not make use of any of the 
deferral options provided in IFRS 4: Insurance Contracts. The standard introduces new requirements for the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. During the year the Group conducted an assessment of the potential classification and 
measurement changes that may result from the adoption of the new standard, based on the composition of the Group Statement of 
Financial Position as at 31 December 2016, for the purposes of a preliminary impact assessment, as well as 31 December 2017, 
to assess the impact on adoption. The outcome of this process indicates that there will be limited changes in classification
and measurement accross the Group.

IFRS 9 introduces a new expected credit loss (""ECL"") impairment model for all financial assets and certain loan commitments 
and guarantees.

As the majority of the group's financial assets subject to more than an insignificant aount of credit risk are measured
at fair value through profit or loss, the potential significant impacts from changes in the measurement basis of impairment
provisions are limited to the Group's investment in associated companies and joint ventures, as a number of these conduct
credit business. Based on ongoing assessments, while the carrying value of these associates will decrease on adoption of IFRS 9,
the impact based on current assessment indicate that this decrease should not be in excess of 2% of the balance of equity
account investments, and therefore will not be material to the Group.

IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Clients replaces all existing revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and applies
to all revenue arising from contracts with clients, unless the contracts are in the scope of the standards on leases, insurance
contracts and financial instruments. The standard is effective for the Group for the financial year commencing 1 January 2018.
The potential areas of significant impact for the Group relate to performance fees earned by the asset management operations, 
upfront fees received, deferred acquisition costs on investments business and isolated instances of more complex fee structures.
Based on the level of performance fees earned, no significant impact from this is expected. The impact of other areas is still 
being assessed.

IFRS 16: Leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17: Leases for reporting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2019. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 16. Initial work performed, indicates
that there will be limited impact on the financial statements as a result of this standard.

IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017. The standard establishes the principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. Initial work performed
on the impact of IFRS 17 indicates that there will be a significant impact on the underlying valuation models, systems
and processes. The Group is in the process of assessing the requirements of the standard against current data, processes
and valuation models and is expected to finalise this assessment during the second half of 2018.

Restatement of investment classes
Sanlam Life Insurance Limited through its Bermuda branch, issued life insurance policies that were backed by an investment
policy issued by a 3rd party with the underlying assets being held in investment funds. These assets were correctly
classified as investment funds until 31 December 2015. This investment policy was terminated effective 1 January 2016 and
was replaced by investments in various asset classes. The administration process for the classification of these assets
in the relevant investment asset classes was not amended appropriately by the end of 31 December 2016, resulting in an
incorrect classification on the statement of financial position with no impact on the statement of comprehensive income.
The 31 December 2016 information is accordingly restated for this error.

3. Normalised earnings per share

In terms of IFRS, a consolidation reserve is created for differences in the valuation bases of long-term policy
liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. Certain investments held in policyholder portfolios may not be
recognised at fair value in terms of IFRS, whereas the valuation of the related policy liabilities is based on the assets
at fair value. Similarly, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of assessed tax losses in policyholder funds
increases the Group's net assets without a corresponding increase in policy liabilities. These create mismatches with a
corresponding impact on the shareholders' fund. A separate reserve is created for these valuation differences owing to
the fact that they represent accounting differences and not economic gains or losses for the shareholders' fund.  The
number of shares in issue must also be reduced with the treasury shares held by the policyholders' fund for the
calculation of IFRS basic and diluted earnings per share.  This is, in management's view, not a true representation of
the earnings attributable to the Group's shareholders, specifically in instances where the share prices and/or the number
of shares held by the policyholders' fund varies significantly. The Group therefore calculates normalised earnings per
share to eliminate these impacts.

3. Share repurchases

The Sanlam shareholders granted general authorities to the Group at the 2017 and 2016 annual general meetings to
repurchase Sanlam shares in the market.  The Group did not acquire any shares in terms of these general authorities.

4. Contingent liabilities

Shareholders are referred to the contingent liabilities disclosure in the 2017 annual financial statements. The
circumstances surrounding the contingent liabilities remain materially unchanged.

5. Subsequent events

Subsequent to the 2017 year-end, the Group concluded agreements to acquire the remaining 53.4% stake in Saham Finances.
This transaction significantly enhances the strategic positioning of Sanlam as the leading insurance provider in Africa,
and will accelerate the extraction of synergies from the combined footprint. The transaction price of USD 1 050 million
will be funded from the following sources:

- A Sanlam Limited share issuance of up to 5% of the issued Sanlam shares in terms of the general authority granted by
  shareholders at the 2017 annual general meeting. The opportunity to further enhance Sanlam's Black Economic Empowerment
  initiatives and shareholding at a minimum level of dilution will be considered as part of the share issuance.
- Available discretionary capital of R3 billion to R4 billion, allowing for the additional R1.5 billion to be released from
  the Sanlam Life covered business operations in 2018.

Debt funding for the remainder. Any utilisation of debt capacity will be subject to the Group's risk appetite, while also
ensuring that the funding cost can be comfortably covered by dividend cash flows from the Saham Finances investment. The
Group intends to redeem the R1,2 billion of Sanlam Life subordinated debt that reaches its call option date in August 2018, 
which will partly offset the increase in overall Group debt from this transaction.

The rand experienced significant volatility during 2017, weakening in the latter half of the year as uncertainty around
the outcome of the African National Congress' national elective conference heightened. General market consensus was that
the rand could weaken further depending on which candidate was elected as the new party president. As the acquisition of
the remaining stake in Saham Finances was only viable below a certain rand/USD exchange rate, the Group decided to
partially hedge the transaction through a combination of foreign currency acquisitions and forward exchange contracts.
USD 602 million of the total USD1 050 million consideration was hedged at an average exchange rate of R14.12. The
unrealised fair value loss on the hedging instruments amounted to some R562 million after tax at 31 December 2017. The
loss was recognised directly in the Statement of Changes in Equity in terms of the hedge accounting applied under IFRS.
The eventual profit or loss realised at payment date will be recognised as an adjustment to the acquisition price. The
investment will meet Sanlam's hurdle rate at the hedged exchange rate, taking cognisance of the expected depreciation of
the rand against the USD over the long term.

6.   Fair value disclosures

Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy

Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that reflects the
significance of the inputs used in determining the measurements. It should be noted that these disclosure only cover
assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in 
an active market for identical assets and liabilities. 

Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within 
level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are supported by
prices from observable current market transactions are categorised as level 2.

Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

Material acquisitions of the Group consolidated in the 2017 financial year

BrightRock Holdings

During August 2017 the Group acquired a 53% interest in BrightRock Holdings, a life insurance provider in South Africa.
The acquisition is in line with Sanlam's commitment to invest in South Africa. The excess amount paid over fair value of
net assets is recognised as goodwill. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional share of the acquiree's
identifiable net assets. The Goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to synergies and future opportunities
expected.

During March 2017, the Santam group acquired a shareholding of 100% in RMB-SI Investments (Pty) Ltd (now Santam
Structured Insurance (Pty) Ltd (SSI)) for R193 million in cash. Key SSI management obtained a 10% economic participation
interest in SSI at acquisition date for R20 million.

ACQUISITION OF A FURTHER INTEREST IN SAHAM FINANCES S.A. (“SAHAM Finances”) VIA THE
INDIRECT ACQUISITION OF THE REMAINING 53.37% SHAREHOLDING NOT OWNED BY SANLAM
EMERGING MARKETS IRELAND LIMITED


1. INTRODUCTION
The board of directors of Sanlam is pleased to announce the conclusion of agreements, in terms of which
Sanlam Emerging Markets Ireland Limited (“SEMIL”) will increase its stake in SAHAM Finances to 100%
(directly and indirectly) (the “Transaction”) by acquiring all the issued shares of SAHAM S.A. (“SAHAM”),
which holds the remaining 53.37% of the shares in SAHAM Finances not already owned by SEMIL (“SAHAM
Finances interest”), from Mr Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Ms. Ghita Lahlou El Yacoubi (collectively the
“Sellers”). SEMIL is the wholly-owned subsidiary of SAN JV Proprietary Limited (“SAN JV”), a special
purpose vehicle currently held jointly by Sanlam’s wholly-owned subsidiary Sanlam Emerging Markets
Proprietary Limited (“SEM”) (85%) and Santam (15%). Santam is supportive of the Transaction, which will
enable it to play a more meaningful role in the specialist and reinsurance businesses of SAHAM Finances.
Santam will confirm the extent of its participation before the Transaction becomes effective. The total
consideration payable in terms of the Transaction is US$1050 million (the “Consideration”).


SEMIL first acquired a 30% stake in SAHAM Finances in February 2016 and subsequently acquired a further
16.63% stake in May 2017, bringing the total held by SEMIL in SAHAM Finances prior to the implementation
of the Transaction to 46.63%.


2. OVERVIEW OF SAHAM AND SAHAM FINANCES
At the time of implementation of the Transaction, SAHAM’s sole asset will be the SAHAM Finances Interest.
SAHAM Finances is an insurance group with operations in 26 countries across North, West and East Africa,
and the Middle East. It predominantly writes personal lines general insurance business (which exceeds 80%
of its portfolio). SAHAM Finances has approximately 65 subsidiaries, a network of 700 branches and a staff
complement of more than 3,000 people. SAHAM Finances has a leading market share in many of the
markets in which it operates.
SAHAM Finances owns inter alia 58.48% of SAHAM Assurance Morocco, which is listed on the Moroccan
Stock Exchange. The Transaction will give rise to an obligation on SEMIL (as the controlling shareholder of
SAHAM Finances) to launch a mandatory offer to minority shareholders in SAHAM Assurance Morocco.
SEMIL does not anticipate being required to incur any additional capital outlay in relation to such an offer.


3. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION
Sanlam sees a number of strategic benefits in increasing its interest in SAHAM Finances to 100%, which
includes the following:
- SAHAM Finances enables Sanlam, its subsidiaries and associates (the “Sanlam Group”) to deepen its
  direct presence in North Africa as well as Francophone West Africa and Southern African Lusophone
  countries, which provides it with a unique positioning on the African continent;
- The Sanlam Group will become a truly Pan-African insurance, investment and ancillary services group,
  able to service multi-national clients and their intermediaries more effectively than any other group
  operating across the continent;
- Continued expansion of the life insurance operations of SAHAM Finances with the support of the Sanlam
  Group;
- Potential synergies in general insurance, including optimisation of reinsurance and enhancement of
  Sanlam’s product line diversification;
- SAHAM Finances has a strong health and assistance business with a well-tested model in Africa that can
  be rolled out further; and
- Improved line of business diversification within the overall SEM operations, which in turn improves
  earnings resilience.


The acquisition of 100% of SAHAM Finances enables Sanlam to have a meaningful presence across sub-
Saharan and North Africa, and is a natural extension of Sanlam’s stated strategy. SAHAM Finances’ overall
performance has been in line with the original business case which was put forward when the initial
acquisition of a 30% interest in SAHAM Finances was considered, and the SAHAM Finances’ management
teams are working well with the Sanlam and Santam support teams. The Transaction increases Sanlam’s
exposure to high-growth markets as well as general insurance products.


4. CONSIDERATION
The Consideration payable for the acquisition of the SAHAM Finances interest will be US$1050 million, plus
transaction costs.


The Sanlam Group will fund the Consideration by using a combination of available discretionary capital, debt
facilities and the issuance of equity instruments within current approved shareholder limits and taking
cognisance of its existing credit ratings and solvency ratios.


5. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE TRANSACTION
The implementation of the Transaction will remain subject to the fulfilment or waiver, as the case may be, of
a number of conditions precedent including, inter alia, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and
the implementation by SAHAM of a corporate restructure in order to divest itself of all its investment
holdings, assets and liabilities other than the SAHAM Finances interest.


6. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION
Based on the reviewed financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, the consolidated net
asset value of SAHAM Finances on 31 December 2017 was US$ 850million and the earnings for the period
were US$ 77.4million. Sanlam is satisfied with the quality of these reviewed financial statements.
Post the implementation of the Transaction, SEMIL will participate in 100% of the earnings and net asset
value of SAHAM Finances.
Sanlam will consolidate its proportionate ownership in SAHAM Finances in its consolidated financial
statements.


7. EFFECTIVE DATE
The effective date of the Transaction will be dependent on the fulfilment or waiver, as the case may be, of
the conditions precedent and is expected to occur during the second half of 2018.


8. JSE LIMITED LISTINGS REQUIREMENTS
For purposes of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the Transaction has been categorised as a
Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited for Sanlam.
Post the implementation of the Transaction, SAHAM and SAHAM Finances will become subsidiaries of
Sanlam. Sanlam will ensure that the memorandum of incorporation of SAHAM and SAHAM Finances are
amended to comply with the provisions of 10.21 of Schedule 10 of the JSE Listings Requirements

Sanlam exposure to Steinhoff International Holdings NV
(“Steinhoff”)

The Sanlam Group has exposure to Steinhoff equity and debt instruments (“Steinhoff
instruments”) in on-balance sheet policyholder and shareholder portfolios, as well as
investment portfolios managed on behalf of third party clients. Given recent
developments around Steinhoff and the consequential decline in the traded values of
Steinhoff instruments, the potential impact on the Group’s key financial results from
exposure to Steinhoff instruments is provided in this announcement. All information is
indicative based on current mark-to-market (“MTM”) values and does not present
actual or potential realised losses.
The information is based on the closing prices of Steinhoff instruments on Wednesday,
20 December 2017 relative to closing prices on Friday, 1 December 2017. We are
actively managing the Group’s exposure and the potential impact outlined below may
therefore not realise.

Summary of exposures
The Group’s exposure to Steinhoff instruments originated from normal course of
business transactions, with many of the positions in place for a number of years. The
Group’s exposure to debt and equity instruments issued by the Steinhoff Group is
largely reflective of Steinhoff’s weighting in the local investment markets and Sanlam’s
size as an institutional investor.
The Group has exposure to Steinhoff instruments in the following Sanlam products and
portfolios:

-   Steinhoff equities are included in the JSE/FTSE Swix benchmark used for the equity
    component of the South African capital portfolios;
-   Steinhoff equities serve as partial security for some of the loans granted by the
    collateralised lending business;
-   The non-participating policyholder portfolios have exposure to local and international
    debt instruments; and
-   Linked and market-related policyholder funds and third party investment portfolios
    hold Steinhoff equities as part of any equity component included in the portfolios’
    mandates that are benchmarked to the JSE/FTSE Swix or All Share indices.
                                    
                                                                                  
The equity exposures were in general in line with or slightly above Steinhoff’s
benchmark index weighting on 1 December 2017. The direct debt exposures were also
in line with the Group’s risk management framework.

Potential financial impact on shareholder’s fund
The best estimate potential impact on the Group’s 2017 and future earnings is not
significant:

-   The decline in the value of Steinhoff shares held in the capital portfolios is to a large
    extent protected by the equity hedges in place. The maximum exposure amounts to
    some R175 million after tax on the Group’s net investment return.
-   Allowing for the estimated value of security held in respect of collateralised loans,
    the best estimate potential exposure amounts to some R230 million after tax on the
    Group’s net result from financial services. The maximum exposure, attaching no
    value to any security held, amounts to R580 million after tax.
-   The non-participating policyholder portfolios have exposure to foreign debt
    instruments of R358 million, which currently reflects an unrealised MTM decline of
    R160 million. The non-participating policyholder portfolios also have exposure to
    South African debt instruments of R771 million. These instruments are illiquid and
    currently do not reflect significant MTM changes based on last traded values. The
    MTM decline from these exposures will be absorbed by more than R500 million of
    discretionary margins held by the Group for such events. In the absence of actual
    defaults, the MTM declines will reverse up to the maturity date of the instruments.
    The utilisation of these margins will not affect Sanlam’s Group Equity Value, as no
    value has been placed thereon in the Embedded Value of Covered Business.
-   The exposure to Steinhoff instruments in the other policyholder and third party
    portfolios managed by Sanlam Investments amounted to only some 1.2% of assets
    under management. The potential impact on Sanlam Investments’ recurring net
    result from financial services is less than R25 million per annum.

Impact on clients’ investment return
The potential impact on Sanlam clients’ investment returns will vary depending on each
individual portfolio’s exposure to different asset classes. In a typical balanced portfolio,
the Steinhoff exposure would have accounted for approximately 1.1% of the portfolio
assets on 1 December 2017 and its share price movement up to Wednesday, 20
December 2017 would have an approximate 1% negative effect on the annual return of
the portfolio. The negative impact on the return of a South African Swix Equity index
fund would be approximately 2.1%.

Solvency and dividends
The above potential financial effects on net asset value and earnings will only have a
marginal effect on the Group’s solvency ratio without impacting our dividend payment
capability.
The information in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Shareholders are advised that this is not a profit forecast as
per paragraphs 8.35 to 8.44 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Operational Update – December 2017

The Group achieved a solid operational performance for the first 10 months of the 2017
financial year. Particularly pleasing is sustained strong growth in the value of new life
business (VNB) and an improvement in operational earnings growth.

The operating environment remained challenging, in particular in South Africa, Namibia,
Botswana, Angola and Nigeria. A stronger average Rand exchange rate during the first
10 months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 also had a negative impact on
the translated Rand results of the non-South African operations. These conditions were
consistent with the first-half 2017 experience and as a result, the underlying new
business performance trends were largely in line with those reported for the six months
ended 30 June 2017.

Despite persistent political and policy uncertainty in South Africa, the local equity
market rallied since the end of June 2017 on the back of dual listed and blue chip
stocks, supporting assets under management and fund-based fee income in the second
half of the year. Due to the lag effect on average assets under management, the higher
market levels did not have a significant impact on the October 2017 year-to-date
results.

Highlights

-   Net result from financial services up 7%
-   Normalised headline earnings up 22%
-   New business volumes down 2%
-   Net fund inflows of R32 billion, in line with 2016
-   Net value of new life business (VNB) up 13%
-   Net VNB margin of 2,76%, up from 2,52% in 2016
-   Sanlam Life Capital Adequacy Requirement (CAR) cover of 5,6 times at 30
    September 2017
-   Sanlam Life Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) cover ratio of 2,8 times
    at 30 September 2017; Group at 2,1 times

The constant currency information has not been reviewed and reported on by Sanlam’s

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2017
are:

-        Net VNB increased by 13% on the first 10 months of 2016 (17% in constant
         currency). Overall VNB margins improved by some 20 basis points, in line with the
         change in mix to more profitable business. The underlying trends reported for the
         first half of 2017 continued for the 10 months to October 2017.

-        New business volumes of R190 billion, down 2% on the first 10 months of the
         2016 financial year, largely due to lower lump-sum inflows at Glacier and the
         Botswana asset management business.

     o    Robust growth in Sanlam Personal Finance’s more profitable recurring premium
          risk business continued, in both the entry-level and middle-income market
          segments. Investor confidence, however, remained under pressure in the mass
          affluent segment in the uncertain economic and political environment, with
          discretionary and life business sales in this market exhibiting similar trends to the
          first half of 2017. Overall new business volumes at Sanlam Personal Finance
          declined by 7% as a result.

          Sanlam Sky new business sales increased by 12% on the comparable 2016
          period, with the large new scheme written by Safrican in the first half of the year
          having a diminishing impact on growth as the year progresses. The change in
          mix towards risk business persisted, contributing to 15% growth in Sanlam Sky’s
          individual life risk business sales. Sales of savings products declined by 38%
          following our deliberate decision to scale back on selling unprofitable savings
          products. Overall individual life new recurring business increased by 7%. Group                                                                                    
          recurring premium new business increased by 29%, supported by the large new
          Safrican scheme written in the first half of the year, as well as the biennial
          renewal of the ZCC scheme.

          New business volumes in the middle-income market increased by 3%. Solid
          demand for recurring premium risk business (up 10%) and retirement annuities
          (up 11%) contributed to overall growth of 6% in recurring premium sales.
          Demand for traditional endowment savings products and ad hoc premium
          increases remained under pressure. Overall single premium growth of some 2%
          reflected a change in mix to the more profitable guaranteed products, benefiting
          growth in VNB.

          As highlighted above, Glacier new business volumes remained under pressure
          and declined by 11%, in line with the first-half 2017 performance.

      o   Sanlam Emerging Markets recorded an overall decline in new business volumes
          of 3%. The net positive impact of structural activity (Saham Finances, direct
          stakes in Shriram Life and General Insurance, Sanlam Investments East Africa
          and the disposal of the Group’s stake in the Enterprise Group) was more than
          offset by the base effect of the R4.6 billion Botswana Public Officers Pension
          Fund (BPOPF) mandate received in the comparable 2016 period. Excluding
          these one-off impacts, new business volumes increased by 17% (25% in
          constant currency). Saham Finances slightly lagged the business plan due to the
          economic pressure in Angola and Nigeria. Corrective actions at the Malaysian
          operations are not yet reflecting in top-line growth. Underlying trends within the
          other Emerging Markets businesses were in line with the first-half 2017 results.

     o   Sanlam Investments continued to attract healthy institutional fund flows with
         overall growth in new fund inflows in the SA asset management business broadly
         in line with its performance for the first half of 2017. The Wealth Management
         and International businesses gained traction, contributing to an overall
         improvement in the cluster’s new business growth from an 8% decline at the end
         of June 2017 to a decline of only 2% for the 10 months to October 2017.

     o    Sanlam Employee Benefits achieved pleasing growth of 11% in its new business
         contribution. Both recurring premium risk business and single premium inflows
         recorded good growth on the first 10 months of 2016.

     o   Overall net fund inflows of R32 billion were in line with the comparable 2016
         results, a resilient performance in the challenging environment. Sanlam
         Investments achieved a threefold increase in net inflows, which was offset by
         lower inflows at Sanlam Personal Finance (due to the lower Glacier single
         premium inflows) and Sanlam Emerging Markets (attributable to the base effect
         of the BPOPF inflow in Botswana during 2016).

     o   Persistency experience remained broadly in line with the first-half 2017 results.
         Should the poor economic conditions in South Africa persist, it may put pressure
         on this key profit driver.

-   Net result from financial services up 7% on the first 10 months of the 2016 financial
    year (up 10% in constant currency). Improved contributions from Sanlam Personal
    Finance, Sanlam Emerging Markets and Sanlam Investments supported the overall
    acceleration in growth compared to the six months ended 30 June 2017.

    o   The strong growth in risk business at Sanlam Sky and Individual Life generated a
        significant increase in the new business strain recognised in terms of the Group’s
        prudent accounting policies. This limited growth in Sanlam Personal Finance’s
        net result from financial services to 4%. Excluding the increase in new business
        strain, commendable growth of some 9% was achieved on the first 10 months of
        2016.

    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net result from financial services increased by 22%
        (35% in constant currency), supported by structural activity. Organic growth in
        constant currency of 16% was achieved. The demonetisation-related bad debt
        provision of R110 million (after tax and allowing for Sanlam Emerging Markets’
        effective interest) recognised in the first half of the year in Shriram Capital largely
        reversed in the second half as the arrears position started to improve. The
        impact of the structural growth will moderate towards the end of the year and
        growth is commensurately not expected to be sustained at the current level for
        the full 2017 financial year. Saham Finances’ operating earnings tracked the
        business plan despite the pressure in Angola and Nigeria.

    o   Sanlam Investments’ contribution to net result from financial services increased
        by 3% (up 8% in constant currency). Fee income in the South African asset and
        wealth management businesses remained under pressure from lacklustre growth
        in average assets under management, as the improved equity market
        performance since the end of June 2017 had only a subdued impact for the 10-
        month period to October 2017. Investor risk aversion also continued to affect
        brokerage volumes and related income at Sanlam Private Wealth. The benefits
        of the restructuring at Sanlam UK during 2016 was still evident in strong growth
        in international earnings. Capital management earnings declined from a high
        comparative base in 2016.

    o   Santam’s net underwriting margin for the 10-month period was within the target
        range of 4% to 8% despite a number of catastrophe claims in 2017, reflecting the
        benefits of its well-diversified book of business and reinsurance strategy. Further
        weather-related large claims since June 2017 were partly offset by increased
        allowance for reinsurance recoveries in respect of the first-half 2017
        catastrophes. A severe winter storm in June 2017 caused widespread wind and
        water damage in Cape Town, while strong winds from the same storm also drove
        wildfires in the Knysna and Plettenberg Bay areas that resulted in significant
        property damage. These were treated as separate events in Santam’s 2017
        interim results. Clarity has now been provided that it is one event for reinsurance
        purposes, increasing the allowance for reinsurance recoveries by some R70
        million.

    o   Sanlam Employee Benefits and Sanlam Healthcare achieved good growth in net
        result from financial services of 14%. The growth rate normalised somewhat
        since the end of June 2017, commensurate with the higher comparative base in                                                                                    
        the second half of 2016. Risk claims experience at Sanlam Employee Benefits
        remained above longer term trends.

-   Normalised headline earnings per share increased by 22% compared to the first 10
    months of the 2016 financial year. A relatively stronger investment market
    performance in 2017 to date supported investment return earned on the capital
    base. Investment market returns up to the end of 2017 can have an impact on the
    sustainability of this level of growth.

-   Diluted headline earnings per share increased by 2%. The lower level of growth in
    diluted headline earnings per share compared to normalised headline earnings is
    attributable to the one-off deferred tax asset of R1.3 billion raised in 2016 following
    the introduction of the Risk Policy Fund in South Africa for tax purposes. This
    significantly increased the comparative earnings base.

Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its CAR under the current solvency regime 5.6 times on 30 September
2017. Under the new SAM regime being implemented in South Africa, Sanlam Life
Insurance’s Solvency Capital Requirement cover ratio amounted to 2.8 times on 30
September 2017, while the Sanlam Group cover ratio was 2.1 times.

Capital deployment since the end of June 2017 was limited to the acquisition of Lion
Assurance Company, a general insurer in Uganda, and the Group following its rights in
terms of the Afrocentric rights issue for a combined outlay of some R100 million.
Available discretionary capital at 31 October 2017 was therefore largely unchanged
from the 30 June 2017 position. A combined total of some R400 million will be utilised
for the Absa Consultants and Actuaries and EasyEquities transactions.

Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the
remainder of 2017 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key operational performance
indicators. Persistent investor risk aversion, average investment market levels, the
relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and the level of long-term interest rates are
key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net result from financial services,
normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for the full 2017
financial year. The outcome of the African National Congress’ national elective
conference in December 2017 can potentially result in currency, investment market and
interest rate volatility. The Group is, however, well-positioned to weather these
headwinds and to continue delivering value for our shareholders and other
stakeholders.

Executive review

The operating environment during the first half of 2017 proved even more demanding than anticipated, in particular in South Africa, our largest market. Growth in all key 
performance indicators was also impacted by a significantly stronger average Rand exchange rate in the first half of 2017, increased new business strain at Sanlam Personal
Finance, catastrophe claims at Santam and the effect of the demonetisation initiative in India. Strategic execution remained a key focus under these difficult conditions, 
enabling the Group to deliver resilient results for the first six months of the 2017 financial year. Particularly pleasing is the double-digit annualised Adjusted Return 
on Group Equity Value (RoGEV) of 16.2% delivered to shareholders. This exceeded the target of 13.2% for 2017 by a healthy margin.

The global environment was in general supportive of emerging markets during the first six months of 2017. Global economic conditions improved in the latter half of 2016 and
remained relatively firm in the first half of 2017, with 3% projected growth in global GDP in 2017 and 2018. This is supported by encouraging growth momentum in Europe and 
the United States (US), and a stabilisation in China's growth prospects. Political risk also eased in Europe after favourable election outcomes in The Netherlands and France,
with initial fears of rising support for Euro-sceptic parties not materialising. Commodity prices responded to expectations for rising demand, improving the terms of trade 
of many emerging market countries. The exception was oil-dependent countries, which are still under pressure from structurally lower oil prices. International investor
sentiment and risk appetite rebounded, buoyed by the robust global economic outlook, some decline in geopolitical risk and indications that the major developed market 
central banks will opt for moderated easing of their current loose monetary policy. A number of equity markets reached new highs as a result, with many emerging investment
markets benefiting from the renewed appetite for risk.

The South African operating environment was, however, not supportive of growth in the first half of 2017. A number of factors drove renewed optimism for accelerated economic
growth at the start of the year:

- An improvement in South Africa's terms of trade following the rise in commodity prices;
- Lower inflation, signifying higher real growth in household disposable income;
- The economic slowdown seemed to have bottomed;
- The interest rate cycle has probably peaked; and 
- Improved prospects for agricultural production after good rainfall in large parts of the country.

Business and consumer confidence were, however, dealt severe blows by heightened political and economic policy uncertainty, which has risen sharply since the end of 2015.
The shock to business and consumer confidence that followed a cabinet reshuffle is evident in the collapse in manufacturers' investment spending plans as recorded by the
Bureau for Economic Research's latest surveys. This weighed heavily on private sector fixed-investment activity and constrained growth in employment. Consumer confidence
continued to wane in the uncertain environment, especially after the downgrade of South Africa's foreign currency sovereign rating to below investment grade by major
agencies, impacting consumer spending trends and savings activity. This considerably weakened the economic climate in South Africa and largely eliminated the benefits of 
otherwise improving local and global conditions. The South African economy entered a technical recession in the first quarter of 2017 as a result, with only pedestrian
growth expected for the remainder of 2017 and 2018.

The impact of waning consumer confidence was already evident in 2016 when Glacier experienced a marked slowdown in single premium investment flows from the mass affluent
market. This trend continued into 2017, but also expanded to the high net worth segment. Both Glacier and Sanlam Private Wealth struggled to attract new single premium 
business in the first half of 2017. The higher tax burden (increase in rate of highest tax bracket and higher dividend withholding tax) for clients in these businesses' 
target markets further exacerbated the situation. A highlight, however, was continued strong growth in recurring premium risk business across all segments.

Santam faced a tough claims cycle in the first half of 2017. A number of large fire-related property claims during the period were aggravated by catastrophe claims in the
Western Cape in June 2017. A severe winter storm caused widespread wind and water damage in Cape Town. Strong winds from the same storm also drove runaway wildfires in the
Knysna and Plettenberg Bay areas that resulted in significant property damage. Despite these claims, Santam still managed to achieve an underwriting margin at the lower 
end of its target range.

Commodity-based economies in the Rest of Africa are benefiting from better terms of trade and the firmer global growth outlook. Economic growth in these countries is
recovering slowly, augmenting robust growth in the East-African region that is less dependent on commodity exports. Oil-dependent countries, Nigeria and Angola in particular,
are however still adapting to lower oil prices and the need to diversify their economic bases away from oil is evident. Economic conditions in Namibia were under some 
pressure in the first half of 2017. The Namibian government's finances and liquidity are under strain from twin deficits, which negatively impacted on liquidity and cost 
of capital in the banking sector, as well as general economic activity. Overall though, the Rest of Africa region continued to expand at a much faster pace than South Africa, 
providing a good base for accelerated growth at Sanlam's operations in this region. Namibia and Botswana remain the most competitive markets in the Rest of Africa region 
given their more mature profile. The Botswana operations in particular faced aggressive pricing by competitors in the unsecured lending and life annuity lines of business,
which eroded some of our market share and margins.

Demonetisation in India during 2016 had a negative impact on the economy and credit businesses at the start of 2017. Consumers and corporates, however, adapted faster than
anticipated to the new environment, with the economy on track to continue delivering high growth in 2017 of some 7%. Shriram Capital similarly experienced a weak first 
quarter in 2017, but has largely recovered by the second quarter of the year. We are optimistic that Shriram Capital will deliver improved results in the second half of 2017.

Malaysia's economic momentum has stabilised after a period of slower growth. Economic growth is accelerating, aided by a competitive Ringgit. A lack of progress in diversifying
our operations in Malaysia has, however, prevented our businesses from sharing in the growth.

The Group's primary indicator of shareholder value creation remains RoGEV. Given the nature of the Group's diversified business, we consider this measure of performance the
most appropriate since it incorporates the result of all the major value drivers in the business. The RoGEV per share for the six months to 30 June 2017 of 6.1% (annualised 11.7%) 
was below the target of 6.4% (annualised 13.2%), largely due to the stronger Rand exchange rate. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes investment market and currency volatility 
as well as changes in interest rates and other factors outside of management's control, was well in excess of the target at 8.1% (annualised 16.2%). Annualised actual and adjusted
RoGEV excludes the annualisation of the revaluation of businesses held for sale and acquired goodwill written off for embedded value purposes.

Net result from financial services increased by 1%. The low level of growth is largely attributable to the stronger average Rand exchange rate, higher new business strain at Sanlam 
Personal Finance following the good growth in risk business, the weak claims experience at Santam and one-off credit provisioning in Shriram Capital following demonetisation in India.
This was partly offset by the contributions from structural growth. Excluding these, net result from financial services increased by a satisfactory 11%.

New business volumes declined by 4%, an acceptable performance under difficult conditions. The Group did particularly well to achieve net fund inflows of R19 billion given the 
significant pressure on single premium business. A highlight for the period is the strong growth in value of new life (covered) business written. The net value of the new covered
business (VNB) increased by 11% (17% in constant currency) at a margin of 2.61%, which exceeds the comparable 2016 margin.

Strategic initiatives

The Group's strategic intent of sustainable value creation for all key stakeholders remains firmly in place, underpinned by the Group's vision to:

- Lead in client-centric wealth creation, management and protection in South Africa.
- Be a leading Pan-African financial services group with a meaningful presence in India and South-East Asia.
- Play a niche role in wealth and investment management in specific developed markets.

The Group's vision and strategic intent is pursued through a strategy focussed on four pillars:

- Profitable top-line growth through a culture of client centricity 
- Enhancing resilience and earnings growth through diversification (including geographical presence, products, market segments and distribution platforms)
- Extracting value through innovation and improved efficiencies (operating and cost efficiencies)
- Responsible capital allocation and management

Continuous transformation of the Group to remain relevant in a changing world is key. We define transformation broadly to include among others economic transformation to 
reduce wealth inequality, transforming our staff to reflect the demographic profile of our client base and societies where we operate, transforming our distribution 
channels and operations in line with technological and regulatory developments and most importantly, transforming everything we do in line with the changing needs and 
preferences of our clients. Transformation therefore underpins the Group's strategy in its entirety as a key focus area under each of the strategic pillars.

We have highlighted before that Sanlam's strategy is not particularly unique. Our ability to consistently execute on the strategy in a sustainable manner has proved to be
a key differentiator. It has been a key driver of success in the past and forms the foundation for Sanlam's sustainability over the long term.

Good progress has been made on all four strategic pillars:

Profitable top-line growth through a culture of client centricity
The challenging conditions in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana provided significant headwinds to grow the Group's top-line in the first half of 2017. By remaining focused
on growing market share in the more profitable recurring premium space, in particular in market segments where we do not have a fair market share, enabled us to deliver the
sterling growth of 17% in VNB in constant currency, at higher overall margins. The strategic restructuring of Sanlam Personal Finance during 2016 into focussed business 
units made a significant contribution to this growth.

Diligent focus on client centricity and the quality of new business written also enhances the resilience of the life insurance in-force book.

Enhancing resilience and earnings growth through diversification
The benefits of diversification was again evident in the Group's first-half 2017 performance. Despite pressure in a number of areas, the Group achieved an overall 
satisfactory performance in all key performance indicators.

The Group's profile was significantly enhanced in the first half of 2017 by the acquisition of an additional 16.6% stake in Saham Finances. This not only increases the 
Group's exposure to the higher-growth Rest of Africa region, but also enhances the line of business profile with a shift towards general insurance. The acquisition of a
majority stake in PineBridge Investments East Africa (renamed Sanlam Investments East Africa) provides for a better balanced and complementary business profile in
East Africa, which was skewed towards life insurance.

Good progress has also been made with the Central Credit Manager initiative launched during 2016, as further elaborated on in the results commentary below.

Extracting value through innovation and improved efficiencies
Cost efficiency is a key focus area across all of the Group's operations. This is especially prevalent during periods of low growth. In particular, lacklustre investment
market performance in South Africa since the end of 2015 and pressure on net fund inflows, are negatively affecting Sanlam Investments' fee income base. Various cost saving
initiatives were launched, with benefits already realised in the first half of 2017 across the cluster.

A number of initiatives at Group and cluster level are aimed at enhancing client offerings, agility and process efficiency through technological and product innovation.
These include:

- The acquisition of a majority stake in BrightRock (refer Capital Management section below) provides us with access to an innovative risk product platform that enables
  seamless adaptation of product design and structure according to changing client needs. This is a unique offering that further enhances the attractiveness and agility of
  the Sanlam product offering.
- We recently announced the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Purple Group's EasyEquities platform. EasyEquities is an award-winning fintech business, which has disrupted 
  the investments sector with its low barriers to opening an investment account through its low-cost platform. One of its primary objectives is to provide investment 
  solutions to all South Africans by removing barriers such as high cost and product complexity. This deal is one further step towards our efforts to make it easier for 
  investors to be able to save by facilitating easier access to investments.
- A Business Information project was launched at Group level to enhance client service offerings, underwriting capabilities and product development through advanced data
  analytics using the latest developments in data management technology, and incorporating Big Data.
- The Sanlam Design Studio that focusses on the development of digital distribution channels and related product development as part of our omni-channel distribution approach.
  The non-traditional and younger market segments are specific focus areas. The Sanlam Design Studio was awarded the '2017 South African New Product Innovation Leader in the
  Insurance Industry on Digital Transformation' by Frost & Sullivan, a global growth consulting and research firm.

Responsible capital allocation and management
Discretionary capital of R1.9 billion was released during the first half of 2017 through the excess cash dividend cover in respect of the 2016 financial year as well as a 
reduction in the capital allocation to Sanlam Capital Markets and Sanlam Personal Finance. The latter is largely attributable to more effective balance sheet management. We also 
disposed of our stakes in the Enterprise Group in Ghana. Sanlam follows a partnership approach in emerging markets outside of South Africa, a key driver of value over the long term.
After the Saham Finances acquisitions, it became clear that we will not be able to meet the future regional aspirations of our partner in Ghana while also being a shareholder in 
Saham Finances. Exiting the investment was the responsible option for our partners in Ghana and Sanlam shareholders, both being key stakeholders for the Group.

Opportunities to extract further capital are under investigation. This is approached in a responsible manner as the Group's long-term sustainability is dependent on having a 
resilient balance sheet that can withstand adverse conditions. This is a safeguard to our clients, staff, suppliers and broader society, and has built stakeholder trust in Sanlam 
over the almost 100 years of our existence. Conservatism is therefore inherent in the Sanlam culture and capital allocation methodology.

Responsible capital allocation also requires of us to invest where we can optimise value to our stakeholders. The deployment of capital during 2017 (refer Capital management
section below) was focused on areas with the highest growth and return on capital prospects. We also recently reached in principle agreement with ABSA to acquire ABSA 
Consultants and Actuaries (ACA). ACA houses the entire employee benefits business of the ABSA Group.

Outlook

Growth prospects outside of South Africa remain more positive with the improvement in economic conditions likely to persist in the medium term across most regions where we 
operate. Sanlam Emerging Markets is well placed to extract growth from this environment. In the short-term, though, growth in Rand terms in all key performance indicators 
will be inhibited by the stronger average Rand exchange rate. The disposal of the Group's stakes in the Enterprise Group in Ghana will also impact on full-year growth for
2017 and 2018, in particular for the Rest of Africa region. Ghana's contribution to the Group's new business volumes, net VNB and net result from financial services in the 
first half of 2017 were R130 million, R34 million and R28 million respectively.

In contrast, prospects for South Africa will remain muted for the remainder of 2017 and 2018. Political and economic policy uncertainty is not likely to dissipate before the 
African National Congress' National Elective Conference in December. Until policy certainty returns, low business and investor confidence will prevail. We commensurately do
not expect an improvement in the performance of the South African businesses for the remainder of the year. The risk of further downgrades to South Africa's sovereign credit 
ratings must be recognised, which will likely result in equity market, interest rate and currency volatility.

Shareholders need to be aware of the impact that the level of interest rates and financial market returns and volatility have on the Group's earnings and Group Equity Value.
Relative movements in these elements may have a major impact on the growth in normalised headline earnings, VNB and GEV to be reported for the 2017 financial year.

We will continue to diligently execute on the strategic priorities identified in the Group's 2016 Integrated Report.

Comments on the results

Introduction

The Sanlam Group's International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017 are presented based on and in compliance with 
IFRS, specifically IAS34 on Interim Financial Reporting. The basis of presentation and accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and Shareholders' information are 
in all material respects consistent with those applied in the 2016 Integrated Report and Annual Financial Statements, apart from the treatment of the Central Credit Manager (CCM):

- The CCM was introduced as a new initiative within Sanlam Capital Markets in the latter part of 2016 to extract value from credit exposures. Based on materiality, the CCM 
  was included in other operations for GEV purposes in 2016. With effect from 1 January 2017, the CCM has been reallocated to covered business given its focus on managing 
  assets of the covered business operations. The credit risk component of capital allocated to Sanlam Personal Finance and Sanlam Employee Benefits was transferred to the 
  CCM together with the related cost of capital charge. No value of in-force (VIF) or VNB are recognised in respect of future margins expected to be earned by the CCM,
  resulting in a negative VIF for the CCM equal to the cost of capital. All margins earned by the CCM are commensurately recognised as positive experience variances. The 
  CCM margins are net of a spread payment to Sanlam Personal Finance and Sanlam Employee Benefits, which is capitalised in the VIF of the latter businesses.

Comparative information has been restated for the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of certain assessed losses in policyholder funds after the introduction of a
separate Risk Policy Fund for South African insurance companies in the first half of 2016. Similar deferred tax assets were recognised in the Group's 2016 full year results.
It resulted in a large one-off tax income in the 2016 comparable period, which contributed to a significant decline in headline earnings in 2017. For purposes of the 
Shareholders' fund income statement and normalised headline earnings, the earnings impact was recognised as fund transfers, similar to the 2016 full year results.

Most of the Group businesses achieved a solid underlying performance in the first half of 2017 despite challenging economic and investment market conditions. Highlights and
lowlights for the six months include the following:

Operating environment

Economic conditions
Economic conditions in South Africa during the first six months of the 2017 financial year were not conducive to growth, as elaborated on in the Executive Review.

Equity markets
The South African equity market delivered a relatively weaker performance with the FTSE/JSE Swix Index recording a total return of 3.3% for the six months to 30 June 2017, 
compared to a return of 7.3% in the comparable six-month period in 2016. On average, the Swix was only 1.3% higher in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 
2016. The MSCI World Index return in Rand of 6% was well in excess of the -3.9% return for the first half of 2016. Investment performance in a number of the Rest of Africa 
markets where the Group operates were relatively stronger than the comparable 2016 period.

Interest rates
The South African 9- and 5-year interest rates declined by 10 and 40 basis points respectively since the end of 2016, but were broadly in line with the 30 June 2016 levels.
Movements in interest rates therefore did not have a major impact on VNB growth and RoGEV for the first six months of 2017. The South African All Bond Index returned 4% in 
the first half of 2017 compared to a return of 11.2% for the same period in 2016, reflecting the more stable interest rate environment during 2017 compared to excessive 
volatility in 2016.

Foreign currency exchange rates
The South African Rand strengthened sharply against most currencies during 2016, after a significant depreciation at the end of the 2015 financial year. Average exchange rates
during the first half of 2017 were commensurately stronger relative to the first six months of 2016. This had a major negative impact on the Rand-based performance of the 
Group's non-South African operations. The exchange rate of the Rand against the currencies to which the Group has major exposure is summarised in the table below.

Group Equity Value

GEV amounted to R112.1 billion or 5 469 cents per share on 30 June 2017. Including the dividend of 268 cents per share paid during the year, a RoGEV per share of 6.1% was
achieved for the first six months of 2017. This was below the 2017 six-month target of 6.4%. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact of investment market and 
currency volatility, interest rate changes and other one-off effects not under management control (such as tax changes), was well in excess of the target.

The interest rate environment did not have a significant impact on the valuation of the Group's businesses and hence RoGEV in the first half of 2017, due to more stable
interest rates and largely offsetting movements in long-term interest rates in South Africa and the Rest of Africa region. In the comparable 2016-period, long-term interest
rates declined by more than 100bps in South Africa, which had a positive impact on the discounted cash flow-based valuations of the South African businesses. RoGEV of these 
businesses was therefore in general higher in the first six months of 2016 than in 2017. RoGEV benefited from the following in the first half of 2017:

- Revaluation of the Group's operations in Ghana by some R870 million in line with the transaction price; 
- Strong growth in VNB, which added 1.5% (annualised 3.1%) to the return on covered business; and
- Positive operating experience variances and assumption changes, which added R687 million to RoGEV. Positive experience variances of R595 million emanated broadly from risk
  business, working capital management profit and credit spreads. Negative persistency experience of R114 million is an acceptable result in light of the pressure on 
  South African consumers. Assumption changes include a reduction in cost of capital following the decrease in capital allocated to the Sanlam Life covered business operations
  (refer Capital Management section below). Similar assumption changes will result from the further planned releases of capital.

The following detracted from RoGEV in the first half of 2017:

- An overall strengthening in the Rand exchange rate, which contributed to unrealised currency translation losses of some R820 million relative to longer term expected exchange
  rate movements;
- Lacklustre investment market performance, in particular in South Africa. Actual investment returns were lower than long-term assumptions, contributing to negative investment
  variances of some R270 million in respect of covered business, while also depressing the valuations of the Group's asset management businesses;
- A disappointing performance at Pacific & Orient in Malaysia;
- Negative economic assumption changes in the Sanlam Finances valuation;
- The impact of the CCM initiative. Assets formerly managed by Sanlam Investment Management were transferred to the CCM during the period. No value has been placed on the future
  margins to be earned by the CCM on these assets, while the asset management income was formerly valued in Sanlam Investment Management. This had a one-off negative impact
  of R150 million on RoGEV in 2017; and
- A relatively low return from Santam shares, which were also impacted by the unfavourable investment market conditions. The investment in Santam is valued at its listed market
  price for GEV purposes and reflects the share price performance during the period. This amounted to only 4.7% (annualised 9.6%) in the first six months of 2017, which was well 
  below the Group target.

* 6-months return (not annualised)

Group operations yielded an overall return of 6.8% in the first half of 2017, the combination of 9.5% return on covered business and 4.2% on other Group operations.

Sanlam Personal Finance's RoGEV of 8.5% was well in excess of its target. Covered business yielded a return of 8.6% compared to 12.8% in the first half of 2016. This is a
commendable result despite a relatively low 3.0% return on the capital backing the covered business operations during the six months to June 2017. The comparable period 
included a one-off benefit from tax changes. The strong VNB performance and positive experience variances were the main contributors to the excess return. The main components
of the positive experience variances were positive risk experience, working capital management profit and credit spreads earned from the CCM initiative. In addition, a 
positive cost of capital assumption change was recognised in respect of the lower capital allocation to the Sanlam Life covered business (refer Capital Management section 
below). The valuations of Glacier and Sanlam Personal Loans reflect solid operational results from these businesses, supporting a return of 8.2% from other operations in 
the first half of 2017 compared to 27.1% in the comparable 2016 period.

Despite an overall solid operational performance by Sanlam Emerging Markets in the first half of 2017, the cluster did not achieve its RoGEV hurdle for the six-month period.
RoGEV for the first half of 2017 of 6.6% (2016: 1.5%) is the combined result of 18% (2016: -0.8%) return on covered business and a yield of 2.4% (2016: 2.3%) on other
operations. The below-target return is mostly attributable to a stronger Rand exchange rate and negative economic assumptions changes in the Rest of Africa region, which had
a major negative impact on the valuation of Saham Finances' life and non-life operations. Adjusted RoGEV of 10.8% was well in excess of the target. The return from covered
business includes positive contributions from the revaluation of the Ghana operations, VNB and experience variances.

The Sanlam Investments operations recorded a RoGEV of 4.0% in the first half of 2017 compared to -0.1% in the first six months of 2016. Covered business yielded 8.0%
(2016:-10.3%) and other operations 3.4% (2016: 1%). The return on covered business includes positive credit spread operating experience variances generated by the CCM. 
The relatively low return from other operations were largely due to the impact of investment market conditions on the asset bases, fee income and hence valuations of the
South African asset management businesses, as well as the R150 million negative valuation methodology impact relating to the transfer of assets from Sanlam Investment
Management to the CCM. Excluding the latter, RoGEV for the cluster amounted to 4.9%.

As mentioned above, the RoGEV on Santam reflects the return on the listed Santam share.

Sanlam Corporate achieved a RoGEV of 9.2%, well in excess of its target (2016: -0.3%). The strong operational performance of the healthcare business supported a RoGEV of
25.1% for other operations (2016: 6%). This was augmented by a return of 6.6% from Sanlam Employee Benefits covered business, which includes positive operating experience
variances from risk experience, working capital management profit and credit spreads earned from the CCM activities.

The negative return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:

- A lower level of discretionary capital following payment of the Saham Finances and Shriram Life and General Insurance acquisitions during 2016.
- Hedging of the additional investment in Saham Finances during 2017. The transaction was hedged through the acquisition of foreign currency, which earned a very low rate 
  of interest due to the US Dollar denomination. The application of hedge accounting principles in the GEV presentation furthermore eliminated the foreign currency movements,
  essentially exposing the portfolio to assets that earned close to zero return.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R4.1 billion increased by 1% on 2016. Solid operational growth at all clusters were impacted by the following:

- In terms of the Group's accounting policies, up front acquisition costs incurred in respect of insurance contracts are not capitalised but immediately expensed, resulting
  in new business strain at initial recognition. New business strain incurred by Sanlam Personal Finance increased by R114 million after tax due to the strong growth in new
  recurring premium risk business.
- Catastrophe claims incurred by Santam in June 2017 reduced its net underwriting profit by R102 million after reinsurance and reinstatement premiums.
- Demonetisation in India in the latter half of 2016 had a negative impact on the arrears position of the Shriram credit businesses, requiring an increase in provisioning in
  terms of IFRS of some R110 million after tax and allowing for Sanlam Emerging Markets' effective shareholding. This impact appears temporary in nature, with improvements
  in performance already evident. Depending on future arrears development, partial reversal of this provision is possible.
- The stronger average Rand exchange rate suppressed net result from financial services by R168 million in the first half of 2017.
- The acquisition of the initial 30% shareholding in Saham Finances at the end of February 2016 and an additional 16.6% stake at the beginning of May 2017 enhanced Sanlam 
  Emerging Markets' profit contribution relative to 2016. The acquisition of 23% direct stakes in Shriram Life and General Insurance in the latter half of 2016 similarly 
  supported growth in the first half of 2017 on a relative basis.

Excluding the above abnormal items, net result from financial services increased by a solid 11%, a commendable overall performance.

Sanlam Personal Finance achieved solid growth for a largely mature business in a challenging South African business environment.

Sanlam Individual Life grew its net result from financial services by 2% in the first half of 2017. Excluding the increase in new business strain, Individual Life net result
from financial services grew by a healthy 9%. Despite pressure on single premium new business, assets under management in the savings business increased by some 6%, supporting 
fund-based fee income. This was augmented by additional margins earned from an increase in the size of the in-force books of risk and guarantee plan business (due to strong
new business growth in recent years) and a higher profit contribution from annuity business. The latter is largely attributable to the establishment of the CCM, which 
enhanced the credit margins being extracted from the annuity portfolio. Sanlam Personal Loans' profit contribution was in line with 2016, with a conservative bad debt 
reserving approach and an increase in administration costs offsetting the positive impact of a larger loan book.

Sanlam Sky's net result from financial services increased by 3%. An increase in margins released from the growing in-force book was largely offset by new business strain 
recognised in respect of the strong growth in new business volumes. Excluding the latter, net result from financial services increased by 8%.

Glacier grew its net profit contribution by 8%. Growth in assets under management slowed down, attributable to lower net fund inflows and lacklustre South African investment
market performance since the end of 2015. Earnings growth was largely in line with the growth in assets under management.

Sanlam Emerging Market's net result from financial services declined by 2%. Excluding structural growth, the impact of a stronger Rand exchange rate and demonetisation-related
credit provisioning in India, net result from financial services grew by 18%.

Namibia had a difficult six months, resulting in a marginal 2% increase in its net result from financial services. Group life claims experience weakened in the life insurance
business, with disability claims increasing substantially. This is similar to the trend experienced in South Africa during 2016 and is partly attributable to the current
difficult economic environment in Namibia. Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH) earnings were also under pressure from a decline in Bank Windhoek's net interest margin
following the liquidity constraints and increase in cost of capital in the Namibian banking industry. Growth in Namibia's gross result from financial services will be 
negatively affected for the remainder of 2017 and 2018 by corporate transactions in Namibia, but with only a small effect on net result from financial services. CIH sold
14.5% of its stake in Bank Windhoek to the Namibian government pension fund during the six months. Cavmont Bank Zambia and Bank of Gabarone in Botswana were also sold to
Bank Windhoek. The disposals resulted in Bank Windhoek becoming an associate of CIH. Bank Windhoek will accordingly be accounted for as an associate within CIH in future 
reporting periods as opposed to a consolidated subsidiary.

Botswana's net result from financial services declined by 23% (down 16% in constant currency). Life insurance profit was negatively affected by the decline in annuity new
business volumes as well as credit-related loss recognised in the annuity portfolio. The asset management business achieved good growth following strong net fund inflows in 
2016 and 2017 year-to-date. Letshego also delivered a solid contribution in constant currency despite competitive pressures from local banks in Botswana.

The Rest of Africa operations (excluding Saham Finances) grew their contribution by 37% (doubling in constant currency) with most businesses achieving strong growth. Saham
Finances' contribution of R116 million increased by 27% on 2016 (up more than 50% in constant currency) and remains in line with expectations.

Net result from financial services in India declined by 5% due to the stronger Rand exchange rate and demonetisation-related credit provisioning, partly offset by structural
growth related to the acquisition of the 23% direct stakes in Shriram Life and Shriram General Insurance in the latter half of 2016. Excluding these, underlying organic 
growth amounted to 30% in constant currency. All lines of business achieved good organic growth. Shriram Life Insurance continued to expand its new dedicated distribution 
footprint, with initial losses from new branches suppressing the profit contribution to net result from financial services by some R20 million. The expanding footprint
contributed to strong growth in VNB.

In Malaysia, net result from financial services decreased by 17% (up 21% in constant currency), the aggregate of strong growth from MCIS and a disappointing decline in
Pacific & Orient's contribution. The MCIS performance was supported by a low base in 2016, which included a number of one-offs, and improved cost efficiencies. Net written
premiums declined at Pacific & Orient, attributable to a loss in market share in its traditional line of business. Diversification of the Pacific & Orient book remains a
challenge but is receiving dedicated attention.The general insurance industry in Malaysia is going through detariffing in July 2017. This creates an opportunity to price
more appropriately, but will be dependent on market participants' response.

Sanlam Investment's net result from financial services declined by 1% (up 6% in constant currency).

Investment management net result from financial services increased by 13% in constant currency. Fee income in the South African businesses was under pressure from relatively
flat equity markets (the average JSE/FTSE Swix Index increased by only 1%) and lower brokerage volumes as investor risk aversion remained high. This was partly alleviated 
by strategic focus on cost efficiencies. The international businesses achieved strong growth from a low base in the first half of 2016, which included restructuring costs.
Sanlam Capital Markets' profitability declined by 11% net of tax. This is largely attributable to large one-off items in 2016. The comparable 2016 period included
marked-to-marked gains from credit and equity-participation stuctures following losses in respect of these instruments at the end of 2015 when credit spreads widened and the
share prices of counters underlying the equity participation structures declined. This increased the comparative base.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Santam had a difficult first six months in 2017 with a number of large corporate claims and catastrophe events highlighted in the Executive Review. Profitability of the 
property line of business was severely affected, partly offset by good performance from the crop and motor lines.

Santam's overall underwriting margin declined from 6.4% in the first half of 2016 to 4% in 2017, a resilient performance in these circumstances, assisted by Santam's 
diversified book. Higher float income and the structural impact of the Shriram General and Saham Finances acquisitions limited the decline in Santam's net result from 
financial services to 13%.

Sanlam Corporate achieved exceptional growth of 31% in its net result from financial services.

Claims experience at Sanlam Employee benefits was still higher than long term expectations, but improved on the first half of 2016. Group risk profit increased by 55% as a
result, supporting overall growth of 26% in Sanlam Employee Benefits' net result from financial services.

Sanlam Healthcare Management (which predominantly includes the Group's stake in Medscheme) also achieved sterling growth of 49%, benefiting from new schemes and an increase
in the number of members under administration.

Normalised headline earnings of R4.5 billion are 5% up on the comparable 2016 period. This is the combined effect of the 1% increase in net result from financial services and
a 55% rise in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio. Net investment return were negatively affected in the first half of 2016 by:
                                                                                                                                                                       
- The sharp strengthening of the Rand from 31 December 2015 to 30 June 2016, which suppressed the Rand-based performance of the offshore exposure in the capital portfolio;
- Investment market under performance in a number of Sanlam Emerging Markets regions; and
- A R175 million one-off CGT expense incurred due to the increase in the effective CGT rate in South Africa.

More favourable investment market returns outside of South Africa supported net investment return in 2017. The redeployment of capital for investment in Saham Finances and
Shriram Life and Shriram General Insurance subsequent to the end of June 2016 reduced net investment income by some R100 million in 2017.

Headline earnings declined by 18% compared to the first six months of 2016. The divergent growth between normalised headline earnings and headline earnings is attributable
to the deferred tax assets raised in the 2016 comparative half-year results in respect of assessed losses in certain policyholder funds (refer Introduction above). This 
increased the comparable base.

Business volumes

Overall new business volumes declined by 4%, largely attributable to lower single premium life and investment inflows in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.

Life and investment new business volumes declined by 3% and 8% respectively, while general insurance earned premiums increased by 16%. In constant currency and
excluding structural growth, new business volumes declined by 3%.

Sanlam Personal Finance's new business sales declined by 7%, a resilient performance in an environment of weak investor confidence.

Sanlam Sky, operating largely in the South African entry-level market, achieved sterling growth of 15%. Individual life recurring premium new business increased by 5%, the
combination of 16% growth in risk business and a 48% decline in savings business as the business mix continued to improve. Group recurring premium sales increased by 48%, 
benefiting from a large new scheme written by Safrican and the biennial renewal of the Zionist Christian Church scheme in 2017.

New business volumes in the Individual Life segment, which is largely focused on the middle-income market in South Africa, increased by 3%. Single premium sales increased
by 2% with good demand for guaranteed products in the uncertain environment. New recurring premium risk business grew by 14% and this was augmented by good demand for
retirement annuities, which increased by 9%. Endowments and ad hoc premium increases experienced lower demand in the first half of 2017.

Glacier new business volumes declined by a disappointing 10%. New life business volumes were in line with the first half of 2016, but investment business inflows declined by 16%.
This is largely attributable to low investor confidence.

The Sanlam Emerging Markets operations grew their new business contribution by 19% (6% excluding structural growth). In constant currency, new business increased by 32% 
(17% excluding structural growth), a satisfactory overall performance. All regions and lines of business achieved strong growth, with the exception of:

- Namibian investment business, which declined by 9%. This more than offset 16% growth in new life business.
- Botswana life business, which declined by 11% in constant currency due to lower single premium annuity inflows. A decrease in the value of retirement funds available for 
  investment contributed to competitive market pricing and a loss in market share for the Group's life insurance business. Appropriate management actions are under 
  consideration by Sanlam Emerging Markets' regional and local management. New investment business inflows to the Botswana investment management operations increased by more
  than 60%, supporting overall new business growth of 35% in constant currency.
- Tanzania and Zimbabwe, which had a slow start to the year.
- The Malaysian life and general insurance businesses, which disappointed with an overall 18% decline in new business sales in constant currency due to slow progress in 
  diversifying lines of business.

Sanlam Investments' new business volumes declined by 8% (5% down in constant currency).

The South African investment management business did well to attract new mandates broadly in line with the comparable period in 2016. Particularly satisfactory is an increase 
in new institutional mandates, an area where the business has struggled to gain traction for a number of years. Retail inflows slowed down due to low investor confidence in 
the retail market and increased competition for the cluster's Implemented Consulting offering. As highlighted in the Executive Review, the impact of low investor confidence
is now also experienced by Sanlam Private Wealth in the high net worth segment, with new inflows declining by 25%. Similar to Glacier, Sanlam Private Wealth is working on new
innovative product offerings to improve its share of profitable new business. The international operations' new inflows declined by 8% compared to the first six months of 2016 
in constant currency. The United Kingdom management team's focus has returned to growth after the period of restructuring, with an improved performance expected over the next
18 months.

Despite a highly competitive South African market, Santam achieved sterling growth of 14% in gross written premiums, with double digit growth in all of the major lines of 
business. Net earned premiums increased by a lower 9% mainly due to reinstatement premiums payable in respect of the catastrophe claims.

New business volumes at Sanlam Corporate declined by 5% due to a decrease in the more volatile single premium inflows. Gaining market share of the more profitable, but highly
competitive, recurring premium risk business has been a strategic focus area for Sanlam Corporate. The initiatives gained good traction and, together with some re-pricing, 
contributed to sterling growth of more than 200% in this line of business.

Net fund inflows of R18.9 billion were achieved in the first half of 2017 despite significantly lower single premium inflows at Glacier and Sanlam Private Wealth. The increase 
in Sanlam Investments' net inflows from R6.9 billion in the first half of 2016 to R9.2 billion in 2017 is a particularly pleasing result.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. Long-term interest rates at 30 June 2017 were broadly in line with the 30 June 2016
levels, with no significant impact on VNB growth on a comparable basis. The 17% growth in VNB in constant currency (11% at actual average exchange rates) is an exceptional
performance and testimony to the Group's resilience in challenging conditions. By remaining focused on the profitability and quality of new business written, the Group's 
life insurance operations managed to increase the overall VNB margin from 2.44% in the first six months of 2016 to 2.61% in the first half of 2017.

Sanlam Personal Finance achieved exceptional growth of 17% in VNB while also increasing its overall VNB margin from 2.49% in the first half of 2016 to 2.76% in 2017. The
strong growth in new recurring premium risk business across all market segments, augmented by good demand for single premium guaranteed business, contributed to a favourable
change in business mix towards the more profitable product ranges. Investment in capacity as part of the realignment of Sanlam Personal Finance during 2016 and increased 
allowance for one-off project expenses in the unit costing resulted in some margin contraction in the individual life risk and savings businesses. This is expected to be
temporary in nature as the new structure will drive enhanced future new business growth.

Sanlam Emerging Markets net VNB declined by 6%, but was 17% up in constant currency (5% up in constant currency and excluding structural growth). Namibian net VNB declined
by 36% due to a change in business mix from individual lines of business to group life business. A decline in VNB in Botswana, Tanzania and Malaysia was in line with the
new life business production. All other regions achieved very strong VNB growth. VNB margins were broadly in line with the comparable 2016 period.

The growth in recurring premium risk business at Sanlam Corporate supported a more than 100% increase in the cluster's VNB contribution.

Sanlam UK was restructured into a more vertically integrated business during 2016. A consequence of the new structure is that most of the profit from new business written 
on the life licence is earned in the non-life operations. VNB of Sanlam Investments commensurably reduced to close to zero, but does not represent the actual profit throughout
the value chain.

Capital management

The Group started the year with unallocated discretionary capital of R550 million, after allowing for the BrightRock acquisition and a portion of the acquisition consideration
in respect of the additional 16.6% stake in Saham Finances.

Additional discretionary capital of R2.7 billion was released during the six months ended 30 June 2017:

- The disposal of the Group's stakes in the Enterprise Group in Ghana will yield net proceeds of some R1.6 billion.
- As communicated in the Group's 2016 annual results announcement, capital allocated to the covered business operations on the Sanlam Life balance sheet can be reduced by
  R2 billion over time. Investment return earned on this capital base is also available for release. The first R500 million was released from the capital base at the end of
  June 2017, together with the net investment return of R292 million earned during the six months then ended.
- The introduction of the Central Credit Manager enabled the transfer of credit exposures from the Sanlam Capital Markets balance sheet to Sanlam Life. This released R350 million 
  of the capital allocated to Sanlam Capital Markets.

The excess cash dividend cover relating to the 2016 financial year also added some R800 million.

Utilisation of discretionary capital during the first half of 2017 included the following transactions:

- Debt funding of up to US$140 million was considered as part of the funding model for the acquisition of the additional 16.6% stake in Saham Finances. The Enterprise Group 
  disposal eliminated the need for debt funding, with this portion of the acquisition consideration (R1.8 billion) also funded from discretionary capital.
- The acquisition of a controlling stake in PineBridge Investments East Africa (renamed to Sanlam Investments East Africa) and other smaller transactions utilised some 
  R260 million. The PineBridge acquisition provides the Group with a meaningful investment management capability in East Africa for future growth in this line of business.

The Enterprise Group disposal became effective on 25 August 2017, while the BrightRock acquisition was effective on 1 September 2017.

Allowing for the above transactions, including payment of the BrightRock acquisition, available discretionary capital increased to R2 billion at 30 June 2017. We remain focused
on utilising the available discretionary capital for value-accretive investment opportunities. The EasyEquities and ACA acquisitions referred to in the Executive Review will
utilise some of the available R2 billion discretionary capital.

Solvency

All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of June 2017. The total admissible regulatory capital (including identified 
discretionary capital) of Sanlam Life, the holding company of the Group's major life insurance subsidiaries, of R43 billion, covered its capital adequacy requirements (CAR) 
5.3 times under the current solvency regime.

As indicated in previous results announcements, South Africa is implementing a new solvency regime (Solvency Assessment and Management - SAM) modelled on the European 
Solvency II regime with an anticipated effective date of 1 July 2018. A Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) target cover range under SAM of between 1.7 times and 2.1 times has
been set for Sanlam Life's covered business. The R9.5 billion of IFRS-based required capital allocated to these operations at the end of June 2017 translated into a SCR cover
at the upper end of this target range. The SCR cover ratio for the Sanlam Life entity as a whole at 3 times exceeded the covered business ratio at the end of June 2017 due to 
the inclusion of discretionary and other capital held on the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as investments in Santam and other Group operations that are not allocated to
Sanlam Life's covered business operations (i.e. not included in the R9.5 billion allocated capital referred to above). The Sanlam Group SCR cover ratio of 2.1 times remained
broadly in line with the 2.2 times cover at 31 December 2016. The Group will increasingly focus on the Group SCR cover as the main solvency measure.

Dividend

The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large shareholder base.

Accounting policies and basis of preparation

The preparation of the Group's reviewed interim financial statements was supervised by the financial director, Heinie Werth CA(SA).

The basis of presentation applied for purposes of the interim condensed financial statements is in accordance with and contain the information required by International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically IAS 34 on interim financial reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee,
the Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

The policy liabilities and profit entitlement rules are determined in accordance with prevailing legislation, generally accepted actuarial practice and the stipulations 
contained in the demutualisation proposal. There have been no material changes in the financial soundness valuation basis since 31 December 2016, apart from changes in the 
economic assumptions.

The accounting policies and basis of preparation for the IFRS financial statements and shareholders' information are in all material respects consistent with those applied 
in the 2016 annual report apart from the treatment of the Central Credit Manager (CCM).

- The CCM was introduced as a new initiative within Sanlam Capital Markets in the latter part of 2016 to extract value from credit exposures. With effect from 1 January 2017,
  the CCM has been reallocated to covered business given its focus on managing assets of the covered business operations. The credit risk component of capital allocated to 
  Sanlam Personal Finance and Sanlam Employee Benefits was transferred to the CCM together with the related cost of capital charge. No value of in-force (VIF) or VNB is 
  recognised in respect of future margins expected to be earned by the CCM, resulting in a negative VIF for the CCM equal to the cost of capital. All margins earned by the
  CCM are commensurately recognised as positive experience variances. The CCM margins are net of a spread payment to Sanlam Personal Finance and Sanlam Employee Benefits, 
  which is capitalised in the VIF of the latter businesses.

Comparative information has been restated for the  following:

- Sanlam Employee Benefits and the Healthcare businesses in Sanlam Personal Finance were reallocated to the newly formed Sanlam Corporate cluster, in line with the restatements
  made in the December 2016 annual financial statements.
- The recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of certain assessed losses in policyholder funds after the introduction of a separate Risk Policy Fund for South African 
  insurance companies during 2016. These deferred tax assets were recognised in the Group's 2016 full year results, but erroneously not in the June 2016 results. It resulted 
  in a large one-off tax income in the 2016 comparable period. For purposes of the Shareholders' fund income statement and normalised headline earnings, the earnings impact was
  recognised as fund transfers, similar to the 2016 full year results.

None  of  the  new  or  revised  IFRSs  or  interpretations, including IFRS 15, that become effective in the current period had a material effect on the Group's interim results;
however, they will require certain additional disclosures in the annual financial statements.

The following new or revised IFRSs and interpretations, effective in future years and not early adopted, may have an impact on future results:

- Amendments to IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Transactions (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective 1 January 2019)
- IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2021)

The impact of the application of these revised standards and interpretations in future financial reporting periods on the Group's reported results, financial position and cash 
flows are still being assessed. The Group is currently focusing on projects to determine the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. The key complexity of applying IFRS 9 is likely to be
on classification and measurement, but the outcome of this project is expected to be that no significant change to the overall statement of financial position will be required.
In addition, we are expecting adjustments in certain equity accounted investments that are primarily lending businesses as a result of the changes to the impairment requirements
of the standard. Comparative information will not be restated on adoption of IFRS 9 and the hedging guidance of IFRS 9 will not be adopted. The IFRS 17 project is currently 
focused on performing a gap analysis at this early stage and the Group will provide an update in future reporting periods. No significant changes are expected as a result of the
adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.

Independent auditors' review report on Sanlam Limited interim Shareholders' information

To the directors of Sanlam Limited

Introduction
We have reviewed the accompanying interim Shareholders' Information of Sanlam Limited for the six months ended 30 June 2017, comprising Group Equity Value; Change in Group
Equity Value; Return on Group Equity Value; Shareholders' fund at fair value; Shareholders' fund at net asset value; Shareholders' fund income statement; Notes to the 
shareholders' fund information; and Embedded Value of covered business, Change in Embedded Value of covered business, Value of New Business and Notes to the Embedded Value
of covered business; as set out below.

Directors' responsibility for interim financial information
The directors of Sanlam Limited are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial information in accordance with the basis of accounting set out 
above, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial information that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information. We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 
(ISRE) 2410, ""Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"". ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the basis of accounting set out above.
This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial information in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of 
management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim Shareholders' Information for the six months ended 30 June 2017
is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of accounting set out above.

Basis of accounting
Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to the Sanlam Limited Shareholders' Information, which describes the basis of accounting. The Sanlam Limited
Interim Shareholders' Information is prepared to provide additional information in respect of the Group shareholders' fund in a format that corresponds with that used by 
management in evaluating the performance of the Group. As a result the Sanlam Limited Interim Shareholders' information may not be suitable for another purpose.

Independent auditors' review report on interim condensed consolidated financial statements

To the shareholders of Sanlam Limited

Introduction
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Sanlam Limited, contained in the accompanying interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 30 June 2017 and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow for the six-month period then
ended and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' responsibility for the interim financial statements
The directors of Sanlam Limited are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 34 - ""Interim Financial Reporting"", the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides, as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error.

Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard 
of Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, ""Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"". ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether 
anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial information in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of
management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review is substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Sanlam Limited
for the six-month period ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 34, ""Interim Financial

Restatement of the Group cash flow statement
Cash, deposits and similar securities disclosed in the statement of financial position include financial instruments of varying durations in line with the definition of the
Solvency Assessment and Management regime being implemented in South Africa and the operational management of liquidity by the Group. During 2016, the Group reassessed the
application of IAS 7 to liquid instruments held to match certain five-year guaranteed investment contracts issued to policyholders by a subsidiary. The application of IAS 7
to these instruments was amended, resulting in a reallocation of R25 million between the movement in cash, deposits and similar securities and cash flows from investment 
activities for 2016.

Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2017

1. Earnings per share
   For basic earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the treasury shares held by subsidiaries, consolidated investment funds and
   policyholders. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
  
   For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the shares not yet issued under the Sanlam Share Incentive Scheme and treasury
   shares held by subsidiaries, consolidated investment funds and policyholders. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted diluted weighted
   average number of shares in issue.
   
   Refer above for normalised earnings per share, which is based on the economic earnings attributable to the shareholders' fund, and should also be used when evaluating 
   the Group's economic performance.

   All conditions precedent to the disposal of the Group's stakes in the Enterprise Group and the acquisition of a 53% stake in BrightRock Holdings were fulfilled during 
   August 2017 and September 2017, respectively. Due to the timing of the BrightRock Holdings transaction, the acquisition accounting will be finalised in the second half 
   of 2017. No further material facts or circumstances have arisen between the dates of the statement of financial position and this report that affect the financial position
   of the Sanlam Group at 30 June 2017 as reflected in these financial statements.

5. Fair value disclosures
   Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy
   Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining
   the measurements. It should be noted that these disclosures only cover assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

   Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities.

   Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
   either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are 
   supported by prices from observable current market transactions are categorised as level 2.
   
   Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

Disposal of Enterprise Group investments

The board of directors of Sanlam hereby announces that Sanlam Emerging Markets
Proprietary Limited (“SEM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary within the Sanlam Group, has
entered into agreements on 22 June 2017 with Black Star Holdings Limited, a separate
managed account held by LeapFrog Strategic African Investments and Prudential
Insurance of America, for the disposal of its stakes in Enterprise Life Assurance
Company Limited, Enterprise Trustees Limited and Enterprise Insurance Company
Limited for a cash consideration of US$130 million (“the Disposal”). With SEM as a
strategic partner in both the Enterprise Group and Saham Finances, it would have been
difficult to meet the regional expansion aspirations of the Enterprise Group. The parties
therefore agreed for SEM to exit from the Enterprise Group, but with Sanlam able to
continue participating in Ghana. Ghana remains a strategically important geography for
the Sanlam Group and options to re-establish a meaningful presence in the country are
under consideration.

The Enterprise Group contributed R105 million to Sanlam’s net result from financial
services, R281 million to new business volumes and R53 million to net Value of New
Business in the 2016 financial year. At current exchange rates, Sanlam Emerging
Markets is expected to realise a profit compared to the 31 December 2016 Group
Equity Value of the business. The transaction remains subject to conditions precedent,
including regulatory approvals and notifications.

The conclusion of the Disposal will increase the Group’s available discretionary capital,
after allowance for payment of the BrightRock and PineBridge transactions, to some R2
billion, which is sufficient for the Group’s immediate needs. Raising debt to fund a
portion of the additional 16.6% stake acquired in Saham Finances, as referred to in the
Operational Update released on the Stock Exchange News Services of the JSE Limited
on 7 June 2017, is commensurately not subject to further consideration.

The consideration in respect of the Disposal is below the categorisation threshold of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Operational Update – June 2017

The Group maintained a resilient operational performance for the first four months of
the 2017 financial year. The key trends emerging during the 2016 financial year
persisted into 2017.

Strong growth in the more profitable recurring premium risk business in South Africa
supported sterling growth in the value of new life business at a higher overall margin.
Embedding client centricity and a stringent focus on new business quality in Sanlam’s
culture over many years has been a key driver of the Group’s new business
performance and is also supporting persistency levels. Satisfactory growth was
achieved in net result from financial services despite a marked increase in new
business strain recognised pursuant to the increase in new risk business, as well as the
negative impact of a stronger average Rand exchange rate against the major
currencies where the Group operates. The operational performance of Saham
Finances, the major new acquisition concluded during 2016, remained in line with the
business plan.

The first four months of 2017 was a very eventful period for South Africa. An
unexpected cabinet reshuffle and removal of the Minister of Finance at the end of
March were followed by downgrades of South Africa’s foreign currency rating to below
investment grade by two rating agencies, with one also downgrading the local currency
rating to below investment grade. Investment market reaction to these events were not
as adverse as anticipated, as it coincided with renewed emerging market interest from
global investors, providing support to the Rand, equity markets and long-term interest
rates. The renewed political and policy uncertainties were, however, detrimental to
investor, business and consumer confidence, which impacted on the Group’s new
business growth in the mass affluent and high net worth segments, and will also delay
any meaningful improvement in economic and employment conditions. The South
African operating environment therefore remained particularly challenging for our
businesses.

Economic conditions in Namibia continue to be impacted by liquidity constraints
emanating from its twin deficit, while the economies and currencies of Nigeria and
Angola remained under pressure from low oil prices. The economic outlook in the other
Africa regions where the Group operates is slowly improving. Economic conditions in
India and Malaysia remain robust, with the short-term impact of demonetisation in India
negatively impacting on the results of the Shriram credit businesses, as anticipated.
Despite volatility in the Rand exchange rate during the four-month period to 30 April
2017, the average exchange rate of the Rand against the major currencies where the
Group operates was significantly stronger during the first four months of 2017
compared to 2016. This had a major negative effect on the translated Rand results of
Sanlam Emerging Markets as well as Sanlam Investments’ international operations.


                                                                                1|Page
Globally, investor concern around geopolitical risk subsided somewhat following the
Dutch and French election results, supported by anticipated stimulative economic
measures in the United States and improving leading economic indicators in China and
Europe. This drove a rally in global equities and a return of demand for emerging
market investments. These conditions provided some support to the South African
investment markets as highlighted above, and commensurately investment return
earned on the Group’s capital portfolio.

Results
The constant currency information included in this operational update has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and is the
responsibility of the Group’s board of directors. It is presented for illustrative purposes
only and because of its nature may not fairly present the company’s financial position,
changes in equity, result of operations or cash flows. All references to constant
currency information are based on the translation of foreign currency results for the four
months to 30 April 2017 at the weighted average exchange rate for the four months to
30 April 2016, which is also applied for the translation of comparative information. The
major currencies contributing to the exchange rate movements are the British Pound,
Indian Rupee, Botswana Pula and the Nigerian Naira.

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the four months to 30 April 2017
are:

-       New business volumes of R71 billion, down 4% on the first four months of the
        2016 financial year (down 3% in constant currency and 4% lower in constant
        currency and excluding the impact of structural growth), largely due to lower lump-
        sum inflows at Glacier, Sanlam Investments Retail and Sanlam Private Wealth.

    o    Sanlam Personal Finance achieved strong growth in the more profitable
         recurring premium risk business lines. This was, however, more than offset by a
         decline in discretionary single premium business in the mass affluent market, as
         investor risk aversion remain elevated in the uncertain political and economic
         environment. Overall new business sales at Sanlam Personal Finance declined
         by 10% as a result.

         Sanlam Sky new business sales increased by an exemplary 27% on the
         comparable 2016 period. The change in mix towards risk business continued to
         yield positive results, contributing to 18% growth in Sanlam Sky’s individual life
         risk business sales. Sales of savings products declined by 49%, with overall
         individual life new recurring business increasing by 5%. A large new scheme
         written by Safrican in the first four months of 2017 supported a more than
         doubling in new Group recurring premium business at Sanlam Sky.

         New business volumes in the middle-income market increased by 4%. Solid
         demand for products providing an investment guarantee supported growth of 4%
         in new life insurance single premium sales. New recurring premium life business
         increased by 7%. Lower demand for traditional recurring premium endowments
         was more than offset by solid growth in retirement annuities and tax free savings
         products, as well as a 16% increase in new recurring premium risk business.



                                                                                    2|Page
    As highlighted above, Glacier new business volumes remained under pressure
    and declined by a disappointing 14%.

o   Sanlam Emerging Markets recorded overall new business growth of 20%, with
    structural growth more than offsetting the negative impact of a stronger average
    Rand exchange rate. In constant currency, new business volumes increased by
    29% (up 2% in constant currency and excluding structural growth). Economic
    conditions in Namibia are placing pressure on new business performance, with
    overall new business volumes in line with 2016. Namibia also experienced a
    change in mix from individual life business to the less profitable group life line of
    business. Annuity sales in Botswana declined significantly during the period, the
    combined effect of a reduction in the value of retirement funds becoming
    available as well as competitive pressures. This contributed to a 2% decline in
    Botswana new business volumes in constant currency (8% decline at actual
    exchange rates).

    Excluding Saham Finances, Rest of Africa new business volumes increased by
    6% in constant currency (10% lower at actual exchange rates). Most regions
    contributed to the growth in constant currency, apart from Tanzania, Nigeria,
    Zimbabwe and Zambia, which had slow starts to the year. Saham Finances’ new
    business production was in line with the business plan, with the Angola
    operations in particular holding up well in a difficult environment.

    The Indian operations delivered strong growth, more than doubling its new
    business contribution in constant currency and at actual exchange rates. In
    Malaysia, delayed new product launches at both the life and general insurance
    businesses contributed to a disappointing 23% decline in constant currency new
    business sales. A number of new products are planned to be launched during
    2017, subject to regulatory approval, which should support an improved
    performance over the medium term.

o   Sanlam Investments achieved good growth in institutional fund inflows. The
    uncertain political and economic environment, however, had a severe impact on
    demand for implemented consulting and Sanlam Private Wealth solutions. This
    was aggravated by lacklustre demand in the United Kingdom, contributing to a
    2% decline in overall new business volumes in constant currency (down 3% at
    actual exchange rate).

o   Sanlam Employee Benefits achieved a pleasing threefold increase in new
    recurring premium business. The more volatile single premium new business
    declined from a high base in the first four months of 2016.

o   Net value of new life business (“VNB”) on a consistent economic basis increased
    by 24% on the comparable period in 2016 (28% on constant economic and
    currency basis). VNB margins have been largely maintained on a per product
    basis with changes in mix towards the more profitable lines of business
    supporting an overall increase in margins. Sanlam Personal Finance’s VNB
    increased by more than 20% on a consistent economic basis, with the overall
    VNB margin improving on 2016. This performance is primarily attributable to the
    substantial growth in Individual Life risk and Sanlam Sky new business. The


                                                                                 3|Page
        decline in Glacier single premium new business had a muted overall effect given
        the lower margin of this line of business. Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net VNB
        grew by a moderate 7% on a consistent economic and currency basis. A lower
        VNB contribution from Namibia, Botswana and Malaysia partly offset strong
        performances from the other regions. Sanlam Employee Benefits also achieved
        a much improved performance, supported by the growth in recurring premium
        Group Risk business.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R12 billion were down on the R16 billion achieved in
        the comparable four-month period in 2016, largely due to the decline in Sanlam
        Personal Finance single premium new business. Despite the pressure on
        Sanlam Investments new business inflows, retention of funds under
        management was well managed with the cluster’s net inflows increasing
        marginally on 2016.

    o   Persistency is under pressure in some lines of business, but overall persistency
        experience remained broadly in line with actuarial assumptions.

-   Net result from financial services up 5% on the first four months of the 2016
    financial year in constant currency (up 3% at actual exchange rates). Excluding the
    rise in new business strain at Sanlam Personal Finance, net result from financial
    services increased by 10% in constant currency.

    o   The strong growth in risk business at Sanlam Sky and Individual Life generated a
        significant increase in the new business strain recognised in terms of the Group’s
        prudent accounting policies. This limited growth in Sanlam Personal Finance’s
        net result from financial services to 3%. Excluding the increase in new business
        strain, Sanlam Personal Finance achieved commendable growth of 11% on the
        first four months of 2016. Mortality claims experience remained within the
        actuarial assumption base.

    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net result from financial services declined by 11%,
        with a stronger average Rand exchange rate, the impact of demonetisation in
        India and a decline in profitability in Namibia and Botswana offsetting the positive
        impact of structural growth. In constant currency, net result from financial
        services declined by 1% (down 16% in constant currency and excluding
        structural growth). Saham Finances’ operating earnings were in line with the
        business plan. As anticipated, demonetisation in India in the latter half of 2016
        had a negative impact on the arrears position of the Shriram credit businesses,
        requiring an increase in provisioning in terms of International Financial Reporting
        Standards of some R110 million after tax and allowing for Sanlam Emerging
        Markets’ effective shareholding. This impact is temporary in nature, with
        improvements in performance already evident. Excluding the impact of
        demonetisation, Sanlam Emerging Markets’ net result from financial services
        increased by 10% on a comparable basis (constant currency and excluding
        structural growth).

        Profitability is under pressure in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya and Malaysia, with a
        solid performance from the other regions. In Namibia, higher group life claims
        experience and the difficult economic environment were the main detractors.


                                                                                   4|Page
        Botswana earnings were significantly affected by the decline in new annuity
        business and credit-related provisioning in the annuity portfolio, partly offset by
        good growth in investment management earnings. High claims experience, lower
        property sales and negative expense variances are impacting on the Kenya
        results. General insurance earnings in Malaysia remained depressed due to a
        decline in net earned premiums, offsetting a good performance by the life
        business.

    o   Sanlam Investments’ contribution to net result from financial services increased
        by 1% (up 6% in constant currency). The South African asset and wealth
        management businesses did well to record only a marginal decline in operating
        earnings despite no real growth in assets under management due to lacklustre
        investment return on the foreign exposure in the portfolios and net outflows from
        the South African life and discretionary capital asset base managed by the
        cluster. The restructuring of the Sanlam UK business during 2016 is delivering
        cost efficiency, supporting a 38% increase in the international operations’ net
        earnings in constant currency. Capital management earnings declined marginally
        from a high comparative base in 2016.

    o   Santam’s net underwriting margin for the four-month period was within the target
        range of 4% to 8%, but below the midpoint. The personal and commercial
        business was impacted by fire related losses and an increase in the frequency of
        claims. The Specialist business was in turn impacted by a number of large
        corporate property claims. Other specialist insurance classes, in particular
        Agriculture, reported solid results. MiWay also reported excellent underwriting
        results, with Santam Re achieving an acceptable performance.

    o   Sanlam Employee Benefits and Sanlam Healthcare achieved strong growth in
        net result from financial services, supporting overall growth of more than 30% for
        the Sanlam Corporate Cluster. Risk claims experience at Sanlam Employee
        Benefits remained higher than historic levels, but improved on 2016.

-   Normalised headline earnings per share increased by 9% compared to the first four
    months of the 2016 financial year. A relatively stronger investment market
    performance in 2017 supported investment return earned on the capital base.

-   Diluted headline earnings per share, which include fund transfers recognised in
    respect of Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, increased by 15%
    compared to the first four months of the 2016 financial year.

Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its Capital Adequacy Requirements under the current solvency regime
5.4 times on 31 March 2017 after allowing for the annual dividend payment to Sanlam
Limited. Under the new Solvency Assessment and Management regime being
implemented in South Africa, Sanlam Life Insurance’s Solvency Capital Requirement
cover ratio amounted to 297% on 31 March 2017 after the dividend payment to Sanlam
Limited.




                                                                                  5|Page
The Group had excess capital of R550 million available for redeployment at the end of
December 2016, after allowing for US$200 million of the US$340 million consideration
for the acquisition of an additional 16.6% stake in Saham Finances, and R700 million
for the acquisition of a 53% stake in BrightRock in South Africa. The Saham Finances
transaction concluded in May 2017 (refer below), while the BrightRock acquisition is still
subject to conditions precedent.

Utilisation of discretionary capital since 31 December 2016 to date included the
following:
     - The Saham Finances transaction concluded with an effective date of 10 May
         2017. The full acquisition price was funded from discretionary capital. Allowing
         for the US$200 million already provided in the opening balance of discretionary
         capital, the transaction effectively utilised additional discretionary capital of
         US$140 million during the period. In line with previous communication, the
         introduction of gearing of up to US$140 million to fund a portion of the
         transaction value is currently under consideration.

    -   The only new acquisition in the first four months of 2017, was a 75% stake in the
        PineBridge asset management operations in Kenya. This investment will enable
        the Group to establish a regional asset manager of scale. The transaction is still
        subject to conditions precedent.

The following added to available discretionary capital:
   -    As indicated in the Group’s 2016 annual results announcement in March 2017,
        the capital allocated to the covered business operations on the Sanlam Life
        licence will be reduced to R8 billion over the next four years. R783 million was
        released during the first four months of 2017, comprising of the first R500 million
        base capital release as well as net investment return of R283 million earned on
        the portfolio up to the end of April 2017 that is not required to be reinvested. The
        portfolio is effectively rebalanced to R9.5 billion compared to R10 billion as at 31
        December 2016. The investment return component is subject to investment
        market returns up to the end of June, when the actual rebalancing of the
        portfolio occurs.

    -   The establishment of the Central Credit Manager included the transfer of
        corporate credit exposure from the Sanlam Capital Markets balance sheet to
        Sanlam Life Insurance Limited. These transfers resulted in a R350 million
        reduction in Sanlam Capital Markets’ capital requirement from R600 million to
        R250 million.

    -   The excess cash cover included in the 2017 dividend declaration and
        investment return earned on the discretionary capital portfolio of some R800
        million in total.

Once the envisaged gearing is introduced for the Saham Finances transaction,
available discretionary capital will amount to some R2 billion post payment of the
BrightRock and PineBridge transactions. This is considered sufficient for the Group’s
immediate needs and the Group will continue to look for value-enhancing growth
opportunities.



                                                                                   6|Page
Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the
remainder of 2017 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key operational performance
indicators. Persistent investor risk aversion, average investment market levels, the
relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and the level of long-term interest rates are
key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net result from financial services,
normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for the first half of
the 2017 financial year. The Group is, however, well-positioned to weather the current
headwinds and to continue delivering value for our shareholders and other

CREDIT RATING ACTION BY STANDARD & POOR’S

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Standard and
Poor’s (S&P) has on 7 April 2017 downgraded the ratings of a number of South Africa-based Insurers and
Reinsurers following similar action on the South African Sovereign, which was downgraded on 3 April 2017.

On 3 April 2017, S&P lowered its foreign currency sovereign ratings on the Republic of South Africa to
‘BB+/B’ from ‘BBB-/A-3’ and its local currency sovereign ratings to ‘BBB-/A-3’ from ‘BBB/A-2’. As a result,
Sanlam Life’s South Africa national scale rating was reduced from ‘zaAAA’ to ‘zaAA-‘, and the ratings of the
SLI3 and SLI4 subordinated deferrable debt issued by Sanlam Life from ‘zaAA-‘ to ‘zaA’. The lower ratings
reflect S&P’s view that South African insurers face increased exposure to credit risk within asset portfolios
following the sovereign downgrade, with the increased risk somewhat mitigated by sound balance sheet
resilience. S&P also noted that they believe that the South African insurers would withstand the stress
associated with a foreign currency sovereign default, if one was to occur.

Sanlam Life’s solvency position remains sound, as reflected in a Capital Adequacy Requirement (“CAR”)
cover ratio of 5.8 times at 31 December 2016. Sanlam Life’s solvency cover ratio under the new Solvency
Assessment and Management (“SAM”) regime currently being implemented in South Africa was also a
particularly strong 3.1 times at 31 December 2016. The S&P rating actions on the Republic of South Africa
and Sanlam Life are not expected to have a significant impact on Sanlam Life’s or the Sanlam Limited
Group’s solvency position under the current and future SAM solvency regimes due to the well-diversified
nature of the balance sheets. It is therefore also anticipated that the capital allocation to the Sanlam
operations, including Sanlam Life, and the level of available discretionary capital will remain unaffected by
the rating actions. Sanlam remains well capitalised, with a solid strategy and a track record of delivering
value to our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders despite challenging operating conditions,
supported by a well-established and mature risk management process.

A sovereign ratings downgrade has been anticipated for some time, with the Sanlam Life balance sheet
being well-protected by its approach to closely match the asset and liability profiles of interest-rate sensitive
policyholder portfolios, as well as the move towards a de-risked asset allocation strategy initiated for the
shareholders’ capital portfolio at the end of 2015. Stress testing is conducted on a regular basis as part of
Sanlam Life’s risk management and capital modeling processes to ensure that its capital and liquidity
positions remain robust subsequent to a stress event such as a sovereign ratings downgrade. Further risk
management actions will be considered proactively as part of this process in response to anticipated
developments in the operating environment.

Further details regarding the rating action is available on S&P’s website or in its press release entitled
“Various Rating Actions Taken on South Africa-Based Insurers and Reinsurers Following Sovereign
Downgrade”.

Sanlam Limited – Changes to the Executive Committee

In terms of paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders
are advised of the following changes within Sanlam Limited’s (“Sanlam”) Executive
Management.

   1. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Sanlam Personal Finance (“SPF”), Mr
      Hubert Brody, will step down on 31 May 2017 to attend more closely to his other
      interests.
   2. Mr Jurie Strydom, currently the joint Deputy CEO of SPF, has been appointed the
      CEO of SPF and will take over on 01 June 2017.
   3. With effect from 01 April 2017, Mr Temba Mvusi, the Chief Executive (“CE”) of
      Group Market Development, has been appointed as acting CEO of the Sanlam
      Corporate cluster which was established at the beginning of 2016.

Mr Brody, who originally joined Sanlam as CE of Group Strategy and Projects, was
appointed as CEO of SPF in June 2015 and has overseen the successful restructuring of
the SPF business to significantly enhance its client focus and operating structures.

Mr Strydom obtained his Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is a qualified actuary. A Sanlam bursary
holder, he started his career at Sanlam as an actuarial student. Prior to re-joining Sanlam
in January 2016, Mr Strydom was CEO of Regent Insurance and an Executive Director of
Imperial Holdings. More recently, he was responsible for Distribution, Glacier and Sanlam
Sky within the SPF cluster.

Mr Mvusi, an Executive at both Sanlam and Santam Limited (“Santam”), will hold the
position of acting CEO for the Sanlam Corporate cluster until a permanent appointment is
made during 2017. Among his qualifications, Mr Mvusi holds a Diploma in International
Relations from the University of New Delhi and an Executive Leadership Programme from
the Wharton School of Business. Mr Mvusi will retain his current responsibilities at Sanlam
and Santam.

The Sanlam CEO, Mr Ian Kirk, acknowledged Mr Brody’s contribution to Sanlam. “Hubert
has added very significant value in his time at Sanlam, not only as CEO of SPF but also in
his initial role as CE of Group Strategy and Projects. He led the restructure of the SPF
business and has laid a solid platform from which SPF will continue to thrive in future. We
are immensely grateful for his wisdom, vision and values-based leadership, which he
brought to Sanlam. We wish him well and respect his decision to focus on his various
other interests.”

Commenting on the appointments of Mr Strydom and Mr Mvusi, Mr Kirk said:

“I wish to congratulate Jurie on his appointment and I am pleased to welcome him to the
Group Exco. We look forward to his role in taking the SPF cluster forward.”

“Temba knows the corporate space very well given his Market Development and prior
Sanlam Investments roles. I am confident that he will play a pivotal role in taking the
corporate cluster strategy forward and driving the Health and Sanlam Employee Benefits
businesses.”

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

The Group achieved satisfactory results in the 2016 financial year, delivering double-digit growth in all key operating indicators despite a challenging environment.

Global markets were impacted by various domestic and international events during 2016. These included fears of lower than expected global economic growth driven by a
slowdown in China and the soft commodity cycle, rising geopolitical risks and the impact of potentially opposing monetary policy stances by central banks in the United
States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Europe and Japan. The fragile outlook for global economic growth was dealt a further blow at the end of the second quarter by the UK
electorate's surprise vote in favour of Britain leaving the European Union, signifying rising pressure in a number of countries for more protectionist policies.
Protectionism also featured strongly in the US presidential elections.

These conditions increased the pressure on the economic growth, currencies and investment market performance of the emerging market countries where the Group operates,
with commodity-based economies such as Zambia, Nigeria and Angola particularly hard hit. The British pound was similarly under pressure. The exceptions were the rand
exchange rate and returns on the bond market in South Africa. The changes in Finance Ministers in December 2015 sparked a sharp weakening in the rand and a significant
rise in long-term interest rates at the end of 2015. The positive developments of cooperation between government, labour and business since then and South Africa's
ability to retain its investment grade foreign credit rating, supported a rally in the rand exchange rate and a 15% return from the South African All-bond index as
long-term interest rates declined by some 100 basis points (bps). The rand strengthened by 12% and 26% against the US dollar and British pound respectively, with the pound
weakening on a relative basis in the aftermath of Brexit. The rand also strengthened against the emerging market currencies where the Group operates.

The Group's 2016 performance under these conditions is testimony to a well-executed sustainable strategy. The five-pillar strategy introduced in 2003 transformed the
Group into a business diversified across business lines, geographies, market segments and products, with an exceptionally strong capital base. We remain focussed on:

- Improving performance through top-line earnings growth by increasing market share in key segments and diversifying the base (including diversification of geographical
  presence, products, market segments and distribution platforms).
- Optimising operational efficiencies.
- Enhancing capital utilisation on an ongoing basis, including the allocation of capital to business units in a manner that will best achieve stated RoGEV targets.
- Prioritising diversification by enhancing the Group's international positioning and growing the relative importance and contribution of the international business to
  the Group, with a specific Pan-African focus.
- Commitment to the promotion of transformation and diversity within operations and broadly through the contribution to socio-economic development in the countries and
  markets in which the Group operates, whether that be directly, or via collaboration with business partners.

The Group's strategy is by no means unique with many other multi-national insurance and financial services groups following a similar approach. Sanlam's ability to
consistently execute on the strategy has, however, been a key differentiator, enabled by: 

- A single-minded focus on execution across the Group operations. The strategy is well-communicated and understood, supported by incentives that reward performance
  aligned with the five strategic pillars.
- A client-centric approach that equitably balances value creation between Sanlam clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.
- A corporate culture embedded in ethics and prudence. Sanlam's prudent approach is unique, which often means forsaking short-term gains in support of long-term
  sustainable growth.
- Sanlam's ability to attract and retain the best skills available. The Group is fortunate to have a multi-level management team with some of the best financial 
  services expertise and experience available in the market.

The Group has made good progress in the implementation of the elements of the five-pillar strategy. Below is a brief overview of the main achievements in 2016.

Earnings growth

Net result from financial services increased by 10% from R7,3 billion in 2015 to R8 billion in 2016, a particularly satisfactory performance. All businesses
contributed to the growth, apart from Santam where underwriting margins normalised after an exceptional performance in 2015. New business volumes increased by 11%,
with Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM) outperforming targets for the year and the other clusters coming in only slightly below stretched targets, a commendable performance
under difficult operating conditions. The 18% increase in value of new business (VNB) (10% on a consistent economic basis) is ascribed to growth in new life business as well 
as an improvement in the business mix. The new business performance contributed to net fund inflows of R41 billion in 2016 (2015: R19 billion), with net inflows across all 
clusters during the year increasing their future earnings bases.

Operating and cost efficiencies

The restructuring of several business units during 2016, including Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF), Sanlam UK and Sanlam Investments' (SI) South African investment
management business, and the establishment of the new Sanlam Corporate cluster, were based on client-centric alignment, while offering the opportunity to optimise
efficiency in an environment of rapidly rising regulatory compliance costs and continued pressure on fee levels. This includes the elimination of product duplication
and unnecessary statutory costs and creating the ability to roll out regulatory changes in a consistent manner at the lowest possible cost.  It also reduces relative
levels of overhead costs, except where new ventures and innovation requirements are prioritised.

Sanlam has a solid track record of delivering on operational efficiencies. This is evident in our ability to largely maintain new business margins on a per product
level despite cost and fee pressures. We again managed to achieve this in 2016. Growth in administration cost was limited to an inflationary increase despite
additional restructuring expenses incurred during 2016.

Optimal capital utilisation

Capital management is a tight standard managed from the Group Office. To enhance Return on Group Equity Value (RoGEV), Group businesses are allocated an optimal level of 
capital and are measured against appropriate return hurdles. Further opportunities to optimise the capital base are continuously investigated as the Group and the operating 
environment develop, including more sophisticated balance sheet management, strategic asset allocation and the most appropriate capital structure. The new solvency regime 
being introduced in South Africa through the Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) regulations enables the Group to further optimise balance sheet and capital management.
Progress includes the following: 

- The enhancement of the Group's projection capability within a SAM environment received significant attention. The modelling results, combined with the more
  conservative investment strategy introduced at the end of 2015 for the capital supporting the South African life operations, indicates that the Group should be able
  to release further discretionary capital over the next few years (refer Capital management section below).
- Balance sheet management also received particular attention. The diversified nature of the South African life operations will enable the Group to expand its exposure
  to credit assets in this business in a capital efficient manner, thereby enhancing future profitability and RoGEV. The relevant mandates have been adjusted to
  facilitate a higher asset allocation to credit assets in the appropriate products. This was one of the drivers for the establishment of the Central Credit Management
  function in Sanlam Capital Markets (SCM).
- The introduction of SAM also enables the Group to more effectively manage future profit margins embedded in certain policyholder liabilities with a dual benefit of
  enhancing RoGEV, while decreasing Group Equity Value (GEV) volatility. The necessary Sanlam board of directors approvals were obtained with implementation scheduled for 
  appropriate times from 2017.

Santam declared a special interim dividend of R8 per share, after taking current and future solvency requirements into account. Sanlam's share of the special dividend
enhanced available discretionary capital at a Group level by some R540 million.

Diversification

The Saham Finances transaction, which became effective in February 2016, expanded the Group's footprint to more than 30 markets in Africa. Sanlam also acquired 23%
direct stakes in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General Insurance whereas Santam made a few small acquisitions in the local market. SPF announced the acquisition
of a 53% stake in BrightRock Holdings, a provider of innovative adaptable needs-based risk solutions, in January 2017.

These initiatives further enhanced the Group's profile. The transformation of the Group from a diversification perspective over the past 14 years has been significant.
From being largely a South African life insurance company, the Group's geographic and line of business exposure has become much more balanced.

Transformation

Ongoing transformation is driven at both a Group and individual business unit level. Transformation includes the Group's diversification efforts, but also aims to
align the Group's demographic profile to the territories in which it operates, and contributes towards black economic empowerment in South Africa.

Sanlam's talent management strategy takes into account global and local talent management practices, and guides the Group in how to attract, recruit, develop and
retain its people to strengthen Sanlam's pool of intellectual capital.

In South Africa, the Group tracks demographic developments and shifts to transform its employee profile and distribution presence. This includes, for example, the
increasing importance of Gauteng as a key metropolitan area due to urbanisation. SPF has made good progress in penetrating new areas and market segments through
employee and distribution transformation.

The restructuring initiatives in different clusters provided an opportunity to improve employment equity profiles to meet the Group targets for black recruitment. Good
progress was made in senior and middle management appointments. Succession plans also show encouraging signs of increasing the number of black people in key roles.

Sanlam and Santam have both been certified as Top Employers in 2017.

COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS
Introduction

The Sanlam Group International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 are presented based on and in compliance
with IFRS. The basis of presentation and accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and shareholders' information are in all material respects consistent
with those applied in the 2015 Annual Report. For segmental reporting, the newly created Sanlam Corporate cluster is shown separately for the first time, initially
comprising of Sanlam Employee Benefits (SEB) and the Sanlam Healthcare businesses.

Group Equity Value

GEV amounted to R110,7 billion or 5 407 cents per share at 31 December 2016. Including the dividend of 245 cents per share paid during the year, a RoGEV per share of
11,8% was achieved for 2016. This is lower than the 14,1% target for the year, principally due to negative foreign currency translation differences recognised in
respect of the non-South African operations following the sharp recovery in the rand exchange rate during 2016. The benefits of a lower risk discount rate (RDR) in South Africa at 31
December 2016 compared to end-2015 were substantially offset by the weak equity market performance during 2016. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact of
lower investment return than the long-term assumptions, interest rate changes and other one-off effects not under management control (such as tax changes), and
assuming normalised exchange rate movements, amounted to 17,8% - well in excess of the target.

South African long-term interest rates declined by some 90bps during 2016, with a corresponding 90bps decline in the RDR used to value the Group's South African
businesses for GEV purposes. A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation basis is used for essentially all of the Group's operations, with the decline in RDR having a
positive effect on the end-2016 valuations and RoGEV for 2016. This positive impact was largely negated by a weak equity market performance, which limited growth in
assets under management and hence GEV valuations at SI and SPF. The strengthening of the rand against most currencies during 2016 had a pronounced negative impact of
more than R5 billion on the rand-based valuations of the Group's operations outside of South Africa and Namibia. This resulted in an overall underperformance in RoGEV
compared to target in 2016. Adjusted RoGEV is a more comparable measure of the underlying operational performance, which continues to reflect sound results despite the
challenging operating environment during 2016.

Group operations yielded an overall return of 13,1% in 2016, the combination of 15,8% return on covered business and 10,5% on other Group operations.

The Group's covered business operations (comprising 46% of GEV) achieved a good overall performance, exceeding the Group hurdle rate by a healthy margin despite the
economic and currency headwinds faced in 2016. This was supported by a sterling return from the mature South African covered business operations of SPF, which exceeded
the 14,1% hurdle rate by 7,3% with an overall return of 21,4% (20% on an adjusted basis). A strong VNB performance, positive operating experience variances and
assumptions changes, tax changes and the positive effect of the lower RDR contributed to this performance. The weak investment return earned on the South African
capital portfolio during 2016 suppressed Sanlam Corporate's covered business return to 7,8% given the large relative capital allocation to this business. SEM achieved
a return of only 0,7% due to foreign currency translation losses - adjusted RoGEV of 21,1% was well in excess of its target. The Sanlam UK return on covered business
of -24,7% (adjusted RoGEV of 9,6%) reflects the stronger rand exchange rate, but also operational underperformance emanating from the UK restructuring, lower than
expected new business production and the strengthening of the reserving basis for regulatory changes (refer Earnings section below).

Other Group operations (comprising 46% of GEV) achieved a return of 10,5% (20,4% on an adjusted basis). The valuation and return of the South African businesses were
positively impacted by the lower RDR, partly offset by low growth in assets under management at the SI asset management businesses. Foreign currency translation
differences on the SEM and SI non-South African operations account for most of the difference between actual and adjusted RoGEV. All of the major businesses achieved
good growth in adjusted RoGEV, apart from the following:

- Sanlam Investments' international businesses. The Sanlam UK businesses experienced expense overruns and weak new business growth during the restructuring process,
  which inevitably led to some internal focus. Assets under management at the Dublin platform business and the asset management businesses were impacted by large
  withdrawals from Sanlam FOUR and a repatriation of funds by South African clients (refer Business volumes section below).
- The Shriram Capital credit businesses, where a prudent valuation approach was followed in light of the uncertain impact that de-monetisation will have on the Indian
  economy and credit businesses in general.
- The general insurance operations of Pacific & Orient (P&O). Diversification of the P&O product lines is taking longer than expected, impacting negatively on the
  short-term growth prospects and valuation of the business.
- The Soras general insurance business, where financial irregularities uncovered during the year resulted in an impairment of the GEV valuation.

Central support functions at SEM were also strengthened during the year to more effectively support the expanding footprint. Capitalisation of the increased central
support costs also had a negative impact on the non-life RoGEV returns, as the valuations do not explicitly allow for any potential future benefits arising from these
initiatives.

The Group's investment in Santam is valued at its listed share price, which recorded a strong return of 32% in 2016 compared to a negative performance of 8,4% in 2015.

The low return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:

- Net corporate expenses of R107 million recognised in net result from financial services.
- A relatively low level of return earned on the portfolio's exposure to low yielding liquid assets.
- Hedging of the Saham Finances and Shriram Life and General Insurance transactions. (Refer Capital management section below.) The transactions were hedged through the
  acquisition of foreign currency, which earns a very low rate of interest due to the US Dollar denomination. The application of hedge accounting principles in the GEV
  presentation furthermore eliminated the foreign currency gains, essentially exposing the portfolio to some R5 billion of assets that earned close to zero return - R4
  billion for two months (Saham Finances) and R1 billion for nine months (Shriram options).

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R8 billion increased by 10% on 2015, with sterling contributions from SEM and Sanlam Corporate and solid
performances by the other Group operations. Santam achieved lower operational earnings due to the normalisation in its underwriting margin from an exceptionally high
base in 2015. Structural growth (Saham Finances, the Zimbabwean operations, Afrocentric and the 23% direct stakes acquired in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram
General Insurance) contributed R221 million to net result from financial services. Excluding these, organic growth of 7% represents a satisfactory performance in an
unsupportive environment.

SPF delivered a solid performance for a largely mature business in an environment of stagnant economic growth and a weak equity market performance. Sanlam Individual
Life remains the largest contributor to SPF's operating earnings with growth in its net result from financial services of 6% in 2016.

Profit from investment products declined by 2%, largely attributable to the impact of the weak equity market performance on assets under management, a relatively lower
impact on profit from actuarial basis changes, a decline in asset mismatch profits and an acceleration in deferred acquisition cost amortisation following a rise in
paid up and early retirement policies.

Profit from risk products declined by 53%, the combined effect of increased new business strain and weaker claims experience. The Group follows a prudent profit
recognition approach for insurance contracts in terms of which all upfront acquisition costs are expensed instead of being capitalised and amortised over the duration
of the contracts. The strong growth in new recurring premium risk business in 2016 (refer below) combined with the introduction of the Risk Policy Tax Fund during 2016
contributed to a 45% increase in new business strain. Mortality claims experience deteriorated significantly in the first half of 2016 after exceptionally favourable
experience in 2015. Claims experience improved in the second half of the year, but were still at a lower overall level for the 2016 full-year compared to 2015.

Profit released from the asset mismatch reserve held in respect of non-participating risk business increased by 4% in line with the higher average level of this
reserve during 2016.

Profit from the annuity book almost doubled due to increased risk margin releases in line with the larger size of the book, an increase in asset mismatch profits and
higher spread generated by the newly established Central Credit Manager in SCM. Other life profits increased by 82%, benefiting from higher short-term interest rates
through an 18% rise in working capital profit and lower negative actuarial basis changes in 2016 compared to the 2015 comparable period.

Sanlam Personal Loans profit declined by 4%, attributable to only a marginal increase in the size of the loan book. The implementation of the National Credit Amendment
Act added substantially to the administration process surrounding loan applications and also introduced more strict affordability requirements. This resulted in a
decline in activations, and also a decline in the number of clients qualifying for loans. Focus remained on maintaining the quality of the book. The bad debt ratio
improved to 5,0% as a result, from 5,4% in 2015.

Sanlam Sky's net result from financial services increased by 6%. Growth in the size of the in-force book and positive mortality and persistency experience variances
were somewhat offset by lower investment variances and economic assumption changes.

Glacier grew its profit contribution by 25% after tax. Fund-based fee income benefited from an increase in average assets under management. Stringent expense
management and lower variable costs due to the lower level of growth in new business also supported the results.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by 30%, comprising organic growth of 18% and a 12% contribution from structural growth.

Namibia's net result from financial services declined by 12% (down 7% on a gross basis). Life earnings were suppressed by negative mortality and disability claims
experience, an increase in new business strain following strong growth in entry-level market risk business and lower annuity mismatch profits. Santam Namibia also
experienced a normalisation in underwriting margins, similar to Santam's South African operations. Bank Windhoek performed well and achieved double-digit profit
growth.

The Botswana operations achieved mixed results with overall growth of only 1% in net result from financial services. Life insurance profit declined marginally due to
lower annuity new business volumes and asset mismatch losses recognised following adverse movements in the yield curve. Letshego, the second largest profit
contributor, experienced flat earnings compared to 2015. Increased competition from banks in Botswana limited growth in the loan book while foreign currency
translation losses also dampened earnings growth. The asset management business experienced strong growth of 19%, benefiting from an increase in assets under
management after being awarded a large new mandate by the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund (BPOPF).

The Rest of Africa operations, excluding first time contributions of R112 million from Saham Finances and the Zimbabwean operations, achieved growth in net result from
financial services of 45%. All countries delivered strong growth, apart from Malawi and Zambia. The general insurance operations in Malawi experienced pressure on
claims, while Zambia continues to be impacted by a difficult operating environment. The Zimbabwean and Nigerian operations exceeded expectations, while Saham Finances
performed only marginally below the business plan despite pressure on the Nigerian and Angolan operations that are affected by currency liquidity constraints and
pressure on economic growth from lower oil prices.

Net result from financial services in India rose 65%; 19% excluding profit contributed by the 23% direct stakes acquired in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General
Insurance during the year as well as the R103 million equipment finance bad debt provision recognised in 2015 which did not reoccur in 2016. The credit businesses
achieved strong growth pursuant to almost 20% growth in their loan books and an expansion in net interest margins. The general insurance business also contributed good
growth despite higher than expected claims experience on the third party motor book, while the life insurance business incurred an operating loss due to increased new
business strain and continued investment in expanding its distribution footprint.

The Malaysian businesses had a disappointing year, masked by one-off incurred but not reported IBNR releases. Net result from financial services increased by 110%, 
the aggregate of a fivefold growth in general insurance earnings and a lower contribution from the life insurance business. Growth in general insurance business premiums 
remained under pressure, with diversification of the product lines taking longer than anticipated. This was however more than offset by releases of the IBNR reserves 
recognised in 2015 as experience develops. Product innovation is a key focus for the business to regain market share and to expand its product lines. A number of new 
products are planned for launch during 2017. The life insurance business had a difficult year with operating earnings declining by 38%. This is attributable to a number
of one-off items:

- Higher reinsurance premiums payable in respect of Group Life products in terms of renewed treaties.
- Continued medical losses due to the delayed effect of repricing of the product while awaiting regulatory approvals. The approvals have recently been received.
- Strengthening of the reserving basis in a number of areas.

SI achieved overall growth of 4% in its net result from financial services, with an exceptional performance from Capital Management largely offset by a lower profit
contribution from the investment management businesses.

Investment Management net result from financial services declined by 10% on 2015, predominantly caused by lower performance fees in the South African Asset Management
business.

The ability of the South African Asset Management business to grow assets under management and fee income in 2016 was hampered by a number of factors:

- The weak South African equity market performance in 2015 and 2016 impacted adversely on growth in assets under management with flat average market levels. Strong
  returns from the bond market could only compensate partially due to the lower fee base of the fixed interest asset class.
- Continued net outflows from the South African life book. The legacy life book managed by SI is running off while SPF's open architecture approach results in only a
  portion, albeit increasing, of its new business being managed by SI.
- The redeployment of discretionary capital during the year further reduced the SI asset base.
- Net performance fees declined by 41% from R214 million in 2015 to R127 million in 2016. Performance fees on the SPF and SEB portfolios are measured over a rolling 3-
  year period. The 2015 base still included the 2013 calendar year, which was a particularly strong year of outperformance. Its exclusion from the 2016 calculation muted
  growth in performance fees in 2016.

The impact of the weak equity markets on assets under management and related fee income was even more pronounced at the Wealth Management business given the larger
exposure to equities in its underlying portfolios.

These businesses have done well to limit the decline in their operational earnings to only 4% under these conditions. This was achieved through diligent cost
management and success in attracting higher margin retail flows (refer below).

The International business had a disappointing year, with net result from financial services declining by 38% on 2015. The weakening of the rand during 2015 caused
breaches in a number of South African funds' foreign investment allowance, requiring a repatriation of assets from the international portfolios. This had a negative
impact on administration and asset management fee income. Sanlam FOUR also experienced large outflows from its UK equity portfolio (refer below), further suppressing
fee income growth. Sanlam UK earnings also came under pressure from one-off restructuring costs incurred in realigning the business for future growth and strengthening
of the reserving basis in the UK life operations following the introduction of regulatory caps on exit fees. The latter required an increase in policy liabilities of
some R70 million, part of which is expected to emerge as positive experience in the future depending on persistency experience.

Capital Management achieved 89% growth in its net result from financial services. Credit spreads on Eurobonds narrowed during 2016 while commodity stock share prices
linked to equity-backed financing structures rose sharply. This contributed to a reversal of the marked-to-market losses incurred on these instruments during the 2015
financial year, when credit spreads widened and share prices were under severe pressure.

The underwriting margin at Santam normalised during 2016 to 6,4% from an exceptionally high base of 9,6% in 2015. The 2016 performance is in the middle of the target
range of 4% to 8%, representing a solid performance. The benign claims environment of 2015 reversed with higher claims experienced across most lines of business. The
crop and property business lines were severely affected by drought-related and large corporate claims respectively. Net premium growth was also less than planned for
2016 in a competitive environment for especially niche and specialist classes. Net result from financial services declined by 13% as a result.

The 36% growth in Sanlam Corporate's net result from financial services includes a first-time contribution of R82 million by Afrocentric (14% growth excluding
Afrocentric). SEB's net result from financial services increased by 18%. SEB Investments benefited from asset mismatch profits, good mortality (annuity longevity)
experience and lower new business strain, supporting a doubling in Investment and other earnings. Higher short-term interest rates increased interest earned on working
capital by 33%. The retirement fund administration business on boarded a large new client, which increased administration fee income in 2016 and contributed to a
pleasing decline in the business's operating loss from R18 million in 2015 to R5 million in 2016, which was offset by one-off system development costs. The adverse
disability claims experience in the first half of 2016 improved in the second half of the year, but with this improvement partly offset by a few large mortality claims
in December 2016. Group risk profits accordingly remained under pressure and declined by 38% compared to 2015.

Normalised headline earnings of R8,4 billion are 6% down on 2015. This is the combined effect of the 10% increase in net result from financial services, a 65% decline
in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio and an 22% decline in amortisation of intangible assets and equity participation costs. Net investment return
was adversely affected by the following:

- The impact of the stronger rand on investment return earned on the international exposure in the South African portfolio;
- Weaker equity market returns in the major SEM geographies; and
- The additional deferred tax expense of R192 million recognised following the increase in the effective capital gains tax (CGT) rate from 19% to 22% during the first half of 2016.

Business volumes

The Group achieved overall growth of 11% in new business volumes, a credible performance. Excluding first-time contributions from structural growth, new business
volumes increased by 9%. Life insurance new business volumes increased by 9%, investment business inflows by 10% and general insurance earned premiums by 18% (7%
excluding structural growth). Structural growth did not contribute significantly to life insurance and investment new business.

SPF's new business sales grew by 1%, with lower discretionary single premium volumes concealing a strong recurring premium performance.

Sanlam Sky new business increased by 1%. Major progress was made in improving the mix of business between risk and savings solutions after disproportionate sales of
tax free savings products in 2015. The design of the savings solution was also amended during 2016 as much weaker than expected persistency experience rendered the
original product launched in 2015 unprofitable. Individual life recurring premium new business declined marginally due to the management actions implemented to improve
the mix of business. Individual life risk business sales increased by a healthy 13%, offset by a 43% decline in savings business. The change in mix had a significant
positive impact on VNB (refer below). Group recurring premium sales were supported by a few large new schemes written by Safrican during 2016 and increased by 17%,
excluding the impact of the biennial renewal of the ZCC scheme that occurred in 2015. Including the ZCC, group recurring premium business increased by 8%.

New business volumes in the Individual Life segment, which is largely focused on the middle income segment in South Africa, increased by 1%. Single premium sales
declined by 1%, the combined effect of some pressure on disposable income and increased investor risk aversion in the uncertain political and investment market
environment. Guaranteed plan business did well under these conditions and increased by 9%, but was more than offset by lower sales of the other major product lines.
New recurring premium sales grew by a strong 13%, with all lines of business contributing to the growth apart from credit life that reflects the low level of growth in
the Sanlam Personal Loans book. Growth in sales of the more profitable risk business remained particularly strong at 20% following recent product innovation and
improvements and enhanced distribution focus. VNB benefited as a result (refer below), but new business strain recognised in operating earnings increased
commensurately as highlighted above.

Glacier was also severely impacted by the heightened investor risk aversion, contributing to a 12% decline in discretionary non-life new business sales (excluding wrap
funds). Demand for life licence and wrap solutions were more resilient with new business volumes increasing by 11% and 7% respectively. Within the life insurance
sales, demand for both offshore and local funds persisted.

The slowdown in single premium business had a negative impact on SPF's net fund inflows, which declined from R22 billion in 2015 to R16 billion in 2016.

SEM new business volumes grew by 63% (47% excluding structural growth). New life business increased by 7% (4% excluding structural growth), investment business inflows
by 80% and general insurance earned premiums by 140% (10% excluding structural growth).

New business volumes in Namibia increased by 4%, the combined result of 16% and 1% growth in new life and investment business respectively. Entry-level market life
business sales performed particularly well, supporting growth in the Namibian VNB (refer below). The low growth in investment business is attributable to only marginal
growth in both collective investment scheme inflows and Glacier Namibia new business.

The Botswana operations almost doubled their new business contribution. This is largely attributable to a R4,6 billion asset management mandate received from the
BPOPF, a welcome development after the large withdrawals by the BPOPF in 2015. Annuity sales declined from a high base in 2015, contributing to an overall 19% decline
in life insurance new business.

Rest of Africa new business volumes grew by 149%, supported by the first-time inclusion of Saham Finances and Zimbabwe. Excluding structural growth, new business
volumes increased by 51%. All countries in the region contributed to the growth, apart from Zambia and Malawi. In Zambia, the operating environment remains under
pressure from low copper prices, presenting headwinds to growth in new business volumes. In Malawi, general insurance premiums were under pressure, more than
offsetting good growth in life business. The Kenyan business achieved good growth in single premium life and general insurance business, augmented by a threefold rise
in new investment management mandates. Individual life recurring premium life sales, however, remained under pressure following a change in the agency remuneration
model and declined by 17%. Particularly pleasing is the performance of the Nigerian business, which grew its new business contribution by 52% to R407 million despite a
sluggish economy and a significantly weaker currency. This illustrates the benefits of low insurance penetration in Africa that enables the Group to maintain good
growth despite a weaker economic environment.

Strong growth in Indian new business persisted, with overall growth of 55% in 2016 (21% excluding structural growth). New life and general insurance business sales
increased by 86% (49% excluding structural growth) and 44% (10% excluding structural growth) respectively. The life business continued to benefit from the investments
made in growing its distribution footprint. Organic growth in general insurance was less than expected due to slow progress in expanding the product mix to include new
and more profitable lines of business.

New business volumes in Malaysia were in line with the 2015 financial year. The life business had a good sales year, experiencing growth of 22%. Pacific & Orient,
however, disappointed with a 17% decline in net earned premiums. Progress with diversifying the lines of business was slower than anticipated, aggravated by some
market share losses in its traditional two-wheeler line of business. Management focus in 2017 will be on accelerated diversification and effectively responding to the
de-tariffing of the general insurance industry in Malaysia.

Net fund flows staged a recovery from net outflows of R7 billion in 2015 to R11 billion of net inflows in 2016. This is the combination of strong new business growth
in 2016 and the large withdrawals by the BPOPF included in the 2015 comparative base.

SI's new business growth of 8% represents a satisfactory performance given the difficult operating environment during 2016. Retail and institutional clients in South
Africa took a cautious stance given political and investment market instability. The SA Investment Management business struggled to win new third party mandates under
these conditions as especially pension fund trustees refrained from changing mandates and asset managers. The implemented consulting product offering, however,
continued to gain traction, contributing to good growth in primary retail inflows as well as an increase in the proportion of funds invested in SI products. This
supported satisfactory growth of 8% in new inflows at the SA Investment Management business. The Wealth Management business did particularly well to grow by 11%
despite the heightened investor risk aversion. The international businesses achieved new business growth of only 5% as management focus was partly on the
restructuring.

Net fund inflows improved from a R3 billion net outflow in 2015 to a net inflow of R5 billion in 2016. The turnaround is largely attributable to the R14 billion
withdrawals by the BPOPF and the Public Investment Corporation included in the 2015 results. The International businesses experienced net outflows of some R5 billion
in 2016, largely from Sanlam FOUR's UK equity portfolio which underperformed in the aftermath of the Brexit vote due to its exposure to UK small caps.

The majority of Santam's premiums are still written in the highly competitive South African market, where the niche classes were in particular under pressure. Gross
written premiums and net earned premiums grew by 7%, reflecting the maturity of the South African market, competitive pressures and the current low-growth economic
environment. MiWay, Santam's direct insurance business, continues to achieve strong growth and increased its premium base by 19%.

Sanlam Corporate achieved growth of 73% in new business volumes, with net fund flows commensurately improving from a R489 million net outflow in 2015 to net inflows of
R1,4 billion in 2016. Linked and smoothed bonus investment business did well, but the more profitable recurring premium risk business declined by 23% as competitive
market pressures to retain existing business persisted.

Overall net fund inflows of R41 billion in 2016 is a satisfactory performance given the challenging market conditions.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 90bps and 100bps decline in the South African 9- and 5-year benchmark rates
respectively during 2016 resulted in a commensurate decline in the risk discount rate with a positive impact on VNB growth and margins. In general, VNB margins were
maintained on a per product basis. Changes in business mix at SPF had a significant positive impact on the Group's VNB performance in 2016, augmented by strong organic
growth at SEM. Net VNB at actual discount rates increased by 18%. On a comparable basis (before economic assumption changes) net VNB increased by a pleasing 10%.

SPF achieved overall growth of 11% on a comparable basis. The change in business mix in Sanlam Sky, together with an improvement in the profitability of the savings
product, contributed to a 27% increase in its VNB contribution and an increase in VNB margin from 5,86% in 2015 to 6,8% in 2016. The good growth in new risk business
in Individual Life similarly supported VNB, with this segment's contribution increasing by 9% on a comparable basis despite only marginal overall growth in new
business sales. Individual Life VNB margins improved from 2,59% to 2,70%. Glacier's VNB growth was in line with its new business performance.

Net VNB at SEM grew by 19% on a comparable basis, with strong growth in Namibia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, India and Malaysia in line with these regions' new life
business performance. Saham Finances made a first-time contribution of R16 million. Malawi reported lower VNB compared to 2015 due to an adverse change in business
mix. Kenya disappointed with a negative VNB contribution of R7 million as lower individual life recurring premium business resulted in an increase in maintenance unit
costs. Management focus remains on improving the new business performance.

SI's VNB declined by 73%, principally due to a 15% decline in life insurance new business in the UK and an increase in the cost of capital allowance.

Sanlam Corporate VNB declined by 5% on a comparable basis, due to the change in mix towards less profitable savings business.

Capital management

Solvency Assessment and Management

The South African insurance industry performed parallel solvency reporting during 2016 to prepare for the implementation of the new Solvency Assessment and Management
(SAM) regime in 2017. The SAM regime is anticipated to replace the current Financial Soundness Valuation (FSV) solvency regime in the second half of 2017. As
highlighted in previous communication, SAM is a risk-based solvency regime founded on the European Solvency II principles, but adapted for South African circumstances.

The initial focus of Sanlam's SAM programme was to prepare the Group and the South African insurance subsidiaries for SAM compliance. In a second phase, the strategic
asset allocation of the balanced portfolio supporting Sanlam Life's covered business was amended during the 2015 financial year to optimise the capital base from a
RoGEV perspective in line with the pending SAM environment. SAM is significantly more punitive in respect of unhedged equity exposures than FSV and accordingly require
a more conservative asset allocation. Implementation of the revised strategic asset allocation (illustrated in the table below) concluded in the first half of 2016.

For Sanlam Life, the Group's target under the FSV basis was to ensure that its CAR cover would be at least 1,5 times over a 10-year period, within a 95% confidence
level. At the end of 2015 this translated into IFRS-based required capital of some R14,5 billion for Sanlam Life's life insurance business, which was covered as
follows:

- R2,5 billion by Santam shares;
- R2 billion by the subordinated debt issued by Sanlam Life; and
- R10 billion by the balanced portfolio.

A prudent approach was followed in determining required capital at the end of 2015 as further modelling capability and certainty on the final SAM standard formula were
required to confirm the level of required capital under SAM.

The third phase of the SAM programme involved expansion of the Group's capital management projection capability, specifically adapted for SAM. Good progress has been
made during 2016 in this regard, which enabled the Group to set an appropriate level of IFRS required capital for Sanlam Life's covered business under SAM, based on
the following principles:

- A SAM solvency capital requirement (SCR) cover range of between 1,7 times and 2,1 times is targeted over a 10-year projection period.
- Investment return earned on the balanced portfolio is excluded from the projections. Actual investment return earned will therefore be available for release to
  discretionary capital on an annual basis under normal circumstances. In severe scenarios that result in a breach of the lower threshold, investment return can be
  retained in the portfolio to restore the SCR cover to the lower end of the range. This allows for increased capital management flexibility.
- Transfers to discretionary capital will occur when the upper limit of the target range is breached over the full 10-year projection period.

The IFRS required capital for Sanlam Life's covered business has been set at R12 billion at 31 December 2016, covered by the R2 billion subordinated debt and R10
billion in the balanced portfolio.

On this basis, the SAM cover ratio for Sanlam Life's covered business amounted to 2,2 times on 31 December 2016. Including Sanlam Life's investments in Group
businesses, the discretionary capital held on its balance sheet as well as the cash held for the anticipated dividend payment to Sanlam Limited in 2017, the SCR cover
for the Sanlam Life legal entity (solo) amounted to 3,1 times on 31 December 2016. The solo solvency ratio will be reported to the regulator once SAM is effective and
will also be relevant for clients, market participants and credit rating agencies in evaluating Sanlam Life's credit risk.

SAM also requires the calculation of a Group solvency position, which is likely to become the more relevant solvency measure over time. The Sanlam Group had a healthy
SCR cover of 2,2 times at 31 December 2016. The principle reason for the lower Group SCR cover compared to Sanlam Life, is the inclusion of Santam in the Group
position. General insurance business can be conducted at lower cover ratios than life business given its different risk profile. Santam's well diversified book further
reduces its capital requirement and hence SCR cover ratio. At a Group level a prudent approach was also followed by not including the Santam surplus capital, thereby
effectively including it at a 1 times cover ratio.

Sanlam Life's capital requirement is expected to reduce over the next few years as the more capital intensive legacy business continue to decline as a proportion of
the overall life book, settling at around R8 billion. The capital modelling conducted during 2016 indicate that, together with expected investment return to be earned
on the balanced portfolio, between R500 million and R1 billion can be released per annum over the next four years to augment the discretionary capital available for
deployment. Focus will also be placed in 2017 on opportunities to further optimise the capital position of the other South African life insurance licences.

The fourth phase of the SAM programme was also launched during 2016, focussing on optimising balance sheet management. The introduction of the Central Credit
Management function in SCM is the first initiative flowing from this work.

Discretionary capital

The Group started the year with discretionary capital of R2,3 billion, which was earmarked for new growth and expansion opportunities as well as to increase stakes in
existing operations on a selective basis. This balance excluded the capital allocated for the Saham Finances transaction announced in 2015 and the acquisition of 23%
direct stakes in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General Insurance. These transactions were concluded and payment made during 2016.

A net total of R3,4 billion was redeployed in 2016 in respect of new transactions, which included the following:

- An additional investment in Saham Finances was announced in December 2016. In terms of this second transaction, the Group will acquire a further 16,6% stake for some
  R4,6 billion. At least R2,7 billion will be funded from discretionary capital and has been formally allocated as such from the available discretionary capital, with
  the remainder to be funded through the raising of debt. The acquisition price is payable in US Dollars, which the Group hedged in the latter part of 2016 and
  beginning of 2017.
- In January 2017 SPF announced the acquisition of a 53% stake in BrightRock for some R700 million. BrightRock is an innovative provider of unique needs-based life
  insurance cover in South Africa that adapts in line with changing client needs. The BrightRock products will augment SPF's existing risk product offering and is
  expected to enhance SPF's market share of this profitable line of business.
- SI concluded a number of smaller transactions, including:
  - A R150 million investment in Brackenham, a private client wealth management business.
  - An effective 49% shareholding in FirstGlobal Asset Management, a South African asset management company which also renders intermediary services in relation to
    participatory interests in collective investment schemes. The total acquisition consideration was R56 million.
  - The acquisition of the non-controlling shareholders' interest in Blue Ink for R39 million.
  - R18 million for investment in its international asset managers, to set up an African wealth management business and for trail payments for the acquisition of the
    Vukile property management agreement.
- Some R140 million was invested by SEM to bolster the capital position of its Rwanda operations and to expand its bancassurance arrangement with Standard Chartered Bank
  to general insurance business.
- The disposal of SPF's interest in Anglo African Finance and Santam's contribution to SEM general insurance transactions during 2016 (including Shriram General
  Insurance) generated some R360 million of discretionary capital.

The discretionary capital portfolio was augmented by the following inflows:

- Sanlam's share of the Santam special dividend payment in 2016 amounted to R542 million.
- The investment return of R182 million earned on the Sanlam Life balanced portfolio was released to discretionary capital as the balance required in the portfolio
  remained unchanged at R10 billion.
- Some illiquid investments were disposed of, generating some R150 million.
- The 2015 dividend cover in excess of cash operating earnings and other smaller items added some R800 million.

Together with investment return earned on the discretionary capital portfolio, unallocated discretionary capital amounted to R550 million at the end of December 2016.
Further discretionary capital is expected to be generated in 2017 through a release from the Sanlam Life balanced portfolio (refer above) as well as the 2016 excess
dividend cover of some R700 million. Discretionary capital remains earmarked to be utilised for value-accretive investment opportunities.


Solvency

All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of December 2016. The total admissible regulatory capital (including
identified discretionary capital) of Sanlam Life Insurance Limited, the holding company of the Group's major life insurance subsidiaries, of R46,9 billion, covered its
CAR 5,8 times.

The Group's solvency position under the new SAM regime is also healthy, as indicated above.
Standard&Poors issued the following credit ratings to the Group during 2016: Sanlam Limited: South Africa National: zaA; Sanlam Life Insurance Limited: South Africa
National: zaAAA, Subordinated debt: zaAA-.

Dividend

The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large shareholder base. Sustainable growth in dividend
payments is an important consideration for the Board in determining the dividend for the year. The Board uses cash operating earnings as a guideline in setting the
level of the normal dividend, subject to the Group's liquidity and solvency requirements. Dividend cover of cash operating earnings is managed broadly within a 1 to
1,1 times range to target consistent real growth in the Group's normal dividend payment. The operational performance of the Group in the 2016 financial year enabled
the Board to increase the normal dividend per share by 9,4% to 268 cents. This will maintain a cash operating earnings cover of approximately 1,1 times. The South
African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect of this dividend. The dividend will in full be subject to the 20% withholding tax, where applicable, which
will result in a net final dividend, to those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 214,4 cents per ordinary share. The number of ordinary
shares in issue in the company's share capital at the date of the declaration is 2 010 119 548 (excluding treasury shares of 156 352 258). The company's tax reference
number is 9536/346/84/5.

Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 268 cents for the year ended 31 December 2016 is payable on Monday, 10 April 2017 by way of electronic bank
transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 7 April 2017. The last date to trade to qualify for this dividend
will be Tuesday, 4 April 2017, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 5 April 2017.

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 5 April 2017 and Friday, 7 April 2017, both days included.

Summarised financial statements for the  year ended 31 December 2016

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for abridged reports, and the
requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require abridged reports to be prepared in accordance with the
framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, from which the summary consolidated financial
statements were derived, are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial
statements.

The policy liabilities and profit entitlement rules are determined in accordance with prevailing legislation, generally accepted actuarial practice and the
stipulations contained in the demutualisation proposal. There have been no material changes in the financial soundness valuation basis since 31 December 2015, apart
from changes in the economic assumptions.

The basis of presentation and accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and Shareholders' information are in all material respects consistent with those
applied in the 2015 annual report. The only amendment coming into effect in the current year that had an effect on the financial statements was an amendment to IAS1 -
Presentation of Financial Statements, which requires that the equity-accounted other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures to be shown separately on
the face of the statement of comprehensive income. In the past, these other comprehensive income amounts, which for Sanlam relates to foreign currency translation
differences, were included in the total 'movement in foreign currency translation reserve' line item. For segmental reporting, the newly created Sanlam Corporate
cluster is shown separately for the first time, initially comprising of SEB and the Sanlam Healthcare businesses.

The preparation of the Group's audited annual results was supervised by the Financial Director, Heinie Werth CA(SA).

The following new or revised IFRS and interpretations have effective dates applicable to future financial years and have not been early adopted:

- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)

Management is in the process of assessing the classification and measurement of its financial instruments in light of the requirements of IFRS 9. No significant impact
is expected. Initial work performed on the impact of IFRS 15 and 16 indicates that there will be limited impact on the financial statements as a result of these
standards.

EXTERNAL AUDIT

This summarised report is extracted from audited information, but is not itself audited. The annual financial statements were audited by Ernst & Young Inc., who
expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The audited annual financial statements and the auditor's report thereon are available for inspection at the company's
registered office. The shareholders' information was audited by Ernst & Young Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The audited shareholders' information
and the auditor's report thereon are available for inspection at the company's registered office.

The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the summarised report and that the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying
annual financial statements and shareholders' information.

3.  NORMALISED EARNINGS PER SHARE

In terms of IFRS, a consolidation reserve is created for differences in the valuation bases of long-term policy liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities.
Certain investments held in policyholder portfolios may not be recognised at fair value in terms of IFRS, whereas the valuation of the related policy liabilities is
based on the assets at fair value. Similarly, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of assessed tax losses in policyholder funds increases the Group's net assets
without a corresponding increase in policy liabilities. These create mismatches with a corresponding impact on the shareholders' fund. A separate reserve is created
for these valuation differences owing to the fact that they represent accounting differences and not economic gains or losses for the shareholders' fund.  The number
of shares in issue must also be reduced with the treasury shares held by the policyholders' fund for the calculation of IFRS basic and diluted earnings per share.
This is, in management's view, not a true representation of the earnings attributable to the Group's shareholders, specifically in instances where the share prices
and/or the number of shares held by the policyholders' fund varies significantly. The Group therefore calculates normalised earnings per share to eliminate these

definition of the Solvency Assessment and Management regime being implemented in South Africa and the operational management of liquidity by the Group. During 2016,
the Group reassessed the application of IAS7 to liquid instruments held to match certain five-year guaranteed investment contracts issued to policyholders by a
subsidiary. The application of IAS7 to these instruments was amended, resulting in a reallocation of R380 million between the net movement in cash and cash 
equivalents and cash flows from investment activities for 2015.

6. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy

Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining
the measurements. It should be noted that these disclosure only cover assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  

Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities.  

Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are supported 
by prices from observable current market transactions are categorised as level 2.

Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

ACQUISITION OF A 53% STAKE IN BRIGHTROCK HOLDINGS PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“BrightRock”)



The board of directors of Sanlam Limited is pleased to announce the conclusion of agreements whereby
Sanlam Life Insurance Limited, the largest operating subsidiary of Sanlam, will acquire a 53% stake in life
insurance provider, BrightRock, through a combination of a share subscription and purchase from various
management shareholders and Correlation Investments Limited (the “Transaction”).

The total consideration is dependent on the effective date of the Transaction and is expected to be a maximum
of R707 million should the effective date occur in the first half of 2017. Sanlam will fund the acquisition from
available discretionary capital.

The BrightRock group offers individualised, needs-matched life insurance cover that is built around a client’s
needs and is designed to change as a client’s needs evolve. BrightRock was launched in the intermediated,
individual risk market in 2012 and has since grown rapidly, establishing a strong market presence.

The Transaction is in line with Sanlam’s strategy to seek profitable and sustainable growth opportunities and is
testimony to Sanlam’s commitment to invest in South Africa. In terms of the Transaction agreement, Sanlam
and BrightRock will retain their own brands, life insurance licences and management teams. BrightRock
products are currently sold solely through independent brokers but the product range will in future also be
available through Sanlam Financial Advisers. Sanlam believes that this places it in a strong position to further
grow its market share, while BrightRock gains a growth partner that is supportive of its aspirations to grow into
a highly differentiated financial services business of scale.

The implementation of the Transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of a number of suspensive conditions,
including, inter alia, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The effective date of the Transaction will
therefore be dependent on the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions.

The Transaction is categorised below the Category 2 threshold for Sanlam for purposes of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements and this announcement is made on a voluntary basis.

Sanlam Limited announces the death of Board member Paul Bradshaw

Sanlam Limited regrets to announce the passing of Mr Paul Bradshaw (66), Independent Non-
Executive Director on the Board of Directors of Sanlam who died on Thursday, 12 January 2017.

Mr Bradshaw has been a key member of the Sanlam organisation, having been involved with the
business both here and in the UK for over two decades. He was a hugely supportive and
passionate member of the Board and made a significant contribution to Sanlam, as a friend, as a
professional and as a greatly admired colleague.

Mr Bradshaw was appointed to the Sanlam Board on 7 August 2013 and served on the Customer
Interest, Risk and Compliance as well as the Audit, Actuarial and Finance subcommittees of
Sanlam and Sanlam Life.

The founder and former Managing Director and Chairman of Skandia UK Life Assurance Limited,
Mr Bradshaw held various Sanlam Group directorships. These included Nucleus Financial Group,
where he was Chairman, Sanlam UK Holdings, Sanlam Life and Pensions UK, Sanlam Private
Investments and Sanlam Private Wealth Holdings UK.

Speaking on behalf of Sanlam, the Chairman of the Board, Mr Desmond Smith said: “I wish to
convey our deep-felt condolences to Paul’s wife Sheila; his children, Christopher and Laura; and
his family, friends and associates. He was a valued member of the Sanlam Board who brought a
wealth of international experience and offered valuable contributions to the Board and its
Committees. He will be sorely missed.”

Replacement Announcement - Sanlam names Chairman-elect to take over from the
retiring Board Chairman in June 2017


Sanlam advises that the following replaces the announcement titled “Sanlam names Chairman-
elect to take over from the retiring Board Chairman in June 2017” released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Thursday, 15 December 2016. The full
amended text appears below.

Sanlam has today announced the following appointments and changes to its Board of Directors
(“Board”):

   -   Mr Desmond Smith who has served as Chairman since 2010 will retire after the Annual
       General Meeting in June 2017;
   -   The Sanlam Limited Board of Directors unanimously nominated Mr Patrice Motsepe to be
       the new Chairman when Desmond Smith retires. However, Mr Patrice Motsepe
       proposed that the Sanlam Board should consider appointing Dr Johan van Zyl as the
       new Chairman;
   -   Dr Van Zyl was thereafter appointed Chairman-elect and will take over from Mr Smith in
       June 2017 in the capacity of non-independent non-executive Chairman;
   -   Mr Motsepe will retain his position as the Deputy Chairman; and
   -   Mr Sipho Nkosi, who has served as an independent non-executive director on the Board
       since 2006, has been appointed as the lead independent non-executive director.

Mr Smith joined the Sanlam Board in June 2009 and was appointed as Chairman in June 2010.
He had been Sanlam’s Managing Director from 1993, having joined the Company in 1968. He
retired from his executive position at Sanlam at the end of 1997. He is also the Chairman of
Reinsurance Group of America and holds several other company directorships.

Dr Van Zyl, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Ubuntu-Botho (“UB”) as well
as the joint CEO of African Rainbow Capital and is a former CEO of Sanlam, was appointed to
the Board as a non-executive director on 18 January 2016 as one of three UB nominated
representatives to the Board. He is credited for transforming Sanlam from a primarily South
African life insurer to a multinational diversified financial services group during his tenure as
CEO. He currently sits on the Supervisory Board of Steinhoff International Holdings and is a
Director on several other boards.

Mr Nkosi, the retired CEO of Exxaro Resources Limited and one of the founders and former
CEO of Eyesizwe Coal, serves on a number of company boards including Sanlam. His
qualifications include BCom (Hons) Economics, MBA, Diploma in Marketing, AMP (Oxford). He
is the second vice-president of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and a past President of the
Chamber of Mines of South Africa where he served on the Executive Council.

Commenting on behalf of the Board on Dr Van Zyl’s appointment, Mr Smith expressed
confidence in the Board’s decision: “Patrice was the Board’s choice but the Board respects his
decision and recommendation that Johan, a consummate leader, is well positioned to take over
as Chairman. His association with Sanlam and industry experience will add value to the future
direction and growth of the company for the benefit of all stakeholders.”

“The Board has put in place well considered and adequate processes to uphold and safeguard
adherence to good governance at all times. These include, among others, the appointment of
Sipho as the lead independent non-executive director,” he added.

Further, Mr Smith anticipated a smooth handover from himself to the Chairman-elect as well as
a continued good working relationship between the Chairman-elect, the Board and the Sanlam
Group CEO, Mr Ian Kirk.

 “Johan and Ian have a well-established and positive working relationship, starting back in May
2006 when Ian joined Sanlam as an executive in Johan’s team. I am confident that this
relationship will continue to serve the best interests of the Sanlam Group,” he said.

   million plus transaction costs (the “Consideration”), which includes Santam’s contribution of US$ 7.35
   million plus transaction costs. Sanlam and its short-term insurance subsidiary, Santam, first acquired a
   30% stake in SAHAM Finances in February 2016.


2. OVERVIEW OF SAHAM FINANCES

   SAHAM Finances is an insurance group with operations in 26 countries across North, West and East
   Africa, and the Middle East. It predominantly writes personal lines general insurance business (exceeding
   80% of its portfolio), but is in the process of diversifying this. SAHAM Finances has approximately 61
   subsidiaries, a network of 700 branches and a staff complement of more than 3,000 people. SAHAM
   Finances has a leading market share in many of the markets in which it operates.


3. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

   A number of strategic benefits informed the Sanlam Group’s acquisition of a 30% interest in SAHAM
   Finances in February 2016, which included the following:
   - SAHAM Finances enabled the Sanlam Group to expand its footprint into Francophone and Lusophone
      countries, which provides it with a unique positioning on the African continent.
   - It enabled the Sanlam Group to become a truly Pan-African insurance, investment and ancillary
      services group, able to service multi-national clients and their intermediaries more effectively than any
      other group operating across the continent.
   - With Sanlam’s support, significant opportunity exists to expand the life insurance operations of SAHAM
      Finances, which contribute some 15% to the SAHAM Finances income.
   - Potential synergies in general insurance, including optimisation of reinsurance, but also strengthening
      of the Sanlam Group’s product line diversification as SAHAM Finances is a significant player in general
      insurance.
   - SAHAM Finances has a strong health and assistance business with a well-tested model in Africa that
      can be rolled out further.
  
  The Sanlam Group’s relationship with the Saham Group has developed and strengthened over the past
  year, cementing our belief in the strong strategic rationale for the partnership to become a truly Pan-African
  financial services group operating across Francophone, Anglophone and Lusophone markets. A number
  of projects have already been launched to unlock synergies between the two groups, focussing on
  reinsurance, strategic alliances, bancassurance and capital optimisation. The Transaction provides the
  Sanlam Group with an opportunity to further align the two groups as strategic business partners and to
  extract further synergies. In addition, the increased shareholding firmly establishes the Sanlam Group as
  the only strategic partner in SAHAM Finances – in terms of the revised shareholders’ agreement, the
  Saham Group’s interest in SAHAM Finances will not reduce to below the Sanlam Group’s stake without
  Sanlam’s prior approval.


4. CONSIDERATION

  The Consideration payable for the further 16.6% stake in SAHAM Finances will be US$ 329 million plus
  transaction costs, which includes Santam’s contribution of US$ 7.35 million plus transaction costs. The
  Consideration is based on a current valuation of the SAHAM Finances operations, taking into account
  difficult operating environments in some markets as well as the strategic benefits of further aligning the
  interests of the two groups.

  SEM will fund its portion of the Consideration by using at least US$ 200 million of available discretionary
  capital, and obtaining third party funding for the remainder. Santam will fund its portion of the
  Consideration through available foreign cash resources.

  Santam’s ability to participate in the Transaction is limited due to the size of the investment already held in
  SAHAM Finances through SAN JV. At 30 June 2016 the investment in SAHAM Finances comprised more
  than 17% of Santam’s shareholder funds, making it the most significant strategic investment held by
  Santam. Santam’s interest in SAN JV will therefore dilute to 15% (previously 25%) and SEM’s interest will
  increase to 85% (previously 75%). The dilution of Santam’s interest in SAN JV will however not affect any
  of its existing shareholder rights.


5. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE TRANSACTION

  The implementation of the Transaction will remain subject to the fulfilment of a number of conditions
  precedent including, inter alia, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.


6. OTHER KEY TERMS

  In terms of the revised shareholders’ agreement, SEMIL will have increased minority protections, as well as
  additional representation on the board of directors of SAHAM Finances.


7. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION

  As per the latest audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, the consolidated net
  asset value of SAHAM Finances on 31 December 2015 was US$ 465 million and the earnings for the
  period were US$ 49 million.

  Post the implementation of the Transaction, SEMIL will participate in 46.6% of the earnings and net asset
  value of SAHAM Finances.
  Each of Sanlam and Santam will account for its respective effective interest in SAHAM Finances in its
  consolidated financial statements as investments in associated companies.


8. EFFECTIVE DATE

  The effective date of the Transaction will be dependent on the fulfilment of the conditions precedent and is
  expected to occur during the second quarter of 2017.


9. JSE LIMITED LISTINGS REQUIREMENTS

  For purposes of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the Transaction should be aggregated with
  the acquisition by SEMIL of its initial effective 30% interest in SAHAM Finances (please refer to the
  announcement dated 16 March 2016). The aggregated transaction has been categorised as a Category 2
  transaction in terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited for both Sanlam and Santam.

Operational Update – December 2016

The Group achieved an overall solid operational performance for the first 10 months of
the 2016 financial year. Key trends remained broadly in line with those highlighted in
the Group’s interim results for the six months to 30 June 2016, but with some
improvement in risk business claims experience at Sanlam Personal Finance and
Sanlam Employee Benefits. Recent acquisitions, including Saham Finances and
investments in Zimbabwe, continue to contribute to operational growth in 2016.
The challenging operating conditions experienced in the first six months of 2016
persisted for the 10 months to 31 October 2016 as anticipated. Economic growth in
most markets where the Group operates remains below longer-term potential, with
robust growth in India the exception. Investment and currency markets remain volatile,
reacting to global and country specific developments. Average market levels during the
first 10 months of 2016 were in general lower than the comparable period in 2015,
depressing growth in assets under management and commensurately fee income at
Sanlam Personal Finance and the investment management businesses. The Rand
regained some ground against major currencies, but was still weaker on an average
basis during the first 10 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Results

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2016
are:

-       New business volumes of R195 billion, up 11% on the first 10 months of the 2015
        financial year.

    o   Sanlam Personal Finance achieved growth of 3% in new business sales, with
        pressure on discretionary single premium savings sales persisting in both
        Individual Life and Glacier. Sanlam Sky new business volumes were in line with
        the high base of 2015. The focus on improving the mix of business yielded
        positive results, contributing to 11% growth in Sanlam Sky’s individual life risk
        business sales, a particularly satisfactory improvement since the end of June
        2016. Sales of savings products in Sanlam Sky declined by 38% due to the
        realignment of the channels towards more profitable product lines. Group
        recurring business at Sanlam Sky was in line with the comparable period due to
        the impact of the large one-off scheme written in 2015 and the biennial renewal
        of the ZCC scheme that also occurred during 2015. Excluding these, Sanlam
        Sky new business volumes increased by 10%. New business volumes in the
        Individual Life segment (focussing primarily on the middle-income market)                                                                                
        declined by 1%. Single premium sales remained under pressure and declined by
        3%. New recurring premiums increased by a satisfactory 13%, supported by
        continued strong growth in risk business. Glacier achieved overall growth of 5%
        as demand for discretionary savings products remained under pressure. Glacier
        life business sales grew by 16% with strong demand for its offshore and wrap
        product solutions.
    o   Sanlam Emerging Markets achieved overall new business growth of 67%,
        supported by a weaker average Rand exchange rate and the impact of corporate
        activity. Excluding corporate activity, new business volumes increased by some
        50%. All major businesses contributed good growth, apart from Zambia and
        Malawi, that continue to struggle in difficult environments, and Malaysia, where
        general insurance premium growth are impacted by weak motor cycle sales and
        a slower than anticipated diversification of the product set. New life business
        volumes increased by 5%, the combined effect of lower annuity sales in
        Botswana and good growth in the other regions. Investment business grew by
        96%, supported by a R4.6 billion new mandate from the Botswana Public
        Officers Pension Fund. General insurance net earned premiums increased by
        130% (17% excluding Saham Finances).
    o   The Sanlam Investments cluster increased its new business volumes by 10%,
        with Sanlam Employee Benefits and the SA Investment management businesses
        achieving particularly good growth.
    o   Gross written premium growth at Santam was under pressure, specifically in the
        specialist insurance lines, resulting in a lower growth rate compared to June
        2016.
    o   Net value of new life business (“VNB”) on a consistent economic basis increased
        by 8% on the comparable period in 2015 (6% up based on actual 31 October
        2016 economic basis). VNB margins have been largely maintained on a per
        product basis. Sanlam Personal Finance’s overall VNB increased by 7% on a
        consistent economic basis, with VNB margins in line with 2015. Sanlam
        Emerging Markets’ net VNB grew by a moderate 5% on a consistent economic
        basis. Lower individual life new business volumes in Zambia and Kenya resulted
        in negative VNB contributions from these regions, offsetting an otherwise solid
        performance. Sanlam Employee Benefits achieved an improved performance,
        supported by good growth in recurring premium Group Risk business.
    o   Overall net fund inflows of R32 billion were up from the R11 billion achieved in
        the comparable 10-month period in 2015, with most businesses contributing to
        the higher net inflows. The comparable 2015 period included the Botswana
        Public Officers Pension Fund withdrawal from Sanlam Emerging Markets and
        Sanlam Investments as well as the Public Investment Corporation withdrawal
        from Sanlam Investments.
    o   No noticeable deterioration in persistency experience since June 2016.

-   Net result from financial services up 10% on the first 10 months of the 2015
    financial year.

    o   Most businesses contributed satisfactory growth, apart from Sanlam Investment
        Management where fund-based fee income was impacted by lower average
        market levels. Further narrowing of credit spreads and improved commodity
        share prices contributed to a more than doubling in Capital Management’s
        earnings contribution.                                                                                 
    o   Sanlam Personal Finance achieved growth of 9%, with trends broadly in line with
        the first six months of 2016.
    o   Growth at Sanlam Emerging Markets slowed down from 40% for the first six
        months of 2016 to 26% for the 10 months to 31 October 2016. This is attributable
        to a relative strengthening in the average Rand exchange rate since the end of
        June, as well as a lower profit contribution from Namibia, where claims
        experience in both the life and general insurance businesses are weaker than in
        the first 10 months of 2015. Asset mismatch profits were also lower in Namibia
        during 2016, while new business strain increased due to strong growth in new
        life business.
    o   The strong performance reported by the Capital Management business
        supported growth of 16% in Sanlam Investments’ contribution to net result from
        financial services. This level of growth is not expected to continue for the
        remainder of the year as it is highly dependent on movements in credit spreads
        and the share prices of certain commodity stocks. In addition, the performance
        fees earned in 2015 on the Sanlam Life portfolios based on a three-year rolling
        investment performance included a particularly strong year of investment
        outperformance, which falls away for purposes of the 2016 performance fee
        calculation.
    o   Santam’s net underwriting margin for the 10-month period was slightly below the
        midpoint of the target range of 4% to 8%. The personal, commercial and
        specialist intermediated business lines were impacted by weather related
        catastrophe events in July and October 2016 and a number of large commercial
        fire losses. MiWay maintained its growth momentum and Santam Re made a
        positive contribution to the underwriting results.

-   Normalised headline earnings per share down 8% compared to the first 10 months
    of the 2015 financial year.

    o  Subdued investment returns earned on the capital portfolio relative to the first 10
       months of 2015 were further negatively impacted by the strengthening in the
       Rand exchange rate since the end of December 2015, which contributed to
       negative returns from the offshore exposure in the portfolio.
    o  Capital utilised for corporate transactions, in particular Saham Finances and the
       Shriram Insurance entities, also reduced the capital base on which investment
       return is earned relative to the first 10 months of 2015.

-   Diluted headline earnings per share, which include fund transfers recognised in
    respect of Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, decreased by 9%
    compared to the first 10 months of the 2015 financial year.

Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its Capital Adequacy Requirements 5.5 times on 30 September 2016.

The Group had excess capital of R3.1 billion available for redeployment at the end of
June 2016, after allowing for the Shriram Insurance transactions that concluded in
October 2016. Utilisation since then has been limited to a number of small transactions.
Including investment return earned on the portfolio and the special dividend declared by                                                                                
Santam, discretionary capital amounted to R3.6 billion on 31 October 2016. The
available discretionary capital remains earmarked for transactions currently under
consideration.

Good progress has been made with capital modelling under the Solvency Assessment
and Management (SAM) regime to be introduced in South Africa during 2017. The
Group will remain well capitalised under the SAM regime. Further information on the
Group’s optimal capital levels will be provided as part of the Group’s 2016 annual
results announcement in March 2017.

Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the
remainder of 2016 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key operational performance
indicators. A number of factors are likely to impact on the Group’s ability to maintain the
10-month growth rate in net result from financial services for the full 2016 financial year,
including average investment market levels, the strengthening in the Rand exchange
rate and the high comparable 2015 base for performance fees at Sanlam Investments.
Shareholders also need to be aware of the impact of movements in the Rand exchange
rate, the level of interest rates and financial market returns and volatility on the Group’s
investment return and Group Equity Value. Relative movements in these elements may
have a major impact on the growth in normalised headline earnings and Group Equity
Value to be reported for the full 2016 financial year.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Sanlam’s financial results for the year ending 31 December
2016 are due to be released on 9 March 2017. Shareholders are advised that this is not
a trading statement as per paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Executive review
In an unsupportive business environment during the first half of the 2016 financial year, the Group once again achieved a 
solid operational performance. Delivering double digit Return on Group Equity Value (RoGEV) (annualised) and double
digit growth in new business volumes and net result from financial services under challenging conditions is testimony to
the resilience of the Group’s strategy and its operations.

Economic growth in most of the markets where the Group operates remained below longer-term potential, in particular in
South Africa, the Group’s largest market. Investment market volatility also persisted as global investors navigated an
increasingly uncertain global environment. Markets grappled with the risk of an economic slowdown in China, the downturn
in the commodity cycle, rising geopolitical risks and the impact of potentially opposing monetary policy stances by
central banks in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Europe and Japan. The fragile outlook for global economic
growth was dealt a further blow at the end of the second quarter by the UK electorate’s surprise vote in favour of Britain
leaving the European Union, signifying rising pressure in a number of countries for more protectionist policies. These
conditions contributed to rising risk aversion, increasing the pressure on the economies, currencies and investment
markets of emerging market countries.

- In South Africa, the economy continued to grow at a pedestrian pace in nominal terms with no real growth expected in
2016. Both internal and external factors are depressing economic activity. The current soft commodity cycle amidst weak
global growth and demand is placing severe pressure on the mining and ancillary sectors, exports and consequently the
current account balance. A depreciating rand exchange rate over the last two years and weaker consumer demand alleviated
some of the pressure on the current account, with recent data suggesting some rebalancing in the economy. Business
confidence in the private sector has declined in an environment of policy uncertainty, the risk of a downgrade in South
Africa’s sovereign debt rating and suppressed profitability due to real growth in employment costs without associated gains
in productivity. Fixed capital investment by the private sector is consequently lagging, placing pressure on employment
growth and consumer disposable income.

A major positive development since the end of December 2015 is renewed cooperation between the public and private
sectors to address the structural challenges that are hampering economic and employment growth. Various initiatives have
already been launched, which assisted in South Africa maintaining its investment grade sovereign debt ratings in June 2016.
The Finance Ministry and private sector are committed to achieve the common goals of the initiatives, which bode well
for accelerated future economic growth.

The South African equity and bond markets followed international events closely and exhibited periods of intense
volatility. Average market levels during the first half of 2016 were some 1% lower than the comparable period in 2015,
limiting growth in assets under management and fund-based fee income at Sanlam Investments and Sanlam Personal Finance.

The economic, political and volatile investment market conditions had a pronounced negative impact on institutional
and retail investor confidence during the first half of 2016. Institutional clients refrained from making significant
investment decisions, including the reallocation of investment management mandates. The retail sector exhibited similar
trends, with waning demand for discretionary single premium investment products.

- The Rest of Africa region continued to experience tough operating conditions with economic growth below the region’s
long-term potential. In many countries sustained loose fiscal policies following the global financial crisis left
economies exposed to deteriorating economic and financial conditions. The shift towards tighter monetary policy in the US,
albeit modest and slow, tighter global financial conditions and a significant downturn in the region’s commodity export
prices have led to a period of macro-economic adjustment. This is especially true of countries which have been running
large current account and government budget deficits along with high government debt levels, including Ghana, Zambia,
Kenya, Angola, Mozambique and Tanzania.

Oil exporters have been especially hard hit, notably Angola and Nigeria, where deteriorating balance of payment
positions, reflected in falling foreign exchange reserves levels, have forced devaluation of the Angolan kwanza and 
the Nigerian naira. The negative shock to the terms of trade of these countries are also restricting growth in domestic 
demand. Nigeria, for example, is expected to record negative economic growth in 2016, followed by a mild recovery only in
2017. Currency weakness has also contributed to sharp increases in inflation in these economies.

Elsewhere, inflation is also elevated in a number of economies including Ghana, Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi. Domestic
policy interest rates remained high or were increased in these countries in the first half of 2016 as a result. In
addition, drought conditions in some countries have also weighed heavily on economic activity, including Zimbabwe, Zambia 
and Malawi.

Oil importing countries, however, benefited from low oil prices, which have supported their terms of trade and purchasing 
power. Kenya is one example among the larger countries where economic growth has remained robust. Other commodity
producers that have improved their terms of trade significantly since the global financial crisis include Botswana and
Namibia where the production of diamonds is material. Botswana recorded a healthy current account surplus and a small
budget deficit in 2015. In contrast, Namibia is running large twin deficits, which cannot be sustained indefinitely. Even 
so, Namibia’s international reserves did increase in the first quarter of 2016 due to capital inflows and valuation
adjustments.

Despite the difficult conditions, the overall Rest of Africa region continues to expand at a much faster pace than
South Africa. Low levels of insurance penetration also supported the Group’s growth in the region.

- India is making steady progress to improve economic growth, with the economy expanding in 2015 at a six year high.
Consumption tailwinds, supported by slower inflation and declining short-term interest rates, continue to drive economic
activity in 2016, benefiting growth at the Group’s Indian operations. The roll-out of the anticipated infrastructure
projects and diligent management of arrears in the equipment finance book is yielding positive results with no additional
bad debt provisions being required.

- Economic growth in Malaysia moderated somewhat in the first quarter of 2016 to 4,2 percent on an annualised basis.
Increased consumption spending by the public and private sector are not fully compensating for a decline in investment
and exports in the current weak commodity cycle. Motorcycle sales remain under pressure, impacting on premium growth in
the Group’s Malaysian general insurance business.

The Group’s primary strategic objective of optimising value creation for shareholders, as measured by RoGEV, remains
solidly in place. Given the nature of the Group’s diversified business, we consider this measure of performance the most
appropriate since it incorporates the result of all the major value drivers in the business. The RoGEV per share for the
six months to 30 June 2016 of 7,9% exceeded the target of 6,8%. Normalised RoGEV per share, which excludes investment
market and currency volatility as well as changes in interest rates and other factors outside of management’s control,
was slightly above the actual RoGEV for the period.

Net result from financial services increased by 11%. Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) achieved solid growth of 9%. Sanlam
Emerging Markets (SEM) grew its contribution by 40%, the combination of solid organic growth and the first-time
inclusion of Saham Finances. As anticipated, underwriting margins at Santam normalised from an exceptional performance in 
2015 to within its target range, resulting in a 6% decline in its net result from financial services. Pressure on fee income
in the asset management operations of Sanlam Investments (SI) and weaker claims experience at Sanlam Employee Benefits
(SEB), limited growth in the cluster’s profit contribution to 1%.

New business volumes increased by 15%, a strong performance under difficult conditions. All of the major businesses
contributed to the growth. Diligent focus on client centricity and the quality of new business written over many years
significantly improved the resilience of the life insurance in-force book as reflected in decent persistency experience
despite the pressure on consumer disposable income. The net value of the new covered business (VNB) increased by 7% at a
margin of 2,44%. The slight reduction in margin from 2,66% in the first half of 2015 is due to changes in business mix and
relatively higher long-term interest rates, with profitability mostly maintained on a per product basis.

- Strategic initiatives    
The Group strategy is embedded in five pillars:
- Improving performance through top-line growth
  - Increasing market share in key segments
  - Diversifying the base (including geographical presence, products, market segments and distribution platforms)
- Improved operating and cost efficiencies, including quality of business written
- Prioritising Sanlam’s international positioning through diversification
- Improving capital efficiency on an ongoing basis
- Embracing and accelerating transformation of the Group.

Varying emphasis is placed on the different pillars over time as the Group evolves, the economic and operating environment 
changes and client needs and preferences develop. This approach is applied throughout the business clusters, tailored to 
their specific circumstances.

The Group’s international positioning remains focused on emerging markets, specifically Africa, India and South-East
Asia. A niche presence is maintained in selected developed markets to provide an investment and wealth management
capability to the African client base, augmented by local distribution capacity to achieve economies of scale.

Steady progress has been made on a number of strategic initiatives:
- SEM finalised the Saham Finances acquisition. This transaction significantly expands the Group’s footprint, which is
unmatched in Africa. The expanded footprint presents the Group with a significant opportunity to provide a holistic and
seamless insurance, investment and employee benefits offering to corporate clients and brokers operating across the
continent.

Conscious of management capacity available in the Group, focus in the near term has been shifted to successfully
execute on this opportunity, with less emphasis on further acquisitive growth in South-East Asia for the time being.

Good progress has been made with the acquisition of additional 23% stakes in Shriram General Insurance and Shriram
Life Insurance in India. The transaction remains subject to final regulatory approval.

Capacity within the SEM central support team has been strengthened in line with the increased focus on accelerated
organic growth.

- SPF refined its strategy to become the leader in insurance, investment and ancillary services in all segments of the
South African retail sector. The business is being realigned along broad solution categories to enhance management
focus and agility, which will significantly improve its ability to anticipate and fulfil rapidly evolving client needs,
while being optimally competitive. The realignment will also strategically position the business to operate effectively in a
regulatory environment post the introduction of the South African regulator’s Retail Distribution Review proposals.

The importance of digital distribution and support channels is rising at a rapid pace. These channels are demanded by
a new generation of clients and can also be a key component in improving the cost effectiveness and affordability of
products to the benefit of clients. The optimal digital offering, including both channel design and tailored product
solutions, is under development.

Life insurance products were launched on the MiWay direct distribution platform during 2015 under the MiWay Life
brand. Satisfactory sales traction was achieved during the first six months of 2016.

- SI’s implemented consulting offering continues to gain popularity with strong retail inflows generated during the
first half of 2016. Particularly satisfactory is the increased portion of funds invested in internally managed portfolios.
This offering also positions the cluster for a post Retail Distribution Review regulatory environment. Institutional
net inflows, however, continued to disappoint. The positioning of the business to gain market share in this highly
competitive segment will receive particular attention going forward. Improving cost efficiencies will also be a strategic 
focus area.

- Santam’s strategy is aimed at maintaining its leadership position in South Africa, while building its non-South
African emerging market presence together with SEM. Good progress has been made in optimising the support model for the
general insurance businesses in SEM. MiWay, Santam’s direct offering in South Africa, continues on a strong growth path, 
now competing in both the retail and small enterprises markets.

- Progress has been made in implementing the strategy of the new Sanlam Corporate cluster announced earlier in the year. 
Recruitment of a Chief Executive for the cluster is progressing after Junior Ngulube’s appointment as Chief Executive
of SEM.

- Outlook    
We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the remainder of 2016, apart from
India where robust economic growth is expected. Global economic growth prospects for the second half of the year is
weighed to the downside as markets absorb the consequences of the UK exiting the European Union. Business and investor
confidence is unlikely to improve under these conditions, while investment market and currency volatility are expected to
persist. We remain confident in the Group’s ability to grow operational earnings and new business volumes despite the
challenging environment, but shareholders need to be aware of the impact that the level of interest rates, currency exchange
rates and financial market returns and volatility have on the Group’s earnings and Group Equity Value. Relative movements
in these elements may have a major impact on the growth in normalised headline earnings, VNB and GEV to be reported for
the 2016 financial year.

We will continue to diligently execute on the strategic priorities identified in the Group’s 2015 Annual Report in the
second half of the 2016 financial year.

Comments on the results
- Introduction    
The Sanlam Group’s International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements for the six months ended 30
June 2016 are presented based on and in compliance with IFRS, specifically IAS 34 on Interim Financial Reporting. The
basis of presentation and accounting policies for the IFRS financial statements and shareholders’ information are in all
material respects consistent with those applied in the 2015 Annual Report.

Most of the Group businesses achieved a solid underlying performance in the first half of 2016 despite challenging
economic and investment market conditions. Highlights for the six months include the finalisation of the Saham Finances
transaction, in absolute terms the largest acquisition concluded by the Group to date, and a continued improvement in the
operational performances of SEM and Sanlam Capital Markets (SCM).

- Operating environment    
Economic conditions
Economic conditions in the first six months of the 2016 financial year were not conducive to growth, as expanded on in
the Executive Review.

Equity markets
The South African equity market delivered a relatively weaker performance with the FTSE/JSE All Share Index recording
a total return of 4,3% for the six months to 30 June 2016, compared to a return of 6,7% in the comparable six-month
period in 2015. The MSCI World Index return in rand of -3,9% was significantly lower than the 7,8% return for the first 
half of 2015. A number of the Rest of Africa markets where the Group operates also experienced significantly lower relative
investment market performance. Investment return earned on the Group’s capital portfolio was commensurately lower, with
a similar impact on headline earnings.

Interest rates
South African long-term interest rates declined by 110 basis points since the end of 2015, but were still 50 basis
points higher than the 30 June 2015 levels. RoGEV for the first six months of 2016 was supported by the decline in rates
since the end of 2015. Growth in VNB was, however, negatively impacted by the higher rates relative to the 30 June 2015
comparable base. The South African All Bond Index returned 11,2% in the first half of 2016 compared to a return of 1,6%
for the same period in 2015, partly offsetting the negative impact of the lacklustre equity market performance on the
South African operations’ assets under management.

Foreign currency exchange rates
The South African rand strengthened against most currencies over the six months to 30 June 2016, after a significant
depreciation during the 2015 financial year. Currency volatility was a key feature in a number of African countries. The
exchange rate of the rand against the currencies to which the Group has major exposure is summarised in the table below.

The stronger closing exchange rate of the rand had a negative impact on the rand-based valuations and RoGEV of the
Group’s non-South African operations. The weaker average exchange rates, however, benefited the translated rand earnings,
new business volumes and VNB of these operations.

Taxation
The following changes in South African tax legislation affected the Group’s results for the six months to 30 June 2016:
- The effective capital gains tax (CGT) rate on unrealised market value appreciation was increased from 18,67% to 22,4% 
during the first half of 2016, requiring re-measurement of the Group’s deferred tax balances. This resulted in the 
recognition of a R175 million one-off capital gains tax charge in the Group’s earnings for the six months to 30 June 2016 
net of non-controlling interests.
- The taxation of risk business written by life insurance companies was amended through the introduction of a separate
risk policy fund (RPF) for tax purposes. The net effect was as follows:
  - For new business, tax relief for the upfront costs incurred in respect of writing new business is delayed until the
    product becomes profitable from a cash flow perspective, impacting negatively on VNB. Together with product design 
    changes and re-pricing, the margin of new risk business was unaffected.
  - In respect of existing business transferred to the RPF, investment income earned on policyholder liabilities 
    attributable to the RPF is not subject to tax in the RPF, resulting in an increase in the discretionary reserves of 
    the RPF to ensure profit is still recognised over the lifetime of the affected policies. This increase in the 
    discretionary reserve led to an increase in the value of in-force life business.

- Group Equity Value    
GEV amounted to R106,6 billion or 5 212 cents per share on 30 June 2016. Including the dividend of 245 cents per share
paid during the year, a RoGEV per share of 7,9% was achieved for the first six months of 2016. This exceeds the 2016
six-month target of 6,8% by a healthy margin. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact of investment market and
currency volatility, interest rate changes and other one-off effects not under management control (such as tax
changes), was slightly in excess of the actual return. 

South African and Namibian long-term interest rates declined by 110bp during the first half of 2016, with a
corresponding 110bp decrease in the risk discount rate (RDR) used to value the Group’s South African and Namibian operations for
GEV purposes. This had a commensurate positive impact on the 30 June 2016 valuations and RoGEV of these businesses. The
benefit was, however, to a large extent offset by:
- Currency translation losses on the non-South African operations due to the stronger rand exchange rate;
- A strengthening in the valuation assumptions used for the SEM and SEB operations;
- The utilisation of prudent investment market return assumptions in the valuation of the investment management businesses; and
- Weak investment market returns and a worsening in risk underwriting experience in the first half of 2016.

After underperforming in 2015, the Group’s shareholding in Santam achieved a stellar return of 24% for the six months
to 30 June 2016. The investment in Santam is valued at its listed market price for GEV purposes and reflects the share
price performance during the period.

Group operations yielded an overall return of 9,1% in the first half of 2016, the combination of 8,8% return on covered 
business and 9,4% on other Group operations. The reduction in return on adjusted net worth reflects the relatively
weaker investment market return earned during the first six months of 2016, especially on the non-South Africa exposure, 
as well as the one-off impact of the change in the effective CGT rate in South Africa (refer above).

SPF’s RoGEV of 13,8% was well in excess of its target. Covered business yielded a return of 12,8% compared to 8,0% in
the first half of 2015. A decline in return on adjusted net worth and some reduction in positive experience variances
and operating assumption changes were more than compensated for by the positive impact on the value of in-force of the
lower RDR and the introduction of the RPF. The valuation of other group operations benefited from the lower RDR applied 
in the discounted cash flow valuation models, supporting a return of 22,7% from these operations in the first half of 2016
compared to 10,2% in the comparable 2015 period.

Notwithstanding SEM achieving solid growth in operating earnings and VNB for the first half of 2016, the cluster did
not achieve its RoGEV hurdle for the six-month period. RoGEV for the first half of 2016 of 1,5% (2015: 4,8%) is the
combined result of -0,8% (2015: 5,7%) return on covered business and a yield of 2,3% (2015: 4,3%) on other operations. The
following factors impacted on the return:
- The strengthening of the rand against particularly the Indian rupee, Botswana pula, Ghanaian cedi and Nigerian naira
had a 6% negative impact on the reported RoGEV. In constant currency terms, a RoGEV of 7,5% was achieved.
- Some of the general insurance operations have not yet succeeded with the successful implementation of
diversification strategies, resulting in a more prudent view being taken in the valuation bases of these businesses. Pacific 
& Orient and Shriram General Insurance in particular yielded inadequate returns as a result.
- Negative variances from the correction of Soras Assurances Generales’ results, following corrective measures taken
to address financial irregularities uncovered during the period.
- Excess capital carried by MCIS, Botswana Insurance Holdings and Shriram Capital detracts from the total returns
achieved on the SEM portfolio given the low rate of investment return earned on the underlying investments. Redeploying the
excess capital remains a focus area.
- The return on covered business also fell short of target. In Kenya and Zambia the turnaround has been slower than
anticipated. Despite profitable new business written by MCIS, returns were negatively impacted by changes to in-force
modelling assumptions. Similar to the South African operations, investment return earned on the capital supporting the life
operations also underperformed.
- In support of the accelerated organic growth strategy, the SEM support structure has been expanded. Although the
increase in group costs have been capitalised, no allowance has been made in the valuations for the future benefits arising
from expected accelerated organic growth.

The SI operations recorded negative RoGEV of 0,4% in the first half of 2016 compared to 9,8% in the first six months
of 2015. Covered business yielded -3,3% (2015: 2,6%) and other operations 1,0% (2015: 14,4%). The return on covered
business was negatively impacted by the significant strengthening of the rand against the British pound, weak investment
return earned on the capital supporting these operations and negative risk underwriting experience at SEB. Last mentioned is
in line with trends already visible in peer’s 2015 results. The low return on other operations is mostly attributable
to currency translation losses on the International sub-cluster businesses. The South African Wealth and Investment
management businesses achieved acceptable growth in light of prudent investment market return assumptions being allowed for
in the valuation bases in an uncertain environment. The valuations were supported by the lower RDR and some growth in the
level of assets under management. In constant currency, the cluster achieved overall RoGEV of 3,0% and a RoGEV of 4,7%
on other operations.

As mentioned above, the RoGEV on Santam reflects the return on the listed Santam share.

The low return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:
- Net corporate expenses recognised in net result from financial services.
- A relatively low level of return earned on the portfolio’s exposure to low yielding liquid assets.
- Hedging of the Saham Finances and Shriram life and general insurance transactions. The transactions were hedged
through the acquisition of foreign currency, which earns a very low rate of interest due to the US dollar denomination. The
application of hedge accounting principles in the GEV presentation furthermore eliminated the foreign currency
movements, essentially exposing the portfolio to some R5 billion of assets that earned close to zero return - in respect of the
Saham Finances transaction for a period of two months and six months in respect of the Shriram insurance transactions.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R4 billion increased by 11% on 2015, with a strong
performance by SEM augmented by solid growth at SPF. As anticipated, Santam experienced a normalisation in underwriting
margins after exceptional results in 2015, contributing to a 6% decline in its contribution to operational earnings. SI’s 
1% operating earnings growth is the combined effect of a strong recovery at SCM, offset by lower earnings at SEB and the
asset management businesses.

SPF achieved particularly satisfactory growth for a largely mature business in a challenging South African business
environment.

Sanlam Individual Life grew its net result from financial services by 8% in the first half of 2016. Excluding the
first-time contribution from Afrocentric of R43 million and start-up losses at MiWay Life of R20 million, Individual Life
net result from financial services grew by 7%. Profit from investment products grew by 18%, supported by an 11% increase
in the average level of assets under management. Strong guaranteed plan sales over the last two years contributed to the
increase in the asset base. Profit from risk products declined by 25%, the combined effect of significantly higher new
business strain following the strong new business performance (refer Business volumes section below) and an increase in
claims experience. Profit released from the asset mismatch reserve declined by 6% due to the lower level of this reserve
in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Positive annuity mortality experience, higher annuity
spread margins and an increase in interest earned on working capital supported the profit contribution from other life
products, which increased by 20%. Sanlam Personal Loans profit declined by 1%, attributable to only a marginal increase 
in the size of the loan book. The implementation of the National Credit Amendment Act added substantially to the
administration process surrounding loan applications and also introduced more strict affordability requirements. This 
resulted in an increase in the number of clients not completing the loan application process due to the additional 
administrative burden, and also a decline in the number of clients qualifying for loans. Focus remained on maintaining the
quality of the book. Bad debt experience remained at some 5% as a result, which was in line with the 2015 experience.

Sanlam Sky’s net result from financial services increased by 7%, broadly in line with the growth in the size of the
in-force book.

Glacier grew its net profit contribution by 20%. Although fees are under constant pressure, fund-based fee income
benefited from an increase in assets under management due to good net fund inflows.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by 40%. This includes a first-time contribution of R95 million (before
group cost allocation) from Saham Finances. The transaction contributed to the cluster’s earnings from 1 March 2016.
Excluding Saham Finances, net result from financial services increased by 24%.

Namibia (up 29% net of tax and non-controlling interests; 10% on a gross basis) benefited from strong profit growth at
Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH). The life operations achieved growth of 13% in gross result from financial
services, augmented by 31% growth in CIH’s contribution. Claims experience normalised at Santam Namibia after exceptional
underwriting results in 2015, contributing to a 21% decline in the business’ operating earnings. The higher growth on a net
basis relative to gross earnings is largely attributable to relatively stronger growth in businesses without
non-controlling interests and a tax overprovision in the first half of 2015 that reversed in the second half of 2015.

Botswana achieved growth of 19% in its net result from financial services (20% before tax and non-controlling
interests). The weaker average rand exchange rate in the first half of 2016 contributed 14% to the growth, with underlying
organic growth of some 5%. The life insurance operations achieved only marginal growth in constant currency terms due to
lower investment related earnings in volatile market conditions as well as a decline in annuity new business sales and
margins from a high base in 2015. Asset management earnings were negatively impacted by the large withdrawal of Botswana
Public Officers Pension Fund (BPOPF) funds in 2015 and volatile investment market conditions. Slow growth in loan advances,
combined with currency depreciation in some markets, suppressed growth in Letshego’s profit contribution.

The Rest of Africa operations (excluding Saham Finances) recorded a 23% decline in net result from financial services
(33% in constant currency). A first-time contribution by Zimbabwe and good growth in Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania was
more than offset by a lower profit contribution from Zambia, Malawi and Rwanda, lower residential property sales in Kenya
and an increase in cluster level cost allocations based on the expanded central support capacity. As highlighted in the
Executive Review, the Zambian and Malawi operations are under pressure from a difficult economic environment. Financial
irregularities relating to prior years were identified in the Rwandan operations, which negatively impacted on the
results of the general insurance business. Corrective actions were taken to address these activities.

Net result from financial services in India rose 73%; 14% in constant currency terms and excluding the abnormal
equipment finance bad debt provisions recognised in the first half of 2015. The credit businesses increased their profit
contribution by 19% in constant currency terms and excluding the equipment finance provisions in 2015, largely attributable
to an increase in the size of the loan books. Both businesses are benefiting from the strong economic growth in India.
Higher claims experience in the general insurance business limited its profit growth to 6% in constant currency. Life
insurance profits declined compared to the first half of 2015, attributable to higher new business strain following strong
new business sales and costs incurred on growing the distribution footprint.

In Malaysia, net result from financial services decreased by 41%, the aggregate of 55% growth in general insurance
earnings and a net loss of R10 million from the life insurance operations. Growth in general insurance business premiums
remained under pressure from a combination of lower sales of two-wheelers and increased competition. This was, however,
more than offset by further anticipated releases of the IBNR reserves recognised in 2015 as experience develops. Product
innovation is a key focus for the business to regain market share and to expand its product lines. A number of new
products are planned for release over the coming months. The life insurance business had a difficult year with operating
earnings declining substantially. This is attributable to a number of one-off items:
- Higher reinsurance premiums payable in respect of Group Life products in terms of renewed treaties.
- Continued medical losses due to the delayed effect of repricing of the product.
- Asset mismatch losses following the sharp decrease in Malaysian government bond yields during 2016.

SI net result from financial services increased by 1%.

Significant investment market volatility resulted in a decline in the average level of most asset class indices during
the first half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The impact of lower average market levels on the investment
management businesses’ assets under management was partly offset by good net fund inflows, in particular strong retail
flows. Average assets under management increased by only 2% as a result, contributing to a 5% decline in Investment
Management net result from financial services. Fee income increased broadly in line with assets under management.
Project-related cost in Sanlam UK and the impact of the weaker average rand exchange rate on the translated rand-based 
cost of the international businesses contributed to a higher than inflationary increase in the cost base.

SEB’s net profit contribution declined by 5%. Risk profits declined substantially due to higher claims experience (a
trend already visible in peer group experience in 2015) and the impact of keen pricing to retain business. This was
partly offset by lower new business strain at SEB Investments, a decline in administration losses and an increase in 
working capital profits due to higher short-term interest rates.

Capital Management experienced a reversal of credit and structured finance related losses incurred in 2015. A narrowing 
of credit spreads on Eurobonds and an increase in the listed price of equities underlying equity-backed financing
structures resulted in marked-to-market gains on these exposures and contributed to a 55% increase in the business’ gross
result from financial services. Net of tax, operating earnings grew at a lower rate of 29% due to an increase in the
effective tax rate following the utilisation of available assessed losses during 2015.

As anticipated, Santam experienced a normalisation in underwriting margins after an exceptional 2015 reporting period.
The claims ratio increased from 63,7% in the first six months of 2015 to 64,8% in the first half of 2016, attributable
to a number of large corporate claims experienced in 2016 and an increase in drought-related agricultural claims. Sales
remuneration increased by 25%. A decrease in the gross commission ratio due to the growth in MiWay, where limited
commission expenses are incurred, was offset by lower reinsurance commissions earned on specialist business lines, including
crop and corporate property, following relatively worse loss ratios compared to 2015. Furthermore, gross commission on
inwards reinsurance business from Santam Re as well as business written in Africa, typically carries higher commission
rates than South African business. Focus on cost efficiencies and the disposal of Indwe contributed to a decline in the
administration cost ratio during the first half of 2016. The net effect was a decline in the underwriting margin from 8,9%
in the first half of 2015 to 6,4% in 2016.

Normalised headline earnings of R4,3 billion are 7% down on the comparable 2015 period. This is the combined effect of
the 11% increase in net result from financial services, offset by a 67% decline in net investment return earned on the
capital portfolio due to:
- Relatively weaker investment market performance, in particular on non-South African exposure;
- The R175 million one-off CGT expense incurred in 2016 due to the increase in the effective CGT rate in South Africa;
  and
- Some R120 million reduction in net investment income earned following the utilisation of discretionary capital for
  the Saham Finances acquisition.

Excluding the one-off CGT expense, normalised headline earnings declined by 3%.

- Business volumes    
The Group achieved overall growth of 15% in new business volumes during the first half of 2016, a particularly
pleasing performance in a difficult operating environment.

Life insurance new business volumes increased by 17%, investment business inflows by 15% and general insurance earned
premiums by 16% (8% excluding the first-time contribution by Saham Finances).

SPF’s new business sales grew by 9%, a satisfactory performance in a difficult market for single premium business.

Sanlam Sky, operating largely in the South African entry-level market, achieved growth of 8%. Individual life recurring 
premium new business increased by a disappointing 2%, with 5% growth in risk sales being offset by a 13% decline in
savings sales. This reflects management effort to reduce the proportion of sales from low margin savings products. Group
recurring premium sales increased by 34% following two large schemes written by Safrican. These new schemes more than
offset the impact of the biennial renewal of the Zionist Christian Church scheme that occurred in 2015.

New business volumes in the Individual Life segment, which is largely focused on the middle-income segment in South
Africa, declined by 1%. Single premium sales decreased by 3%, impacted by waning investor confidence and continued focus
by bank brokers on their own in-house products. New recurring premiums grew by 12%, with a sterling performance by new
risk business sales that increased by 24%. This was augmented by solid growth in ad hoc premium increases and tax free
savings product sales. New recurring premium retirement annuity sales reflect the pressure on middle-income consumers and
grew by only 2%.

Glacier achieved a solid performance in the first half of 2016, growing its new business volumes by 12%. Life
insurance new business continued to grow strongly at 22%, with good demand for offshore and wrap solutions. Suppressed 
investor confidence in the affluent market segment, however, had a marked impact on discretionary non-life product sales, 
which increased by only 8%.

The SEM operations grew their new business contribution by 37%; 19% excluding the first-time contributions by Saham
Finances and the Zimbabwe operations (11% in constant currency). New life business increased by 23% (22% excluding Saham
Finances and Zimbabwe), investment business inflows by 23% (20% excluding Zimbabwe - Saham Finances does not contribute
to investment business) and general insurance earned premiums by 115% (9% excluding Saham Finances and Zimbabwe).

New business volumes in Namibia increased by 27%, the combined result of a more than doubling in new life business and
15% growth in unit trust inflows. Glacier Namibia volumes are included in SEM for the first time in 2016 (previous
reported by SPF). New life business sales were also supported by strong entry-level market and group business sales.

As anticipated, Botswana’s new business performance was more subdued against a high base in 2015. A slowdown in
annuity sales is the primary driver behind a 5% decline in new business sales in constant currency (8% growth in rand terms).

Rest of Africa new business volumes increased by 141% (32% excluding the first-time contributions by Saham Finances
and Zimbabwe). Tanzania, Nigeria and Kenya achieved excellent new business sales growth, offsetting lower volumes in
Zambia and Malawi and a slow start to the year in Ghana. The growth in Kenya was driven by strong investment flows into Pan
Africa Asset Management and good single premium corporate sales. The agency channel continues to recover after the disruption 
caused by the implementation of a new policy administration system during 2015 and restructuring of the distribution model in 
2016, but individual life sales volumes were not yet at the desired level and declined slightly compared to the first half of 
2015.

New business growth in India of 43% was supported by the weaker average rand exchange rate. Constant currency growth
of some 20% represents a solid overall performance.

As indicated before, lower two-wheeler sales and competitive pressures impacted negatively on Pacific & Orient in
Malaysia. This is evident in its earned premiums that declined by 16%. MCIS continues to do well from a new business
perspective and increased sales by 57%.

SI’s new business volumes increased by 18% with strong contributions from all businesses. SEB in particular attracted
good inflows into its investment products, elevating its new business growth to 81%. The market for recurring premium
risk business, however, remains highly competitive with all competitors pricing keenly to retain business. The Wealth
Management and Investment Management businesses continued to attract strong retail inflows in South Africa as elaborated 
on in the Executive Review. Some internal focus during the restructuring of Sanlam UK is impacting on new business
performance.

The majority of Santam’s premiums are still written in the highly competitive South African market. Earned premiums
grew by 7%, reflecting the maturity of the South African market and highly competitive niche and specialist market
segments that depressed renewals. MiWay, Santam’s direct insurance business, grew its premium base by 20%, with strong 
growth also achieved by Santam Re.

Net fund inflows of R21,7 billion in the first half of 2016 were well in excess of the R6,8 billion net inflows achieved in 
the comparable period in 2015. Excluding the BPOPF withdrawal of some R14,5 billion in the first six months of 2015, the 2016 
first-half net inflows were broadly in line with 2015.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 50 basis points higher long-term 
interest rates in South Africa and Namibia at the end of June 2016 compared to 30 June 2015 resulted in a commensurate increase 
in the risk discount rate and a consequential negative impact on VNB growth and margins. This was partly alleviated by a decline 
in the Botswana long-term rate. VNB at actual discount rates increased by 9%; on a comparable basis (before economic assumption 
changes) VNB increased by 11%.

SPF achieved overall growth of 8% on a comparable basis. The introduction of the low margin tax free savings product in the 
entry-level market at the end of March 2015 resulted in a change in business mix for Sanlam Sky with a commensurate decline in 
overall VNB and VNB margins. Despite a normalisation in mix between risk and savings products in 2016, the first half of 2015 
included a lower percentage of tax free savings sales relative to 2016 due to the product only being sold for two months in 
first-half 2015. VNB at Sanlam Sky declined by 7% on a comparable basis as a result, with VNB margins also declining from 7,67% 
in the first half of 2015 to 6,51% in 2016. The strong growth in recurring premium risk business in the Individual Life segment 
more than compensated for the lower single premium sales, with VNB increasing by 11% and the VNB margin expanding from 2,54% to
2,68% on a comparable basis. Glacier VNB growth of 23% is broadly in line with its new life business performance.

VNB growth and margins at SEM were negatively impacted by the lower new business production in Zambia and Malawi, as well as the 
decline in individual life sales in Kenya. This was more than compensated for by strong VNB growth in the other regions. On a 
consistent economic basis, overall VNB increased by 23% to R265 million. The underperformance in Zambia, Malawi and Kenya, together 
with the inclusion of the low margin Glacier life business in the Namibian results in 2016 contributed to a decline in the overall 
VNB margin for the cluster.

SI’s VNB declined by 15%, largely due to the change in sales mix at SEB from recurring premium risk business to lower
margin savings products.

- Capital management    
Progress on Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) implementation
The South African insurance businesses have made good progress with their SAM implementation programmes and will be
compliant with the new solvency regime when it becomes effective during the course of 2017.

As indicated in previous results announcements, a SCR target cover range of between 1,7 times and 2,1 times has been
set for Sanlam Life Insurance Limited’s (Sanlam Life) covered business. The R10 billion of IFRS-based required capital
allocated to these operations at the end of June 2016 translated into a SCR cover at the upper end of this target range.
The SCR cover ratio for the Sanlam Life entity as a whole exceeded the covered business ratio at the end of June 2016 due
to the inclusion of discretionary and other capital held on the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as investments in
Santam and other Group operations that are not allocated to Sanlam Life’s covered business operations (i.e. not included in
the R10 billion allocated capital referred to above).

Discretionary capital
The Group started the year with unallocated discretionary capital of R2,3 billion. The utilisation of unallocated discretionary 
capital during the six months to 30 June 2016 was limited to a few small transactions. Together with investment return earned on 
the discretionary capital portfolio and the 2015 dividend cover in excess of cash operating earnings, available discretionary 
capital increased to R3,1 billion at 30 June 2016. We remain focused on utilising the available discretionary capital for 
value-accretive investment opportunities.

- Solvency    
All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of June 2016. The total
admissible regulatory capital (including identified discretionary capital) of Sanlam Life, the holding company of the
Group’s major life insurance subsidiaries, of R44,4 billion, covered its capital adequacy requirements (CAR) 5,3 times.
No policyholder portfolio had a negative bonus stabilisation reserve at the end of June 2016.

Dividend    
- The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large
shareholder base.

Accounting policies and basis of preparation

The preparation of the Group’s reviewed interim financial statements was supervised by the financial director, Kobus
Möller CA(SA).

These reviewed interim condensed consolidated results have been prepared in accordance with and contains the information
required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically IAS34 on Interim Financial Reporting as well as 
the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued 
by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

The policy liabilities and profit entitlement rules are determined in accordance with prevailing legislation,
generally accepted actuarial practice and the stipulations contained in the demutualisation proposal. There have been no
material changes in the financial soundness valuation basis since 31 December 2015, apart from changes in the economic
assumptions. 

The accounting policies and basis of preparation for the IFRS financial statements and Shareholders’ information are
in all material respects consistent with those applied in the 2015 annual report. 

None of the new or revised IFRSs or interpretations that became effective in the current period affected the results.

The following new or revised IFRSs and interpretations that are applicable to the group have effective dates
applicable to future financial years and have not been early adopted:
- IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
- IFRS 16 - Leases (effective 1 January 2019)

The impact of the application of these revised standards and interpretations in future financial reporting periods on
the Group’s reported results, financial position and cash flows are still being assessed.

External review    
The appointed auditors, Ernst & Young Inc, reviewed the interim condensed financial statements and Shareholders’
information of the Group at 30 June 2016. These reviews were conducted in accordance with International Standards on Review
Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. Copies of
the unqualified review reports of Ernst & Young Inc are presented below.

Shareholders' information
Independent auditors’ review report
on Sanlam Limited interim Shareholders’ information
To the directors of Sanlam Limited

Introduction
We have reviewed the accompanying interim Shareholders’ information of Sanlam Limited for the six months ended 30 June 2016, 
comprising Group Equity Value; Change in Group Equity Value; Return on Group Equity Value; Shareholders’ fund at fair value; 
Shareholders’ fund income statement; Notes to the shareholders’ fund information; and Embedded Value of covered business; 
Change in Embedded Value of covered business; Value of New Business and Notes to the Embedded Value of covered business; as 
set out below. 

Directors’ responsibility for interim financial information
The directors of Sanlam Limited are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial information in 
accordance with the basis of accounting, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of interim financial information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information. We conducted our review in accordance with 
International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity”. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the basis of accounting set out above. 
This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements. 

A review of interim financial information in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and
applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on
these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim
Shareholders’ information for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
the basis of accounting set out above.

Basis of accounting
Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to the basis of accounting. The Sanlam Limited Interim Shareholders’ 
information is prepared to provide additional information in respect of the Group shareholders’ fund in a format that 
corresponds with that used by management in evaluating the performance of the Group. As a result the Sanlam Limited Interim 
Shareholders’ information may not be suitable for another purpose.

Independent auditors’ review report on interim condensed consolidated financial statements

To the shareholders of Sanlam Limited

Introduction
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Sanlam Limited, contained in the accompanying
interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016 and 
condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow for the six-month 
period then ended and selected explanatory notes set out below and the basis of accounting.

Directors’ responsibility for the interim financial statements
The directors of Sanlam Limited are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim condensed
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS 34) - 
“Interim Financial Reporting”, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides, as issued by the Accounting Practices 
Committee and the Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the 
requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard of Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, “Review of 
Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.” ISRE 2410 requires us to 
conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial 
statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting 
framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial information in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. 
We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, 
as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained. 

The procedures performed in a review is substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed 
in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of Sanlam Limited for the six-month period ended 30 June 2016 is

   For basic earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the 
   treasury shares held by subsidiaries, consolidated investment funds and policyholders. Basic 
   earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted weighted average number 
   of shares in issue.                                  
   For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for 
   the shares not yet issued under the Sanlam Share Incentive Scheme and treasury shares held by 
   subsidiaries, consolidated investment funds and policyholders. Diluted earnings per share is 
   calculated by dividing earnings by the adjusted diluted weighted average number of shares 
   in issue.                                  
   Refer above for normalised earnings per share, which is based on the economic earnings 
   attributable to the shareholders’ fund, and should also be used when evaluating the Group’s 
   economic performance.

   Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy                                                         
   Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy 
   that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining the measurements. It should be noted 
   that these disclosure only cover assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

   Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, 
   quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities.

   Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices 
   included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
   or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique 
   based on assumptions that are supported by prices from observable current market transactions are 
   categorised as level 2.                                                         

   Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are

Sanlam Limited – Changes to the Executive Committee

In terms of paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders
are advised of the following changes within Sanlam Group’s Executive Management.

   1. Financial Director, Mr Kobus Möller (57), will retire from the executive and board
      with effect from 30 September 2016. Mr Möller will remain employed by Sanlam
      until 31 December 2016. He will continue to serve within the Group in a non-
      executive capacity on subsidiary boards and sub-committees. Mr Möller joined
      Sanlam in 1998 and was appointed as the Group’s Financial Director in 2006.

   2. With effect from 01 October 2016:

          -   Mr Heinie Werth (53), the Chief Executive Officer of Sanlam Emerging
              Markets (SEM) will succeed Mr Möller as the Group’s Financial Director and
              Executive Director of the Sanlam board. A Chartered Accountant, Mr Werth
              also holds an MBA cum laude from the University of Stellenbosch among
              other qualifications. He joined Sanlam in 1998 and has held various
              executive positions including, among others, Financial Director: Sanlam
              Employee Benefits; and Financial Director: Sanlam Life Insurance Limited.

          -   Mr Junior John Ngulube (58) will be appointed to the position of CEO: SEM,
              taking over from Mr Werth. Mr Ngulube joined Sanlam in February 2016 as
              CEO: Sanlam Corporate. He holds a Master of Science in Agriculture from
              the Pennsylvania State University (U.S.A.) and various industry qualifications
              achieved from business schools in South Africa, the United States,
              Singapore and France.
              Prior to joining Sanlam, Mr Ngulube was the CEO of Munich Reinsurance
              Company of Africa (MRoA). Under his leadership, the MRoA Group, which
              writes both life and non-life business in 45 countries across Africa, grew
              profitably, more than doubling its gross written premium income, to just over
              R6 billion in 2015.

        Commenting on the Executive Management changes, Sanlam Group CEO, Mr Ian
        Kirk, said: “We are grateful to Kobus for his consummate professionalism and
        diligent service to Sanlam since 1998. He has been instrumental in our growth over
        the years and has made a significant contribution to the successful implementation
        of our strategy. We look forward to continuing our relationship with him and wish
        him well in his retirement.

        “I wish to also congratulate Heinie and Junior on their appointments. I am confident
        they will continue to add value and play a key role in growing our business.”

        The Group announced that it will inform the market in due course about the
        successor to the CEO: Sanlam Corporate.

Operational Update – June 2016

Operating conditions remained challenging during the first four months of the 2016
financial year across most of the markets where the Group operates. Despite these
conditions impacting on performance in a number of areas, the Group’s diversification
across geographies, market segments and product lines enabled it to deliver an overall
solid performance for the four months ended 30 April 2016.
Economic growth in most markets remains below longer-term potential, in particular in
South Africa where only modest growth is expected for 2016. The first four months of
2016 also saw significant investment market volatility in South Africa and international
markets. Coupled with concerns around global growth prospects, these conditions
posed particular headwinds for the Group to grow new business volumes and fund-
based fee income, aggravated in South Africa by concerns of a downgrade in the
international sovereign rating to below investment grade. The Rand regained some
ground against major currencies, but was still significantly weaker on an average basis
during the first four months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Results

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the four months to 30 April 2016
are:

*       New business volumes of R74 billion, up 9% on the first four months of the 2015
        financial year.

    o Sanlam Personal Finance achieved growth of 11% in new business sales, a
      particularly satisfactory performance given the challenging operating conditions
      in South Africa. Sanlam Sky new business volumes increased by 5%, comprising
      only a marginal increase in individual life recurring premiums and strong growth
      in group life recurring premiums. The low growth in individual life business is
      largely attributable to increasing consumer pressure in this market segment and
      the realignment of the channels towards more profitable product lines. The
      Individual Life segment grew new business volumes by 3%. Single premium
      sales growth remains moderate, in line with the 2015 experience. New recurring
      premiums increased by 16%, supported by strong growth in risk business.
      Glacier achieved overall growth of 13% as demand for its offshore and wrap
      product solutions remains strong.
    o Sanlam Emerging Markets achieved overall new business growth of 53%,
      supported by a weaker average Rand exchange rate and the impact of corporate
      activity during 2015. Excluding these, new business volumes increased by some
        40%. All major businesses contributed strong growth, apart from Zambia, that
        continues to struggle in a difficult environment, and Ghana and Malawi that had a
        slow start to the year. New life business volumes increased by 42%, augmented
        by 65% and 50% growth in investment and general insurance business
        respectively.
    o   The Sanlam Investments cluster increased its new business volumes by 5%,
        with Sanlam Employee Benefits and the International businesses achieving
        particularly good growth. Group recurring premium risk business in Sanlam
        Employee Benefits remains under pressure while the South African Investment
        Management and Wealth Management business units achieved only marginal
        growth on the 2015 comparative base.
    o   Net value of new life business (“VNB”) on a consistent economic basis increased
        by 7% on the comparable period in 2015 (in line with 2015 based on actual 30
        April 2016 economic basis). VNB margins have been largely maintained on a per
        product basis. Growth in Sanlam Personal Finance’s VNB was, however,
        depressed by the inclusion of the lower margin tax free savings product in the
        Sanlam Sky business mix (the product was introduced after April 2015 and
        therefore not included in the comparative base). Sanlam Personal Finance’s
        overall VNB increased marginally as a result, with a decline at Sanlam Sky
        offsetting good growth at Individual Life and Glacier. Sanlam Emerging Markets’
        net VNB grew by 23% on a comparable economic basis with VNB trends
        generally in line with new business performance. Sanlam Employee Benefits
        reported a markedly lower contribution due to a decline in the more profitable
        Group Risk business.
    o   Overall net fund inflows of R16 billion were up from the R3 billion achieved in the
        comparable 4-month period in 2015, with most businesses contributing to the
        higher net inflows. The comparable 2015 period included the Botswana Public
        Officers Pension Fund withdrawal from Sanlam Emerging Markets and Sanlam
        Investments.
    o   Persistency levels are generally in line with the 2015 results.

*   Net result from financial services up 7% on the first four months of the 2015
    financial year.

    o All businesses contributed satisfactory growth, apart from Sanlam Investments
      where fund-based fee income was impacted by lower average market levels.
    o The Saham Finances acquisition concluded on 29 February 2016 and
      contributed to the Group’s earnings with effect from 1 March 2016.

*   Normalised headline earnings per share down 13% compared to the first four
    months of the 2015 financial year.

    o   Subdued investment returns earned on the capital portfolio relative to the first
        four months of 2015 were further negatively impacted by the strengthening in the
        Rand exchange rate since the end of December 2015, which contributed to
        negative returns from the offshore exposure in the portfolio.

*   Diluted headline earnings per share, which includes fund transfers recognised in
    respect of Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, decreased by 15%
    compared to the first four months of the 2015 financial year.

Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its Capital Adequacy Requirements 5.3 times on 31 March 2016 after
allowing for the dividend paid to Sanlam in April 2016.

The Group had excess capital of R2.3 billion available for redeployment at the end of
December 2015, after allowing for the Saham Finances and Shriram Insurance
transactions. Utilisation since then has been limited to a number of small transactions.
Including investment return earned on the portfolio and the excess dividend cover in
respect of the 2016 dividend payment, discretionary capital amounted to R3.1 billion on
30 April 2016. The available discretionary capital remains earmarked for transactions
currently under consideration.

Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the
remainder of 2016 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key operational performance
indicators. Shareholders also need to be aware of the impact of the level of interest
rates and financial market returns and volatility on the Group’s earnings and Group
Equity Value. Relative movements in these elements may have a major impact on the
growth in normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for the
six months to 30 June 2016 as well as the full 2016 financial year. Relatively strong
operating earnings and new business growth experienced subsequent to April 2015
also cause an increase in the comparable base.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Sanlam’s financial results for the six months ending 30 June
2016 are due to be released on 8 September 2016. Shareholders are advised that this

resilience that enabled us to withstand these conditions and deliver a satisfactory performance. 

The following are some of our salient features for the year:
- Return on Group Equity Value (RoGEV) per share of 12,8% (adjusted 14,8%)
- Net result from financial services per share increased by 6% 
- New business volumes increased by 16% to R211 billion
- Net fund inflows of R19 billion
- Net value of new life business (VNB) down 15% to R1,4 billion
- Net VNB margin of 2,62%
 
The Group strategy was reviewed and approved by the Board of directors of Sanlam (Board) in December 2015. This
followed a six-month process driven by the Group Executive committee who identified refinements and shifts in some of 
the underlying plans. In essence the strategy remains unchanged and focuses on two geographic approaches:
- In South Africa, the Group aims to retain and extend its leadership position in financial services. 
- Outside South Africa, the Group aims to deepen and enhance its existing relationships and product ranges to become a
  leading player in targeted territories through accelerated organic growth. This is augmented by continued focus on
  identifying further opportunities for expansion to new businesses and territories.

2015 strategic initiatives    
The five pillars of our strategy remain constant:
- Improving performance through top-line earnings growth by increasing market share in key segments and diversifying
  the base (including diversification of geographical presence, products, market segments and distribution platforms).
- Optimising operational efficiencies.
- Enhancing capital utilisation on an ongoing basis, including the allocation of capital to business units in a manner
  that will best achieve stated RoGEV targets.
- Prioritising diversification by enhancing the Group’s international positioning and growing the relative importance
  and contribution of the international business to the Group, with a specific Pan-African focus.
- Commitment to the promotion of transformation and diversity within operations and broadly through the contribution
  to socio-economic development in the countries and markets in which the Group operates, whether that be directly, or 
  via collaboration with business partners.

We continue to place a high premium on strategy execution. The specific pace of implementation of the strategy and the
quantification of performance measures are driven through the Group’s business plans and the budgets of the respective
clusters. This is influenced significantly by factors such as specific opportunities and the capabilities available
within each of the businesses.

We have made good progress in the implementation of the elements of the five-pillar strategy. Below is a brief
overview of our main achievements in 2015 against the strategic pillars.


Earnings growth
Earnings growth for Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) and Santam remained strong despite operating in mature markets.
Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM) and Sanlam Investments (SI) had more muted earnings growth, with SEM most significantly
affected by the provisioning in Shriram Equipment Finance in India and the business environment in Zambia. Low investor
confidence due to challenging macro-economic factors and major investment market volatility impaired the ability of the
investment businesses to show growth at the same levels as in the past few years.

Operating and cost efficiencies
Costs remain under control despite the need to invest in systems and capacity creation. At SPF, additional capacity
was created at Glacier and Sanlam Sky, whereas Sanlam Individual Life retained tight control on costs. SEM is making
progress with system transitions to standardise a platform among its partners. The cluster is starting to experience
efficiency benefits from centralised buying, IT support and standardised product roll-outs. 

Following a period of extensive and careful planning, Sanlam Collective Investments’ administration and IT outsourcing
to Silica went live in October 2015. All client and funds data was successfully migrated and the process of supporting
all stakeholders continues as they adjust to the new system. 

The ability to manage claims costs is critical at Santam, given the deterioration in the exchange rate and the
subsequent negative impact on prices of motor vehicle parts and paint costs. Santam’s suppliers form an integral part of the
claims management process, necessitating building a sustainable network that enables Santam to improve pricing and refine
its product offering, which ultimately attracts and retains policyholders.

Optimal capital utilisation
Group businesses are each allocated an optimal level of capital and are measured against appropriate return hurdles.
By using capital optimisation opportunities available within a Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) regulatory
environment, the Group released an additional R2,5 billion in 2015 for investment in expansion opportunities.

SPF continued to focus on the capital efficiency of its product range and especially new products, ensuring that
product pricing compensates for the underlying capital requirements. The cluster is maintaining an optimal level of capital. 

SEM continued balancing the need to achieve the hurdle rate with sensitivity towards the countries and stakeholder
expectations where the cluster operates. Excess capital is extracted via dividends as appropriate when taking these
considerations into account. Major new investments, subject to final regulatory approvals include a 30% interest in Saham
Finances and 23% additional interests in Shriram Life Insurance and Shriram General Insurance, with the Shriram insurance
transactions still being finalised.

The unwinding of Santam’s BBBEE scheme delivered a combined value of R1,1 billion to participants. The unwinding also
presented Santam with an opportunity to improve the efficiency of its capital structure by using a share buy back at
R190 per share to facilitate the unwinding. This reduced Santam’s capital base by R801 million.

Diversification
Prior to the Saham Finances transaction, the Group (through SEM) had nearly 40 operating life insurance, general
insurance and asset management businesses across 19 countries (through either a direct or an indirect presence) compared to
about 10 operating businesses five years ago. The Saham Finances transaction, which is one of the Group’s biggest
transactions yet, will provide access to new markets including Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Senegal and Cameroon in Francophone West
Africa, the Arabic-speaking North African country of Morocco and Lebanon in the Middle East, and Angola in Lusophone
Southern Africa. This will increase the number of operating businesses to more than 60.

Diversification opportunities within the Group were realised through the launch of MiWayLife to broaden SPF’s direct
offering. MiWayLife operates under the Sanlam Life licence, but is managed independently under its own brand. Santam’s
claims card is being rolled out in the Group and general insurance products have been launched in the Sanlam Life agency
network. 

SPF identified geographic areas where it is under-represented and is developing further capacity in Limpopo and the
northern parts of the country. The cluster is also improving its penetration of the middle market in Gauteng. 

Implemented Consulting, which formalises the investment implementation process through an investment committee
framework, was a key solution for SI to enable further growth and to assist with flows into the building blocks and solution
funds of the cluster.

Transformation
Ongoing transformation of the Group is driven from the centre and implemented at individual business unit level.
Accelerated transformation initiatives were identified within each cluster to ensure improvement in the demographics at
management levels. 

SI is creating a strong pipeline of black leaders through its Alternative Investment Academy, which is aimed at
setting up graduates to ultimately being able to manage their own funds. Just over 80% of the recruited employees for 2014 
and 2015 were black. 87% of SI’s employees under the age of 30 are black. They have excellent capability and potential to
develop into leaders of the business over the longer term. 

Transformation at SEM takes consideration of the emphasis in many markets on citizen empowerment and localisation of
jobs. The cluster is focusing on training and development across the whole value chain of in-country employees and
increased regional support capacity to transfer skills.

The unwinding of Santam’s BBBEE scheme delivered on its objectives of empowerment and transformation, particularly
through the community trust. The trust created value through its support of education, arts, culture, skills development
and job creation - and will continue funding transformation initiatives on a projects basis.

Comments on the results

- Introduction    
The Sanlam Group International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2015 are presented based on and in compliance with IFRS. The basis of presentation and accounting policies for the
IFRS financial statements and shareholders’ information are in all material respects consistent with those applied in the
2014 Annual Report.

- Group Equity Value    
Group Equity Value (GEV) amounted to R103,5 billion or 5 057 cents per share on 31 December 2015, exceeding R100 billion for 
the first time. Including the dividend of 225 cents per share paid during the year, a RoGEV per share of 12,8% was achieved 
for 2015. This exceeds the 2015 target of 12,1% despite the challenges faced by the Group and a significant rise in long-term 
interest rates in South Africa. Adjusted RoGEV per share, which excludes the impact of investment return earned in excess of 
the long-term assumptions, interest rate changes and other one-off effects not under management control (such as tax changes), 
amounted to 14,8% - well in excess of the target.

South African long-term interest rates increased by 200bp during 2015, with a corresponding 200bp rise in the risk
discount rate (RDR) used to value the Group’s South African businesses for GEV purposes. A discounted cash flow (DCF)
valuation basis is now used for essentially all of the Group’s operations, with the increase in RDR having a pronounced
negative effect on the end-2015 valuations and RoGEV for 2015. The diversification of the Group outside of South Africa
assisted in largely offsetting this negative impact, with the valuation and RoGEV of the Group’s international operations
benefiting from the sharp weakening in the rand exchange rate, particularly against developed market currencies and the
Indian rupee, and more stable long-term interest rates. Exchange rate gains contributed some 4% to RoGEV per share. The
strong investment market performance of 2014 also did not repeat in 2015, contributing to relatively lower RoGEV in the
2015 financial year compared to 2014. Adjusted RoGEV is a more comparable measure of the underlying operational
performance, which continues to reflect solid results.

Group operations yielded an overall return of 13,8% in 2015, the combination of 14,5% return on covered business and
12,9% on other Group operations.

The Group’s covered business operations (comprising 46% of GEV) achieved a solid performance, exceeding the Group
hurdle rate by a healthy margin despite the adverse impact of higher interest rates. The mature South African covered
business operations exceeded the 12,1% hurdle rate by 0,6% with an overall return of 12,7% (17,4% on an adjusted basis),
augmented by a return of 20% from the non-South African businesses. The latter benefited from the release of relatively
higher discount rates applied in the valuation base of these businesses and the weakening in the rand exchange rate during
2015. The main items contributing to the return are:
- Value of new covered business (VNB): A 0,9% lower return from VNB in 2015 is largely attributable to the base effect
  of the AECI policy written in 2014 and the negative change in economic basis in 2015.
- Positive operating experience variances persisted in 2015, with positive risk experience of some R800 million still
  being the largest contributor. Particularly satisfactory is positive persistency experience of R170 million, a sound
  performance in a low-growth economic environment with consumer disposable income under pressure. This is testimony to the
  success of the Group’s strategic focus on client-centricity and efforts to improve the quality of the in-force book.
  Positive working capital experience was largely offset by negative one-off expense experience due to a number of large
  regulatory and other projects currently being implemented across the Group.
- Operating assumption changes contributed slightly less to the return in 2015. A major contributor in 2015 is
  positive risk experience assumption changes of R810 million. The level of positive operating risk experience variances over a
  number of years indicates some expected continuance in these trends and required the capitalisation of a portion thereof
  in the value of in-force covered business (VIF) to align more closely to the SAM
  requirements. This was partly offset by a strengthening in one-off expense assumptions given the level of regulatory
  change currently being experienced in most operations, and a number of other modelling changes.
- The largest return variance compared to 2014 relates to economic assumption changes, turning from a positive return
  contribution of 0,2% in 2014 to negative 3,3% in 2015. This is attributable to the rise in long-term interest rates in
  South Africa, with the higher RDR only partly compensated for by an increase in the future investment return assumptions
  on the underlying asset base.
- Investment variances contributed less to the overall RoGEV due to a weaker investment market performance in 2015
  compared to 2014, partly offset by foreign exchange gains.

Capital allocated to covered business (adjusted net worth) declined from R17,2 billion at the end of 2014 to R15,1
billion at 31 December 2015, representing 32% of covered business compared to 36% at the end of 2014. The reduction is
largely due to the revised capital allocation approach applied to Sanlam Life’s covered business with effect from 2015
(refer Capital management below).

Other Group operations (comprising 43% of GEV) achieved a return of 12,9% (23,2% on an adjusted basis). The valuation
and return of the South African businesses were adversely impacted by the higher RDR, somewhat offset by good growth in
assets under management in a number of the asset management boutiques. Sanlam Investment Management, the traditional
retail and institutional asset manager in South Africa, experienced only a marginal increase in assets under management due
to large net outflows, particularly from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC).

The return on SI and SEM’s non-South African businesses was in general supported by the weakening in the rand exchange
rate. The Group’s investment in Santam is valued at its listed share price, which declined in 2015 commensurate with
other financial services stocks, resulting in a negative 8,4% RoGEV contribution from Santam.

The low return on discretionary and other capital is essentially the combined effect of the following:
- Net corporate expenses of R109 million recognised in net result from financial services.
- A relatively low level of return earned on the portfolio’s exposure to low yielding liquid assets.
- Hedging of the Saham Finances and Shriram life and general insurance transactions. The transactions were hedged
  through the acquisition of foreign currency, which earns a very low rate of interest due to the US dollar denomination. 
  The application of hedge accounting principles in the GEV presentation furthermore eliminated the foreign currency gains,
  essentially exposing the portfolio to some R5 billion of assets that earned close to zero return.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R7,3 billion increased by 6% on 2014, with solid
performances by SPF and Santam more than compensating for lower earnings at SI and SEM. Santam achieved an exceptional
underwriting performance, with its underwriting margin of 9,6% exceeding the new longer term target range of between 4% and 8%.
As indicated in the introduction, the Group faced a challenging operating environment in 2015, which together with a
number of internal one-off items had a pronounced impact on growth in net result from financial services. These items were:

- In SI, performance fees declined by 21% from 2014. A significant portion of the performance fees earned by SI in
  2014 related to funds managed on behalf of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). The cumulative withdrawal by the PIC of
  some R20 billion of funds under management in 2014 and 2015 as part of the restructuring of their portfolios, reduced
  the base on which fees can be earned, with no performance fees accruing in 2015 on the PIC funds. A relatively lower
  level of outperformance of benchmarks in 2015 compared to the 2014 financial year also resulted in lower performance fees
  being earned on collective investment schemes.

The 2014 comparative earnings of SI’s International business included one-off profit of R58 million realised on the
disposal of Intrinsic in the United Kingdom (UK).

One-off expenditure increased SI’s administration costs by R83 million after tax in 2015, including the outsourcing of
Sanlam Collective Investments’ administration platform, further leveraging off the Group’s repositioned WealthsmithsTM
branding, restructuring of the UK private wealth business and costs associated with regulatory compliance in the UK.

Sanlam Employee Benefits (SEB) wrote one of the largest insurance policies in history in South Africa during 2014 when
it concluded an R8,3 billion pensions outsourcing agreement with the AECI retirement fund. This policy generated
effective net new business strain of R138 million in 2014, with a further R14 million being recognised in the 2015 earnings in
respect of the additional premium received during the year.

Capital Management experienced abnormal marked-to-market losses of R92 million in its debt and equity-structuring
units related to commodity market conditions, entity specific issues and political events in South Africa. Credit spreads on
Eurobonds issued by African governments and South African institutions widened significantly during the year. In the
case of African government bonds it is largely attributable to unfavourable investor sentiment towards emerging markets
following the severe slump in commodity prices that is likely to have an adverse impact on many governments’ ability to
service debt. Investors’ risk perception of South African institutional debt rose sharply during 2015 from a combination
of some company specific issues such as the regulatory penalty levied against MTN in Nigeria, and general negative
investor sentiment following the changes in Finance Ministers at the end of 2015. The widening of credit spreads culminated in
marked-to-market losses in Capital Management’s debt business that has exposure to these Eurobonds. In addition,
Capital Management also incurred marked-to-market losses on financing transactions backed by commodity stocks. The share
prices of commodity companies declined sharply during 2015 in line with the slump in commodity prices, which reduced the
underlying level of security within these instruments. This had a consequential negative impact on their fair values. In the
absence of defaults, these marked-to-market losses should reverse in future reporting periods.

- SEM experienced a difficult 2015, with its Indian, Malaysian and Zambian operations underperforming against 2014 and
the target for 2015.

The Shriram Capital results in India were affected by one-off items in both the 2014 and 2015 financial years, causing
a R154 million adverse change in net result from financial services. Shriram Transport Finance Company’s subsidiary
focused on equipment financing experienced abnormal levels of arrears in 2015. The subsidiary expanded its lending book in
anticipation of the newly elected government’s infrastructure projects. Delays in the roll-out of these projects placed
a large number of clients under financial pressure, with the outstanding loan book growing outside of normal parameters
during the year. This required a significant strengthening in the provision for bad debts. The position stabilised
recently with some projects being initiated. An improvement in recoveries and the arrears position is expected during 2016.
In addition, the 2014 comparative results for Shriram Capital included a R51 million one-off release of provisions
relating to Shriram General Insurance’s third party pool book, thereby increasing the comparative base.

The Zambian economy and currency are under severe pressure from low commodity prices, in particular copper that is its
main source of income and foreign currency inflows, unplanned elections and severe flooding during the year. Despite a
number of management actions, SEM’s Zambian operations could not escape the impact of the economic environment on
consumer disposable income, resulting in significantly lower operating earnings due to lower new business sales and negative
persistency experience.

Pacific & Orient, SEM’s general insurance business in Malaysia, appointed a new statutory actuary during 2015 in line
with Malaysian regulations. The new actuary required a strengthening of the reserving basis, which reduced the 2015 net
result from financial services by R30 million. This reserve can be released in future periods should actual experience
prove to be more favourable than that assumed in the current basis.

Excluding these items, net result from financial services grew by 11%, a solid performance against the overall
challenging backdrop.

SPF achieved solid growth for a largely mature business. Sanlam Individual Life remains the largest contributor to
SPF’s operating earnings with growth in its net result from financial services of 7% in 2015. Profit from investment
products grew by 27%, benefiting from strong guaranteed product sales over the last few years that increased the book size 
of this line of business. Market-related investment products also contributed to the growth, supported by a 14% increase 
in the average level of assets under management - partly attributable to the strong investment market performance of 2014.
The profit contribution of risk products declined by 8%, with a further improvement on the exceptionally favourable
mortality experience of 2014 difficult to achieve and due to an increase in new business strain in 2015 following the
strong growth in new risk business sales. Profit released from the asset mismatch reserve held in respect of non-participating 
risk business declined by 14% in line with the lower level of this reserve during 2015. Mortality experience in the annuity 
book normalised during 2015, which together with a lower level of asset mismatch profits contributed to a decline in earnings 
from this line of business. This was offset by higher profit from other products, which include the legacy universal life book.

Sanlam Sky’s net result from financial services increased by 19%. Growth in the size of the in-force book, positive
investment variances and economic basis changes as well as improved persistency and premium variances supported the
earnings growth.

Glacier grew its profit contribution by 21% after tax. Fund-based fee income benefited from an increase in assets
under management due to strong net fund inflows and favourable investment market performance in prior years.

SEM grew its net result from financial services by a satisfactory 14% excluding the abnormal items highlighted before.

Namibia (up 10% net of tax and non-controlling interests; 16% on a gross basis) benefited from sound profit growth at
Santam Namibia and Capricorn Investment Holdings (CIH). Santam Namibia experienced a benign claims environment during
2015, similar to Santam’s South African experience. Bank Windhoek, CIH’s major investment, continued to deliver good
growth. Profit realised in 2014 in the closed fund life book from credit spread moves did not repeat in 2015, which together
with a shrinking book contributed to lower operating earnings from this business. The renegotiation of the Bank Windhoek
credit life profit share arrangement also had a negative impact on earnings growth in 2015. The variance between gross
and net growth is mostly attributable to relatively stronger growth in the businesses with non-controlling interests.

Botswana achieved good growth of 17% in its net result from financial services (22% before tax and non-controlling
interests). The life business’ results benefited from good annuity volumes and margins and an increase in the size of the
book following the strong new business performance over the last number of years. Letshego, which earns more than half of
its profit outside Botswana, experienced currency translation losses as well as a higher effective tax rate due to a
change in the various countries’ contribution to overall earnings. Its profit contribution was in line with 2014. The
general insurance business Legal Guard made a welcome recovery and turned around from a net loss in 2014 to a small net
profit in 2015. Botswana Insurance Fund Management (BIFM), the Botswana asset manager, was adversely impacted by the
withdrawal of R12,4 billion of assets under management by the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund (BPOPF). Restructuring of
the business limited the negative profit impact to some R10 million.

The Rest of Africa operations, excluding Zambia, achieved growth in net result from financial services of 17%. Most
countries and lines of business delivered strong growth. The exception was general insurance where all businesses
experienced claims pressure, apart from the Ghanaian operations.

Net result from financial services in India rose 13% excluding structural changes and the abnormal items listed
before. The credit and general insurance businesses achieved satisfactory growth, while the life insurance business continued
to invest in expanding its distribution footprint.

In Malaysia, growth in general insurance business premiums came under pressure from a combination of lower sales of
two-wheelers and increased competition. Appropriate management action has been taken, which limited the impact on
profitability to some extent. The life business also did not perform in line with expectations due to losses in the medical
portfolio, contributing to a disappointing overall performance. A new Regional Executive for Malaysia has been appointed
towards the end of the year. His focus will be on improving the performance of the individual businesses, but also
extracting synergies from the combined operations.

SI achieved overall growth of 6% in its net result from financial services excluding abnormal items.

The relatively weaker investment market performance in 2015 impacted adversely on the Investment Management
businesses’ ability to grow assets under management, aggravated by:
- Continued net outflows from the South African life book and capital portfolio. The legacy life book managed by SI is
  running off while SPF’s open architecture results in only a portion of its new business being managed by SI. Outflows
  from the older life books are therefore not replaced by new inflows, resulting in consistent net outflows of assets under
  management for SI. SI’s strategic focus remains on replacing the life outflows with third-party business and an increase 
  in the proportion of SPF open architecture business managed. A consequence of the Group’s strategic focus on capital
  efficiency has been a reduction in the capital backing the South African life business, which is managed by SI. A further
  R4 billion has been released during 2015, which will be redeployed for investment in strategic operations on which SI
  does not earn any fee income.
- The R20 billion of funds under management withdrawn by the PIC over the last two years.
- The funds withdrawn from SEM by the BPOPF during 2015 included some R3 billion of funds managed by SI’s
  International business.

Average assets under management of the South African investment manager, the largest contributor to the sub-clusters’
profit, increased by only 6% as a result. Growth of 8% in net result from financial services, excluding abnormal items,
represents a solid performance in this context.

SEB’s profit contribution grew marginally by 1% if the new business strain from the AECI policy is excluded. A
reduction in losses from the administration businesses and 32% growth at SEB investments were offset by a 7% decline in risk
profits following a normalisation in claims experience during 2015 from a particularly favourable experience in 2014.

Capital Management managed to achieve 11% growth in its net result from financial services, excluding marked-to-market
losses from widening credit spreads on Eurobonds and equity-backed financing structures.

Santam had an exceptional year, with its underwriting margin improving from an already high base of 8,7% in 2014 to
9,6% in 2015. The benign claims environment of 2014 persisted into 2015, which together with disciplined underwriting
action contributed to the 16% growth in Santam’s net result from financial services. Premium growth was less than planned
for 2015 in a competitive environment, commercial business in particular.

Normalised headline earnings of R8,9 billion are 6% up on 2014. This is the combined effect of the 6% increase in net
result from financial services, 8% growth in net investment return earned on the capital portfolio and a 43% increase in
amortisation of intangible assets. The latter is essentially due to intangible assets recognised in respect of the
acquisition of MCIS in Malaysia during 2014. Despite the relatively weaker investment market performance in 2015, net
investment surpluses earned on the capital portfolio increased by 16% due to a well-timed change in strategic asset allocation
(refer capital section below) and the international exposure in the portfolio. The change in strategic asset allocation
from unhedged to hedged equities was implemented before the decline in the South African equity market in December,
protecting the portfolio against these losses and locking in the gains made up to that stage. In addition, investment
return earned on the international exposure in the portfolio benefited from the sharp weakening of the rand exchange rate
against developed market currencies during 2015.

Business volumes    
The Group achieved overall growth of 16% in new business volumes from a high base in 2014. Excluding the R8,3 billion
AECI premium recognised in 2014, new business increased by 21%, a particularly pleasing performance in a difficult
economic environment.

Life insurance new business volumes increased by 18% (excluding the AECI policy), investment business inflows by 24%
and general insurance earned premiums by 8%. All businesses contributed to the solid performance, apart from SI’s
International business.

SPF’s new business sales grew by 21%, a stellar performance for this mature business.

Sanlam Sky, operating largely in the South African entry-level market, achieved growth of 13%. Individual life
recurring premium new business increased by 12% and Group recurring premium sales by 21%. The tax free savings product 
launched in March 2015 after changes in tax legislation proved much more popular than anticipated, with new savings business
volumes increasing by 50% on the comparable period in 2014. To some degree this came at the expense of the higher margin
risk business sales, which increased by only 4%. Some replacement sales are not unusual after the introduction of a new
product, but this was particularly pronounced at Sanlam Sky due to the non-availability of a competitive Sanlam savings
solution that intermediaries could sell in this market segment in prior years and industry-wide marketing of the new
product line that intensified client attention and demand. Sales trends started normalising towards the end of the year, 
with the mix between risk and savings products moving to more appropriate levels. Group recurring premium sales were
supported by a large new scheme written during 2015 and the biennial renewal of the ZCC scheme, which more than offset the
impact of the cancellation of the Capitec credit life agreement in 2014.

New business volumes in the Individual Life segment, which is largely focused on the middle income segment in South
Africa, increased by 3%. Single premium sales increased by 3%, reflecting pressure on disposable income, the competitive
environment and a shift in sales to the Glacier platform. Annuity and guaranteed plan sales reflected good growth, offset
by lower sales from bank brokers as these channels increasingly focused on their own in-house products. New recurring
premium sales grew by 10% with all lines of business contributing to the growth. A strong recovery in the sales of risk
business was particularly satisfactory, with this line of business growing by 17% in the second half of 2015 (flat for
the six months to 30 June 2015) to reach overall growth of 9% for the full 2015 financial year. Similar to the entry-level
market, the mix of recurring premium savings products changed towards the new tax-free savings products, although in
this market segment the tax-free savings products was favoured above existing low margin endowments.

Glacier achieved another exemplary performance in 2015, growing its new business volumes by 27%. Demand for offshore
and wrap solutions were particularly strong, driven by a weaker rand and competitive investment performance offered by
the wrap solutions respectively.

The SEM operations grew their new business contribution by 29% - new life business increased by 32%, investment
business inflows by 29% and general insurance earned premiums by 19%. The growth in life and general insurance business was to
some extent supported by acquisitions during 2014 and 2015.

New business volumes in Namibia declined by 16%, the combined result of 36% growth in new life business and a 23%
decline in unit trust inflows in a competitive environment. The strong growth in life business is largely due to an increase
in per policy premium size in the affluent market.

The Botswana operations had another sterling year with new business volumes rising by 78%. Strong annuity sales
continue to be the main driver of new life business (up 41%), augmented by a more than doubling in new investment mandates at
the asset management operations.

A 35% increase in Rest of Africa new business volumes is attributable to a twofold increase in investment business
inflows and a 94% rise in general insurance business, the latter partly due to the base effect of new acquisitions. Life
business growth disappointed at 2%. The Zambian operations struggled in difficult economic conditions, recording a 37%
decline in new business sales. The Kenyan business made progress in rebuilding its agency force after the major impact of
the system implementation issues experienced in the first half of the year. As anticipated, a major improvement in sales
volumes will only reflect in 2016 as new agent productivity improves. New life business sales for the full year declined
by 19%, with some improvement evident in the second-half performance. Excluding Zambia and Kenya, Rest of Africa new
life business volumes increased by 30%, with all regions contributing to the strong growth.

New business growth in India persisted in line with the first-half 2015 trends. New life and general insurance
business sales increased by 60% and 24% respectively, benefiting from the investments made in growing the distribution
footprint.

As indicated before, lower two-wheeler sales and competitive pressures impacted negatively on Pacific & Orient in
Malaysia. This is evident in its earned premiums that declined by 22%. The base effect of the MCIS acquisition during 2014
supported a more than doubling in Malaysian new life business sales.

The AECI policy written by SEB in 2014 had a major negative impact on the 13% overall year-on-year growth in SI’s new business
volumes. Excluding the AECI policy, new business volumes increased by 23%. All business units achieved growth in excess of
20%, apart from International where an 18% decline in inflows is largely attributable to the disposal of Intrinsic during
2014. A 57% increase in new life business at SEB (excluding AECI) is particularly satisfactory. Recurring and single
premium new business grew by 60% and 57% respectively. Another highlight for the year was the success of the SI retail
unit in yielding new inflows. By partnering with intermediaries through the Implemented Consulting initiative, the unit
attracted new inflows of more than R8 billion during 2015. Also pleasing is the significant portion of the funds that
flowed to the SI investment core, supporting strong net inflows into Sanlam Collective Investments.

The bulk of Santam’s premiums are still written in the highly competitive South African market. Earned premiums grew
by 8%, reflecting the maturity of the South African market and the current low-growth economic environment. The severe
drought experienced in large parts of the country manifested in reduced planting and commensurately lower premiums written
in the agricultural business line. MiWay, Santam’s direct insurance business, continues to make inroads and grew its
premium base by 19%.

Net fund inflows of R19,1 billion in 2015 is an acceptable performance given the large withdrawals experienced from
the PIC and BPOPF and the economic and investment market headwinds faced in the 2015 financial year.

The discount rate used to determine VNB is directly linked to long-term interest rates. The 200bp rise in the South
African five and nine-year benchmark rates during 2015 resulted in a commensurate increase in the risk discount rate and a
significant negative impact on VNB growth and margins. This was aggravated by the high base in 2014 related to the AECI
policy. VNB at actual discount rates declined by 13% (6% excluding AECI). On a comparable basis (before economic
assumption changes) VNB decreased by 2% (increased by 6% excluding AECI).

SPF achieved overall growth of 6% on a comparable basis. The significant change in business mix in Sanlam Sky to the
lower margin tax free savings products contributed to a 9% decline in Sanlam Sky’s VNB and a reduction in new business
margins from 9,51% in 2014 to 7,44% in 2015. The normalisation in business mix towards the end of the year should support
VNB growth in 2016. The strong growth in recurring premium risk business in the Individual Life segment more than
compensated for the change in mix of savings business to tax-free savings products. VNB margins improved from 2,88% to 2,97%,
driving VNB growth of 9% in this mature segment. Glacier’s VNB growth was in line with its new business performance.

VNB growth and margins at SEM were negatively impacted by the significantly lower new business production in Kenya and
Zambia, the renegotiation of the Bank Windhoek credit life profit sharing arrangement and higher long-term interest
rates in Namibia. All of the other businesses achieved strong VNB growth largely in line with their new business
performance. On a consistent economic basis, overall VNB increased by 8% to R467 million. Excluding Kenya and Zambia, VNB grew by
24% and Rest of Africa’s contribution by 35%.

SI’s VNB declined by 60%, largely due to the base effect of the AECI transaction concluded in 2014 and a lower
contribution from the International business in line with its lower new business volumes.

VNB margins were in general maintained at a product level, apart from the Namibian credit life business.

- Capital management    
Sanlam Life capital allocation approach
Under the current Financial Soundness Valuation (FSV) regime, participations or strategic investments held by a life
insurance company can be taken into account for purposes of the statutory capital available to cover its CAR. This creates
an opportunity in a diversified group to optimise its capital allocation by using trategic investments to cover a portion of
sthe capital required to meet its targeted CAR ratio, with the remainder being held in the form of a balanced portfolio 
and/or subordinated debt. This is referred to as capital diversification. In the transition to SAM, the new solvency regime,
some uncertainty existed as to whether any capital diversification would also be allowed under the SAM regime.
The Group therefore followed a prudent capital allocation approach during the development phase of the SAM specifications,
essentially capitalising each life insurance business on a standalone basis without any allowance for diversification.
The SAM specifications have largely been finalised during 2015, with the outcome that participations will be allowed 
to contribute to available capital (own funds) under SAM, both at a company (solo) and group level, with a corresponding
capital requirement (SCR). Prescribed valuation bases are applicable at a solo and group level. 
The valuation and SCR bases for participations provide some stability to the entity’s SCR cover ratio and
potentially generate surplus own funds that can be redeployed.

The improved clarity on the final SAM specifications enabled the Group to extract further capital efficiencies during
2015. This was achieved through a combination of capital diversification and a more conservative asset allocation for
the balanced portfolio backing Sanlam Life’s covered business.

For Sanlam Life, the Group’s target under the FSV basis is to ensure that its CAR cover would be at least 1,5 times
over a 10-year period, within a 95% confidence level. At the end of 2014 this translated into IFRS-based required capital
of some R14,7 billion for Sanlam Life’s covered business. Consistent with the prudent approach then followed, this
capital requirement was fully covered by subordinated debt of R2 billion and a balanced portfolio of R12,7 billion, with no
allowance for the value attributed to investments in strategic businesses. This basis of capital allocation contributed
to Sanlam Life’s high CAR cover ratio under the FSV regime, as its investment in Santam alone contributes more than 
R4 billion in available statutory capital.

The investment in Santam also provides a major diversification opportunity under SAM. The utilising of capital 
diversification was accordingly introduced at the end of 2015, initially limited to R2,5 billion. The first R2,5 billion of
Sanlam Life’s IFRS-based capital requirement will therefore be covered by Santam shares, with the remainder covered by
subordinated debt and the balanced portfolio.

In conjunction with the use of the diversification benefit, the Group also reconsidered the strategic asset allocation
of the balanced portfolio to optimise RoGEV under SAM, given that the SAM regime is particularly punitive with regards
to equity holdings. The strategic asset allocation was significantly changed as follows, taking cognisance of the
utilisation of diversification benefits:

Sanlam Life’s IFRS-based required capital amounted to R14,5 billion at the end of 2015 based on the revised capital
allocation approach, covered as follows:
- R2,5 billion by Santam shares;
- R2 billion by the subordinated debt issued by Sanlam Life; and
- R10 billion by a balanced portfolio.

The revised capital allocation approach effectively released a total of R4 billion additional discretionary capital:
- R200 million emanated from the reduction in the overall required capital from R14,7 billion to R14,5 billion.
- Given a slightly lower overall capital requirement, the investment return of R1,3 billion earned on the balanced
  portfolio during 2015 could be released to the discretionary capital portfolio.
- The reduction in the capital requirement funded by the balanced portfolio from R12,5 billion before the utilisation
  of diversification benefits to R10 billion thereafter, released a further R2,5 billion.

As indicated in the Group’s interim results announcement, a SCR target cover range of between 1,7 times and 2,1 times
has been set for Sanlam Life’s covered business. The R14,5 billion of IFRS-based required capital translated into a SCR
cover at the upper end of the target range at 31 December 2015.

From a RoGEV perspective, the lower expected return from the more conservative asset allocation is compensated for by
the lower level of capital held in the balanced portfolio. The cost of capital charge in the embedded value of covered
business therefore remained largely unchanged.

Discretionary capital    

The Group started the year with discretionary capital of R3,3 billion, which was earmarked for new growth and
expansion opportunities as well as to strengthen existing relationships. A net total of R6 billion was redeployed in the 
year, which included the following:
- R4,2 billion (excluding Santam’s contribution) allocated to the acquisition of Saham Finances, which will
  significantly expand the Group’s African footprint and general insurance diversification. The acquisition price is payable 
  in US dollars, which the Group hedged during 2015 by acquiring the foreign currency. In terms of the IFRS hedge accounting
  specifications, the investment will be recognised in 2016 at the US dollar/R14,08 exchange rate at which the foreign
  currency was acquired.
- The Group also indicated after the release of the interim results in September 2015 that it will acquire a 23%
  additional stake in the Shiram life and general insurance businesses. A total of some R970 million has been earmarked for
  this transaction, which has also been hedged during 2015 against exchange rate movements.
- R703 million was utilised for the acquisition of an effective 27% stake in Medscheme, which improves the Group’s
  healthcare proposition for clients in addition to offering a number of potential synergies. The first of these has been
  realised through the roll-out of the Reality loyalty scheme to medical aid members administered by Medscheme.
- Some R240 million was invested by SEM to enter the Mozambique and Zimbabwe markets and to increase its stakes in the
  Nigerian and Tanzanian general insurance businesses.
- As indicated in the 2014 Sanlam Annual Report, the Group extended its relationship with its empowerment partner,
  Ubuntu-Botho Investments (UB), for an additional 10 years with the aim, among others, to jointly explore mutually
  beneficial transactions. The first transaction concluded in terms of this arrangement is the transformation of Indwe Brokers
  Holdings (Indwe), a general insurance intermediary, into a black-owned company through the disposal by Santam of a 51%
  shareholding in the business to African Rainbow Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of UB. Sanlam also acquired a 25% stake 
  in Indwe for a total amount of R69 million. The transaction better positions Indwe in a highly competitive market, opens
  up new opportunities for the business and enabled the Group to further execute on the transformation pillar of its strategy.
- R46 million was received from Santam as its contribution to recent general insurance investments made in Africa.
- SI utilised R36 million for investment in its US-based asset manager and for trail payments for the acquisition of
  the Vukile property management agreement.
- SPF invested R57 million in a distribution business in the entry-level market in South Africa.
- SI established a seeding capital portfolio that will be utilised to grow some of their new products and portfolios
  while building a track record. Discretionary capital of R200 million was utilised to bolster the portfolio.
- A special dividend of R226 million was received from MCIS in Malaysia as part of its capital optimisation
  initiatives.
- R165 million was realised from the disposal of SEM’s direct stake in Nico Holdings in Malawi to Botswana Insurance
  Holdings, SEM’s subsidiary in Botswana. Not only does this transaction enhance the potential to extract synergies between
  the businesses, but it also effectively released illiquid excess capital held in the Botswana operations.

Investment return earned on the discretionary capital portfolio and the 2014 dividend cover in excess of cash
operating earnings added some R1 billion of discretionary capital. Together with the R4 billion of capital released from the
capital allocation changes in Sanlam Life, unallocated discretionary capital amounted to R2,3 billion at the end of
December 2015. We remain focused on utilising the available discretionary capital for value-accretive investment opportunities.

- Solvency    
All of the life insurance businesses within the Group were sufficiently capitalised at the end of December 2015. The
total admissible regulatory capital (including identified discretionary capital) of Sanlam Life Insurance Limited, the
holding company of the Group’s major life insurance subsidiaries, of R47,8 billion, covered its CAR 5,8 times. No 
policyholder portfolio had a negative bonus stabilisation reserve at the end of December 2015.

The Group appointed Standard & Poor’s (S&P) during 2015 to replace Fitch Ratings as the Group’s credit ratings agency
following the cancellation of Fitch Ratings’ registration as a ratings agency for regulatory purposes by the FSB. S&P
issued the following South Africa National Scale ratings at the beginning of 2016: Sanlam Limited: zaAA-; Sanlam Life
Insurance Limited: zaAAA, Subordinated debt: zaAA+. These ratings confirm the strength of the Group’s balance sheet and
operations.

- Dividend    
The Group only declares an annual dividend due to the costs involved in distributing an interim dividend to our large
shareholder base. Sustainable growth in dividend payments is an important consideration for the Board in determining the
dividend for the year. The Board uses cash operating earnings as a guideline in setting the level of the normal
dividend, subject to the Group’s liquidity and solvency requirements. The operational performance of the Group in the 2015
financial year enabled the Board to increase the normal dividend per share by 9% to 245 cents. This will maintain a cash
operating earnings cover of approximately 1,1 times. The South African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect
of this dividend. The dividend will in full be subject to the 15% withholding tax, where applicable, which will result in a
net final dividend, to those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 208,25 cents per ordinary share.
The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company’s share capital at the date of the declaration is 2 003 141 288
(excluding treasury shares of 163 330 518). The company’s tax reference number is 9536/346/84/5.

Shareholders are advised that the final gross cash dividend of 245 cents for the year ended 31 December 2015 is payable on
Monday, 11 April 2016 by way of electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at
close of business on Friday, 8 April 2016. The last date to trade to qualify for this dividend will be Friday, 
1 April 2016, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Monday, 4 April 2016.

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Monday, 4 April 2016 and Friday, 8 April 2016,
both days included.

3. Normalised earnings per share      
   In terms of IFRS, the policyholders’ fund’s investments in Sanlam shares and Group subsidiaries are not 
   reflected as equity investments in the Sanlam statement of financial position, but deducted in full from 
   equity on consolidation (in respect of Sanlam shares) or reflected at net asset value (in respect of 
   subsidiaries). The valuation of the related policy liabilities however includes the fair value of these 
   shares, resulting in a mismatch between policy liabilities and policyholder investments, with a consequential 
   impact on the Group’s earnings. The number of shares in issue must also be reduced with the treasury shares 
   held by the policyholders’ fund for the calculation of IFRS basic and diluted earnings per share. This is, in 
   management’s view, not a true representation of the earnings attributable to the Group’s shareholders, 
   specifically in instances where the share prices and/or the number of shares held by the policyholders’ fund 
   varies significantly. The Group therefore calculates normalised earnings per share to eliminate the impact of 
   investments in Sanlam shares and Group subsidiaries held by the policyholders’ fund.

3. Share repurchases  
   The Sanlam shareholders granted general authorities to the Group at the 2015 and 2014 annual general meetings 
   to repurchase Sanlam shares in the market. The Group acquired 142,000 shares at an average price of R46,85 in      
   terms of general authorities. The total consideration paid of R6,7 million was funded from existing cash resources. 
   All purchases were effected through the JSE trading system without any prior understanding or arrangement between 
   the Group and the other counterparties. Authority to repurchase 108,2 million shares, or 4,99% of Sanlam’s issued 
   share capital at the time, remain outstanding in terms of the general authority granted at the annual general 
   meeting held on 3 June 2015. The financial effect of the share repurchases during 2015 on the IFRS earnings and 
   net asset value per share is not material.

4. Contingent liabilities   
   Shareholders are referred to the contingent liabilities disclosure in the 2015 Annual Report. The circumstances
   surrounding the contingent liabilities remain materially unchanged.    

5. Subsequent events                                                                                    
   During November 2015 agreements were concluded whereby SEM and Santam will jointly acquire an effective 30% 
   interest in Saham Finances, the insurance arm of the Saham group. Saham Finances operates in 26 countries across 
   North, West and East Africa, and the Middle East. It is the largest insurer in Africa, excluding South Africa. 
   The acquisition consideration amounts to US$400 million, including transaction related costs and working capital 
   for the Group company that will hold the investment in Saham Finances. All the required regulatory approvals were 
   obtained after year-end and the transaction will be closed shortly.
   
   No other material facts or circumstances have arisen between the date of the statement of financial position and 
   this report which materially affects the financial position of the Sanlam Limited Group at 31 December 2015 as 
   reflected in these financial statements.   

6. Fair value disclosures   
   Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy   
   Below follows required disclosure of fair value measurements, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that 
   reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining the measurements. It should be noted that these 
   disclosures only cover assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
   
   Included in level 1 category are assets and liabilities that are measured by reference to unadjusted, quoted 
   prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities.
   
   Included in level 2 category are assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included 
   within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
   (i.e. derived from prices). For example, instruments measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that 
   are supported by prices from observable current market transactions are categorised as level 2. 
   
   Assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data are categorised as level 3.

Sanlam Life Insurance Limited (“Board”) and to the Sanlam Executive Management.

   1. Dr Johan van Zyl has been appointed to the Board as a non-executive director.
      Dr Van Zyl, the previous Sanlam Group Chief Executive Officer, joins the Board as
      an Ubuntu-Botho Investment Holdings (UB) nominated representative on the Board.
      His appointment is effective from 18 January 2016.

      In terms of the strategic agreement concluded between UB and Sanlam in 2014,
      UB is entitled to nominate three members to the Board.

   2. Mr Junior John Ngulube has been appointed to the position of Chief Executive
      Officer of the newly established Sanlam Corporate business cluster.

      Mr Ngulube’s appointment is effective from 01 February 2016 and he will be a
      member of the Sanlam Executive Committee. He joins Sanlam from Munich
      Reinsurance Company of Africa where he was the Chief Executive Officer of their
      sub-Saharan operations since 2007 following a career that spanned 28 years in
      various positions within the Munich Re group.

      He holds a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (Honours) from the University of
      Zimbabwe, a Master of Science in Agriculture from the Pennsylvania State

      business schools in South Africa, the United States, Singapore and France. The
       Sanlam Corporate business cluster is being formed in line with Sanlam’s
       overarching strategy to support the delivery of an enhanced and integrated solution
       to the Group’s corporate clients, both in South Africa and the rest of the African
       continent. It will collaborate and maintain strong links with the other four existing
       clusters in the Group (Sanlam Emerging Markets, Sanlam Investments, Sanlam
       Personal Finance and Santam) to ensure delivery of a seamless holistic solution to
       corporate clients and their intermediaries.

Welcoming Dr Van Zyl to the Board, Sanlam Chairman, Mr Desmond Smith said: “We are
pleased to welcome Johan back to the Board, this time in his capacity as a representative
of our partners, Ubuntu-Botho. We look forward to his contribution to the Board where we
expect that he will add considerable value.”

Commenting on Mr Ngulube’s appointment, Sanlam Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ian Kirk
said: “Junior brings a wealth of experience in financial services which he gained at one of
the largest reinsurance companies in Africa. He has great insurance expertise in South
Africa and the rest of Africa. We are confident that he is well qualified to lead the formation
of the Sanlam Corporate business cluster and to grow it into a key and formidable part of
the Group’s operations. We welcome him to Sanlam and look forward to his contribution.”

Operational Update - December 2015

Operational Update – December 2015
The Sanlam Group achieved an overall solid performance for the 10 months ended 31
October 2015, despite continued impact from the headwinds faced by the Group in the
first half of 2015. Economic conditions in the markets where the Group operates
remained challenging, with the commodity-based economies experiencing pressure on
domestic economic growth as well as currency volatility. South Africa, the Group’s
largest region, is no exception with a poor economic growth outlook for 2015 and a
marked weakening of the Rand against developed market currencies since the end of
June 2015.
The broader trends underlying the Group’s performance for the 10 months to 31
October 2015 are in line with those of the first half of 2015. The large R8.3 billion policy
written by Sanlam Employee Benefits in the third quarter of 2014 (“the SEB policy”)
affects the comparability of new business volumes, value of new life business (VNB)
and net result from financial services.

Results

The salient features of the Group’s performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2015
are:

-       New business volumes of R175 billion, up 17% on the first 10 months of the 2014
        financial year. Excluding the SEB policy, new business volumes increased by
        24%.

    o    Sanlam Personal Finance achieved growth of 22% in new business sales.
         Sanlam Sky new business volumes increased by 14%, comprising 13% growth
         in individual life recurring premiums and an 18% increase in group life recurring
         premiums. The 2015 new business sales benefited from the biennial premium
         renewal of the ZCC scheme as well as a large new voluntary scheme awarded to
         Sanlam Sky, which more than compensated for the termination of the Capitec
         credit life underwriting agreement towards the end of 2014. Excluding these
         items, new business volumes grew by 12% on a normalised basis, in line with
         the target for this business. The introduction of the tax free savings product in
         this market segment resulted in higher than expected replacement sales with a
         commensurate change in mix to the low margin savings product. The Individual
         Life segment grew new business volumes by 3%. Single premium sales growth
         remains moderate, in part due to a shift in sales to the Glacier platform. New
         recurring premiums increased by 8%, supported by good growth in risk, tax free
         savings and credit life business. Demand for Glacier’s offshore and wrap product
    solutions remains strong, contributing to 28% growth in Glacier’s new business
    contribution.
o   Sanlam Emerging Markets achieved overall new business growth of 42%. The
    Namibian operations experienced lower inflows of the more volatile unit trust
    business, which more than offset good growth in new life business. The
    Botswana operations more than doubled their new business contribution,
    supported by strong annuity and investment business volumes. All of the other
    regions (Rest of Africa, Malaysia and India) achieved growth in excess of 20%,
    despite some headwinds:
        o New business activity in Zambia remains depressed in the difficult
            operating environment with an improvement only expected during 2016.
        o The new business impact of the system implementation issues
            experienced by the Kenyan life business continues to reflect in the
            October year-to-date results.
        o Pacific & Orient, the Group’s general insurance business in Malaysia, is
            experiencing pressure on new business from a general decline in the
            sales of two-wheelers as well as increased competition. Appropriate
            management action has been implemented.
o   The Sanlam Investments cluster increased its new business volumes by 14%
    (26% excluding the SEB policy), with the South African Investment Management
    and Wealth Management businesses achieving particularly strong growth. Group
    recurring premium risk business in Sanlam Employee Benefits remains under
    pressure, similar to the first half of 2015. The International businesses also
    recorded a decline in new business inflows, partly attributable to the disposal of
    Intrinsic in 2014.
o   VNB on a consistent economic basis declined by 8% on the comparable period
    in 2014. Excluding the SEB policy, VNB increased by 1%. VNB margins have
    been maintained on a per product basis. Growth in Sanlam Personal Finance’s
    VNB was, however, depressed by the change in mix to the lower margin tax free
    savings product in both Sanlam Sky and Individual Life, as well as the strong
    growth in Sanlam Sky’s lower margin group life business. Sanlam Personal
    Finance’s overall VNB increased marginally as a result, with a decline reported
    at Sanlam Sky. Sanlam Emerging Markets’ VNB growth continues to be
    impacted by lower contributions from Namibia, Zambia and Kenya, due to the
    factors highlighted in the Group’s interim results. Sanlam Employee Benefits
    reported a markedly lower contribution due to the impact of the SEB policy
    included in the comparable base and a decline in the more profitable recurring
    premium risk business.
o   Overall net fund inflows of R11.5 billion were down from the R27,5 billion
    achieved in the comparable 10-month period in 2014, but represents a
    satisfactory performance given the large outflows experienced in 2015 from two
    institutional clients. The Public Investment Corporation withdrew R11.2 billion
    from Sanlam Investment Management while the Botswana Public Officers
    Pension Fund withdrew an overall R17.3 billion from Sanlam Emerging Markets
    and Sanlam Investments’ International business.
o   Persistency levels are generally in line with the 2015 first-half results.
-   Net result from financial services up 8% on the first 10 months of the 2014 financial
    year.

    o The same key factors that affected the Group’s 2015 first-half performance also
      reflect in the results for the 10 months to 31 October 2015.
          o Fund-based fee income benefited from a relatively higher level of assets
              under management.
          o Mortality experience in most of the major market segments remained in
              line with the first-half performance.
          o Sanlam Investments’ profitability reflects lower performance fees and
              increases in administration spend on projects and capacity building. An
              increase in emerging market credit spreads and marked-to-market losses
              on equity-backed financing structures in the current volatile equity market
              environment had a negative effect on Sanlam Capital Markets’
              performance since the end of June 2015.
          o In Sanlam Emerging Markets, the Zambian and Indian businesses
              reported a decline in profits compared to the same period in 2014, with
              additional provisions being raised since the end of June 2015 in respect of
              the arrears position in the Shriram Transport Finance equipment finance
              book. Overall growth in operating earnings for the cluster remained
              broadly in line with the first-half performance.
    o Santam experienced a particularly favourable claims environment in the four
      months to 31 October 2015.

-   Normalised headline earnings per share up by 12% compared to the first 10 months
    of the 2014 financial year.

    o   Investment return earned on the capital portfolio benefited from the major
        weakening in the Rand exchange rate since the end of June 2015, which
        supported the performance of the offshore exposure in the portfolio.

-   Diluted headline earnings per share, which includes fund transfers recognised in
    respect of Sanlam shares held in policyholder portfolios, increased by 16%
    compared to the first 10 months of the 2014 financial year.

Capital

All of the Group operations remain well capitalised. Sanlam Life Insurance’s statutory
capital covered its Capital Adequacy Requirements 5 times on 30 September 2015.

The Group had excess capital of R4.6 billion available for redeployment at the end of
June 2015. Utilisation since then has been limited to a number of small transactions.
Including investment return earned on the portfolio and the release of some illiquid
capital, discretionary capital amounted to R4.8 billion on 31 October 2015. As indicated
before, a major portion of the available discretionary capital has been earmarked for
transactions in the process of completion.
The Group followed a prudent approach in the allocation of capital to its operations in
anticipation of the implementation of Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) in
South Africa. With increased certainty regarding the final outcome of the SAM regime,
the Group is identifying opportunities to improve the efficiency of capital allocation.
Being a diverse Group, one of the opportunities is to cover part of the life operations’
capital requirement with the investments held in other Group operations. This is referred
to as internal capital diversification that creates some additional capacity for strategic
investments. Combined with the existing discretionary capital pool, this will enable the
Group to cover the funding requirements of all the recently announced transactions,
including the proposed acquisition of an interest in the Saham Finances Group, from
internal resources. An update on the Group’s capital position will be provided in the
2015 annual results announcement in March 2016.

Outlook

We expect that the economic and operating environment will remain challenging for the
remainder of 2015 with a resulting impact on the Group’s key operational performance
indicators. Shareholders also need to be aware of the impact of the level of interest
rates and financial market returns and volatility on the Group’s earnings and Group
Equity Value. Relative movements in these elements may have a major impact on the
growth in normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for the
financial year ending 31 December 2015. Relatively strong operating earnings and new
business growth experienced in the latter part of 2014 also cause an increase in the
comparable base.

The 2015 financial year has been particularly challenging to date with a number of
headwinds contributing to lower than expected performance in a number of key metrics.
These are short-term pressures and we remain confident that the Group’s strategy is
appropriate to deliver on our longer term growth targets.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by
Sanlam's external auditors. Sanlam’s financial results for the year ending 31 December
2015 are due to be released on 10 March 2016. Shareholders are advised that this is
not a trading statement as per paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements.
