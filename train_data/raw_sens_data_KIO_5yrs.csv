Kumba’s commitment to safety, health and sustainability creates shared value for its stakeholders

Following the annual publication of its sustainability report, Kumba is today presenting its sustainability performance
for the first time. Themba Mkhwanazi, Kumba’s Chief Executive, said: ""Sustainability is at the heart of who we are at
Kumba and core to what we do. We recognise that a sustainability mindset, including our non-negotiable commitment
to safety and health, makes us better at our business of producing high quality iron ore. It makes us more resilient,
agile and efficient. There are many highlights, but I am proud that for the fourth year in a row, we have achieved zero
fatalities and have had no major environmental incidents.

""We continue to embed sustainable mining practices into our operations through our Sustainable Mining Plan which
is aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We launched the plan in 2018 and it is built on three
key pillars, aligned with E, S and G:

    -   E: Healthy environment – recognising that biodiversity, energy and water all lie within our stewardship;
    -   S: Thriving communities – building communities with better health, education and levels of employment; and
    -   G: Trusted corporate leader - developing trust, providing ethical value chains and improved accountability.

""Our commitment to sustainability is underpinned by our board structure and governance framework, where
sustainability is represented by a number of internal and external engagement forums, including our Social, Ethics
and Transformation Committee. Furthermore, our executive’s long-term incentives map directly to Kumba
sustainability performance through six metrics namely:

    -   total recordable case frequency rate;
    -   level 3 to 5 environmental incidents;
    -   PM10 dust control;
    -   financial provision provided for rehabilitation and mine closure;
    -   attributable free cash flow; and
    -   attributable return on capital employed

""Kumba has adopted the Anglo American Social Way, a best practice integrated social performance management
system which defines our social performance standard s and governing framework. This guides our approach to
community engagement and development as well as cultural heritage, all of which are essential to our social license
to operate and innovate. The Social Way was leveraged to develop Kumba’s Covid-19 WeCare Community response
plans, providing much needed support for our host communities. This year, for example, we spent R2.4 billion with
more than 300 businesses in our host communities, directly and positively impacting the lives of well over 16 000
people.""

Climate change is one of the biggest environmental challenges facing the world. Kumba’s environmental management
efforts are focused on moving the business towards operating carbon neutral and less water intensive mines.

    -   Kumba has a critical role to play in the transition to a low carbon world, both by becoming carbon neutral at
        our operations and by providing high-quality iron ore that allows customers to reduce their carbon emissions
        in the process of steel production.
    -   We are targeting a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 30% improvement in energy intensity
        against our 2016 baseline by 2030. Together with the broader Anglo American group, we are developing
        solar renewable energy generation and investigating green hydrogen as a renewable energy source for
        mining activities.
    -   Kumba revised its water strategy during 2020 and we are targeting a more than 14% reduction in water usage
        by 2025. Water efficiency projects such as the reduction of water usage in dust suppression are being
        implemented.
    -   Kumba’s integrated approach to managing social and climate change risks, recognises the importance of
        cross-disciplinary collaboration for effective risk management through integrated water, energy and carbon
        management.

""To successfully deliver on our purpose to re-imagine mining to improve people's lives, we need to change the way
we mine. We need to earn our social license to innovate. Our FutureSmart Mining(TM) approach which includes our
Sustainable Mining Plan, is focused on technology, digitisation and sustainability working to ensure safer, more
efficient and precise mining with an optimised footprint.

""We are continually improving our business model using new technology and strategies that create a safer, greener
and sustainably profitable business. This provides more control over our destiny such that we can meet all of our
sustainability commitments and create value f or all of our stakeholders.""

Safety and health
Kumba continues to prioritise the health, safety and well-being of our workforce and our communities. In these
challenging times, our fatality free record of over four years is testament to our safety culture. This is underpinned by
critical control risk monitoring, risk reduction initiatives and our elimination of fatalities programme.
Our WeCare Covid-19 response programme and protocols are embedded across the operations and have become
part of our day-to-day procedures. We continue to provide essential services, including water, food parcels and
emergency medical support while contributing to the livelihoods and health of our host communities.

Mining and production
We continue to focus on balancing our value chain thereby ensuring that iron ore deliveries meet market demand.
Kumba delivered a solid mining performance for the period. While total waste stripping of 58.8Mt is 16% below the
69.6Mt achieved in Q3 2019 (“the comparative period”), it is ahead of both the first and the Covid-19 impacted second
quarter of this year of 50.1Mt and 44.5Mt, respectively. Overall, steady progress continues to be made with our
scheduled maintenance programme, and equipment performance has improved as a result.

Waste stripping for the period at Sishen increased by 37% to 42.9Mt (Q2 2020: 31.3Mt), driven by primary equipment
availability and a steady increase in direct operating hours. At Kolomela, waste stripping increased by 20% to 15.9
Mt (Q2 2020: 13.2Mt) following the optimisation of hauling routes, resulting in improved truck utilisation.

Production is managed carefully in conjunction with finished stock levels to optimise our value chain. Taking into
account the higher levels of finished stock in Q2 2020 due to Covid-19 related logistical constraints, and the annual
rail and port maintenance taking place in Q4 2020, we drew down on stock levels during the period. Total finished
stock reduced by 0.9Mt to 5.3Mt from 6.2Mt at 30 June 2020. Total production decreased by 1Mt or 9% to 9.5Mt
(Q3 2019: 10.5Mt) and increased by 12% relative to Q2 2020.

Logistics, sales and the market environment
The successful outcome of Covid-19 measures and initiatives to increase workforce capacity at Transnet resulted in
the iron ore export channel haulage rates returning to pre-Covid levels. Consequently, there was a significant
improvement in throughput at Saldanha Port.

Export sales increased by 13% to 10.9Mt (Q3 2019: 9.7Mt) and by 35% relative to Q2 2020. In line with expectations,
there was no off-take from ArcelorMittal South Africa during the period.

China’s strong economic rebound continued to support a favourable iron ore market, with the Platts 62 index CFR
price averaging US$119/dmt for the period. This compares, against US$101/dmt for the year-to-date (“YTD”). Kumba
achieved an average realised FOB export iron ore price of US$117/dmt for the period (2020 YTD: US$103/dmt),
benefiting from the recovery in markets outside of China and a lump:fine ratio of 71:29 (2020 YTD: 67:33). The product
quality averaged 64.2% Fe for the period (2020 YTD: 64.3%).

Full year 2020 guidance
Kumba is on track to meet its full year 2020 guidance announced at our interim results presentation on 28 July 2020.
Our guidance takes into account Transnet’s annual maintenance during October and is as follows:

•   Total sales of 38 - 40 Mt
•   Total production of 37 - 39 Mt
    - Sishen: ~27 Mt
    - Kolomela: ~11 Mt
•   Waste:
    - Sishen: 145 - 160 Mt
    - Kolomela: 45 - 55 Mt

Production and sales volumes referred to for the period are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited
(“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as to the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current beliefs and
expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are
estimates and have not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

Kumba approves Kapstevel South project at Kolomela

Kumba is pleased to announce the approval of its Kapstevel South project at its Kolomela mine by both the Company
and Anglo American’s boards.

The total capital cost of the project will be approximately R7 billion, including pre-stripping. It is anticipated that the
addition of the Kapstevel South pit will deliver an after-tax internal rate of return of ~25% and allow Kolomela to
maintain an estimated EBITDA margin of >35% in the long-term.

The project entails the development of a new pit, Kapstevel South and associated infrastructure at Kolomela. The pit
is a conventional truck and shovel operation producing high quality direct shipping ore (DSO). Whilst the pit is included
in the current life of mine, it contributes significantly to sustaining production of ~13Mt for the remaining life of mine.
Pit establishment and waste stripping will commence this year with first ore expected in 2024.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “The approval of this project, at a time when the global and South African
economies face the challenges of Covid-19, underscores Kumba’s positive longer-term outlook for demand for its
high-quality product. It also demonstrates our commitment to extend the lives of our mines and continue providing
much-needed jobs and livelihoods in the Northern Cape region.”

The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are estimates and the financial information
has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

HIGHLIGHTS
- Four years of fatality-free production
- R13 billion of shared value created
- Average realised FOB price of US$93/tonne                
- Protected EBITDA margin of 55%               
- ROCE of 84%                
- Net cash of R15.7 billion 
- Interim cash dividend of R19.60 per share

OVERVIEW  
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba said: ""Kumba adapted its business quickly and comprehensively to meet the
human, operational and market challenges of the likely enduring reality of Covid-19. The Company delivered a strong
performance in the first half of the year, with EBITDA of R17.4 billion at a margin of 55%. We are a resilient and capital
efficient business with a robust balance sheet, well positioned to navigate the current environment and the longer term. 

The safety and health of our employees and contractors has always been our first priority. We have now marked four
years of being fatality free. In these unprecedented times it is even more critical to safeguard both lives and livelihoods
and support the ecosystem in which we operate. We have implemented an extensive WeCare programme across four pillars of
physical health, mental health, living with dignity, and community response that supports our workforce, communities
and suppliers. In practice, this programme includes screening and testing, workforce education and communication, mental
health support, contingency plans to ensure social distancing at work and to allow for periods of self-isolation, as well 
as remote working. We are contributing to our local communities by providing essential services such as water, healthcare, 
and medical services in partnership with the Provincial Department of Health and the local municipalities. With the support
of our host communities, unions and government and the safe practices of our people, we have been able to reopen and
ramp up production safely.

Kumba's production of 17.9 Mt and sales of 18.6 Mt were in line with our Covid-19 adjusted guidance for the first half 
of the year, following continued improvements as we returned to pre-Covid-19 run-rates in June. Our strong EBITDA
performance translated into R7.1 billion of attributable free cash flow. Taking into account our strong earnings, the
resilience required for our new operating conditions, and need for a robust balance sheet, the Board declared an interim
cash dividend of R19.60 per share, representing a payout ratio of 75% of headline earnings.

We remain committed to our strategic imperatives of margin enhancement and life extension which are key to our
sustainability. Our margin continued to benefit from constructive market prices and currency weakness, as well as the 
early and decisive action taken to protect our margin through additional cash preservation measures including delivering 
R700 million in cost savings for the year to date.

Kumba has been through challenging times before and we know how to respond. Our approach to navigating the pandemic is
based on ensuring the resilience of our business, living our values of care and respect, and fulfilling our purpose to
re-imagine mining to improve people's lives. We are building on our strategy to further strengthen our business and
ensure that we remain agile, resilient and able to meet the challenges that we face.""

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Kumba's operational performance for the period reflects the lockdown and subsequent reopening of operations in Q2 2020
with reduced workforce levels of approximately 50%, before ramping up production to pre-Covid-19 run-rates in June.
Consequently, total tonnes mined for the period decreased by 15% to 117.6 Mt (H1 2019: 138.0 Mt), with total waste 
reducing by 17% to 94.6 Mt (H1 2019: 113.8 Mt).

Both production and sales are closely managed in line with Transnet's logistical capacity, which increased to
approximately 80% in June 2020. As a result, total production was 11% lower at 17.9 Mt, relative to the 20.1 Mt delivered 
in the same period in 2019 with the impact of the pandemic most evident in the second quarter as volumes decreased by 20%. 

Total sales volumes declined by 13% to 18.6 Mt (H1 2019: 21.4 Mt), driven by lower domestic offtake by ArcelorMittal
SA of 0.4 Mt (H1 2019: 1.5 Mt), while export sales volumes decreased by 8% to 18.3 Mt (H1 2019: 19.9 Mt) due to
logistical constraints and severe coastal weather conditions impacting ship loading at Saldanha port.

REVENUE AND EBITDA
Total revenue decreased by 8% to R31.6 billion (H1 2019: R34.5 billion), mainly as a result of lower prices and sales
volumes, partially offset by a weaker exchange rate.

Kumba's average realised iron ore export price decreased by 14% to US$93/tonne (H1 2019: US$108/tonne), while the
average Rand/US$ exchange rate weakened by 17% to R16.67/US$1 (H1 2019: R14.20/US$1). Sales volumes reduced by 13% to 
18.6 Mt (H1 2019: 21.4 Mt) due to lower exports of 1.6 Mt and lower domestic sales of 1.1 Mt. Shipping revenue increased 
by R569 million, benefitting from a weaker currency and higher volumes, partly offset by lower freight rates. 

EBITDA of R17.4 billion reflects a decrease of 14% compared with R20.1 billion in H1 2019. Currency gains from a
weaker exchange rate and reduced operating expenses provided support. However, this was offset by the lower average 
realised FOB price of US$93/tonne (H1 2019: US$108/tonne), the 2.7 Mt impact of lower sales volumes and inflation-led 
cost escalation. 

In line with this, Kumba's EBITDA margin decreased to 55% (H1 2019: 58%), with the mining operating margin declining to
53% (H1 2019: 56%), excluding a net freight loss incurred on shipping operations. 

CASH FLOW
Kumba ended the period with a net cash position of R15.7 billion (H1 2019: R18.4 billion). Cash flow generated from
operations was R15.0 billion (H1 2019: R19.2 billion), underpinned by EBITDA of R17.4 billion, while working capital
increased due to finished stock increasing to 6.2 Mt (FY 2019: 4.5 Mt).

INTERIM CASH DIVIDEND DECLARED
Attributable and headline earnings per share were R26.21 and R26.19 (H1 2019: R31.39 and R31.51), respectively. In
line with Kumba's capital allocation framework and dividend policy, which targets a payout range of between 50% and 
75% of headline earnings, the Board has declared an interim cash dividend of R19.60 representing 75% of headline 
earnings.

OUTLOOK
Safety, health and wellbeing will continue to be our first priority. We are committed to improving on our four-year
fatality-free track record through various initiatives to continue embedding safety behaviour and culture. The Covid-19
response measures implemented are being integrated into the way we operate and do business, and we will continue to
support our communities, business partners, suppliers and customers as part of our commitment to improving lives and
livelihoods.

The extent of the impact of Covid-19 on Kumba's operational and financial performance, including our full-year 2020
guidance, will depend on many factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and related restrictions, 
all of which are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. The implications for our export markets are still unfolding.
Although we are encouraged by China's recovery and the reopening of the European economies, we remain alert to the 
possibility of further risks developing, including a second wave of infection.

The Company's full-year 2020 guidance was revised together with our Covid-19 business response update. To date,
operational performance has been in line with expectations and our guidance is as follows:
- Total sales of 38 Mt to 40 Mt
- Total production of 37 Mt to 39 Mt
  - Sishen: ~26 Mt
  - Kolomela: ~12 Mt
- Waste:
  - Sishen: 145 Mt to 160 Mt
  - Kolomela: 45 Mt to 55 Mt

Kumba's unit costs were reviewed to take into account the Covid-19 adjusted production volume guidance and cost
savings target. Sishen's unit costs are expected to increase to between R385/tonne and R395/tonne, while Kolomela's unit 
costs remain between R280/tonne and R290/tonne with cost pressures from mining inflation and managing the Covid-19 impact
expected to continue. 

Since implementing our savings programme in 2018, we have saved R2.6 billion, and have effectively achieved our 2022
savings target two years ahead of time. With this in mind, and knowing we need to step up our rate of saving if we are 
to offset mining inflation, we are aiming to deliver a further R400 million of savings in the second half of 2020,
bringing the total for 2020 to R1.1 billion.

Our longer-term cost-saving targets are under review. In light of the uncertain and fluid environment in which we are
currently operating, we are monitoring developments and considering the potential risks and opportunities under various
scenarios ranging from the environment deteriorating further to positioning for recovery should conditions improve. Once
we have more certainty, we will provide an update on our longer-term cost-saving targets. 

Our capital expenditure guidance of between R5.6 billion to R6.1 billion for 2020 includes the deferral of R1.0
billion of non-critical capital expenditure to 2021.

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded: ""Our competitive products, flexible value chain and geographically diverse customer
portfolio base ensure that we are in a position of strength. These unprecedented times further highlight the importance 
of maintaining our cost discipline, talented workforce and the ability to adapt quickly to a fast-evolving environment 
with care and respect for all of our stakeholders. We delivered a solid first half performance with R17.4 billion of 
EBITDA and R7.1 billion in attributable free cash flow. Our robust balance sheet and capital discipline provide us with 
the financial flexibility to allocate capital where it is needed most in our business during this time of uncertainty, while
delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.""

Kumba production and sales report, and trading statement, for the six months ended 30 June 2020

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “Kumba's first priority is the safety and health of our employees
and contractors. It is therefore with heartfelt gratitude that in May this year, we marked four years of fatality-free
operations, underlining our sustained commitment to improving safety across all our operations.

""We have been responding to the Covid-19 pandemic with the same focus and rigour. Our comprehensive ""WeCare""
lives and livelihoods response programme is aimed at safeguarding the physical and mental health, wellbeing and
safety of our people at work and at home, as well as that of our local communities. As part of this focus, Kumba has
implemented extensive measures to combat the spread of the virus in the workplace and in our host communities.
These measures include the implementation of extensive health screening measures, our own testing facilities,
securing isolation and quarantine facilities for employees and their families, and appointing additional medical support
staff in the Northern Cape region.

""Business continuity is our next priority to safeguard the livelihoods of all those who rely on our business across our
value chain. While our operational performance reflects the impact of the lockdown and subsequent re-opening with
a reduced proportion of our workforce, we successfully ramped up to close to full capacity in June 2020. Our focus is
on maintaining flexibility and performance along our value chain to protect run-rates and capture the benefits of
healthy demand for our quality products”.

Kumba’s operational performance for the period reflects lower workforce levels in Q2 2020 as guided by the South
African government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Having shut down operations in response to the lockdown,
Kumba re-opened its operations on 27 March 2020 following approval from the Department of Mineral Resources and
Energy to operate at c.50% of workforce levels. With opencast mines permitted to return in phases to 100% of
operations from 1 May 2020, Kumba commenced with the ramp-up to 100% in June 2020.

The safety and health of our employees and contractors has always been our first priority and in the current
environment this is even more critical as we work to safeguard both lives and livelihoods. Covid-19 measures include
screening, testing and quarantine procedures, as well as business contingency plans which have been implemented
across our value chain. These measures support efforts to manage infection rates and to date, operating activities
have not been impacted.

In line with these operating conditions and significantly reduced workforce levels, waste stripping for the period
declined by 17% to 68 Mt (1H 2019: 82.8 Mt) at Sishen and by 15% to 26 Mt (1H 2019: 30.9 Mt) at Kolomela.

Both production and sales are being closely managed in line with Transnet's logistical capacity, which increased to
c.80% in June 2020 after also re-opening at c.50% of workforce capacity. Kumba, along with industry peers, and
Transnet, are working together to ensure optimal use of the rail network and port. At the same time, initiatives are
underway to increase workforce levels, including the provision of training support.

Total production decreased by 11% to 17.9 Mt (1H 2019: 20.1 Mt), with the impact of the pandemic most evident in
Q2 2020 resulting in production falling by 20% to 8.5 Mt (Q2 2019: 10.5 Mt). Total sales decreased by 13% to 18.6
Mt (1H 2019: 21.4Mt) which includes a 76% drop in domestic off-take to 0.4 Mt (1H 2019: 1.5 Mt), while export sales
decreased by 8% to 18.3 Mt (H1 2019: 19.9 Mt), as an increase in severe coastal weather conditions during the period
hampered shipment rates.

Maintaining flexibility across the value chain, from mine to port, remains a key focus area for the Company. The
benefit of having flexibility was demonstrated by our ability to draw down 0.2 Mt of finished stock to 6.2 Mt during the
period (31 December 2019: 6.4 Mt; 30 June 2019: 4.5 Mt), with 2.4 Mt available for shipping at Saldanha Port.

Buoyant iron ore prices, translated into an average realised FOB export iron ore price of US$93/tonne (1H 2019:
US$108/tonne). Lump to fine ratio was 65:35 (1H 2019: 68:32) and product quality was adjusted during the period to
meet market demand resulting in an average Fe quality of 64.4% (H1 2019: 64.3% Fe).

Full year 2020 guidance
Kumba's full year 2020 guidance was revised on 23 April 2020 together with our Covid-19 business response update.
Our ramp up in run-rates are on track and revised guidance remain unchanged.

    •   Total sales of 38 - 40 Mt
    •   Total production of 37 - 39 Mt
            – Sishen: ~27 Mt
            – Kolomela: ~11 Mt
    •   Waste:
            – Sishen: 145 - 160 Mt
            – Kolomela: 45 - 55 Mt

Trading statement for the six months ended 30 June 2020

Kumba is finalising its interim financial results. In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, shareholders are advised that headline earnings for the period are likely to be between R8,137 million
and R8,557 million, a decrease of between 15% and 19% from the previous six months ended 30 June 2019
(""comparative period""). Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are likely to be between R25.37 and R26.68, a decrease
of between 15% and 19% from the comparative period. Reported headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative
period (released on SENS on 23 July 2019) were R10,095 million and R31.51.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to be between R8,146 million and R8,566 million, a decrease of between
15% and 19% from the comparative period. Basic earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be between R25.40 and
R 26.71, a decrease of between 15% and 19%. Reported basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were
R10,058 million and R31.39, respectively.

The decrease in earnings for the period is largely attributable to lower total sales volumes and lower average realised
FOB export prices, partially offset by the weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, relative to the comparative period.
Further information will be provided in the Company’s results for the period, which will be released on SENS on or
about 28 July 2020.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current beliefs and
expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are
estimates and the financial information on which the trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company's external auditors.

Production and sales volumes referred to for the period are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited
(“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as to the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present and future
business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause
Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market
prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities,
the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing
equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the
impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit,
the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of
competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health,
environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Kumba operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Kumba’s most recent Integrated Report.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future.
Important factors that could cause Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual
production during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral
resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities,
the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and
processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of
transport infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and
operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and
economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by
governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental
or other types of regulation in the countries where Kumba operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Kumba’s most recent Integrated Report.

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “The safety and health of our people and all those
who interact with our business are our first priority. We are fully committed to supporting our country’s
efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and have implemented appropriate measures. These include
scaling down our operations to ensure social distancing, issuing personal protective gear and providing
rigorous health screening and management, along with the implementation of our COVID-19 Community
Response Plans which includes continuous supply of essential services to our local communities.

Our 2020 production¹ and sales¹ guidance has been updated to 37-39Mt and 38-40Mt, respectively to
reflect the anticipated impact of the 35-day lockdown. As a measure of prudence in the face of broad-
based economic uncertainty across the world’s markets, we are targeting a cost saving² of R325 million
and deferral on non-critical capital expenditure of R1.0 billion to build upon our robust financial position.
These cash preservation measures add to our liquidity position which remains at levels similar to that at
the end of 2019.”

Overview:
-   Kumba has been fatality free since May 2016 and continues to improve its safety and health
    performance by ensuring that its leading indicators are within required parameters.
-   Total sales of 10.5Mt were 3% below Q1 2019, driven by a 51% lower domestic offtake.
-   Total production decreased by 1% to 9.4Mt compared to Q1 2019, due to lower output at
    Kolomela.
-   Total finished stock decreased to 5.5Mt from 6.4Mt at 31 December 2019.

to the winding down of Saldanha Steel by ArcelorMittal SA, while export sales increased by 1% to
10.2Mt. Relative to Q4 2019, export sales decreased by 3% due to lockdown related logistical
constraints at Saldanha Port.

During the period, Kumba’s mining operations were disrupted by unfavourable weather conditions
resulting in safety-related stoppages, planned maintenance on the key shovel fleet at Sishen and
reliability issues with the truck fleet at Kolomela. Waste stripping at Sishen reduced by 9% to 37.1Mt
(Q1 2019: 40.9Mt) and only increased by 2% to 13Mt (Q1 2019: 12.8Mt) at Kolomela.

From a plant perspective, approximately 7 days of production were lost due to the lockdown. Total
production decreased by 1% to 9.4Mt compared to Q1 2019, and by 20% relative to the high base in
Q4 2019.

With total sales ahead of total production, finished stock was drawn down resulting in total finished stock
levels reducing to 5.5Mt from 6.4Mt as at 31 December 2019.

Update on response to COVID-19

Operational update
On Friday, 27 March 2020, following the announcement of the initial 21-day nationwide lockdown,
Kumba announced that it had been granted approval by the Department of Mineral Resources and
Energy to continue production with a c50% level of workforce. The approval was premised on the
Company implementing appropriate safety and health measures in line with South African government
requirements, continuing with the provision of essential services to local communities and protecting the
integrity of assets. Kumba’s full year 2020 production³ guidance (provided in the Company’s 2019
annual results presentation on Tuesday, 18 February 2020) was also updated based on a 21-day
lockdown period.

On Thursday, 9 April 2020, the President of the Republic of South Africa announced the extension of the
21-day nationwide lockdown by a further 14 days until Thursday, 30 April 2020. Our operations are
continuing safely at the workforce levels approved by the Department of Minerals Resources and Energy
with the support of our key suppliers and service providers ensuring that we continue to supply to our
customers. Appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees are in place and
remain a priority. Kumba continues to provide a wide range of essential services in its host communities,
while also responding directly with additional support to help alleviate the health and economic effects
of COVID-19.

Supporting our employees, host communities and suppliers
In response to the call by our President to contribute to supporting the national fight against the spread
of COVID-19, the Kumba Board has resolved to donate the equivalent of a third of their personal
directors’ fees or salaries for the next quarter towards COVID-19 relief initiatives while the Executive
team has selected to contribute to the employee matching scheme supported by the Anglo American
Foundation.

We have implemented an extensive health awareness and support programme called “WeCare”,
specifically to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and full-time contractors as well as our
host communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this programme, we are helping colleagues
better understand how to protect themselves and others from the virus, monitoring their health to pick
up early symptoms, and to manage their health should they test positive for COVID-19. For example, all
operational colleagues are self-monitoring for any symptoms through temperature checks, prior to,
during and after their shift, that trigger medical assistance being reported.

Kumba has been providing food parcels, water, emergency services, support to health facilities and
social development programmes. In addition, we have collaborated with the Provincial Health
Department to increase access to healthcare services for our community members by enabling more
effective screening through scanners and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing machines which
can be used remotely to test and release results in 24 hours. We have established testing centres
through the Ulysses Gogi Modise Wellness (UGM) Clinic and Tsantsabane Hospital, as well as
quarantine and isolation centres within our host communities.

Kumba is supporting our suppliers through its supplier response plan which delivers a range of support
including reviewing payment terms, facilitating early settlement of invoices for small businesses as far
as possible and assisting in directing small business owners for help from Government and other NGO
assistance programs.

Proactive response programme
Kumba’s capital discipline and balance sheet strength ensures that the Company is resilient and
appropriately positioned to respond to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. As at 31 March 2020,
Kumba’s liquidity position, comprised of cash and undrawn committed facilities, remained similar to that
at 31 December 2019, reflecting the benefit from the weaker currency and a constructive iron ore market.

The situation is highly dynamic and there remains significant uncertainty about the national measures
required to control COVID-19 and the human and economic consequences of those actions. Kumba
has therefore planned a range of escalating measures to ensure that the business withstands additional
macro-economic volatility, while safeguarding long term stakeholder interests. Our first phase of
response targets an additional 2020 cost saving² of R325 million and deferral on non-critical capital
expenditure of R1.0 billion.

In our response programme, preserving business continuity and asset integrity remains a priority. Cost
saving measures currently being implemented include restrictions on all discretionary spending,
reductions in central overheads, demobilisation of non-critical contractors and deferral of certain
exploration and evaluation activities.

All capital deferrals have been carefully considered to ensure long-term asset value is protected. As a
result, the Sishen UHDMS and Kapstevel South feasibility studies remain on track for completion during
H2 2020.

2020 guidance update
Taking all the above into account, the impact of the known disruptions on the previously issued 2020
guidance is summarised as follows:

Footnotes
1. Operational guidance is based on the current 35-day lockdown with production expected to progressively increase through May and June.
2. Cost savings exclude R960 million that continues to be targeted for 2020 as part of our margin enhancement strategy as well as decreased variable costs
   in line with lower levels of operational activity.
3. The total production guidance was updated on 27 March 2020. Based on a 21-day lockdown and c.50% level of workforce, the impact on production was
   expected to be 2-3Mt resulting in the guidance being revised to 38.5-40.5Mt

Production and sales volumes referred to for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 are 100% of Sishen Iron
Ore Company Proprietary Limited (“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the
non-controlling interests in SIOC.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current
beliefs and expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this
announcement are estimates and have not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external
auditors.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present and
future business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future. Important
factors that could cause Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from
those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any
period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and
development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global
pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing equipment,
the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the

Kumba updates response to South Africa’s COVID-19 measures

Kumba is providing an update on how it is responding operationally to the fast-evolving global impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic.

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “Kumba’s priorities are the safety, health and wellbeing of
our people and all those who interact with our business around the world. We also have a clear responsibility to
protect the integrity of our business and assets so that we are ready to restart and ramp up any affected operations
safely and as quickly as possible once permitted to do so. This approach will enable us to minimise any interruption
of supply to our customers and support what will be a vital economic recovery phase for South Africa.”

Kumba notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on Monday, 23 March 2020 in
relation to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, that took effect at midnight on Thursday, 26 March 2020 until Thursday,
16 April 2020, in order to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.

Kumba has consulted with the government authorities and industry bodies in South Africa to determine and agree
the appropriate measures to be taken across its operations and business activities. Such measures are to protect
people’s safety and health, the continuing provision of essential services to local communities, the security and
integrity of the assets, the supply of essential raw materials to customers, and the ability to return operations to
normal levels of activity as swiftly as possible once the lockdown restrictions are eased, in support of the country’s
broader economic interests.

In line with South African government requirements, Kumba has started to implement all appropriate measures
across its operations, with a focus on de-densification of the workforce and rigorous health screening and isolation
where needed. During the lockdown period, Kumba will continue with a c.50% level of workforce and the rail and
port logistics infrastructure to support the export of iron ore is expected to continue to service the operations.
Kumba will also continue to provide a number of essential services, including security; mine maintenance; tailings
facility safety management; water treatment; community water supply; accommodation provision; health, safety
and emergency response; and critical head office services.

Themba Mkhwanazi added: “Our operations play a vital role in many of our host communities, including in terms
of jobs and the provision of a number of essential community services, including access to water, health care and
emergency medical services. We are wholly committed to supporting the country’s effort to combat COVID-19,
including continuity of such services, and will continue to work with government and across the industry to provide
all possible support.”

Guidance update:
Shareholders are advised that scaling down operations will impact the company’s 2020 production guidance of
between 41.5Mt and 42.5Mt, as announced in the 2019 Annual Results presentation on Tuesday, 18 February
2020. Based on the 21-day lockdown period and allowing for a safe ramp-up of operations thereafter, we expect
a 2020 production volume impact of between 2 and 3Mt (based on the c.50% reduction in the workforce).

Kumba will provide additional guidance in its scheduled 1Q 2020 Production and Sales Report on Thursday, 23
April 2020.

EXTRACTS FROM THE PROVISIONAL AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 
AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION

HIGHLIGHTS
- Fatality free since May 2016
- Attributable free cash flow of R17.1 billion
- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 83%
- EBITDA margin improved from 45% to 52%
- Operating efficiency up from 65% of benchmark to 68%
- Final cash dividend of R15.99 per share 

OVERVIEW 
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba, said, ""Kumba's strategy has helped deliver exceptional earnings growth, as
we continue to increase the resilience of the business. Against challenging operational conditions, we marked another
year of strong financial performance with EBITDA up by 62% to R33.4 billion. Our financial performance reflects the
benefits of higher iron ore prices, improved efficiencies and further cost savings ahead of our target, which have 
cushioned the impact of the operational challenges experienced during the period. These results were also achieved 
through a relentless focus on safety as we maintained our fatality free track record since May 2016. Our commitment 
to responsible production, aimed at unlocking value from our world-class assets, has in turn allowed us to help build 
thriving communities and improve people's lives.

Kumba's EBITDA margin increased to 52% and cash flow from operations is up by 79% to R34.7 billion. Kumba's strong
performance and robust balance sheet, resulted in the Board declaring a final cash dividend of R15.99 per share. 
Combined with the interim dividend of R30.79 per share, this represents a total payout ratio of 92% of headline 
earnings per share for 2019, in excess of our 50% to 75% dividend payout policy. In total we have created value of  
R19.8 billion for shareholders and our empowerment partners this year.

Since embarking on our margin enhancement strategy, Kumba's return on capital employed has improved from 49% in 2018
to 83% in 2019, reflecting favourable markets and the continued success of our value over volume strategy. We are 
focused on optimising the value of our assets, generating strong cash flows and further improving returns. Kumba has
transformed into a more capital efficient and resilient business, providing greater stability for our employees, 
contractors and the communities around us, as well as delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.""

FINAL CASH DIVIDEND
Our capital allocation framework seeks to ensure that the business generates sufficient cash flow after sustaining
capital before prioritising shareholder returns. This is done while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to protect 
the business from market volatility as well as ensuring that appropriate levels of capital are allocated to life 
extension projects. The Board has declared a final cash dividend of R15.99 per share, and combined with the interim 
dividend of R30.79 per share, this amounts to a total dividend of R46.78 per share (2018: R30.24) for the year. This 
equates to a 92% payout ratio of headline earnings for 2019.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Total tonnes mined increased 2% to 297.9 Mt (2018: 292.5 Mt) with mining activity improving in the second half of the
year following challenges with primary equipment reliability in the first six months of the year. This, combined with
plant maintenance, impacted production volumes which decreased by 2% to 42.4 Mt (2018: 43.1 Mt). The average
lump to fine ratio was broadly maintained at 67:33 (2018: 68:32) and the average quality at 64.2% Fe (2018: 64.5% Fe).

At a mine level, Sishen's production was similar to 2018 at 29.2 Mt with waste stripping down 0.5% to 181.1 Mt (2018:
182 Mt). At Kolomela, production decreased by 5% to 13.2 Mt (2018: 13.9 Mt) owing to the maintenance of the DMS plant
and waste stripping was increased to 63.2 Mt (2018: 56.0 Mt).

Total sales volumes decreased to 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt), driven by lower domestic sales of 2.2 Mt (2018: 3.3 Mt),
while export sales were maintained at 40.0 Mt. Due to lower domestic sales and refurbishment of the ship loader at 
Saldanha Port, finished stock increased to 6.4 Mt (2018: 5.3 Mt). 

REVENUE AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (EBITDA)
Total revenue increased by 41% to R64.3 billion compared to R45.7 billion for 2018, mainly as a result of stronger
prices, higher market premiums and currency gains, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the lower
domestic offtake. Kumba's average realised iron ore export price increased by 35% to US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne), 
while the average Rand/US$ exchange rate weakened by 9% to R14.45/US$1 (2018: R13.24/US$1). Sales volumes reduced by 
2% to 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt). Shipping revenue increased by R938 million benefiting from a weaker currency and 
higher volumes.

EBITDA of R33.4 billion reflected an increase of 62% compared to R20.6 billion in 2018. Growth was driven by a 
35% strengthening of the average realised FOB prices of US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne) and currency gains of 9% from 
a weaker Rand/US$ exchange rate. Cost savings of R920 million and market premia of R646 million went a long way towards
mitigating higher mining and logistics costs, as well as the 2% decline in sales volumes.

Kumba's EBITDA margin increased to 52% (2018: 45%). Kumba delivered strong financial results with net profit up 69% to 
R21.3 billion (2018: R12.6 billion) and headline earnings increasing by 69% to R16.3 billion (2018: R9.7 billion). 
Attributable and headline earnings per share for the year were R50.72 and R50.88 (2018: R30.08 and R30.28), respectively.

CASH FLOW
Kumba ended the year with a net cash position of R12.3 billion (2018: R11.7 billion) net of lease liabilities. Cash flow 
generated from operations increased by 84% to R34.7 billion (2018: R18.9 billion) due to higher EBITDA and lower working 
capital requirements.

OUTLOOK FOR 2020
Kumba's production guidance for 2020 is 41.5 Mt to 42.5 Mt, with Sishen producing ~29 Mt of product and mining 
170 Mt to 180 Mt of waste at a stripping ratio of 4.4, with the average LoM stripping ratio remaining at ~3.4. 
Kolomela's production guidance is ~13 Mt and waste stripping at 55 Mt to 60 Mt with the stripping ratio expected 
to average 4 in 2020 and the LoM average stripping ratio of 3.8.

Total sales guidance is between 42 Mt and 43 Mt, including 1 Mt of domestic sales. 

Unit costs for Sishen and Kolomela are projected to be between R355/tonne to R370/tonne and R280/tonne to 
R290/tonne, respectively. 

Capital expenditure, including deferred stripping costs, is expected to be in the range of R6.6 billion to 
R7.1 billion. 

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded: ""With supportive demand fundamentals for our high quality products, we are focused on
delivering our safe production targets to continue capitalising on this opportunity. We are focused on improving operational
equipment reliability and productivity, building on the strong financial performance in 2019. Underpinned by our strong
balance sheet and capital discipline, we have a solid foundation for achieving our 2020 targets.""

Production and sales report for the fourth quarter and year ended 31 December 2019
Kumba CEO, Themba Mkhwanazi, said ""Kumba delivered a solid operational performance with total production of
42.4Mt and total sales of 42.2 Mt. This in line with the full-year guidance of 42-43Mt and 41.5-42.5Mt, respectively.""
Production and sales volumes referred to are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (""SIOC""),
and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Strong safety and sustainability focus, marking over three and a half years of fatality-free operations.
- Total sales for 2019 of 42.2Mt (2019 guidance: 41.5-42.5Mt) were 2% below 2018 as a result of lower off-take
  from ArcelorMittal SA due to a decision to wind down operations at its Saldanha Steel plant. Export sales for
  the year were flat at 40Mt, with an 8% quarter-on-quarter increase in Q4 2019 offsetting lower domestic sales.
- Total production of 42.4Mt for the year (2019 guidance: 42-43 Mt) decreased by 2%, primarily due to the
  temporary closure of Kolomela's dense media separation (DMS) plant for an infrastructure upgrade. For Q4
  2019, production increased by 12% to 11.8Mt, driven by improved performance at Sishen and the restarting
  of the Kolomela DMS plant as scheduled.
- Total finished stock of 6.4Mt with 2.2Mt at Saldanha Port, ensures that Kumba is well positioned for Q1
  2020.

Total sales of 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt) decreased by 2%, driven by a 34% decline in domestic sales to 2.2Mt (2018:
3.3Mt) due to lower off-take by ArcelorMittal SA. Export sales volumes for 2019 were similar to 2018 at 40.0Mt.
Although rail performance improved significantly, shipments were hampered by single loading due to the
scheduled refurbishment of the second ship loader by Transnet. However, relative to Q3 2019, export sales
increased by 8.0% to 10.5Mt (Q3 2019: 9.7Mt), partially offsetting lower domestic sales. Compared to Q4 2018,
export sales decreased by 2% (Q4 2018: 10.7 Mt).
Total finished stock increased to 6.4Mt (Q4 2018: 5.3 Mt) as a result of lower domestic sales and the scheduled
port refurbishment. With 2.2Mt of stock at Saldanha Port, Kumba is well positioned for the first quarter of 2020.

Total production of 42.4Mt (2018: 43Mt) for the year reduced by 2% due to the temporary closure of Kolomela's
(DMS) plant for infrastructure upgrade from the first quarter of the year. Good progress was made in Q4 2019 with
production increasing by 12% to 11.8Mt compared to 10.5Mt in Q3 2019, and by 16% relative to 10.2Mt in Q4
2018. This reflects continued improvements in operational performance at Sishen following unscheduled
maintenance on the DMS plant in Q3 2019, as well as the ramp-up in production at Kolomela with the re-opening
of the DMS plant in Q4 2019 as scheduled.

Kumba's continuous drive towards new levels of P101 benchmark operational efficiency resulted in Sishen's waste
stripping increasing by 11% to 45.3Mt for the quarter (Q4 2018: 50.7Mt), with Kolomela's waste stripping remaining
relatively flat at 14Mt.

Kumba realised an average FOB iron ore export price of US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne) for the year, on the
back of an average lump ratio of 67% and the average Fe quality of 64.2% Fe.

Trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2019
Kumba is currently finalising its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period""), which will
be released on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 18 February 2020.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, shareholders are advised that
headline earnings for the period are likely to be between R15,680 million and R16,826 million. Headline earnings
per share (HEPS) are likely to be between R48.93 and R52.47, an increase of between 62% and 73% from the
previous year ended 31 December 2018 (""comparative period""). Reported headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period (released on SENS on 19 February 2019) were R9,677 million and R30.28, respectively.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to be between R15,636 million and R16,776 million. Basic earnings
per share (EPS) are expected to be between R48.79 and R52.34, an increase of between 62% and 74%. Reported
basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R9,615 million and R30.08 respectively.

The increase in earnings for the period is largely attributable to the higher average realised FOB export ore price
and a weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, relative to the comparative period. Further information will be
provided in the company's results for the period to be released on SENS on 18 February 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company's external auditors.

2019 Total Sales Guidance Update
Shareholders are referred to ArcelorMittal SA Limited's (""AMSA"") announcement on 11
November 2019, titled: Conclusion of the first phase of the strategic asset footprint review and
further information on the company's section 189 process."" In particular, the statement that:
""Following due deliberation and consideration, the decision has been made to undertake an
orderly and commercial wind-down of steel operations at Saldanha Works (""Saldanha""),
ultimately placing the operation on care and maintenance.""

Following AMSA's decision to wind down its steel operations at Saldanha, Kumba has reduced
the 2019 total sales guidance to 41.5-42.5Mt from 42-43Mt. The production guidance for the full
year 2019 is unchanged at 42-43Mt.

Kumba will continue to assess the effect of AMSA's strategic asset footprint review on domestic
sales and will update the market in due course. Importantly, export sales contribute 94%
towards the company's total sales and Kumba's high-quality iron ore products are well-
positioned in global markets with ongoing customer demand and a stable export order book.

Anglo American Bulks Seminar and Site Visit
Shareholders are further advised that Anglo American plc (""Anglo American"") is this week
hosting an analyst and investor visit to Queensland, Australia to provide a detailed update on
Anglo American's Bulks businesses. The update will cover Anglo American's world-class
steelmaking ingredient businesses of Kumba Iron Ore, Minas-Rio, and the Metallurgical Coal
operations in Australia, as well as its nickel and export thermal coal operations.                                              

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: ""Kumba is on an exciting journey of transformation
to create value through quality and efficiency. We are unlocking value from our world class
assets, by leveraging our capabilities and technologies to ensure that Kumba provides
sustainable returns through the cycle.""

Kumba's presentation includes production guidance for 2019-2022 and unit cost guidance for
2019-2020, as well as the long-term potential, as shown below. The guidance for 2020 onwards
does not include the impact of the above-mentioned announcement from AMSA.

Kumba Iron Ore Limited production and sales report for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019

Kumba's first priority is the safety of its employees and the company continues its focus on further improving its safety
and sustainability performance. Production is on track to meet the full year 2019 guidance of 42-43Mt, while lower
domestic sales volumes has resulted in the reduction of the total sales guidance to 42-43Mt from 43-44Mt. Production
and sales volumes referred to in this report are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (""SIOC""), and
attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Kumba has operated for more than three years without a fatality and continues its focus on further improving its
  safety and sustainability performance.
- Total sales volumes decreased by 3% to 10.2Mt, compared to Q3 2018, following a 36% decline in domestic off-
  take, while export sales were flat.
- Total production volumes of 10.5Mt were similar to Q3 2018 with increased production at Sishen offset by lower
  production at Kolomela due to the DMS upgrade.
- Lower domestic sales volumes resulted in the reduction of total sales guidance for the full year to 42-43Mt from
  43-44Mt.

Total sales decreased by 3% to 10.2Mt (Q3 2018: 10.5Mt) driven by domestic sales declining by 36% to 0.5Mt (Q3
2018: 0.8Mt) due to lower off-take from ArcelorMittal South Africa, while export sales were flat at 9.7Mt. Total finished
stock increased to 5.1Mt from 4.5Mt at 30 June 2019, as a result of the scheduled refurbishment of the second ship
loader at Saldanha Port.

Total production volumes were similar to Q3 2018 at 10.5Mt with the 2% increase in Sishen to 7.2Mt (Q3 2018: 7Mt)
offset by lower volumes from Kolomela of 3.4Mt (Q3 2019: 3.5Mt). Relative to Q2 2019, production at Sishen
decreased by 2% due to unscheduled maintenance of the dense media separation (DMS) plant. However, this was
largely mitigated by a 7% increase in production from the JIG plant.

Kolomela's production decreased to 3.4Mt (Q3 2019: 3.5Mt), as expected, reflecting the impact of the infrastructure
upgrade on the DMS plant, which is scheduled to reopen in the fourth quarter. Compared to Q2 2019, Kolomela's
production increased by 4% following the step-up in performance of the direct shipping ore plant.

Waste stripping at Sishen increased by 18% to 53Mt (Q3 2018: 44.8Mt) and at Kolomela by 7% to 16.6Mt (Q3 2018:
16Mt), demonstrating progress on improving operating equipment efficiency.

Full year 2019 guidance
Total production remains on track to meet the full year guidance as announced in Kumba's 2019 interim results on 23
July 2019. Lower domestic sales volumes have resulted in the reduction of the total sales guidance to 42-43Mt from
43-44Mt. The 2019 full year guidance is as follows:

-   Total production of 42-43Mt:
    - Sishen: 29-30Mt
    - Kolomela: ~13Mt
-   Waste:
    - Sishen: 170-180Mt
    - Kolomela: 55-57Mt
-   Total sales of 42-43Mt

- Fatality free since May 2016    
- EBITDA margin up 22 percentage points to 58%
- Strong balance sheet with net cash of R18.8 billion
- Average realised export price up 57% to US$108/tonne
- Headline earnings up 239% to R10.1 billion or R31.51 per share
- Interim cash dividend of R30.79 per share

OVERVIEW 
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba Iron Ore, said, ""Kumba delivered an exceptional financial performance 
in the first half of 2019 by focusing on safe, responsible and efficient production, while achieving optimal 
value for our premium quality products. Most importantly, we marked three years of fatality-free mining by combining 
local excellence and global expertise to transform productivity and safety at Sishen and Kolomela.

Our ""value over volume"" strategy has met customer demand and delivered a more than threefold increase in EBITDA 
to R20.1 billion. With a very strong opening cash position and attributable free cash flow of R12.7 billion, 
the Board has declared an interim cash dividend of R9.9 billion or R30.79 per share. This represents a payout 
ratio of 98% of headline earnings, above our target range of 50% to 75% of headline earnings.

By integrating our sales and operational strategy, we achieved a 57% increase in our average realised FOB 
iron ore price. This reflects the strengthening of iron ore prices and quality premia, as well as the marketing 
and beneficiating capability of our team, which ensured that our premium product portfolio remains competitive 
and that we continue to create customer value.

We are progressing at a pace towards our margin enhancement target of US$10/tonne. Our operational efficiency 
increased to 67%, which, together with our focus on cost optimisation, delivered savings of R460 million, 
underpinning our EBITDA margin of 58% and our break-even price of US$32/tonne.

Operationally, Kumba experienced a challenging first half which saw production volumes decreasing by 11% to 20.1 Mt
largely due to unscheduled plant maintenance in Q1 2019. We have made good progress in Q2 2019 with production 
increasing by 12% to 10.5 Mt from the first quarter. We remain cautious and production guidance for the year was 
revised down to 42 Mt to 43 Mt. Pleasingly, our logistical performance has improved significantly, supporting 
growth in export sales of 2% and our full year sales guidance which remains at 43 Mt to 44 Mt.

For the second half of the year we aim to improve our safety performance, increase production volumes and 
deliver on our full year R700 million cost-savings target while continuing to achieve optimal market premia. 
Our strategy to extend the life of our mines to over 20 years remains on track, thus providing a more sustainable 
future for our communities which depend on us. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable 
shareholder returns, together with our flexible and resilient balance sheet, ensures that we remain well-positioned 
to deliver sustainable returns.""

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Kumba experienced operational challenges in the first half, largely due to unscheduled maintenance. Total tonnes mined
decreased marginally by 2% to 138 Mt (H1 2018: 140.4 Mt), while total production volumes reduced by 11% to 20.1 Mt 
(1H1 2018: 22.5 Mt). Good progress was made in Q2 2019, with production increasing by 12% to 10.5 Mt from the first 
quarter.

Sishen's tonnes mined and production volumes decreased to 99.6 Mt (H1 2018: 105.1 Mt) and 13.8 Mt (H1 2018: 15.3 Mt),
respectively with waste movement at 82.8 Mt (H1 2018: 86.6 Mt). At Kolomela, mining productivity continued to improve as
demonstrated by the increase in total tonnes mined by 9% to 38.4 Mt, (H1 2018: 35.3 Mt), with waste stripping up 17% as 
planned to 30.9 Mt (H1 2018: 26.4 Mt). Total production decreased by 12% to 6.3 Mt (H1 2018: 7.2 Mt) due to the 
infrastructure upgrade of the dense media separation plant.

Significant improvement in the logistical performance contributed to the 2% growth in export sales to 19.9 Mt 
(H1 2018: 19.5 Mt). Total sales volumes increased marginally to 21.4 Mt (H1 2018: 21.2 Mt).
 
REVENUE AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (EBITDA)
Total revenue increased by 77% to R34.5 billion (H1 2018: R19.5 billion), largely driven by a 57% increase in the
average realised FOB iron ore price to US$108 tonne (H1 2018: US$69/tonne) and the Rand weakening by 16% on average against
the US Dollar (H1 2019: R14.20/US$1 compared to H1 2018: R12.30/US$1), while total sales volumes were broadly flat at 21.4 Mt
(H1 2018: 21.2 Mt).

Unit cash costs at Sishen mine increased by 20% to R370/tonne (FY 2018: R290/tonne), largely attributable to
lower production volumes and the utilisation of high-grade work-in-progress (WIP) stock. Kolomela mine incurred unit 
cash costs of R255/tonne (FY 2018: R249/tonne) as cost savings helped to partially offset cost escalation and lower
production volumes. Kumba achieved an average cash break-even price of US$32/tonne (62%Fe CFR China), an improvement of
US$14/tonne compared to the first half of 2018.

EBITDA of R20.1 billion (H1 2018: R7 billion) reflects an increase of 189% driven by a 35% gain through higher market
premia and increased sales, a 46% higher average Platts62 iron ore price and a 16% weaker currency. This
increase was partly offset by higher operating expenses resulting from an increase in royalties, inflation and a net 
freight loss incurred on shipping operations. Overall, the EBITDA margin improved to 58% (H1 2018: 36%).

Kumba achieved a net profit of R13.2 billion (H1 2018: R3.9 billion).

CASH FLOW
Cash flow generated from operations increased to R19.2 billion (H1 2018: R6.9 billion) which resulted in the group ending
the period with a net cash position of R18.8 billion (H1 2018: R11.7 billion; H2 2018: R11.7 billion) after allowing for
capital expenditure of R2.2 billion and the final 2018 cash dividend payment of R6.6 billion.

INTERIM CASH DIVIDEND DECLARED
In line with our capital allocation framework, the Board has declared an interim cash dividend per share of R30.79.

OUTLOOK
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on the momentum gained in the first six months of the year. Kumba's strategic
objectives are clear - we are targeting a US$10/tonne margin enhancement and a 20-year life of asset. This will allow
us to maximise value and shareholder returns while maintaining financial discipline.

To date in 2019, we have extended our fatality-free safety performance track record, delivered strong financial results 
and will be paying R13 billion of cash to our shareholders in dividends. Our aim in the second half, is to further improve 
on our safety performance, increase production volumes and deliver on our cost-savings target of R700 million, in addition to
continuing to achieve maximum market premia.

We are working hard to further progress our resource development plan and the feasibility study on our UHDMS technology, 
which will add to the life of Sishen mine is 80% complete. At Kolomela, we are unlocking the 85 Mt of resources under 
study and drilling activities are on schedule.

Due to the operational challenges experienced over the first few months of the year, our full year total production
guidance has been revised to 42 Mt to 43 Mt from 43 Mt to 44 Mt. Full year guidance for sales remained constant at 43 Mt
to 44 Mt as we continue to optimise our integrated sales and operations planning. Sishen's production guidance has been
revised to between 29 Mt and 30 Mt, while waste guidance remains unchanged at 170 Mt to 180 Mt. Due to the infrastructure 
upgrade of the DMS plant, we have revised Kolomela's production guidance to ~13 Mt, while waste guidance of 55 Mt to 60 Mt 
was maintained as previously guided.

In line with the revised production guidance at Sishen, the full year unit cash cost guidance of the mine was
increased to between R325/tonne and R335/tonne. Kolomela's unit cash cost guidance was revised down to between 
R255/tonne and R265/tonne.

Our capital expenditure for 2019, including deferred stripping, was revised slightly higher to R4.9 billion to 
R5.1 billion, from the previous range of R4.6 billion to R4.8 billion, due to an increase in deferred stripping 
and capital spares aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of our primary equipment and production plants.

Kumba Production and Sales Report, and Trading Statement for the six months ended 30 June 2019

Production and Sales Report for the six months ended 30 June 2019
Kumba's first priority is the safety of its employees and we are now fatality-free for more than three years. In the six
months ended 30 June 2019 (""the period""), Kumba has focused on safe, responsible production, while achieving optimal
value for our high quality products. Throughout this report, production and sales volumes referred to are 100% of Sishen
Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (""SIOC"") and are attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the non-
controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Kumba marked three years of fatality free operations, demonstrating our commitment to safety.
- Export sales increased by 2% to 19.9 Mt, reflecting improved rail performance, partly offset by poor weather
  conditions and repairs to a stacker reclaimer in Q2 2019 which resulted in a 4.0% decrease relative to Q1 2019.
- Total production decreased by 11.0% to 20.1 Mt due to plant maintenance, however, demonstrating an increase in
  Q2 2019 relative to Q1 2019 by 11% to 10.5 Mt as plant performance improved.

Kumba's total sales for the first half increased by 1.0% to 21.3 Mt (H1 2018: 21.2Mt), with export sales increasing 2.0%
by 19.9 Mt (H1 2018: 19.5 Mt). This reflects an improvement in rail performance, allowing us to meet sustained
demand for our premium quality products. In Q2 2019, however, shipments were hampered by severe weather
disruptions and repairs to a stacker reclaimer at Saldanha port, resulting in export sales decreasing by 4.0% to 9.8 Mt
in Q2 2019, relative to 10.1 Mt in Q1 2019.

Operationally, total production decreased by 11.0% to 20.1 Mt (Q2 2018: 22.4 Mt), however, good progress was
achieved with production increasing by 9.0% in Q2 2019 to 10.5 Mt relative to Q1 2019. This was largely driven by
Sishen's production improving by 13.0% from 6.4 Mt in Q1 2019. At Kolomela, production decreased by 12% to 6.3 Mt
(H1 2018: 7.2 Mt) due to extended maintenance of the dense media separation plant.

Kumba continued to focus on its value over volume strategy in line with the strong demand for high quality iron ore.
The average lump to fine ratio was maintained at 68:32 and the average Fe quality of the product portfolio was stable
at 64.3% Fe (H1 2018: 64.5% Fe). These factors contributed to the higher average realised FOB export iron ore price
of US$108/tonne (1H 2018: US$69/tonne).

Kumba delivered a solid performance from its mining activities. Although waste stripping at Sishen decreased, as
planned, by 4% to 82.8 Mt (H1 2018: 86.6 Mt), the primary mining equipment performed well in Q2 2019 with increased
levels of availability. Full year waste stripping guidance is unchanged at 170-180 Mt. At Kolomela, productivity
continued to improve, demonstrated by the haul truck direct operating hours increasing on average from 14 to above
18 hours owing to reduced cycle times. Waste stripping increased by 17% to 30.9 Mt (H1 2018: 26.4 Mt) with the full
year guidance maintained at 55-60 Mt.

Given the unscheduled plant maintenance in the first half of the year, production guidance for 2019 is revised to 42-43
Mt, from 43-44 Mt. The full year sales guidance is unchanged at 43-44 Mt, as sales volumes will be supplemented from
finished stock which is at a healthy level of 4.5 Mt (30 June 2018: 6.2 Mt).


Updated Trading statement for the six months ended 30 June 2019
Kumba is currently finalising its results for the period, which will be released on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
News Service (""SENS"") on 23 July 2019.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, and further to the trading statement
released on SENS on 14 May 2019 in which the company indicated that headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") and
basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period would be at least 160% higher than the previous six months ended 30
June 2018 (""the comparative period""); shareholders are advised that headline earnings for the period are likely to be
between R9,779 million and R10,284 million. HEPS are likely to be between R30.52 and R32.10, an increase of
between 228% and 245%. Reported headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period (released on SENS on 24
July 2018) were R2,977 million and R9.31, respectively.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to be between R9,743 million and R10,246 million. Basic EPS are expected
to be between R30.41 and R31.98, an increase of between 230% and 247%. Reported basic earnings and EPS for the
comparative period were R2,943 million and R9.21, respectively.

The increase in earnings for the period is largely attributable to the higher average realised FOB export iron ore prices
and a weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate relative to the comparative period. More information will be provided in the
company's results for the period to be released on SENS on 23 July 2019.

The financial information, on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by the
company's external auditors.

Kumba Iron Ore Limited - Details on tailings storage facilities

Kumba has today published on its website the details of the four tailings storage facilities (TSFs) that it
manages, as requested by the Church of England Pensions Board and the Swedish Council on Ethics
for the AP Funds, representing 96 institutional investors.

Themba Mkwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba, said: ""We have confidence in the integrity of the four
tailings storage facilities that Kumba manages in South Africa's Northern Cape province which are subject
to the highest global safety and stewardship standards and are operated in accordance with the South
African Mandatory Code of Practice on Mine Residue deposits as stipulated by the Department of Mineral
Resources. These tailings storage facilities are also subject to Anglo American's Mineral Residue
Facilities and Water Management Structures standard. Anglo American's mandatory Group Technical
Standard was completely revised and updated in early 2014 and continues to be reviewed regularly. This
standard goes beyond regulatory and other industry requirements in all host jurisdictions. As an industry,
there is a clear ethical and moral imperative to do everything possible to ensure that tailings facilities are
managed to the highest standards of safety, using appropriate advanced technologies, and to work
together to build greater levels of trust with all our stakeholders.""

The four TSFs that Kumba manages are located at its two operating mines in the province of the Northern
Cape, South Africa. Of the four TSFs, one is an active facility, constructed as a water retaining structure,
at Kolomela Mine, while three are located at Sishen Mine using the upstream method of construction, of
which only one is active. Upstream tailings dams are generally considered to be an appropriate design
for facilities in dry and seismically stable regions with flat topography, including the locations of the TSFs
managed by Kumba in South Africa. Kumba does not have an ownership interest in any other TSFs.

Anglo American's Group Technical Standard, which applies to all TSFs managed by Kumba, sets
minimum requirements for design criteria, monitoring, inspection and surveillance, and was peer-
reviewed by international specialists. In line with that standard, all TSFs managed by Kumba have a
Competent Person in charge and an externally appointed Engineer of Record, providing continuous
technical management from initial design and construction, to monitoring and support. A dedicated team
of engineering specialists at Anglo American provides strategic direction and technical assurance.

Anglo American's Group Technical Standard and other materials relating to TSFs are available at
www.kumba.co.za/tsf.

Trading statement for the six months ending 30 June 2019

Kumba's interim results for the six months ending 30 June 2019 (""the period"") will be released on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 23 July 2019.

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements (""the Listings Requirements""), companies are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied that there is a reasonable degree of certainty that the
financial results for the next period to be reported on, are expected to differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding reporting period, released on SENS on 24 July 2018 (""the comparative period"").

Relative to the comparative period, Kumba is expected to deliver a stronger financial performance, underpinned
by higher average iron ore export prices and a weaker average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. Headline
earnings and basic earnings for the period are expected to increase by at least R4,763 million and R4,708
million (at least 160%), respectively, from the comparative period. Headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") and
earnings per share (""EPS"") are expected to increase by at least R14.90 and R14.73 (at least 160%),
respectively, from the comparative period.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the comparative period were R2,977 million and R2,943
million, while reported HEPS and EPS for the comparative period were R9.31 and R9.21, respectively.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company's external auditors. Kumba's interim results for the period may be further affected by actual
trading conditions in the remainder of the period.

A further trading statement will be released as soon as the Company has reasonable certainty on the expected
HEPS and EPS ranges for the period as required by the Listings Requirements.

Total sales volumes of 10.9Mt were broadly flat relative to Q1 2018 with export sales growth of 2% to 10.1Mt
partially offset by lower domestic sales. Relative to Q4 2018, export sales decreased by 6% due to lower opening
stock levels at Saldanha Port at the beginning of the year, following the derailments and bridge incident in 2018.

Kumba's total plant production volumes decreased by 12% to 9.5Mt compared to Q1 2018. The was driven by
unscheduled plant maintenance at Sishen and stoppage of the dense media separation plant at Kolomela to
perform a critical infrastructure upgrade. Production at Sishen decreased by 12% to 6.4Mt and at Kolomela by
13% to 3.1Mt. With rail logistics performing in line with plan, this resulted in a drawdown of excess finished stock
levels at the mines and total finished stock reducing to 4.2Mt from 5.3Mt as at 31 December 2018.

From a mining perspective, waste stripping at Sishen was 3% lower at 40.9Mt (Q1 2018: 42.2Mt) due to a marginal
reduction in shovel availability. While at Kolomela, longer haul distances led to a 5% decrease in waste stripping
to 12.8Mt. Improving mine to plan practices and operating equipment performance are key priorities as we
progress towards new levels of benchmark operating performance.

Guidance
Logistical performance improved during the quarter, reflecting the progress made by the joint steering committee
and the benefits of working more closely with Transnet. This progress was one of the key factors underpinning
the maintenance of the 2019 full year guidance announced in Kumba's 2018 annual results on 19 February
2019. The 2019 guidance is unchanged, as follows:

- Total sales of 43-44Mt
- Total production of 43-44Mt
  - Sishen ~30Mt
  - Kolomela 13-14Mt
- Waste
  - Sishen 170-180Mt
  - Kolomela 55-60Mt

DELIVERING ON OUR STRATEGY AND CREATING VALUE FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief executive of Kumba, said, ""In 2018, Kumba continued to achieve important milestones in our
strategy of unlocking our full potential through margin expansion and life of mine extension. We kept our commitment on safety
and remained fatality-free with significant improvement across multiple safety indicators. Our focus on productivity and
efficiency continued to gain traction as we reached 65% of benchmark. This, together with our drive to optimise costs,
saw us realise close to R1 billion of cost savings against our target of R800 million.

The flexibility in our approach to production allowed us to lift product qualities to an average of 64.5% Fe, enabling
higher price realisation whilst mitigating logistical constraints. We achieved our production and sales volume
guidance, with unit costs remaining well contained. This solid performance resulted in net cash generated from operations of
R18.9 billion, which coupled with disciplined capital allocation, translated into a total dividend of R30.24 per share for
the year. Furthermore, in line with our resource development plan, I am pleased to announce that we were granted the right
to expand Kolomela into the adjacent Heuningkranz area which presents an exciting opportunity to extend our life of
mine.

It is clear that alongside the solid performance achieved, Kumba has significant value to unlock. While challenges
are part of the uncertain environment that we operate in, the quality of our assets ensures that we are well positioned
to serve our diversified and growing customer base, and we have the right strategy and teams in place to create
sustainable shareholder value"".

COMMENTARY

RESULTS OVERVIEW
Safety is of fundamental importance to Kumba and throughout 2018 we continued to roll-out our fatalities elimination
framework which embeds the principles of safe behaviour. We believe that having a culture of safety is what makes the
difference, and this is demonstrated by our track record of remaining fatality free since May 2016. To further emphasise that
safety is non-negotiable, Kumba has linked safety to business performance through its incentive structure to recognise
and reward a positive safety culture. High potential incidents, which is a leading indicator of fatalities, reduced by 67%
to 7 (2017: 21). Of the lagging indicators, the total recordable case frequency rate declined to 1.80 (2017: 3.23) and
lost-time injuries remained similar to 2017 at 21.

Total tonnes mined increased 8% to 292.5 Mt with operating efficiency improving from 58% last year to 65% of benchmark
in 2018. Total production reduced by 4% to 43.1 Mt, as planned, within our guidance of between 43 Mt and 44 Mt. At the 
mine level, Sishen delivered 29.2 Mt and Kolomela 13.9 Mt of production with ongoing improvements in productivity, 
resulting in the reduction of unscheduled work by up to 40%. Sishen and Kolomela achieved an 81% and 80% mine to plan 
compliance, respectively.

Our flexible production enabled a timeous response to the rail constraints and to market demand for premium quality
products. Planned plant production volumes were reduced to mitigate elevated levels of finished stock and the quality of
the product portfolio improved to benefit from the quality and lump premium. 

Total sales volumes were well within guidance of between 42 Mt and 44 Mt at 43.3 Mt (2017: 44.9 Mt) although export sales 
volumes decreased by 4% to 40.0 Mt (2017: 41.6 Mt). The decrease was as a result of a combination of missed sales 
opportunities due to derailments experienced, single loading due to the six-week scheduled refurbishment of a ship loader, 
and temporary closure of the Iron Ore Export Channel (IOEC) due to a truck colliding with a railway bridge in November 2018.

Kumba made good progress on margin enhancement with the EBITDA margin improving to 45% (2017: 42%) which contained the
break-even price at US$41/tonne (2017: US$40/tonne). This was driven by the cumulative effect of the price premia and
cost saving initiatives which largely offset higher on-mine stay-in-business (SIB) capital expediture, fuel prices and 
freight rates.

We continued to unlock further value from our resource development plan. As a result of the optimised pit slope
design built into the updated life of mine plans, reserve life increased to 14 years from 13 years in 2017 and we 
recovered an additional 56.4 Mt of Ore Reserves and 56.2 Mt of Saleable Product.

Notwithstanding the significant headwinds in 2018, Kumba achieved headline earnings in 2018 of R9.7 billion, similar to 
that of 2017, supported by a 1% increase in the average realised iron ore export price to US$72/tonne (2017:
US$71/tonne) and R1 billion of cost savings. Attributable earnings decreased by 22% to R9.6 billion compared to a 2017 
result of R12.3 billion which had benefited from the positive impact of an impairment reversal of R4.8 billion before tax.
Attributable and headline earnings per share for the year were R30.08 and R30.28 respectively (2017: R38.63 and R30.47).

DIVIDEND 
Kumba announced a new dividend policy on 24 July 2018, based on a more definitive target payout ratio that demonstrates 
the prioritisation of sustainable shareholder returns through the cycle and disciplined capital allocation following
the continued success of our strategy in driving operational and margin improvement, as well as our ability to generate cash
sustainably, supported by a clearer path to life extension.

The new dividend policy targets a dividend range of between 50% and 75% of headline earnings. Along with
prioritising shareholder returns in allocating capital, our aim is to maintain a flexible capital structure and 
continue to protect the balance sheet from market volatility, as well as to ensure an appropriate level of capital is 
allocated to life extension projects.

The Board has declared a final cash dividend of R15.73 per share, which together with the interim dividend of R14.51
per share, results in a total dividend for the year of R30.24 per share (2017: R30.97). This equates to 100% of headline
earnings for 2018, as the interim dividend included a once-off top-up cash dividend of R7.53 per share to reset the
balance sheet net cash position.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Platts 62% IODEX CFR China index averaged US$69.5/dmt in 2018, down 2.5% relative to 2017. However, steel prices
rose by 12% and mill profitability reached record highs. Higher profitability incentivised mills to push for productivity gains. 
Consequently, the Platts 62-65 index differential rose to a record US$27/dmt during the year and averaged US$21/dmt for 2018, 
around 1.3 times the 2017 level. This differential is currently at US$13 as mill margins have decreased by an estimated 30%. 
Due to a shortage of low-alumina ores, the alumina coefficient rallied from approximately US$1.50 per 1% alumina at the start of 
the year to a level of more than US$8 per 1% by mid-year. However, alumina penalty has reversed most of its gains in the second 
half of 2018 and is currently at approximately US$4 per 1% alumina.

Property and machinery sectors buoyed 2018 steel demand in China. New property starts grew at the highest level post the global 
financial crisis and reached an all-time high. Excavator sales rose 45%, offsetting lower demand from infrastructure which 
experienced low investment growth of approximately 4%. The slowdown in infrastructure activity is largely reflective of the 
clampdown on local government and off-balance sheet financing activities as the M1- M2 money supply growth remained negative for 
a 10th consecutive month in December 2018 at -6.6%. 

Iron ore supply from the top four Australian producers edged up by 2.8% while Vale's iron ore shipments rose an
estimated 6% to approximately 390Mtpa on the ramp-up of S11D to 60% of its 90Mtpa capacity.

2018 was an exceptional year for lump premiu with a record annual average of of US$0.25/dmtu. This is currently trading at 
US$0.33/dmtu.Frequent production cuts in northern China provinces and recent supply disruptions at major iron ore miners in 
the second half of 2018, has tightened the lump availability at Chinese ports where stocks have fallen to a near 12-month 
low of approximately 15 Mt (at 41 ports) by year end.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
At the operational level, the alignment between sales and operations was strengthened, and flexibility increased
across the system to deliver operational and cost efficiency both safely and sustainably. In line with our strategy to 
unlock full potential, we focused on a number of areas, including the improvement of safety performance; increasing
productivity and operational efficiency, as well as optimising operating and capital expenditure.

Kumba continued to embed the fatalities elimination framework based on the six elements of leadership, culture, risk
and change management, learning from incidents, technology, monitoring and assurance. Earlier this year, we completed 
our Sacred Covenant training for all employees, and successfully implemented a safety intervention plan at Kolomela. 
A ""Stop for safety day"" was held at both mines to reinforce the importance of safety over production.

All this has contributed towards the strong safety culture and our track record of remaining fatality free since May 2016.
The use of technology has also led to better safety performance with the automation of braking on trucks and collision
avoidance systems, as well as the use of drones to inspect areas of work during high risk activities such as blasting.
This year, the total recordable case frequency rate improved to 1.80 (2017: 3.23), high potential incidents, which are
leading indicators of fatalities, reduced by 67% to 7 (2017: 21) and the number of injuries resulting in lost-time 
remained similar to 2017.

To increase productivity and operational efficiency, a number of initiatives were implemented aimed at improving
primary mining equipment productivity using double-sided loading, optimising haul distances and improving shovel and truck
reliability, amongst others.

Alongside these initiatives, ongoing implementation of the Operating Model has ensured the continuous improvement of
operations. At Sishen, the focus areas in 2018 included the stabilisation of the work management processes in the mining
and truck maintenance areas and implementation at the processing plant and drilling maintenance sections. In the mining
areas, work management enables a fully integrated view of all activities in the pit and ensures greater adherence to the
mining schedule. The most visible and immediate impact was the reduction of unscheduled work by up to 40% in some areas
with Sishen achieving an 81% mine to plan compliance. At Kolomela, the operating model led to improved work management
practices in mining, mobile equipment maintenance and the processing plant.

Given the rail constrained environment, focus was placed on improving the train load out and turnaround times at our mines, 
as well as at reducing the variability of individual wagon loads. Technology has been a key enabler of safety and strategic 
delivery. During the period, we rolled out additional auto-drills enabling 24/7 drilling, implemented truck payload 
optimisation, installed advanced control rooms to monitor and manage production in real-time, and introduced advanced process 
control systems to increase productivity rates. These initiatives and our continuous drive to improve productivity and 
efficiency resulted in efficiency improving to 65% of benchmark.

Our strategy of optimising operating and capital expenditure focused on improving contractor and supplier management
by leveraging the group's global procurement agreements to deliver cost savings on amongst others, truck tyres, fuel and
spare parts.

Capital expenditure at our mines was aimed at improving the safety, productivity and efficiency of operations. These
included the separation of light vehicle and heavy vehicle roads, automation of the wash plant facility, installation of
new chutes to reduce downtime associated with blockages, upgrade of crushers and the full ramp up of the second modular
plant at Sishen in the second half of 2018.

Production summary (unaudited)
Total tonnes mined increased 8% to 292.5 Mt while total production volumes decreased by 4% to 43.1 Mt (2017: 45.0 Mt).

Our flexible production enabled a timeous response to the rail constraints and market demand for premium quality
products. Planned production volumes were reduced to mitigate elevated levels of finished stock and the quality of the
product portfolio improved to benefit from the quality and lump premia.

The process to improve the quality of ore involved increasing densities and maintaining the Dense Media Separation
(DMS) plant at maximum cut density. This resulted in the overall plant yield reducing by 1.2%. However, product quality
improved from an average of 64.1% to 64.5% Fe and the lump:fine ratio from 66% to 68%, ensuring that Kumba is well
positioned to meet market demand for premium products.

Sishen operations
Total tonnes mined at Sishen increased by 11% to 220.5 Mt (2017: 199.5 Mt), following a 9% increase in owner fleet
productivity. Our strategy to maximise value of tonnes mined resulted in total production decreasing to 29.2 Mt 
(2017: 31.1 Mt). Consistent with the mine plan, the stripping ratio increased to 4.7 compared to 4.3 in 2017, resulting 
in the amount of waste mined increasing to 182 Mt (2017: 162 Mt).

Sishen's second modular ultra-high dense media separation (UHDMS) plant was completed in August and commissioned in 
November 2018. The modular plant will treat the remaining JIG discards and supports our focus on the beneficiation of 
low-grade ore.

Progress continued to be made on the Dingleton project. Of the 517 original families, only 10 households remain. 
Engagements with the remaining households are continuing and the process is well on track. Sishen's consolidated mining 
right, incorporating Dingleton, was executed on 29 June 2018.

Kolomela mine
Total tonnes mined increased by 0.4% to 72.0 Mt (2017: 71.8 Mt), with production remaining flat at 13.9 Mt and waste
stripping increasing to 56.0 Mt (2017: 55.6 Mt). Due to rail constraints and sufficient finished stock levels at the
mine, additional maintenance was undertaken on the DMS modular plant to ensure optimal performance through life of mine.
Good productivity and efficiency gains were achieved with the 996-waste shovel tempo increasing by 36%. Kolomela achieved
an 80% mine to plan compliance.

Logistics
A significant number of incidents along the IOEC line during the course of the year led to volumes railed to port
reducing by 3.3% to 40.6 Mt (2017: 42.0 Mt). In addition to seven train derailments, Transnet declared force majeure on
Kumba following a truck colliding with a railway bridge, resulting in the temporary closure of the IOEC line.

Since the half year, however, good progress was made in improving the level of engagement between Kumba and Transnet.
A joint executive steering committee was formed to manage the performance on the IOEC line, and this has led to better
collaboration as demonstrated by the efficient construction and reopening of the railway bridge two days earlier than
expected. Fortunately, there were no injuries and due to the quick recovery time, stock at port was sufficient to meet
shipments.

At Saldanha port, severe weather disruptions together with the scheduled upgrade of the shiploader, which resulted in
single loading over a six-week period, contributed to total shipments decreasing by 3.1% to 40.3 Mt (2017: 41.6 Mt). To
partly mitigate these events, 1.1 Mt of iron ore was shipped through the multi-purpose terminal.

Despite the logistical challenges experienced, total sales of 43.3 Mt (2017: 44.9 Mt) remained within guidance of 
42 Mt to 44 Mt. The decrease was driven by total export sales decreasing 3.8% to 40.0 Mt (2017: 41.6 Mt), including 1.2 Mt
sourced from third-party producers, while domestic sales remained at similar levels to 2017 at 3.3 Mt. Total finished 
stock for the year held at the mine and port reduced to 5.3 Mt, below the 6.2 Mt reported at 30 June 2018 (31 December 2017: 
4.3 Mt).

66% of sales (2017: 69%) were on a cost and freight (CFR) basis with the remainder sold free on board (FOB).
Contractual sales comprised 77% (2017: 70%) of total export sales volumes.

Kumba continued to build its market position and further diversified its customer portfolio with sales in regions
utilising direct-charge materials continuing to increase, in line with the company's strategy of realising higher average
prices for its quality products. China represented 56% (2017: 63%) of Kumba's export sales portfolio whilst the share of
the EU/MENA region increased to 21% (2017: 18%) and Japan and Korea to 20% (2017: 17%).

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue
Total revenue decreased by 1% to R45.7 billion compared to R46.4 billion for 2017, mainly as a result of total sales volumes
reducing by 4%. This, together with the marginal strengthening of the average Rand/US$ exchange rate to R13.24/US$1
(2017: R13.30/US$1) were partially offset by a 1% increase in the average realised iron ore export price to US$72/tonne
(2017: US$71/tonne). Freight rates strengthened by US$2.5/tonne compared to 2017, resulting in a R273 million increase in
shipping revenue.

Kumba's higher average achieved FOB price was driven by higher lump, Fe and market premia, largely offsetting the
impact of weaker iron ore index prices in 2018. On average, the Platts 62 index price decreased by US$1.8/tonne to
US$69.5/tonne, whilst the achieved lump, Fe and market premia increased by US$5.4/tonne to US$16.7/tonne and freight rates 
increased by US$2.6/tonne to US$14.1/tonne.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses, excluding the reversal of the Sishen impairment in 2017, decreased marginally to R29.4 billion compared 
to R29.8 billion in the prior year, principally as a result of lower production and sales volumes as well as the benefit
of cost savings. Cost savings of R976 million from operating efficiency improvements and overhead cost reductions largely
offset inflationary pressure on input costs and higher distribution costs. Selling and distribution costs increased by
6% largely due to higher demurrage caused by rail constraints and above inflation increases in Transnet tariffs.

Freight costs of R4.5 billion remained constant year-on-year as 2.2 Mt lower shipping volumes were offset by a
US$1.20/tonne higher average Platts freight rate on the Saldanha-Qingdao route. Spot freight rates averaged US$13.00/tonne, 
a 10% increase from US$11.8/tonne in 2017.

Unit cash costs at Sishen increased by 1% to R290/tonne (2017: R287/tonne). This was primarily as a result of lower
production volumes and above inflation mining-related cost escalations including diesel prices, which were partially 
offset by cost savings. In addition, during the year, the group capitalised an increased number of equipment spares as 
property, plant and equipment, for which the reconditioning costs incurred met the recognition criteria.

Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R248/tonne (2017: R237/tonne), representing a 5% increase in line with
expectations, due to higher mining volumes and above inflationary pressures from higher fuel prices, partially offset by
savings on overhead costs.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
Despite the challenging environment, Kumba produced an EBITDA of R20.6 billion, representing an increase of 5.1%
compared to R19.6 billion in the previous year. Growth was primarily driven by the 1% increase in the average realised FOB
export iron ore price to US$72/tonne (2017: US$71/tonne) and cost savings of around R1 billion, demonstrating the success
of our margin enhancement strategy. The benefit of our strategy, was partially offset by the 4% decrease in total sales
volumes and above inflation cost escalation.

Kumba's EBITDA margin increased by 3 percentage points to 45% (2017: 42%) and the mining operating margin improved to
50% (2017: 47%), excluding the net freight profit incurred on shipping operations. Net profit decreased by 22% to 
R12.6 billion (2017: R16.1 billion), after the 2017 impairment reversal of R4.8 billion before taxation.

Cash flow
Kumba ended the year with a net cash position of R11.7 billion (2017: R13.9 billion). Cash flow generated from
operations decreased by 16% to R18.9 billion (2017: R22.4 billion), due to higher working capital requirements which offset 
the increase in EBITDA. The increase in working capital largely relates to the higher finished stock of 5.3 Mt 
(2017: 4.3 Mt) following logistical challenges on the rail line.

Total committed debt facilities of R12 billion (revolving facility) mature in 2020. Financial guarantees issued in favour
of the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in respect of environmental closure liabilities were R2.9 billion. The annual 
revision of closure costs reflected a further shortfall of R586 million in respect of the rehabilitation of the Sishen and 
Kolomela mines. Guarantees for the shortfall will be issued in due course.

We created stakeholder value by paying income tax of R4.1 billion (2017: R5.9 billion) and mineral royalties of 
R983 million (2017: R1.2 billion) to government, providing capital expenditure of R4.5 billion (2017: R3.1 billion), and 
distributing dividends to shareholders of R12.5 billion (2017: R6.7 billion).

Capital expenditure of R4.5 billion was incurred: R2.3 billion on SIB activities, R1.7 billion on deferred stripping, 
and R0.5 billion on expansions, which included R0.2 billion on the Dingleton project and R0.2 billion on the second 
Sishen modular plant, commissioned in November 2018.

Included in SIB capital expenditure is reconditioning or overhauling costs for capital spares, which are components of
heavy mining equipment. During the year, the group recognised an increased number of capital spares for which the 
reconditioning costs incurred met the capitalisation criteria for recognition as property, plant and equipment. These 
reconditioning activities are anticipated to improve the performance of the equipment beyond their original expectations 
and this has resulted in the recognition of higher SIB capital expenditure than in prior years. The capitalised costs are 
depreciated over the expected overhaul intervals of the capital spares.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
The following changes were recorded for the 2018 Kumba Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Statement.

Kumba's total ore reserves as at 31 December 2018 are estimated to be 732.9 Mt (at 59.1% Fe) at Sishen and Kolomela, a
net increase of 8% from 676.4 Mt in 2017.

Sishen's ore reserves increased 9% year-on-year, mainly attributable to a steepening of the pit slopes of the Sishen
pit design based on advances made in the spatial geotechnical modelling field thus allowing for optimisation of pit slope
designs. As a result of the optimised pit slope design built into the updated life of mine plan, Sishen's reserve life
has increased from 13 years in 2017 to 14 years in 2018.

The continued focus on on-lease exploration at Kolomela, made available additional Measured and Indicated Mineral
Resources for conversion to Ore Reserves and resulted in Kolomela's reserve life remaining at 14 years and ore reserves
increasing by 7% year-on-year.

Kumba's estimated mineral resources, in addition to its ore reserves totalled 1.1 billion tonnes (at 48.0% Fe), a
year-on-year increase of 12%.

REGULATORY UPDATE
Mining Charter
Kumba welcomes the gazetting of Mining Charter 2018 by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 27 September 2018.

The Mining Charter 2018 is a significant improvement on the draft 2017 and 2018 Mining Charters and deals in a more
constructive way with numerous issues that had proven to be challenging under the 2010 Charter. We also greatly appreciate
the extensive efforts made by the Minister and his team to engage with and take on board the feedback of numerous
stakeholder groups in finalising this charter.

In its submission to the DMR on 27 August 2018, Kumba presented a number of proposals that we believe would assist in 
achieving greater competitiveness, investment and growth for the mining industry.

While we are still in the process of reviewing and undertaking a full assessment of the implications of the new
charter, we welcome certain improvements and points of clarity that have been incorporated.

These include:
- No additional ownership requirements for existing mining rights 
- The requirement for the 1% EBITDA trickle dividend has been removed 
- The inclusion of an equity equivalent ownership structure for communities 
- The removal of the  ""free carried interest"" shareholding requirement for community and employee share ownership
  schemes 
- Provisions regarding prospecting rights have been withdrawn 
- The Foreign Supplier contribution provision has been removed. 

However, we do still have a few significant concerns that we believe may continue to affect the sustainability of the
mining industry in South Africa.

These include, but are not limited to:
- Continued regulatory uncertainty arising from the recent favourable decision of the High Court in the Minerals
  Council of South Africa's application for a declaratory order as to various issues pertaining to the status of the 
  Mining Charter
- Application of the Charter (designed for mining) to licences granted under the Precious Metals Act and the Diamonds
  Act, some of which must be renewed annually 
- The provisions suggesting that new and further BEE ownership transactions will need to be concluded at the point of
  renewal of a mining right. 
  
Furthermore, we are concerned that Mining Charter 2018 will, in certain respects, be difficult to implement legally
and practically, and that may have unintended adverse consequences for the industry.

A further amendment to the Mining Charter of 2018 was gazetted in December 2018. This amendment has clarified that our
first reports as to progress with our Charter initiatives under the Mining Charter 2018 will be due in March 2020 and
this is a welcome development.

Kumba has consistently affirmed its support for the government's national transformation objectives in relation to the
mining industry and has consistently acknowledged its role in promoting transformation in South Africa.
Correspondingly, Anglo American has a longstanding track record of driving and supporting sustainable transformation in 
the mining industry, and we are certainly committed to continuing that journey.

Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA)
On 24 August 2018, the Minister of Mineral Resources announced the withdrawal of the MPRDA Amendment Bill. As a result, 
all amendments that have previously been proposed now fall away, bringing certainty to mining regulation.

Sishen consolidated mining right granted
Sishen's application to extend the mining right to include the Dingleton properties was granted on 25 June 2018 and
notarially executed on 29 June 2018. Mining operations in this area will only commence once the required environmental
authorisation has been approved, which is expected soon. The grant allows Sishen mine to expand its current mining
operations within the adjacent Dingleton area.

Kolomela consolidated mining right granted
The Section 102 application to amend the Kolomela mining right and the Mining work programme to include Heuningkranz
and portion 1 of Langverwacht was granted on 14 October 2018. The Environmental authorisation was approved on 
7 November 2018. The grant allows Kolomela mine to expand its current mining operations within the adjacent 
Heuningkranz area.

Thabazimbi transfer to ArcelorMittal SA
On 1 November 2018, the employees, assets and liabilities as well as the mining rights and the assumed liabilities for
the mine were transferred at a nominal purchase consideration from Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited to
Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine Proprietary Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal South Africa, previously 
ArcelorMittal South Africa Operations Proprietary Limited.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
There were no significant events from 31 December 2018 to the date of this report, not otherwise dealt with in this
report.

CHANGES IN DIRECTORATE
The following changes to the Board were announced during the 2018 financial year:
- Mr Allen Morgan stepped down as an independent non-executive director and chairperson of the Remuneration Committee,
  with effect from 11 May 2018.
- Terence Goodlace was appointed as lead independent non-executive director. Mr Goodlace stepped down as the chairman
  of the Risk and Opportunities Committee and remains a member of the committee.
- Dolly Mokgatle was appointed as the chairman of the Risk and Opportunities Committee. Mrs Mokgatle stepped down as
  the chairman of the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee but remained a member of the committee.
- Buyelwa Sonjica was appointed as the chairman of the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee.
- Ntombi Langa-Royds was appointed as the chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, following 
  Mr Morgan's retirement from the Board and as the chairman of the committee

CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT
The Board announced the appointment of:
- Darrin Strange as Chief operating officer with effect from 1 May 2018.
- Sam Martin as Executive Head: Strategy and business development with effect from 16 July 2018.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019
Full year production guidance is between 43 Mt and 44 Mt with Sishen producing around 30 Mt of product and mining
between 170 Mt and 180 Mt of waste. Sishen's stripping ratio in 2019 is expected to exceed 4.5, with the average LoM
stripping ratio reducing to approximately 3.4. Kolomela's production guidance is between 13 Mt and 14 Mt and waste at 
55 Mt to 60 Mt. The stripping ratio for the mine is expected to exceed 4 in 2019, with the LoM average at approximately 4.

Total sales volumes are likely to be between 43 Mt and 44 Mt, including domestic sales volumes of around 3 Mt of the 
6.25 Mt contracted to ArcelorMittal SA in terms of the supply agreement. Delivery of production and sales volumes as guided
will be in line with rail performance and finished stock levels. We continue to engage with Transnet to optimise
efficiencies and ensure that we achieve maximum rail capacity.

Unit costs are expected to be between R315/tonne and R325/tonne for Sishen and between R265/tonne and R275/tonne for
Kolomela. Costs will remain under pressure as a result of increases in fuel, labour and maintenance costs, with partial
offset from our cost savings programme, targeting R700 million in 2019.

The 2019 outlook for capital expenditure, including deferred stripping, is expected to be in the range of R4.6 billion
to R4.8 billion. Beyond 2019, it is anticipated that expansion capital will include amongst others, our UHDMS
technology, currently in feasibility phase. Construction expected to start in 2020 and capital expenditure for the 
UHDMS project is expected to be between R2 billion and R3 billion. Further information will be available once the 
feasibility study is completed towards the end of 2019.

Iron ore export prices and the Rand/US$ exchange rate are key factors influencing Kumba's financial and operational
performance. Shareholders are advised that these forecasts have not been reviewed or reported on by our auditors.

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded, ""We are continuing to make good progress on transforming Kumba into a company that
delivers sustainable returns through the cycle, underpinned by the economic benefit offered by our differentiated product
quality.

We are delivering our strategy to maximise the potential of our world class asset base by leveraging our existing
capabilities whilst embracing new technologies to produce safely and efficiently. Importantly, at the half year, we put in
place the new dividend policy that targets a pay-out of 50 to 75% of headline earnings. The dividend policy has been well
received and it places greater transparency around our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and ongoing
shareholder returns.""

The presentation of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2018 will be available on the Company's website 
http://www.angloamericankumba.com at 07:05 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11:00 CAT on 19 February 2019.

This measure of normalised earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required

Normalised earnings represents earnings from the recurring activities of the group, as disclosed in the 
accounting policies in the annual financial statements.  
                                    
This is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of Kumba 
for non-recurring expense or income items incurred during the year. The recognition and 
utilisation of the deferred tax asset is a non-recurring item and has therefore been adjusted 
in determining normalised earnings.                                      


NOTES TO THE AUDITED SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2018

1.  CORPORATE INFORMATION
    Kumba is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in South Africa. The main business of Kumba, 
    its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is the exploration, extraction, beneficiation, marketing, sale 
    and shipping of iron ore. The group is listed on the JSE Limited (JSE).

    The audited summarised consolidated financial statements of Kumba and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
    31 December 2018 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 15 February 2019.
  
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
    The audited summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared, under the supervision of 
    BA Mazarura CA(SA), Chief financial officer, in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings 
    Requirements for provisional reports, and the requirements of the South African Companies Act, No 71 of 2008 
    applicable to summarised consolidated financial statements. The Listings Requirements require provisional reports 
    to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of 
    International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the 
    Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council 
    and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
    
    The audited consolidated financial statements from which these summarised consolidated financial statements were 
    derived have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments, 
    share-based payments, discontinued operation and disposal group held for sale and biological assets which are stated 
    at fair value, and are presented in Rand, which is Kumba's functional and presentation currency. All financial 
    information presented in Rand has been rounded off to the nearest million.

    2.1 Going concern
        In assessing whether the group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, the directors 
        have reviewed the group financial budgets with their underlying business plans. The financial performance of the 
        group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in which the group operates. Factors exist which are outside 
        the control of management which can have a significant impact on the business, specifically the volatility in the 
        Rand/US$ exchange rate and the iron ore price. 

        Based on the current financial position, the Board is satisfied that the group is sufficiently liquid and solvent 
        to be able to support the current operations for the next 12 months. In the light of the going concern assessment 
        performed by the Board, the audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
  
    2.2 Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
        In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the 
        group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are consistent with those applied to the 
        consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except as disclosed below. 
    
3.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    The accounting policies and methods of computation applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
    from which the summarised consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of International Financial Reporting 
    Standards and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated 
    annual financial statements, except as disclosed below.

        3.1 Amendments to published standards and interpretations
        A number of amendments to accounting standards were effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 
        on or after 1 January 2018. Comparative information has not been presented.

        3.1.1 New standards effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
              The following standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations, which are effective for the 
              year commencing on 1 January 2018, were adopted by the group:
              IFRS 9 Financial instruments
              IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and sets out the updated requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, 
              derecognition and general hedge accounting of financial instruments. These requirements specifically deal 
              with the classification and measurement of financial instruments. With regards to classification, subsequent 
              to initial recognition, the financial assets are to be classified as either armortised cost, fair value 
              through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, based on the business model and 
              contractual cashflow characteristics. The measurement of impairment losses are based on an expected credit 
              loss model, which takes into account the time value of money, probability weighting as well as forward 
              looking information. IFRS 9 further requires consideration of the disaggregation of the debtors' book when 
              considering impairments where revenue streams are likely to have different risk profiles.

              The adoption of this new standard had no material impact on the group's earnings for the year.

              IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
              IFRS 15 replaces all existing revenue requirements in IFRS and applies to all revenue arising from contracts 
              with customers. The standard requires an entity to recognise revenue in such a manner as to depict the 
              transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount representing the consideration, to which the entity 
              expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The identified contracts with customers are 
              required to be evaluated to determine the performance obligations, the transaction price and the point at 
              which the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring promised goods or services to the customers. 
              IFRS 15 requires that an entity should apply the standard using either one of the following transition 
              approaches: (a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period; or (b) retrospectively with the cumulative 
              effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. The group applied 
              the modified retrospective approach on adoption.

              The group's revenue is primarily derived from commodity sales for which the point of recognition is 
              dependent on the contract sales terms known as the International Commercial terms (Incoterms). Under Incoterms 
              (i.e. cost, insurance and freight (CIF) and cost and freight (CFR)), the seller is required to contract and 
              pay for the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to a named port destination.

              Consequently, the freight service on export commodity contracts with CIF/CFR Incoterms represents a separate 
              performance obligation as defined under IFRS 15 and as such, a portion of the revenue earned under these 
              contracts, representing the obligation to perform the freight service, is deferred and recognised when this 
              obligation has been fulfilled, along with the associated costs.

              The impact of applying IFRS 15 in the 2018 financial year was as follows:
              - Net decrease in profit after tax of R201 million
              - No material impact on opening retained earnings
              - Increase in current assets of R9 million
              - Increase in current liabilities of R288 million
         
    3.2 New standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been 
        early adopted
        At the date of authorisation of these summarised consolidated financial statements, the following standard, 
        amendments to existing standard and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective in the 2018 financial year 
        and has not been early adopted.

        IFRS 16 Leases
        IFRS 16 Leases became effective for the group from 1 January 2019, replacing IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 sets out 
        updated requirements on recognition and measurement of leases. The group has elected to adopt the modified 
        retrospective transition approach and therefore the cumulative effect of transition to IFRS 16 will be 
        recognised in Retained earnings and the comparative period will not be restated. 

        The principal impact of IFRS 16 will be to change the accounting treatment by lessees of leases currently 
        classified as operating leases. Lease agreements will give rise to the recognition by the lessees of a right 
        of use asset and a related liability for future lease payments.

        Based on the impact assessment performed, the application of IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact 
        on the group's consolidated financial statements, particularly in relation to the recognition of the right of 
        use assets and lease liabilities that were previously treated as operating leases. 

        The most significant expected impact of transitioning to IFRS 16 in the 2019 financial year, based upon Kumba's 
        current contractual arrangements, is estimated to be:
        - recognising a lease liability of approximately R400 million to R500 million
        - recognising a right of use asset of approximately R350 million to R450 million. The right of use asset will
          principally relate to rental of properties and mining equipment
        - the balance representing an adjustment to retained earnings

        Depreciation of the right of use asset and the finance charge representing the unwinding of the discount on 
        the lease liability will be recorded in the statement of profit or loss. The impact of the standard on EBITDA 
        and profit before tax following adoption is not expected to be significant although the presentation of the 
        leases in the statement of profit or loss will change.

4.  CHANGES IN ESTIMATES
    The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions is a key area where management's 
    judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows 
    required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use of certain estimates 
    and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate. The closure 
    provisions are updated at each reporting period date, for changes in these estimates.    
    
    The life of mine plan (LoMP) on which accounting estimates are based only includes proved and probable ore reserves
    as disclosed in Kumba's 2018 annual ore reserves and mineral resources statement. The most significant changes in 
    the provisions for 2018 arises from the change in the LoMP as well as the timing of the expected cash flows for both 
    Sishen and Kolomela.

    The group's effective tax rate was 24% for the year (2017: 25%).  
    
11. SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
    Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
    decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
    operating segments, has been identified as the Kumba Executive Committee.   
    
    The Kumba Executive Committee considers the business principally according to the nature of the products and 
    services provided, with the identified segments each representing a strategic business unit. ""Other segments"" 
    comprise corporate, administration and other expenditure not allocated to the reported segments.  
    
    The total reported segment revenue comprises revenue from external customers, and is measured in a manner 
    consistent with that disclosed in the statement of profit or loss. The performance of the operating segments is 
    assessed based on earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which is considered a more 
    appropriate measure of profitability for the group's businesses. Finance income and finance costs are not allocated 
    to segments, as treasury activity is managed on a central group basis.  
    
    Total segment assets comprise finished goods inventory only, which is allocated based on the operations of the 
    segment and the physical location of the asset. 
    
    Depreciation, staff costs, impairment of assets and additions to property, plant and equipment are not reported to 
    the CODM per segment, but are significant items which are included in EBITDA and/or reported on for the group as a 
    whole.

    On 10 July 2018, SIOC received the grant letter from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in respect of 
    section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) approving the cession of the Thabazimbi 
    mining rights to ArcelorMittal SA.       
    
    Subsequently, on 12 October 2018, Kumba and ArcelorMittal SA announced that all the conditions precedent to the transfer 
    of Thabazimbi mine, together with the mining rights, had either been fulfilled or waived. On 1 November 2018, 
    the employees, assets and liabilities as well as the mining rights and the assumed liabilities of Thabazimbi mine 
    were transferred at a nominal purchase consideration from SIOC to Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine Proprietary Limited (a wholly 
    owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal SA, previously ArcelorMittal South Africa Operations Proprietary Limited).   
    
    The Thabazimbi operation continued to be classified as a discontinued operation until 1 November 2018.

    On 29 June 2018, the South African Revenue Services (SARS) issued the group with additional income tax assessments 
    relating to a tax audit on the deductibility of certain expenditure incurred, covering the 2012 to 2014 years 
    of assessment. The group objected against these assessments after consultation with external tax and legal advisers. 
    On 11 December 2018, the SARS advised that it has disallowed the objection. Kumba is in the process of preparing 
    an appeal against this outcome. Based on the external legal and tax advice, the group believes that these matters 
    have been appropriately treated in the results for the year ended 31 December 2018.
    
    There were no other contingent liabilities at 31 December 2018.
    
16. GUARANTEES                                                                                                       
    The total guarantees issued in favour of the DMR in respect of the group's environmental closure liabilities at 
    31 December 2018 were R2.9 billion (2017: R2.8 billion). Included in this amount are financial guarantees for the 
    environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of the group to the DMR in respect of the Thabazimbi mine 
    of R439 million (2017: R439 million). ArcelorMittal SA has guaranteed R439 million of this amount by means of bank
    guarantees issued in favour of SIOC. The relevant parties are in the process of exchanging the Thabazimbi guarantees 
    as part of the sale transaction (Refer to note 12). 
    
    As a result of the annual revision of closure costs, a shortfall of R586 million arose. Guarantees in respect of the 
    shortfall will be issued in due course. 
    
17. REGULATORY UPDATE                                                                                                
    The Reviewed Mining Charter (MCIII)                                                                              
    Kumba welcomes the gazetting of Mining Charter 2018 by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 27 September 2018.     
    
    The Mining Charter 2018 is a significant improvement on the draft 2017 and 2018 Mining Charters and deals in a more 
    constructive way with numerous issues that had proven to be challenging under the 2010 Charter. We also greatly 
    appreciate the extensive efforts made by the Minister and his team to engage with and take on board the feedback 
    of numerous stakeholder groups in finalising this charter.    
    
    In its submission to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) on 27 August 2018, Kumba presented a number of 
    proposals that we believe would assist in achieving greater competitiveness, investment and growth for the 
    mining industry.     
    
    While we are still in the process of reviewing and undertaking a full assessment of the implications of the 
    new charter, we welcome certain improvements and points of clarity that have been incorporated.       
    
    These include:                                                                                                   
    - No additional ownership requirements for existing mining rights                                            
    - The requirement for the 1% EBITDA trickle dividend has been removed                                          
    - The inclusion of an equity equivalent ownership structure for communities                                          
    - The removal of the  ""free carried interest"" shareholding requirement for community and employee share 
      ownership schemes                                           
    - Provisions regarding prospecting rights have been withdrawn                                                
    - The Foreign Supplier contribution provision has been removed.
    
    However, we do still have a few significant concerns that we believe may continue to affect the sustainability 
    of the mining industry in South Africa. 
    
    These include, but are not limited to:                                                                           
    - Continued regulatory uncertainty arising from the recent favourable decision of the High Court in the 
      Minerals Council of South Africa's application for a declaratory order as to various issues pertaining to the 
      status of the Mining Charter                                          
    - Application of the Charter (designed for mining) to licences granted under the Precious Metals Act and the 
      Diamonds Act, some of which must be renewed annually                                           
    - The provisions suggesting that new and further BEE ownership transactions will need to be concluded at the 
      point of renewal of a mining right.    
      
    Furthermore, we are concerned that Mining Charter 2018 will, in certain respects, be difficult to implement 
    legally and practically, and that may have unintended adverse consequences for the industry.      
    
    A further amendment to the Mining Charter of 2018 was gazetted in December 2018. This amendment has clarified 
    that our first reports as to progress with our Charter initiatives under the Mining Charter 2018 will be due in 
    March 2020 and this is a welcome development. 
    
    Kumba has consistently affirmed its support for the government's national transformation objectives in relation 
    to the mining industry and has consistently acknowledged its role in promoting transformation in South Africa. 
    Correspondingly, Anglo American has a longstanding track record of driving and supporting sustainable transformation 
    in the mining industry, and we are certainly committed to continuing that journey.      
    
18. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                                                                                             
    The group subscribes to the Code of Good Corporate Practices and Conduct and complies with the recommendations of 
    the King IV Report. The Board charter is aligned with the provisions of all relevant statutory and regulatory 
    requirements including, amongst others, King IV. Full disclosure of the group's compliance will be contained in 
    the 2018 Integrated Report.    
    
19. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD                                                                                
    There have been no material events subsequent to 31 December 2018, not otherwise dealt with in this report.

Kumba Production Report for the fourth quarter 2018 and Trading Statement for the year ended 31
December 2018

Production and Sales Report for the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2018

Kumba's continued delivery on health, safety and operating performance contributed to production and sales
volumes remaining in line with guidance, despite significant logistical challenges for the quarter ended 31
December 2018 (""Q4 2018""). Throughout this report, production and sales volumes referred to are 100% of
Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (""SIOC""), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as
the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Kumba's leadership and strong culture of health and safety delivered ongoing improvements across key safety
  metrics and ensured a fatality free performance.
- Total sales of 43.3 Mt for the year were within the guidance range of 42-44Mt. Export sales for the year
  decreased by only 4% to 40Mt, with a 10% quarter-on-quarter increase in Q4 2018 despite significant logistical
  challenges.
- Total production for 2018 of 43.1Mt, although 4% lower, were also within the guidance of 43-44Mt. Compared
  to Q3 2018, planned production reduced by 3% to 10.2Mt in Q4 2018 to offset elevated stock levels arising
  from rail constraints.

Total sales volumes of 43.3Mt and total production of 43.1Mt for the year were both well within guidance of 42-
44Mt and 43-44Mt, respectively.

Export sales volumes for 2018 decreased 4% to 40Mt (2017: 41.6Mt) owing to rail constraints and the single
loading of vessels following the scheduled refurbishment of the ship loader by Transnet at Saldanha Port.
Pleasingly, the earlier reopening of the Iron Ore Export Channel following structural damage to a railway bridge,
resulted in export sales in Q4 2018 increasing 10% to 10.7Mt, when compared to the third quarter (Q3 2018:
9.7Mt). Relative to Q4 2017, export sales were 6% lower (Q4 2017: 11.4 Mt).

Total production volumes for the year reduced by 4% to 43.1Mt (2017: 45Mt) to offset high stock levels at the
mines. Compared to Q3 2018, production volumes were down 3% to 10.2Mt (Q3 2018: 10.5Mt), while relative to
the high base in Q4 2017, volumes in Q4 2018 were down 13% (Q4 2017: 11.6Mt). Lower plant tonnage yields
also resulted in lower volumes, as Kumba improved the average quality of its product portfolio in 2018 to 64.5%
Fe (2017: 64.1% Fe) following the strategy to maximise the value of tonnes railed and exported to benefit from
the strong demand for high-grade ore.

The underlying movements for the twelve-month period were mainly driven by Sishen's production reducing by
6% to 29.2Mt (2017: 31.1Mt), while production at Kolomela was flat at 13.9Mt. Relative to Q3 2018, however,
fourth quarter production was driven by Kolomela's production decreasing 8% to 3.2Mt (Q3 2017: 3.5Mt) as
elevated stock levels, following the rail challenges, presented an opportunity at Kolomela to undertake additional
maintenance on the dense media separation modular plant.

The focus on improving primary mining equipment productivity as part of our operating efficiency drive continued
to deliver benefits and resulted in waste stripping at Sishen increasing by 19% to 51Mt for the quarter (Q4 2017:
43Mt) whilst at Kolomela, waste stripping remained relatively flat at 14.1Mt.

Total finished stock held at the mine and port reduced to 5.3Mt (Q4 2017: 4.3Mt), below the 6.6Mt reported at 30
September 2018.

Kumba achieved an average realised iron ore export price of US$72/tonne (2017: US$71/tonne) for the full year.

With reference to the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish a trading statement
as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be reported on will differ by
at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period. The financial results for the year ended
31 December 2017 (""the comparative period"") were released on SENS on 13 February 2018.

Kumba's headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period are likely to be in line with
the comparative period. Reported headline earnings for the comparative period were R9,728 million, while HEPS
were R30.47.

As a result of an impairment reversal of R4,789 million (before taxation and non-controlling interest) in the 2017
comparative period, basic earnings per share (""EPS"") were positively impacted by R8.30 per share. The non-
recurrence of this impairment reversal in 2018, means that Kumba's basic earnings for the period are likely to be
between 19% and 28% lower than the comparative period, translating to a range of between R8,885 million and
R10,030 million. In this regard, EPS will also likely be between 19% and 28% lower than the comparative period
translating to a range of between R27.80 per share and R31.40 per share. Reported basic earnings for the
comparative period were R12,335 million while EPS were R38.63.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company's external auditors.

Kumba is pleased to announce that the Iron Ore Export Channel (IOEC) was reopened by
Transnet on 7 December 2018, two days earlier than expected, and that operations on the
rail line have resumed.

Transnet has informed Kumba that the newly constructed temporary bridge passed all
technical assessments and that the IOEC line is now open for business. Tests were first
carried out on an empty train on Friday, 7 December, followed by a heavy-laden train the
same day.

Kumba’s CEO, Themba Mkhwanazi commended Transnet on their swift response, which
ensured that the IOEC line was restored earlier than planned.

Kumba’s expectation of meeting the lower end of its 2018 guidance, as announced on 24
July 2018 within the Company’s reviewed interim results, is unchanged. Kumba’s 2018
guidance is 43-44 Mt for total production and 42-44 Mt for total sales.

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement issued on 30 November 2018 relating
to the disruption of the IOEC due to railway bridge damage.

Iron Ore Export Channel disrupted due to railway bridge damage
Kumba has been notified by Transnet of an incident on a public road at a railway bridge that
has closed the Iron Ore Export Channel (IOEC).

A truck carrying an abnormal load which exceeded the bridge height collided into a railway
bridge, causing structural damage to the bridge and the railway line above. Train movements
in both directions have been impacted and Transnet has declared force majeure on Kumba.

Transnet have informed Kumba that a temporary bridge will be constructed and that the
IOEC line is expected to be reopened on the 9th December 2018. Based on this information,
Kumba currently anticipates that the lower end of its 2018 guidance, as announced on 24
July 2018 within the Company?s reviewed interim results, will be met. Kumba?s 2018
guidance was 43-44Mt for total production and 42-44Mt for total sales.

The incident is receiving the highest level of attention by Transnet. Kumba is working closely
with Transnet to ensure that the IOEC line is restored as soon as possible. Further updates
will be provided as appropriate.

Kumba Iron Ore Limited production and sales report for the third quarter ended 30 September 2018

Kumba continued to improve on safety and delivered a solid operating performance, while maintaining production
and sales volumes in line with guidance. Throughout this report, production and sales volumes referred to are 100%
of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the
non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
• Safe production ensured Kumba remained fatality free and continued to improve on multiple safety metrics.
• Production volumes reduced by 9% to 10.5Mt as planned, to offset elevated stock levels arising from rail
  constraints in H1 2018.
• Export sales decreased by 10% to 9.7Mt as a result of scheduled refurbishment by Transnet.

Total production volumes decreased by 9% to 10.5Mt (Q3 2017: 11.5Mt) as planned, to offset elevated stock levels
at Sishen and Kolomela arising from Transnet rail constraints in H1 2018. Production volumes were also impacted by
the slight decrease in processing plant yields as Kumba focused on producing high quality products to maximise the
value of tonnes railed to port and benefit from the strong demand for high-grade ore.

Production at Sishen and Kolomela reduced by 10% to 7Mt (Q3 2017: 7.8Mt) and 6% to 3.5Mt (Q3 2017: 3.7Mt),
respectively. Waste stripping at Sishen increased by 7% to 45Mt (Q3 2017: 42Mt) and remained flat at Kolomela (Q3
2017: 16Mt), as we continued our progress towards benchmark efficiency.

Export sales decreased by 10% to 9.7Mt (Q3 2017: 11.4Mt) due to the scheduled refurbishment of the ship loaders
at Saldanha which resulted in single loading of vessels during the quarter. Total finished stock increased to 6.6Mt
from 6.2Mt at 30 June 2018.

Guidance
Kumba continued to work closely with Transnet to improve logistical performance and good progress has been
made during the quarter. As a result, the 2018 full year guidance announced in Kumba's 2018 interim results on 24
July 2018 has been maintained as follows:

-   Total production of 43-44Mt
    – Sishen 29-30Mt
    – Kolomela 14Mt
-   Waste
    – Sishen 170-180Mt
    – Kolomela 55-57Mt
-   Total sales of 42-44Mt

TRANSFER OF THABAZIMBI MINE TO ARCELORMITTAL SOUTH AFRICA

Kumba and ArcelorMittal South Africa are pleased to announce that all the conditions precedent to the
Transfer of Thabazimbi Mine (""the Mine""), together with the mining rights, to ArcelorMittal South Africa
have either been fulfilled or waived. The employees, assets and liabilities as well as the mining rights
and the assumed liabilities for the Mine will be transferred at a nominal purchase consideration from
Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (“SIOC”) to Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine (Pty) Ltd (a wholly-
owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal South Africa, previously ArcelorMittal South Africa Operations (Pty)
Ltd on 1 November 2018.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said, ""We are pleased that consent for the transfer of the mining
rights of Thabazimbi Mine has been granted as it will enable ArcelorMittal South Africa to directly
manage their liabilities. This brings to culmination a very collaborative transfer process with ArcelorMittal
South Africa and we thank them for the role they played in the process. We also thank the employees
at the Mine for their contribution and commitment over the years and wish them everything of the best
as they embark on a new journey”.

Kobus Verster, CEO of ArcelorMittal South Africa, said “The conclusion of this process allows us to take
full ownership of the Thabazimbi Mine and continue with our investigations to decide the future of the
operations. We remain committed to ensuring the transition process is managed in the best interest of
Thabazimbi Mine employees and local communities”.

Kumba and ArcelorMittal South Africa have prior to this issued a joint announcement on 9 February
2017 advising that SIOC and ArcelorMittal South Africa had entered into an agreement for the transfer
of the Mine together with the mining rights, to ArcelorMittal South Africa. The Transfer was dependent
on certain conditions being fulfilled.

As reported in Kumba’s 2018 Interim results on 24 July 2018, the grant letter in respect of Section 11
of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act No.28 of 2002, approving the transfer of the
mining rights was received from the Department of Mineral Resources on 10 July 2018.

The Transfer is below the JSE transaction threshold for both Kumba and ArcelorMittal South Africa and
this announcement is for information purposes only.

Commentary
CONTINUED SAFETY, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY GAINS 
""Kumba's strategy of 'Transformation to full potential', called 'Tswelelopele', resulted in a solid operating
performance across the value chain and continued to deliver shareholder returns. Attributable free cash flow of 
R2.8 billion and a strong opening cash position translated into an interim cash dividend of R4.7 billion, 
despite the impact of a stronger rand and softer iron ore prices. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 12%, while production increased by 3% with 11% more ex-pit waste moved. Continued 
productivity and efficiency improvements on the back of the Operating Model have enabled the removal of more ex-pit 
waste while containing unit costs.

Rail challenges have resulted in lost opportunities to achieve higher export sales volumes. This, coupled with a
stronger Rand and lower iron ore export prices, resulted in revenue of R19.5 billion. Our operational improvements, 
coupled with strong cost discipline, led to cost savings of R415 million which contributed to headline earnings 
of R3 billion. We ended the period with a strong net cash position of R11.7 billion. 

The next six months will be focused on delivering further operational and financial gains through our strategy, 
which comprises three horizons. Under Horizon 1, our focus is on margin enhancement through cost saving initiatives 
and further productivity and efficiency improvements, and on the revenue side, maximising realised prices. 
Alongside this, work is being done under Horizon 2 to leverage our endowment and we see further life of mine 
extension opportunities through our resource development programme. We are primarily focused on Horizon 1 and 2 
where value can be unlocked in the short to medium term while we are opportunistic about long-term growth options 
under Horizon 3.

Based on the solid operating platform and strong balance sheet, the Board has approved a dividend policy which targets
a pay-out ratio range of 50 - 75% of headline earnings. The new policy reflects our commitment to shareholder returns
while balancing the capital requirements of sustaining and growing our business.""

Themba Mkhwanazi
Chief executive

NEW DIVIDEND POLICY AND INTERIM CASH DIVIDEND DECLARED
Following the 2014 and 2015 iron ore market downturn, Kumba resumed dividend payments in 2017 by applying a 
discretionary dividend policy as we sought to embed operational improvements and ensure a flexible balance sheet 
was built which is resilient to market volatility while providing a base to address the growth and life extension 
imperative.

The continued success of our strategy in driving operational improvement, our ability to generate cash, and a clearer
path to life extension have given us the platform to revise our dividend policy to a more definitive target payout 
ratio demonstrating the prioritisation of sustainable shareholder returns through the cycle and disciplined capital 
allocation.

The new dividend policy will target a base dividend range of between 50% and 75% of headline earnings. While we will
prioritise shareholder returns in allocating capital, our aim is to maintain a flexible capital structure and 
continue to protect the balance sheet from market volatility, as well as to ensure an appropriate level of capital is 
allocated to life extension projects.

The Board has approved a total cash dividend of R14.51 per share which is made up as follows:
- R6.98 per share representing 75% of headline earnings in accordance with the new dividend policy; and
- R7.53 per share being a once-off top-up cash dividend to reset the balance sheet net cash position given the 
  accumulation of cash since the recovery in the iron ore market in 2016.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Platts 62% IODEX CFR China index averaged $70/dmt during the first half of 2018 ('the period'), down 7% or $5/dmt 
relative to the first half of 2017 ('the comparative period').  A series of political events in Beijing and winter 
production cuts in North China until mid-March hampered construction activity. This resulted in an inventory overhang 
pushing steel prices lower by more than 10% through March. Since then, end user demand has staged an impressive 
recovery with property investment up 10%. Consequently, steel stocks have fallen by 50% post the Chinese New Year 
period - a new record. Steel mill margins are currently near record highs and 'flight to quality' remains the 
pre-dominant theme among Chinese mills as high-grade iron ore maximises steel productivity. The Platts65/Platts62 
differential has risen by 86% in the first half of the year to $27/dmtu at 30 June 2018 and averaged $18/dmtu 
for the period. 

While demand for iron ore has been buoyant, supply has increased. Iron ore port stocks rose by 9 Mt in the first 
half of 2018 to 156 Mt at 45 ports in China. The combined iron ore shipments from Australia and Brazil are up 3.8%
year-on-year to an annualised 1.2 billion tonnes in the first half of the year. Widening discounts for low grade 
ores and higher freight rates have raised the break-even price for higher cost suppliers.

The lump premium had a strong recovery, increasing from 7.9 US cents/dmtu at the start of the year to 
32 US cents/dmtu at 30 June 2018, taking the average for the period to 18 US cents/dmtu or an equivalent of US$12/dmt. 
Multiple sintering closures in Tangshan, Hebei and other northern provinces in China, and record demand for low alumina 
ores have been the key drivers of the recent rally in the lump premium in China.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The focus on safety remains a key priority for Kumba. Life saving rules called 'My Sacred Covenant' were launched 
and included compulsory training for all employees. At both mines, a 'Stop for safety day' was held to reinforce 
the importance of safe production. We remained fatality free during the period with improvements across key safety 
metrics. The total recordable case frequency rate1, a measure of the frequency of recordable injuries, improved to 
2.08 (1H17: 3.79), high potential incidents reduced to 3 (1H17: 13) and the lost-time injury frequency rate1 
decreased to 0.99 (1H17: 1.35). 

Total tonnes mined increased by 12% to 140.4 Mt while total production rose by 3% to 22.4 Mt with marginally 
lower production at Sishen of 15.3 Mt (1H17: 15.6 Mt). Continued strong performance at Kolomela led to production 
increasing by 14% to 7.2 Mt. Total sales volumes remained flat in relation to the first half of 2017 at 21.2 Mt.

1. Lost-time injury (LTI) frequency rate and total recordable case (TRC) frequency rate are now calculated based on 
1,000,000 man hours. LTIFR calculated using LTI*1,000,000/total hours and TRCFR calculated using TRC*1,000,000/total hours. 
Comparative numbers for 1H17 were restated accordingly. 

Sishen mine
Total tonnes mined at Sishen increased by 12.2 Mt to 105.1 Mt (1H17: 92.9 Mt) of which waste mined was 86.6 Mt,
representing a 13% increase as a result of the improvement in primary equipment efficiencies. 

Production decreased by 2% to 15.3 Mt (1H17: 15.6 Mt) due to a strategic decision to increase product quality and 
the value of product railed to mitigate the impact of the rail constraints caused by derailments. With market 
demand increasing for higher quality products, we improved the average quality of our products to 64.5% Fe and the 
lump:fine ratio to 67:33 (1H17: 63:37), which contributed to lower production volumes. 

Through the implementation of the Operating Model, Sishen not only stabilised its operations, but continued to 
improve efficiencies in line with our strategy. Compared to the first half of 2017, total fleet productivity was 
up 17%, supported by truck fleet productivity increasing by 38%. As a result of these improvements, Sishen was 
able to park 11 trucks and achieve a 7% improvement in truck utilisation without negatively affecting production. 
Additionally, primary shovel tempos improved by 19%. 

Some of the key initiatives at Sishen include:
- Increasing double sided loading
- Larger blasts to reduce delays associated with frequent blasting
- Increasing the floor stock in front of the shovels.

Technology has become a key enabler of safe production and improved performance. As an example, 36 of the haul 
trucks have been fitted with autobraking collision avoidance technology. Kumba is the first mining company to 
successfully prove the autobraking technology. We also introduced an operator training programme which uses drone 
technology to film the best shovel operators, in order to transfer knowledge to other operators. 

Kolomela mine
Total tonnes mined increased by 10% to 35.3 Mt, (1H17: 32.2 Mt). Waste mined was 26.4 Mt (1H17: 25.4 Mt), an 
increase of 4%, as planned. The mine produced 7.2 Mt of ore (1H17: 6.3 Mt), a 14% increase, from 32% more ex-pit 
ore mined.

Kolomela's increased production was due to continued improvement of the Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) plant tempos and
increased throughput due to the ramp-up of the Dense Media Separation modular plant, as well as the successful
implementation of the Operating Model at the plant. 

The Operating Model and advanced process control technology have resulted in Kolomela mine consistently improving 
its DSO plant throughput and efficiency over the past few years, and the plant is now regarded as an industry 
benchmark. Despite the high base, the productivity of the DSO plant improved by a further 2% in comparison to the 
first half of 2017. Further to the plant performance, Kolomela mine has also improved its earthmoving equipment 
efficiencies with primary shovel tempos increasing by 9% and truck productivity increasing by 6% during 
the period.  

Logistics
Transnet rail performance has been sub-optimal. Since the second half of 2017, there have been six derailments 
on the Iron Ore Export Channel of which four occurred during the 2018 period. As a result of this, iron ore railed 
to port remained similar to the comparative period at 20.8 Mt. The derailed wagons have been replaced and performance 
is being monitored closely to secure delivery of our contractual capacity. Initiatives have been implemented to 
mitigate the impact of derailments, which include reducing loading times and improving our turnaround times at 
the mines. 

Severe weather disruptions at Saldanha port have resulted in a number of vessels being delayed into July, impacting
shipments for the period which remained at similar levels of 19.5 Mt relative to the comparative period.

Sales
The challenges with the logistics performance resulted in 2.4 Mt of lost export sales opportunity in the period. 
As a result, total and export sales remained flat at 21.2 Mt and 19.5 Mt, respectively, relative to the comparative 
period, with domestic sales decreasing to 1.7 Mt (1H17: 1.8 Mt). Finished product inventory held at the mines 
and ports increased to 6.2 Mt (1H17: 4.4 Mt) with a higher proportion of this at the mines.

CFR sales accounted for 65% of export sales volumes (1H17: 65%). Kumba further diversified its customer portfolio 
and China's share of export sales reduced to 57% (1H17: 60%) of the export sales portfolio, while the share of 
the EU/MENA/Americas region increased to 21% (1H17:20%). Product quality improved to 64.5% Fe and the total sales 
lump:fine ratio to 67:33 (1H17: 63:37), allowing Kumba to benefit from the relatively stronger lump premium market.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Kumba produced a resilient financial performance despite challenging logistics and export market conditions. 
Proactive steps taken to reduce costs, improve operational efficiencies and increase iron ore quality to 
maximise quality premia partly offset the full effects of the stronger Rand/US$ exchange rate and lower 
average realised iron ore prices. In light of these headwinds, a strong and flexible balance sheet remains 
an imperative as this enables the prioritisation of shareholder returns through our new dividend payout 
policy of 50 - 75% of headline earnings while we continue to invest for growth. 

Revenue
Total revenue decreased by 9% to R19.5 billion (1H17: R21.5 billion), largely driven by the following factors:
- Rand strengthening of 7% on average against the US dollar (1H18: R12.30/US$1 compared to 1H17: R13.21/US$1); 
  and
- Average realised iron ore export price decreasing 3% to US$69/tonne (1H17: US$71/tonne).

Kumba's average realised FOB prices decreased by US$2/tonne compared to 1H17, following a decrease in iron ore 
prices of $5/tonne and higher freight rates of $2/tonne, which was partly offset by the average lump premium 
increasing by US$5/tonne, given our relatively more competitive lump:fine ratio. Furthermore, our average product 
quality increased from 64.1% Fe in 1H17 to 64.5% Fe in 1H18 which together with our marketing efforts helped to 
increase the premium received for our high quality lump product. 

Firmer freight rates translated into a 9% increase in shipping revenue to R1.9 billion (1H17: R1.7 billion).

Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 4% to R14.4 billion (1H17: R13.8 billion), following the 12% increase in mining
volumes to 140.4 Mt, along with the 3% increase in production volumes to 22.4 Mt. Cost savings of R415 million 
as a result of optimisation and efficiency improvements helped to contain the increase in operating expenses.

Unit cash costs at Sishen mine increased by 8% to R309 per tonne (FY17: R287 per tonne) primarily as a result of
higher mining volumes and above-inflation increases in fuel costs, partly offset by productivity and efficiency 
improvements, as well as savings in overhead costs. Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R232 per tonne 
(FY17: R237 per tonne), a 2% decrease, as cost savings from optimisation and improved efficiencies outweighed the 
impact of higher mining volumes and fuel prices.

Selling and distribution costs increased by 13% to R3 billion (1H17: R2.7 billion) on the back of contractual 
tariff increases and higher demurrage. Shipping costs were R107 million higher due to the Platts freight rate 
on the Saldanha - Qingdao route increasing to US$12.47/tonne, a 23% increase from US$10.12/tonne in 1H17.

Break-even price
Kumba achieved an average cash break-even price of US$46/tonne (62%Fe CFR China), an increase of US$6/tonne 
from the average for the 2017 financial year. The increase in controllable costs was contained to US$1/tonne 
as costs related to higher mining volumes and logistics, were partially offset by cost savings, productivity 
gains and operating efficiency improvements. Non-controllable costs rose by US$5/tonne due to the stronger 
Rand (US$4/tonne) and higher freight rates (US$1/tonne). 

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
EBITDA of R7 billion (1H17: R9.1 billion) reflects a decrease of 24%. Underlying drivers included controllable 
factors which delivered a 14% gain through higher sales premiums and cost savings. This helped offset the impact 
from non-controllable factors such as the strengthening of the Rand by 7%, the 3% reduction in average 
realised iron ore export price, and higher inflation-related costs. In addition, a net freight loss was 
incurred on shipping operations from long-term fixed price chartering contracts. As a result of the above, 
the EBITDA margin decreased to 36% (1H17: 43%). 

Cash flow
The lower EBITDA resulted in cash flow generated from operations decreasing to R6.9 billion (1H17: R11.7 billion). 
The group ended the period with a net cash position of R11.7 billion (1H17: R13.5 billion; 2H17: R13.9 billion) 
after allowing for capital expenditure of R1.4 billion for the period and the final 2017 cash dividend payment 
of R6.3 billion. Capital expenditure incurred related to stay-in-business (SIB) activities of R0.4 billion, 
deferred stripping capitalisation of R0.9 billion and expansion activities of R0.2 billion which included 
capital expenditure on Dingleton. 

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
There have been no material changes to the ore reserves and mineral resources as disclosed in the 2017 Kumba
Integrated Report.

REGULATORY UPDATE
Sishen consolidated mining right granted
The application to extend the mining right of Sishen through the inclusion of the adjacent Prospecting Rights 
was granted on 25 June 2017 and the grant was notarially executed on 29 June 2018. The grant allows Sishen 
mine to expand its current mining operations within the adjacent Dingleton area. 

The Mining Charter 2018
The publication of the draft 2018 Mining Charter by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 15 June 2018 has been noted.
All parties have until the end of August to respond to the draft, following the decision by the Minister of Mineral
Resources to extend the public consultation period. Kumba will participate in the process through its majority 
shareholder, Anglo American, who is preparing a submission in respect of the draft 2018 Mining Charter.

Kumba shares the acknowledgment made by the Minerals Council that the draft 2018 Mining Charter is an improvement on
the draft 2017 Mining Charter. However, we have concerns surrounding several significant issues in the draft Mining
Charter that we believe may affect the sustainability of the mining industry in South Africa, should they not be
reconsidered. 

Kumba has consistently affirmed its support for the Government's national transformation objectives in relation 
to the mining industry and acknowledges its role in promoting transformation in South Africa. To this end, we have 
a longstanding track record of driving and supporting transformation in the mining industry and beyond, while 
contributing significantly to South Africa's economic growth and development. 

Kumba believes that much more work needs to be done, in consultation with all stakeholders, to create a Mining 
Charter that promotes both investment for the long term and transformation. We look forward to the ongoing 
discussions with the Minister, the Department of Mineral Resources  (DMR) and other industry stakeholders to work 
towards these objectives.

The transfer of Thabazimbi to ArcelorMittal SA
As previously reported, Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (SIOC) and ArcelorMittal SA entered into an
agreement for the transfer of the Thabazimbi mine, together with the mining rights, to ArcelorMittal SA. The 
agreement is expected to come into effect by 28 September 2018, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. 
In the event that the conditions for transfer are not satisfied by 28 September 2018, the agreement will lapse 
and SIOC will proceed with the closure of the mine. 

On 10 July 2018, one of the key conditions precedent to the transfer was met as SIOC received the grant letter from
the DMR in respect of Section 11 of the MPRDA approving the transfer of the Thabazimbi
mining rights to ArcelorMittal SA. The employees, assets and liabilities of Thabazimbi mine will transfer to ArcelorMittal
SA at a nominal purchase consideration in addition to the assumed liabilities of which ArcelorMittal SA's contractual
liability are 97%. The Thabazimbi mine assets and related liabilities that will transfer have been presented separately
in the statement of financial position as assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale at 30 June 2018 
(refer to note 10 in the condensed consolidated financial statements). Current operating expenses represent closure 
activities.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
At a Special General Meeting on 10 July 2018, shareholders approved a new employee share ownership plan, called Karolo,
for qualifying employees of SIOC. The qualifying employees will be allocated units that are equal to Kumba shares, 
at no cost. This scheme replaces the Envision scheme which unwound in November 2016.

There were no further significant events that occurred from 30 June 2018 to the date of this report, not otherwise
dealt with in this report.

CHANGES IN DIRECTORATE
The following changes to the Board were announced during the first six months of the year:
- Allen Morgan stepped down as an independent non-executive director with effect from 11 May 2018.
- Terence Goodlace was appointed as lead independent non-executive director. Mr Goodlace stepped down as the 
  chairman of the Risk and Opportunities Committee and remains a member of the committee.
- Dolly Mokgatle was appointed as the chairman of the Risk and Opportunities Committee. Mrs Mokgatle stepped 
  down as the chairman of the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee but remained a member of the committee.
- Buyelwa Sonjica was appointed as the chairman of the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee.
- Ntombi Langa-Royds was appointed as chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, following 
  Mr Morgan's retirement from the Board and as the chairman of the committee.

CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT
The Board announced the appointment of:
- Darrin Strange as Chief operating officer with effect from 1 May 2018.
- Sam Martin as Executive Head: Strategy and business development with effect from 16 July 2018.

OUTLOOK
We will continue to drive our operations to reach their full potential through our 'Tswelelopele' strategy. Kumba is 
a world-class operation, we have a resilient business, committed employees and a winning strategy to deliver superior
value through the cycle. Through our strategy, we are driving value over volume and targeting R800 million of cost savings
for the year. We have progressed our resource development plan and will continue to work on increasing the life of mine.
Most importantly, we are striving to remain fatality free and continue to create value for shareholders.

Due to the logistical challenges experienced in the first six months of the year, our full year total sales guidance
has been revised to 42 - 44 Mt from 44 - 45 Mt. Consequently, full year guidance for production was revised down to 
43 - 44 Mt more closely aligned to rail supply levels as part of our integrated sales and operations planning drive 
and focus on optimal efficiency. Sishen's production guidance has been revised to 29 - 30 Mt while waste guidance 
remains unchanged at 170 - 180 Mt. Kolomela will continue to produce 14 Mt of product and 55 - 57 Mt of waste as 
previously guided.
 
As a result of lower production at Sishen, the full year unit cash cost of Sishen was revised to R300 - R310 per tonne.
Kolomela's unit cash cost guidance remains unchanged at R240 - R250 per tonne.

Our current capital expenditure outlook for 2018 (including deferred stripping) is R3.7 - R3.9 billion. This was
revised slightly lower from the previous outlook of R3.9 - R4.1 billion, mainly due to revised SIB project scheduling.

The presentation of the Company's results for the six months ended 30 June 2018 will be available on the Company's 
website www.angloamericankumba.com at 07:00 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11:00 CAT on 24 July 2018.

This measure of earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required in terms of International Financial 
Reporting Standards or the JSE Listings Requirements. Normalised earnings represents earnings from the 
recurring activities of the group.                                                        

Normalised earnings is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of Kumba 
for non-recurring expense or income items incurred during the year. The recognition and utilisation of the 
deferred tax asset is a non-recurring item and has therefore been adjusted in determining normalised
earnings.                                                        

NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the six months ended 30 June 2018
1.  CORPORATE INFORMATION
    Kumba is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in South Africa. The main business of Kumba, 
    its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is the exploration, extraction, beneficiation, marketing, 
    sale and shipping of iron ore. The group is listed on the JSE Limited (JSE).

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Kumba and its subsidiaries for the six months 
    ended 30 June 2018 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 20 July 2018.

2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of 
    BA Mazarura CA(SA), Chief financial officer, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the 
    South African Companies Act No 71 of 2008, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting 
    Practices Committee, the Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and in 
    compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements for interim reports.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical 
    cost convention except for certain financial instruments, discontinued operations and disposal group held for 
    sale, share-based payments, and biological assets which are stated at fair value, and are presented in Rand, 
    which is Kumba's functional and presentation currency. All financial information presented in Rand has been 
    rounded off to the nearest million.

    2.1. Going concern
         In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial 
         statements, the directors are required to consider whether the group can continue in operational 
         existence for the foreseeable future. The financial performance of the group is dependent upon the 
         wider economic environment in which the group operates. Factors exist which are outside the control 
         of management which can have a significant impact on the business, specifically the volatility in 
         the Rand/US$ exchange rate and the iron ore price.

         These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Board 
         is satisfied that the group is sufficiently liquid and solvent to be able to support the current operations 
         for the next 12 months.

    2.2. Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
         In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
         management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are 
         consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
         except as disclosed below.

    2.3. Accounting policies
         The accounting policies and methods of computation applied in the preparation of these condensed 
         consolidated interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards 
         and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous 
         consolidated annual financial statements.

         2.3.1. New standards effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
                The following standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations which become 
                effective for the year commencing on 1 January 2018 were adopted by the group:

                a. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  
                   IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and sets out the updated requirements for the recognition and measurement 
                   of financial instruments. These requirements specifically deal with the classification and 
                   measurement of financial instruments, measurement of impairment losses based on an expected 
                   credit loss model and closer alignment between hedge accounting and risk management practices.

                   The adoption of this new standard had no material impact on the group's earnings for the period.

                b. IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 
                   IFRS 15 replaces all existing revenue requirements in IFRS and applies to all revenue arising 
                   from contracts with customers. The standard requires an entity to recognise revenue in such a 
                   manner as to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount representing 
                   the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods 
                   or services. 

                   The group's revenue is primarily derived from commodity sales for which the point of recognition 
                   is dependent on the contract sales terms known as the International Commercial terms (Incoterms). 
                   Under Incoterms (i.e. cost, insurance and freight (CIF) and cost and freight (CFR)), the seller 
                   is required to contract, and pay, for the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to a 
                   named port of destination. 
                        
                   Consequently, the freight service on export commodity contracts with CIF/CFR Incoterms represents 
                   a separate performance obligation as defined under IFRS 15 and as such, a portion of the revenue 
                   earned under these contracts, representing the obligation to perform the freight service, is 
                   deferred and recognised when this obligation has been fulfilled, along with the associated costs.

                   The impact of applying the standard in the period ended 30 June 2018 is:
                   - Net increase in profit of R6 million
                   - No material impact on opening retained earnings, therefore prior year figures were not restated
                   - Increase in current assets of R106 million
                   - Increase in current liabilities of R100 million

         2.3.2. New standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not effective and have 
                not been early adopted
                At the date of authorisation of these interim financial statements, the following standards, amendments 
                to existing standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective for the current year and 
                have not been early adopted.

                These standards, amendments and interpretations will be effective for annual periods beginning after 
                the dates listed below:
                IFRS 16 Leases effective for years commencing on or after 1 January 2019
                IFRS 16 Leases will become effective for the group from 1 January 2019, replacing IAS 17 Leases. The group 
                has completed its impact assessment and is continuing to work on the necessary changes to internal 
                systems and processes.

                The group has elected to adopt the modified retrospective transition approach and therefore the cumulative 
                effect of transition to IFRS 16 will be recognised in retained earnings and the comparative period will not 
                be restated. The principal impact of IFRS 16 will be to change the accounting treatment by lessees of 
                leases currently classified as operating leases. Lease agreements will give rise to the recognition by 
                the lessee of a right of use asset and a related liability for future lease payments. 

                The most significant expected impact of transitioning to IFRS 16 based upon our current contractual 
                arrangements is estimated to be recognising a lease liability of approximately R400 million to 
                R500 million and a right of use asset of approximately R300 million to R400 million, with the 
                balance representing an adjustment to retained earnings. The right of use asset will principally relate to 
                rental of properties and mining equipment.

                Depreciation of the right of use asset and the finance charge representing the unwinding of the discount 
                on the lease liability will be recorded in the statement of profit and loss. The impact of the standard 
                on EBITDA and profit before tax following adoption is not expected to be significant although the 
                presentation of the cost of leases in the statement of profit and loss will change.

                Management will continue to assess the implications of IFRS 16 on any new contracts or modifications 
                to existing contracts, which may cause the financial impact to differ from the estimates provided above.

    2.4. Change in estimates
         The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions are a key area where 
         management's judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected 
         future cash flows required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the 
         use of certain estimates and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and 
         the discount rate. The closure provisions are updated at each reporting period date, for changes in these 
         estimates.

         The life of mine plan (LoMP) on which accounting estimates are based only includes proved and probable ore 
         reserves as disclosed in Kumba's 2017 annual ore reserves and mineral resources statement. The most 
         significant changes in the provision for 2018 arises from the change in the LoMP as well as the timing 
         of the expected cash flows for both Sishen and Kolomela mines. 

         The effect of the change in estimate of the rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions, which was applied 
         prospectively from 1 January 2018, is detailed below:

8.  TAXATION
    The group's effective tax rate was 27% for the period (30 June 2017: 23% and 31 December 2017: 25%).

9.  SEGMENTAL REPORTING
    Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
    operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
    performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Kumba Executive Committee.

    The Kumba Executive Committee considers the business principally according to the nature of the products 
    and services provided, with the identified segments each representing a strategic business unit. 
    'Other segments' comprise corporate, administration and other expenditure not allocated to the 
    reported segments.

    The total reported segment revenue comprises revenue from external customers, and is measured in a manner 
    consistent with that disclosed in the statement of profit and loss. The performance of the operating 
    segments is assessed based on earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), 
    which is considered a more appropriate measure of profitability for the group's business. Finance 
    income and finance costs are not allocated to segments, as treasury activity is managed on a central 
    group basis.

    Total segment assets comprise finished goods inventory only, which is allocated based on the operations 
    of the segment and the physical location of the asset.

    Depreciation, staff costs, impairment of assets and additions to property, plant and equipment are not 
    reported to the CODM per segment, but are significant items which are included in EBITDA and/or reported 
    on for the group as a whole.

13. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
    On 29 June 2018, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued the group with additional income tax assessments 
    relating to a tax audit on the deductibility of certain expenditure incurred, covering the 2012 - 2014 years of 
    assessment. The group is in the process of preparing an objection to these assessments after consultation with 
    external tax and legal advisers. The group believes that these matters have been appropriately treated in the 
    results for the period ended 30 June 2018.

14. GUARANTEES
    The total guarantees issued in favour of the DMR in respect of the group's environmental closure liabilities at 
    30 June 2018 were R2.9 billion (30 June 2017: R2.8 billion and 31 December 2017: R2.8 billion). Included in 
    this amount are financial guarantees for the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of 
    the group to the DMR in respect of Thabazimbi mine of R438 million (30 June 2017: R438 million and 
    31 December 2017: R438 million). ArcelorMittal SA has guaranteed R429 million of this amount by means 
    of bank guarantees issued in favour of SIOC.

    As a result of the annual revision of closure costs, a shortfall of R202 million arose. Guarantees in respect 
    of the shortfall will be issued in due course.

15. REGULATORY UPDATE
    Mining Charter
    The publication of the draft 2018 Mining Charter by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 15 June 2018 has been 
    noted. All parties have until the end of August to respond to the draft, following the decision by the Minister 
    of Mineral Resources to extend the public consultation period. Kumba will participate in the process through its 
    majority shareholder, Anglo American, who is preparing its submission in respect of the draft 2018 Mining Charter.

    Kumba shares the acknowledgment made by the Minerals Council that the draft 2018 Mining Charter is an improvement 
    on the draft 2017 Mining Charter. However, we have concerns surrounding several significant issues in the draft
    Mining Charter that we believe may affect the sustainability of the mining industry in South Africa, should they 
    not be reconsidered.

    Kumba has consistently affirmed its support for the Government's national transformation objectives 
    in relation to the mining industry and acknowledges its role in promoting transformation in South Africa. 
    To this end, we have a longstanding track record of driving and supporting transformation in 
    the mining industry and beyond, while contributing significantly to South Africa's economic growth and 
    development.

    Kumba believes that more work needs to be done, in consultation with all stakeholders, to create a 
    Mining Charter that promotes both investment for the long term and transformation. We look forward to the 
    ongoing discussions with the Minister, the DMR and other industry stakeholders to work towards these objectives.

16. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
    The group subscribes to the Code of Good Corporate Practices and Conduct and complies with the recommendations 
    of the King IVTM* Report. The Board charter is aligned with the provisions of all relevant statutory and regulatory 
    requirements including among others, King IVTM*. Full disclosure of the group's compliance is contained in the 
    2017 Integrated Report.
    *Copyright and trademarks are owned by the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa NPC and all of its rights 
     are reserved.
    
17. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
    At a Special General Meeting on 10 July 2018, shareholders approved a new employee share ownership plan, called 
    Karolo, for qualifying employees of SIOC. The qualifying employees will be allocated units that are equal 
    to Kumba shares, at no cost. This scheme replaces the Envision scheme which unwound in November 2016.

    There have been no other material events subsequent to 30 June 2018, not otherwise dealt with in this report.

18. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT
    The auditors, Deloitte & Touche, have issued their unmodified review report on the condensed consolidated 
    interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The review was conducted in accordance 
    with ISRE 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.

    A copy of the auditor's report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is available for 
    inspection at the Company's registered office.

    The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all the information contained in the financial results. 
    Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the review engagement, 
    they should obtain a copy of the auditor's report, together with the accompanying financial information 
    from the registered office.

    Any reference to future financial performance included in this announcement has not been reviewed or 
    reported on by the Company's auditors.

Kumba Iron Ore Limited Production and Sales Report for the quarter ended 30 June 2018

Kumba Iron Ore Limited (“Kumba”) announces its production and sales report for the quarter
ended 30 June 2018 (“Q2 2018”). Throughout this report, production and sales volumes referred

Overview:
- Safety performance continued to improve on all fronts with Kumba maintaining its fatality free
  track record.
- Total production increased by 2% compared to Q2 2017 due to a solid operational
  performance from both Sishen and Kolomela.
- Export sales increased by 1% to 9.6Mt and were adversely affected by derailments along the
  iron ore export channel.

Kumba delivered a solid operational performance across the board in Q2 2018. Sishen and
Kolomela have both continued to benefit from productivity improvements.

Sishen’s waste stripping increased by 4% to 44.4Mt, from the 42.7Mt produced in Q2 2017 due
to ongoing improvements in productivity. The full year guidance for waste stripping remains
unchanged at 170-180Mt.
 
Kolomela’s production increased by 4% to 3.6Mt compared to 3.5Mt in Q2 2017, supported by
the full ramp-up of the DMS modular plant performance. Waste stripping of 13.1Mt decreased
from 15.3Mt due to high rainfall. Full year production and waste stripping guidance remains
unchanged at 14Mt and 55-57Mt respectively.

Export sales increased marginally by 1% to 9.6Mt compared to 9.4Mt in Q2 2017. Relative to Q1
2018, however export sales decreased by 4% due to derailments and sub-optimal rail
performance. This, coupled with severe weather disruptions at Saldanha port, has led to high
levels of finished product inventory of 6.2Mt at 30 June 2018.

Kumba is working closely with Transnet to secure delivery of the contractual capacity and to
mitigate further derailments. Due to the rail performance challenges experienced in the first six
months of the year, the full year total sales guidance has been revised to 42-44Mt from 44–
45Mt. The full year guidance for production was revised down to 43-44Mt to more closely align
to rail supply levels, as part of the integrated sales and operations planning drive and focus on
optimal efficiency.

Updated trading statement for the six months ended 30 June 2018

Kumba’s financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (“the period”), will be released
on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (“SENS”) on 24 July 2018.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings requirements, and further to the
trading statement released on SENS on 25 June 2018 in which the Company indicated that
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period would
be at least 20% lower than the previous six months ended 30 June 2017 (“the comparative
period”), Kumba advises shareholders that headline earnings for the period are likely to be
between R2,884 million and R3,033 million, a decrease of between 34% and 37%, with basic
earnings for the period expected to be between R2,851 million and R2,998 million, a decrease of
between 35% and 38%. HEPS is likely to be between R9.02 and R9.49, a decrease of between
34% and 37%. Basic EPS is expected to be between R8.92 and R9.38, a decrease of between
35% and 38%.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the comparative period (released on SENS
on 25 July 2017) were R4,603 million and R4,586 million respectively, while reported HEPS and
EPS for the comparative period were R14.42 and R14.37 respectively.

The expected decrease in earnings for the period is largely attributable to the impact of a stronger
Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, lower export iron ore prices relative to the comparative period as
well as derailments on the Iron Ore Export Channel. Further information will be provided in the
Company’s results for the period to be released on SENS on 24 July 2018.

The financial information, on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDING 30 JUNE 2018

Kumba’s financial results for the six months ending 30 June 2018 (""the period"") will be released on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 24 July 2018.

The period under review has seen further gains in operational and cost efficiencies building on the momentum
established in 2017. The positive impact of these gains on our expected earnings for the period are, however, likely to
be more than offset by the impact of a stronger Rand/US Dollar exchange rate and lower export iron ore prices relative
to the comparative six months ended 30 June 2017 (""the comparative period""), as well as derailments on the Iron Ore
Export Channel.

As a result of the above and in accordance with paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements,
shareholders are advised that both headline earnings and basic earnings for the period are likely to be at least R921
million and R917 million lower (at least 20% lower), respectively, than reported headline earnings and basic earnings
for the comparative period. Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) and earnings per share (“EPS”) are also likely to be
at least R2.88 and R2.87 per share lower (at least 20% lower), respectively, than reported HEPS and EPS for the
comparative period.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the comparative period (SENS release on 25 July 2017) were
R4,603 million and R4,586 million respectively, while reported HEPS and EPS for the comparative period were R14.42
and R14.37 respectively.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the Company’s external auditors. A further trading statement will be released as soon as the Company has reasonable
certainty on the expected HEPS and EPS ranges for the period.

Kumba Iron Ore Limited Transfer of Securities

In accordance with section 122(3)(b) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008 (""Companies Act""), and
paragraph 3.83(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, Kumba advises its shareholders that
Anglo American plc (“Anglo American”) has transferred its entire 69.71% beneficial interest in the
Company from one wholly owned subsidiary in South Africa to another.

This transfer is administrative in nature, has no impact on Anglo American’s beneficial interest in
Kumba and forms part of a longstanding exercise by Anglo American to simplify its corporate
structure in South Africa.

Specifically, Anglo South Africa Capital Proprietary Limited (""ASAC""), all of the ordinary shares of
which are owned by Anglo American, has transferred its entire 69.71% beneficial interest in the
issued ordinary shares (“ordinary shares"") of the Company such that as a result ASAC no longer
holds any beneficial interest in the Company. Anglo South Africa Proprietary Limited, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Anglo American, has acquired that same beneficial interest in the ordinary
shares of the Company such that as a result it now holds a 69.71% beneficial interest in the
ordinary shares of the Company.

As required in terms of section 122(3)(a) of the Companies Act, the Company has filed the required
notices with the Takeover Regulation Panel.

Sishen production decreased by 5% to 7.3Mt, and by 6% relative to Q4 2017. This was primarily
driven by lower DMS plant production due to short-term mining feedstock constraints which were
partially offset by higher yields from both the DMS and JIG plants. Waste stripping remained in
line with Q4 2017 at 42.2Mt and increased by 24% compared to Q1 2017 as a result of the
continued improvement in efficiencies. Production and waste stripping rates are expected to be
maintained at levels required to meet the full year guidance of 30-31Mt and 170-180Mt,
respectively.

Kolomela production increased by 26% to 3.5Mt, driven by higher plant throughput and the full
ramp-up of the DMS modular plant. In comparison to Q4 2017, production decreased by 9% as a
result of wet weather conditions which reduced primary equipment tempos. Waste stripping
increased by 32% to 13.4Mt due to improved efficiencies. The full year production guidance for
Kolomela remains at 14Mt, with waste stripping at 55-57Mt.

Export sales decreased by 1% to 9.9Mt below the Q1 2017 level. However, relative to Q4 2017,
this was a 12% decrease following derailments which impacted export sales by 1.1Mt. Kumba is
working closely with Transnet to mitigate derailments and currently expects to meet full year
guidance with total sales of 44–45Mt. Total finished product stock is 4.6Mt, compared to 4.3Mt as
at 31 December 2017.

COMMENTARY
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SAFETY, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCIES DELIVERED
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief executive of Kumba, said, ""I am pleased to report that Kumba has delivered 
on our key objectives for 2017. Most importantly, our safety initiatives resulted in a fatality-free 
year with material improvement across our key indicators. At Sishen, our focus on all aspects of the 
value chain resulted in productivity gains by the fleet whilst we also delivered improved plant 
efficiencies and higher yields. These factors contributed to production above guidance with an overall 
increase of 8% to 45 Mt. Higher production, together with ongoing cost discipline, contained unit costs 
below guidance. 

Stronger operational performance has been our priority which, coupled with our focus on costs and 
ongoing capital discipline, resulted in the delivery of attributable free cash flow of R12.3 billion.
 
Overall, whilst both the operational and financial delivery has been strong, there remains more that can 
be done to realise the full potential of our assets and we remain committed to building on these gains 
in 2018.""

OVERVIEW 
The focus on safety remains a key priority for the group. The continuous effort in our safety performance 
included a focus on fatality elimination with an emphasis on leadership, operational risk management, 
implementation of critical controls and learning from incidents. This has resulted in encouraging improvements 
reflected in our leading indicator reporting. No fatalities were recorded during 2017. High potential incidents, 
which are those that could have resulted in a fatal accident, have reduced by 46% in 2017. On the lagging 
indicators, the total recordable case frequency rate, which is a measure of frequency of injuries, dropped 17% 
to 0.65 (2016: 0.78) and the lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) decreased 39% to 0.17 (2016: 0.28). Kumba 
mined total tonnes of 271.3 Mt during 2017, an increase of 12%. Total production increased to 45 Mt due to 
significant productivity improvements at Sishen, which achieved 31.1 Mt, and a continued solid performance at 
Kolomela, delivering 13.9 Mt. Total export sales volumes increased by 7% to 41.6 Mt (2016: 39.1 Mt)
due to higher production, whilst total sales volumes increased by 6% to 44.9 Mt (2016: 42.5 Mt).

Kumba achieved an average cash breakeven price of US$40/tonne (62%Fe CFR China), an increase of US$11/tonne 
from the average for the 2016 year. Controllable costs increased by US$1/tonne as mining related inflation and 
higher mining volumes from a rising stripping ratio were partially offset by production gains and operating 
efficiency improvements. Non-controllable costs rose by US$10/tonne as a result of lower market premiums 
(US$1/tonne), higher freight rates (US$5/tonne), and a stronger currency which added US$4/tonne. 

Headline earnings increased by 12% to R9.7 billion (2016: R8.7 billion), mainly as a result of an 11% increase 
in the average realised iron ore export price to US$71/tonne (2016: US$64/tonne), and 6% higher total sales 
volumes. Attributable and headline earnings for the year were R38.63 and R30.47 per share respectively 
(2016: R26.98 and R27.30). The increase in attributable earnings is mainly due to the increase in revenue and 
the reversal of the impairment charge recognised in 2015. 

DIVIDEND 
In accordance with the Board's policy of returning excess cash to shareholders whilst retaining a high level 
of balance sheet flexibility, a discretionary approach continues to be applied. The Board has declared a final 
cash dividend of R15 per share, which together with the interim dividend, results in a total dividend for the 
year of R30.97 per share.  

The Board will continue to assess the group's requirements at each interim and annual reporting period, taking 
into account the prevailing risks and opportunities, as well as the future earnings outlook.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Platts 62% Fe CFR index gained 22% year on year, averaging US$71/tonne during 2017, on the back of 
improved demand conditions and slower iron ore supply growth. China's Fixed Asset Investment expanded 7.2% year 
on year while stricter enforcement of environmental regulations saw around 200 Mt of obsolete steelmaking capacity 
being taken offline through the year, increasing domestic steel prices by 60%. Amid record profitability levels, 
Chinese mills sought to maximise productivity and consequently preferred premium quality ores, pushing product 
premia and discounts to record highs. Consequently, the Platts 65/Platts 62 index differential rose to a record 
US$25.20/dmt in October and averaged US$16.09/dmt for 2017, around two and a half times more compared to the 
2016 level. 

Seaborne iron ore supply growth slowed, with the traditional supply basins of Australia, Brazil and South Africa
adding a combined 41 million wet metric tonnes of iron ore supply to the seaborne market - the lowest level 
since 2006. However, strengthening iron ore prices incentivised some high cost supply back into the market, 
with shipments from marginal seaborne suppliers rising 11% year on year, primarily driven by India.

Lump premiums were volatile in 2017. The premium fell to an historic low of almost 2 US cents/dmtu in April 
but then witnessed a sustained recovery to reach a new record high of almost 46 US cents/dmtu in September with 
2017 averaging at 15 US cents/dmtu. The anti-pollution drive in China buoyed the demand for direct charge ores 
including lumps.

Despite the challenging first quarter, the group produced a total of 45 Mt. 

Sishen mine
The new mine plan and ongoing implementation of the Operating Model delivered further productivity gains, 
including significant fleet productivity improvements, and were the main drivers of Sishen's strong performance. 
The mine implemented increased operator training, changed shift patterns and introduced more accountability at 
supervisory levels. Through these measures and higher attendance rates from a committed workforce, the mine has 
been able to increase direct operating hours (DOH), adding extra production hours per day. In the pit, wider benches, 
changed blast sizes and improved shovel productivity contributed to an increase in mining volumes. 

Total tonnes mined at Sishen increased by 12% to 199.5 Mt (2016: 178.3 Mt) with 39% fewer trucks. Consistent with the
mine plan, the stripping ratio increased to 4.3 compared to 3.3 in 2016. Consequently, the amount of waste mined also
increased, as planned, to 162 Mt (2016: 137 Mt). Sishen's production increased by 10% to 31.1 Mt (2016: 28.4 Mt) due 
to increased plant throughput and higher plant yields. 

The Dingleton project is substantially complete, with 496 homes relocated and continuing negotiations in progress with
the remaining 14 households still to be relocated.

Kolomela mine
Total tonnes mined increased by 12% to 71.8 Mt (2016: 64 Mt). Waste mined was 55.6 Mt (2016: 50.2 Mt), an increase of
11%, supporting higher production levels. Kolomela's production was 9% higher at 13.9 Mt (2016: 12.7 Mt), reflecting
productivity improvements. Productivity and efficiencies of the Kolomela drill fleet increased by 20% with the
introduction of automated drilling technology. The Kolomela modular plant delivered 0.5 Mt, although performance was 
affected by delays in the ramp-up of the crushing plant. 

Operating Model
The Operating Model ensures more stable operations, reduced variability and enhanced capability and efficiency,
providing a structured approach for continuous improvement.
 
Implementation at Sishen during 2017 focused on support and services work, which enables a fully integrated view of
all activities in the pit. The most visible and immediate impact was the reduction of unscheduled work by up to 40% 
in some areas. This has a direct impact on safety, planned work, productivity, elimination of waste and improvement 
in efficiencies. Scheduled compliance and scheduled work are two of the important leading indicators of stability in 
the process.
 
At Kolomela a 7.6% improvement in Direct Shipping Ore plant throughput was achieved while Sishen has achieved an 84%
improvement in mine to plan compliance since 2015. The stabilised roll-outs at the Kolomela plant and Sishen shovel
maintenance areas continue to demonstrate benefits. 

Logistics
Despite severe weather disruptions at port and rail in the early part of 2017, Kumba's higher production led to a 6%
increase in volumes railed on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore Export Channel to 42 Mt (2016: 39.8 Mt). 

Following a strong fourth quarter, Kumba shipped 41.6 Mt (2016: 38.7 Mt) from the Saldanha port destined for the
export market, an increase of 7%, including 1.4 Mt shipped through the multi-purpose terminal (MPT) at the 
Saldanha port.

Sales
Total export sales increased by 7% to 41.6 Mt (2016: 39.1 Mt), including 0.6 Mt sourced from third party producers,
whilst total sales were 44.9 Mt (2016: 42.5 Mt), consistent with higher production levels. CFR sales accounted for 
69% of export sales volumes (2016: 70%). Finished product inventory held at the mines and ports increased from 3.5 Mt 
to 4.3 Mt. China accounted for 63% (2016: 64%) of Kumba's export sales portfolio while the share of EU/MENA/Americas 
region increased to 18%, as Kumba further diversified its customer portfolio in the region. The group's lump:fine 
ratio was higher at 66:34 for the year (2016: 64:36).

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue
Total revenue increased by 14% to R46.4 billion compared to R40.8 billion for 2016, mainly as a result of the 11%
increase in the average realised iron ore export price to US$71/tonne (2016: US$64/tonne), and 6% higher total sales
volumes. These gains were partially offset by the 9% strengthening of the average Rand/US$ exchange rate to R13.30/US$1 
(2016: R14.69/US$1). Firmer freight rates resulted in a R1.7 billion increase in shipping revenue.

Kumba's average achieved FOB price improved by US$7/tonne compared to 2016, driven by stronger average iron ore index
prices and higher lump premiums, offsetting the impact of higher freight rates. The average 62% Platts index increased
by US$13/tonne, whilst the achieved lump premium increased by US$0.31/tonne and freight rates increased by US$5/tonne
compared to 2016. 

Average Platts Index lump premiums largely stabilised at US$0.15/dmtu on the back of improved demand for direct 
charge material.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses, excluding the reversal of the Sishen impairment, increased by 17% to R29.8 billion compared to
R25.4 billion in the prior year, principally as a result of the 12% increase in total mining volumes, together with 
the 8% increase in production volumes and inflationary pressure on input costs. This was partially offset by savings 
in mining costs from productivity measures, overhead reductions and less use of contractors. Selling and distribution 
costs increased by 3% in real terms, driven by a 6% increase in sales volumes railed.

Higher freight costs of R1.4 billion were incurred due to the average Platts freight rate on the Saldanha-Qingdao
route increasing to US$12/tonne. Spot freight rates averaged US$11.54/tonne, a 66% increase from US$6.95/tonne in 2016.
 
Cost savings were achieved through comprehensive programmes aimed at reducing overheads and on-mine costs, which,
together with higher production, resulted in unit cash costs being lower than guidance. 

Unit cash costs at Sishen decreased by 3% to R287/tonne (2016: R296/tonne). This was primarily a result of higher
production volumes and cost savings from the continued improvements in operating efficiencies, partially offset 
by mining related cost escalations and the higher stripping ratio of 4.3 (2016: 3.3) which increased waste volumes 
by 18%. 

Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R237/tonne (2016: R201/tonne), an 18% increase in line with expectations,
due to higher mining volumes, above inflationary pressures from higher fuel prices, and additional costs associated 
with the modular plant. The modular plant costs will continue to be incurred in future.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
EBITDA of R19.6 billion was 6% higher compared to R18.4 billion in the previous year, on the back of a 6% 
improvement in total sales volumes and an 11% increase in the average realised FOB export iron ore price to 
US$71/tonne (2016: US$64/tonne), partially offset by an increase in mining volumes and cost inflation, including higher 
freight rates. 

Kumba's EBITDA margin decreased by 3 percentage points to 42% (2016: 45%), mainly as a result of uncontrollable
factors such as the increase in freight rates. The group's mining operating margin decreased to 40% (2016: 41%), 
excluding the net freight loss incurred on shipping operations, mainly as a result of long-term fixed price chartering 
contracts. Net profit (after the impairment reversal) increased by 45% to R16.1 billion (2016: R11.1 billion).

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operations increased by 30% to R22.4 billion (2016: R17.2 billion), driven by higher average
realised iron ore prices and increased sales volumes. The group ended the year with a net cash position of R13.9 billion
(2016: R6.2 billion). The group's working capital remains healthy. The decrease in trade and other receivables of 
R2.5 billion is mainly due to an increase in collections in December 2017 compared to the prior year. 

Capital expenditure of R3.1 billion was incurred: R1.3 billion on stay-in-business (SIB) activities, R1.2 billion on
deferred stripping, and R0.6 billion on expansions, which comprised R0.3 billion on the Dingleton project and 
R0.3 billion on the Sishen modular plant. The relocation of the remaining houses in Dingleton is expected to be 
completed during 2018.

Impairment review
Given the improved market conditions since the 2015 year end when an impairment charge of R6 billion was recognised
for Sishen, it was considered appropriate to re-assess the mine's recoverable amount at 31 December 2017. Sishen has
achieved improved levels of production and operating efficiencies. Additionally, whilst the long term outlook for 
iron ore has remained broadly unchanged since 2015, the outlook for market conditions in the nearer term has improved. 
These factors have resulted in an increase in the recoverable amount of the mine to above its previous carrying value. 
In this context, the impairment charge previously recognised was reversed.

Refer to note 5 in the summarised consolidated financial statements which details the key assumptions applied.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
The following changes were recorded for the 2017 Kumba Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Statement.
 
Kumba's total ore reserves as at 31 December 2017 are estimated to be 676.4 Mt (at 59.6% Fe) at Sishen and Kolomela, 
a net decrease of 9% from 744 Mt in 2016.
 
Sishen's ore reserves decreased 9% year-on-year, mainly attributable to the annual accelerated production on the back
of improved mining productivity, and more stringent resource-to-reserve modifications.

As a result of the productivity improvements built into the updated life of mine plan, Sishen's reserve life has
reduced from 17 years in 2016 to 13 years in 2017.

A more stringent resource-to-reserve conversion approach was adopted at Kolomela to ensure that the direct shipping
ore operation continues to deliver a niche high-grade product that will maintain Kumba's realised price. This is now
similar to the approach applied at Sishen mine and resulted in Kolomela's reserve life reducing from 18 years in 2016, 
to 14 years in 2017. Kolomela's ore reserves decreased by 8% year-on-year due to annual production. 

Kumba's estimated mineral resources, in addition to its ore reserves, totalled 1.2 billion tonnes (at 46.7% Fe), a
year-on-year increase of 9%.

REGULATORY UPDATE 
The Reviewed Mining Charter (MCIII)
In June 2017, the South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) published its Reviewed Mining Charter 2017
(MCIII). Kumba expressed its concern that the MCIII was not concluded through agreement between the DMR and all 
relevant stakeholders.
 
Kumba is supportive of the legal action followed by the Chamber of Mines, with the ultimate objective of arriving at a
negotiated solution that is practical to implement, and which preserves and enhances investment in what is a critically
important industry for South Africa. Kumba welcomed the DMR's written undertaking that the provisions of the 2017
Reviewed Mining Charter will not be implemented or applied in any way, pending judgment in the review application 
brought by the Chamber of Mines. The hearing on the Chamber of Mine's Declarator on the ""once empowered always empowered"" 
issue was heard in November 2017, with the outcome expected after 90 days. The hearing on the review of the Mining Charter 
has been set for 19 to 21 February 2018. 

Sishen consolidated mining right granted
Sishen's application to extend the mining right by the inclusion of the adjacent Prospecting Rights was granted on 6
July 2017 and the process to amend the Sishen mining right continues. Mining operations in this area will only commence
once the required environmental authorisation has been approved, which is expected soon. The grant allows Sishen mine to
expand its current mining operations within the adjacent Dingleton area. 

Thabazimbi transfer to ArcelorMittal SA 
Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (SIOC) and ArcelorMittal SA announced in 2016 that they had entered into 
an agreement to transfer Thabazimbi mine to ArcelorMittal SA, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. As the 
DMR has not yet issued the Section 11 the deadline has been extended to 31 March 2018. If the conditions are not satisfied 
by this time and there is no agreement by the parties to extend it, the agreement will lapse and SIOC will proceed with 
the closure of the mine. 

The agreement is expected to become effective in the second half of 2018, at which time the employees, assets and
liabilities will transfer to ArcelorMittal SA at a nominal purchase consideration plus the assumed liabilities of 
which 97% is already ArcelorMittal SA's contractual liability. The Thabazimbi mine assets and related liabilities 
that will transfer have been presented separately in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the disposal 
group held for sale at 31 December 2017 (refer to note 12 in the summarised consolidated financial statements).

OUTLOOK
Full year production guidance for 2018 is between 44 to 45 Mt. Sishen is expected to produce between 30 to 31 Mt of
product and mine between 170 to 180 Mt of waste in 2018. Sishen's stripping ratio is expected to exceed 4 in 2018, 
with the LoM average at ~4. Kolomela's production guidance for 2018 is around 14 Mt and waste of 55 to 57 Mt. 
Kolomela's stripping ratio is expected to exceed 3.5 in 2018, with the LoM average at ~4. 

Total sales volumes of 44 to 45 Mt are expected in 2018. Domestic sales volumes of up to 6.25 Mt are contracted to
ArcelorMittal SA in terms of the supply agreement, however, around 3 Mt is the expected volume for 2018.
Sishen unit costs are expected to be between R295/tonne and R305/tonne and Kolomela unit costs to be between R240/tonne 
and R250/tonne in 2018. 

Capital expenditure for 2018, including deferred stripping, is expected to be in the range of R3.9 billion to 
R4.1 billion. 

The group's performance remains sensitive to the volatility in iron ore export prices and the Rand/US$ exchange 
rate. 

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded, ""Building on our strong results this year, we want to make sure we are taking the 
right steps to ensure a sustainable long-term business for Kumba, in order to maximise value for all our 
stakeholders.

We have structured our full potential transformation agenda around three horizons to improve the performance 
of our current assets in the near term, to invest to grow our core business over the medium term and in the 
longer term to consider expansion into attractive opportunities.

Our priority now is on driving operations to unlock their full potential, rationalising external expenditure,
reinforcing the integration of sales and operational planning and building a more effective organisation. In the 
medium and longer term we will focus on development of new technologies to process lower grade material and life 
extension projects. As we progress on this transformation journey, we will keep the market informed.""

This measure of normalised earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required in terms of International 
Financial Reporting Standards or the JSE Listings Requirements. Normalised earnings represents earnings 
from the recurring activities of the group. 
                                         
This is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of Kumba for non-recurring 
expense or income items incurred during the year. The recognition and utilisation of the deferred tax asset 
is a non-recurring item and has therefore been adjusted in determining normalised earnings.

    its consolidated financial statements.                                          
                                                                                                                                      
 4. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES                                                                                                             
    The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions is a key area where management's 
    judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows 
    required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use of certain estimates 
    and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate. The closure 
    provisions are updated at each reporting period date, for changes in these estimates. The life of mine plan (LoMP) 
    on which accounting estimates are based only includes proved and probable ore reserves as disclosed in Kumba's annual 
    ore reserves and mineral resources statement. The most significant changes in the provisions for 2017 arises from the 
    change in the LoMP as well as the timing of the expected cash flows for both Sishen and Kolomela. The effect of the 
    change in estimate of the rehabilitation and decommissioning provision, which was applied prospectively from 
    1 January 2017, is detailed below:

    The change in estimate of the decommissioning provision has been capitalised to the related property, plant and equipment 
    and as a result had an insignificant effect on profit or earnings per share.

    Expansion capital expenditure comprises mainly of the expenditure on the Dingleton relocation project and Sishen's 
    second modular plant. SIB capital expenditure to maintain operations was principally related to infrastructure to 
    support mining and plant operations. 
    
    The increase in the deferred stripping costs is mainly attributable to the increase in the actual stripping ratio of 
    the Sishen mine components to which the capitalisation relates.    
    
    Impairment reversal                                                                                                               
    Kumba produces iron ore at Sishen and Kolomela mines in the Northern Cape Province. The two mines are treated as 
    separate cash generating units (CGUs). The Sishen CGU consists of the Sishen mining assets located in the Northern Cape 
    and an allocation of corporate assets.    
    
    At 31 December 2015, the Sishen CGU was impaired by R6 billion, with an associated deferred tax credit of 
    R1.7 billion as a result of a deterioration in the long-term outlook for iron ore prices, which led to a 
    reconfiguration of the Sishen pit shell to improve cash flows. The carrying amount of the Sishen CGU, consisting of 
    property, plant and equipment, at 31 December 2017 was R19.4 billion. The remaining balance of the impairment, after 
    deducting notional depreciation, was R4.8 billion, including the remaining balance of the associated deferred tax of 
    R1.3 billion. Kolomela was never impaired.
    
    During 2017, Sishen mine achieved improved levels of production and operating efficiencies. Additionally, whilst the 
    long-term outlook for the iron ore price has remained broadly unchanged since 2015, the outlook for market conditions 
    in the nearer term has improved. Consequently, the recoverable amount of Sishen mine has been assessed and the previous 
    impairment reversed. The revised carrying value is now R24.2 billion and was increased by R4.8 billion (R2.6 billion 
    after tax and non-controlling interests). 
    
    The recoverable amount, based on discounted cash flows, is sensitive to changes in input assumptions particularly 
    in relation to future iron ore prices and Rand/US$ foreign exchange rates. For example, a US$5/tonne increase or 
    decrease in the long-term price forecast for iron ore equates to a R3.2 billion increase or R3.5 billion decrease 
    in the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount has been assessed under a range of valuation scenarios, 
    incorporating downside adjustments to both operating and economic assumptions, all of which indicate headroom over 
    the revised carrying value of R24.2 billion. For example, under the most conservative long-term downside case, the 
    headroom is R6.7 billion.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    Cash flow projections were determined for the life of the Sishen mine. Inputs into the discounted cash flow model 
    were based on economic assumptions and forecast trading conditions drawn up by management. To the extent that 
    specific risk factors were not incorporated into the discount rate, adjustments were made to the cash flow 
    projections.
    
    Of this reversal, R368 million has been recorded against land and buildings, R347 million against buildings and 
    infrastructure, R2.3 billion against machinery, plant and equipment, R812 million against site preparation and 
    development, R910 million against assets under construction and R61 million against mineral rights.
    
    Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine whether a reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions 
    would result in an additional impairment, partial reversal or no reversal of the previous impairment. Reasonable 
    downward changes in any of the key assumptions would still provide sufficient headroom to support full reversal 
    of the impairment recognised in 2015.

11. SEGMENTAL REPORTING                                                                                                                                          
    Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
    operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
    of the operating segments, has been identified as the Kumba Executive Committee. 
    
    The Kumba Executive Committee considers the business principally according to the nature of the products and 
    services provided, with the identified segments each representing a strategic business unit. ""Other segments"" 
    compromise corporate, administration and other expenditure not allocated to the reported segments. 
    
    The total reported segment revenue comprises revenue from external customers, and is measured in a manner consistent
    with that disclosed in the income statement. During the year, the group changed the basis of assessing the 
    performance of the operating segments. The performance of the operating segments is assessed based on earnings 
    before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which is considered a more appropriate measure of 
    profitability for the group's businesses. In the prior year, the performance of operating segment was assessed based 
    on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). The prior year numbers have been reclassified to show the new performance 
    measurement. Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to segments, as treasury activity is managed on a 
    central group basis.                         
    
    Total segment assets comprise finished goods inventory only, which is allocated based on the operations of the 
    segment and the physical location of the asset.   
    
    Depreciation, staff costs, impairment of assets and additions to property, plant and equipment are not reported to 
    the CODM per segment, but are significant items which are included in EBITDA and/or reported on for the group as 
    a whole.

    As previously reported, SIOC and ArcelorMittal SA entered into an agreement for the transfer of Thabazimbi mine, 
    together with the mining right to ArcelorMittal SA. The agreement is expected to become effective in 2018, subject 
    to certain conditions. The identified assets and liabilities of Thabazimbi mine (as indicated in the disclosure below) 
    will be transferred at a nominal purchase consideration plus the assumed liabilities. If all conditions precedent 
    have not been satisfied by 31 March 2018 (or a later date agreed to between the parties), the agreement will lapse 
    and SIOC will proceed with closure of the mine.

    On 15 June 2017, the DMR published its Reviewed Mining Charter 2017 (MCIII). Kumba expressed its concern that the 
    MCIII was not concluded through agreement between the DMR and all relevant stakeholders, including the mining industry, 
    despite the best efforts of those stakeholders over the preceding year.                                                      
    
    Kumba is supportive of the legal action followed by the Chamber of Mines, with the ultimate objective of arriving 
    at a negotiated solution that is practical to implement, and that preserves and enhances investment in what is a 
    critically important industry for South Africa. Kumba welcomed the DMR's written undertaking that the provisions of 
    the 2017 Reviewed Mining Charter will not be implemented or applied in any way, pending judgment in application brought 
    by the Chamber of Mines. Kumba will continue to engage through the Chamber of Mines. The hearing on the Chamber of Mines 
    Declarator on the ""once empowered always empowered' issue was heard in November, with the outcome expected 
    after 90 days. The hearing on the review of the Mining Charter has been set for 19 to 21 February 2018.

    The group subscribes to the Code of Good Corporate Practices and Conduct and complies with the recommendations 
    of the King IV Report. In November 2016, the Board charter was aligned with the provisions of all relevant

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
Shareholders are advised that Kumba is currently finalising its
financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 (“the
period”), which will be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”) on or about 13 February 2018.

In accordance with paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, shareholders are advised that headline earnings
for the period are likely to increase to between R9,300 million
and R9,985 million, with headline earnings per share (“HEPS”)
likely to be between R29.13 and R31.27, an increase of between
7% and 15%. The increase in headline earnings is largely
attributable to higher sales volumes on the back of improved
operational performance as well as an increase in export iron
ore prices.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to increase to between
R11,795 million and R12,660 million, with basic earnings per
share (“EPS”) expected to be between R36.94 and R39.65, an
increase of between 37% and 47%.

The improved operational performance at Sishen mine, as a result
of improved levels of production and operating efficiencies, as
well as the recovery in the price outlook for the iron ore
market, has necessitated an assessment of the recoverable amount
of the Sishen mine. This has resulted in an impairment reversal
relating to Sishen mine of R4.8 billion (pre-tax). The
impairment reversal, net of tax and non-controlling interest,
is R2.6 billion and will be included in basic earnings but
excluded from headline earnings. More information will be
provided in the Company’s financial results for the period to
be released on SENS on or about 13 February 2018.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the prior
comparative period (released on SENS on 14 February 2017) were
R8,724 million and R8,621 million respectively, while reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparative period were R27.30 and R26.98
respectively.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s
external auditors.

Sishen production decreased by 7% to 7.8Mt (3Q16: 8.3Mt). The higher production in 3Q16
was attributable to temporary access to low strip ratio ore and higher plant yields as per the
mine plan. As planned, production for 3Q17 was in line with 1Q17 and 2Q17. Waste removal
increased by 21% to 42Mt, compared to 35Mt in 3Q16. Sishen maintained its solid and
consistent performance and ongoing improvements which have resulted in production
guidance for 2017 being revised to 29-30Mt. Waste guidance remains unchanged at 155-
165Mt.

Kolomela production increased to 3.7Mt, up 8% compared to 3Q16, mainly due to productivity
improvements and the ramp up of the modular plant. Waste mined increased by 11% to 16Mt
resulting from ongoing improvements in operational efficiency. Kolomela is on track to meet full
year production and waste guidance for 2017 of 13-14Mt and 50-55Mt respectively.

Export sales increased by 4% to 10.8Mt mainly due to shipping of delayed volumes on hand
at Saldanha at 30 June 2017. Total finished product stocks were 4.6Mt, compared to 4.4Mt at
30 June 2017. Full year sales guidance has been revised to 42-44Mt.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Shareholders are advised of the following changes to the composition of Kumba’s board of directors
(“Board”):

Fani Titi intends to step down from the board with effect from 30 September 2017, and that Dr Mandla
Gantsho has been appointed as an independent director and chairman designate. Dr Gantsho will join
the board on 1 August 2017 and will succeed Mr Titi as chairman on 1 October 2017, after a handover
period of two months.

Dr Gantsho is the CEO and founder of Africa Rising Capital, an investment and advisory business. He
is a non-executive director and chairman of Sasol Limited and Impala Platinum Holdings Limited. He is
also a member of the divisional board of Rand Merchant Bank (A division of FirstRand Bank Limited).
A chartered accountant by profession, Dr Gantsho has spent some fifteen years in leadership positions
within development finance institutions, both in South Africa and internationally, and brings a wealth of
experience of multi-sectoral development throughout the African continent. In addition, he has extensive
board leadership experience on a number of listed and unlisted corporations.

Fani Titi, Chairman of Kumba, said: “Chairing the Kumba board has been an enormous privilege during
what has been a period of considerable price volatility and positive change for the business. I will hand
over to Mandla Gantsho at a time of strength for Kumba, following the announcement of its half year
results and the resumption of dividend payments to our shareholders. I am pleased to have played a
part in contributing to a great South African business that will continue to make a significant contribution
to our economy and to the communities in which we operate. I look forward to welcoming Mandla
Gantsho to the board and I am confident that his extensive commercial and leadership experience will
serve Kumba well as it continues to create value for all its stakeholders.

“I am grateful to the board and shareholders of Kumba for their support over the last five years. Mandla
Gantsho will work with a leadership team ably led by our CEO Themba Mkhwanazi to build on the
significant progress already made by the business.”

Mandla Gantsho said: “I am honoured and humbled to join the board of Kumba. The mining sector
continues to present enormous potential and opportunity to attract investment in South Africa and
elsewhere on the continent. More importantly, as a driver of economic growth, it is pivotal in creating
sustainable employment and downstream opportunities for business and entrepreneurial development.
As a member of the Kumba board, I am committed towards building on the indelible legacy created by
Fani Titi. I am confident that with my board colleagues and a committed and professional management
team, Kumba will continue its positive trajectory”.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, added: “On behalf of the entire board, we wish Fani Titi well and
thank him for his steady leadership of the board over the last five years. Personally, I thank him for his
guidance upon my stepping into the role of CEO of Kumba almost one year ago. I am pleased to
welcome Mandla Gantsho to the Kumba board and as the Kumba team, we look forward to his wealth
of experience and leadership as we continue to build this magnificent business”.
Further biographical details

Commentary
SAFETY            
The focus on safety remains a key priority for the group. The continuous effort in our safety performance included an
emphasis on leadership, operational risk management and implementation of critical controls, which have resulted in
encouraging improvements reflected in our leading indicator reporting. No fatalities were recorded during the first half 
of 2017. The total recordable case frequency rate, a measure of frequency of injuries, was 0.73 (1H16: 0.83) and the
lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) decreased to 0.23 (1H16: 0.27). 

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCIES DELIVERED
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief executive of Kumba, notes, “I am pleased to report that Kumba has delivered on our key
objectives set for the first half. Kumba was fatality free and improved significantly on all key safety indicators. Our
operational performance was again encouraging, with another step change in productivity from the revised Sishen mine plan 
and enhanced fleet efficiencies. This resulted in a 23% improvement in production.

“Stronger operational performance and commodity prices resulted in the operating margin improving to 36% from 29% in
1H16, and headline earnings increasing 53%. Cash flow conversion was strong with operating free cash flow up 48% to 
R8.3 billion resulting in a robust R13.5 billion net cash position. This has enabled us to resume dividend payments, 
with an interim dividend of R5.1 billion declared representing R15.97 per share. While the overall progress has been 
very encouraging, substantial effort was required simply to offset cost inflation and there is no room for complacency. 
The team is therefore examining every aspect of the value chain in order to improve Kumba’s ability to endure any future 
price volatility.” 

DIVIDEND REINSTATED
The Board has decided to resume paying a dividend, in accordance with the Board’s policy of returning excess cash to
shareholders, whilst retaining a high level of balance sheet flexibility. A conservative approach remains critical in 
the context of an ongoing volatile price environment.

Taking cognisance of the uncertain environment, but also recognising the strong cash balance built up by the group,
the Board has decided to pay an interim cash dividend of R15.97 per share. 

The dividend policy remains under review and the Board will continue to assess the Company’s requirements at each
interim and annual reporting period, taking into account the prevailing risks and opportunities, as well as the future
earnings outlook.

REGULATORY UPDATE
The Reviewed Mining Charter (MCIII)
On 15 June 2017, the South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) published its Reviewed Mining Charter 2017
(MCIII). Kumba has expressed its concern that, unlike the collaborative process for agreeing the 2004 and 2010 Mining
Charters, the MCIII was not concluded through agreement between the DMR and all relevant stakeholders, including the 
mining industry, despite the best efforts of those stakeholders over the preceding year. Unfortunately, the practical
experience of the mining industry in implementing the previous Mining Charters - which themselves have contributed to the
achievement of the significant transformation that exists across the South African mining industry today - was not taken 
into account in the development of MCIII.

Kumba is supportive of the legal course of action being followed by the Chamber of Mines, with the ultimate objective
of arriving at a negotiated solution that is practical to implement, and that preserves and enhances investment in what
is a critically important industry for South Africa. In the absence of new investment, South Africa will fail to deliver
the economic growth required to create greater levels of employment and socio-economic upliftment for the benefit of
all South Africans. Kumba is committed to meeting South Africa’s transformation objectives and has been a longstanding and
major contributor to the country’s transformation.

On 14 July 2017, the Chamber of Mines advised that the Minister of Mineral Resources has given a written undertaking
that the Minister and the DMR will not implement or apply the provisions of the 2017 Reviewed Mining Charter in any way,
pending judgment in the urgent interdict application brought by the Chamber of Mines. Kumba welcomes the undertaking
and will continue to engage through the Chamber of Mines.

Sishen consolidated mining right granted
An application, in terms of Section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act No 28 of 2002, to
extend Sishen mine’s mining right by the inclusion of the adjacent Sishen Iron Ore (Pty) Ltd (SIOC) Prospecting Rights 
(including Dingleton) and other properties, was lodged on 1 July 2016. This application is required by Sishen mine to expand 
its current mining operations within the adjacent Dingleton area. The official grant letter was received from the DMR on 
6 July 2017 and the process to amend the Sishen mining right, will now proceed. Mining operations will only commence once the 
required environmental authorisation, in terms of the National Environmental Management Act 1998 (Act 107 of 1998), has been 
approved, which is expected soon. 

Thabazimbi transfer to ArcelorMittal SA
SIOC and ArcelorMittal SA announced in 2016 that they had entered into an agreement to transfer Thabazimbi mine to
ArcelorMittal SA, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied by 31 August 2017
(the later date agreed to by the companies), the agreement will lapse and SIOC will proceed with the closure of the
mine. 

The agreement is expected to become effective in the second half of 2017, at which time the employees, assets and
liabilities will transfer to ArcelorMittal SA at a nominal purchase consideration plus the assumed liabilities of which 97%
is already ArcelorMittal SA’s contractual liability. These liabilities include the mine’s social closure plan based on
the identified needs of the Thabazimbi community. The transfer will simplify the current arrangement by making
ArcelorMittal SA solely responsible for Thabazimbi’s closure and rehabilitation. The Thabazimbi mine assets and related
liabilities that will transfer have been presented separately in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the disposal 
group held for sale at 30 June 2017 (refer to note 9 in the condensed consolidated financial statements). 

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Platts 62%Fe CFR index reached US$95.05 per tonne in February, the highest level since August 2014, driven by
Chinese New Year restocking and rising steel prices. Iron ore prices have subsequently fallen and ended the first half of
the year at US$63 per tonne. Economic activity in China remained buoyant, with a rise in domestic steel prices and
improved margins prompting mills to ramp-up capacity and boosting demand for iron ore. Strengthening iron ore prices have
resulted in high cost supply coming back into the market, with iron ore supply from high cost seaborne suppliers, primarily
from India, increasing 20% year-on-year. 

The lump premium started the year at 10 US cents/dmtu and ended the first half at 21 US cents/dmtu, reaching an
historic low of almost 2 US cents/dmtu in April. The recent rally in premiums is on the back of lower availability of lump
product at Chinese ports and record mill margins, incentivising a renewed focus on productivity and supporting demand for
direct charge material. 

Underlying steel production and iron ore demand remained relatively strong during the first six months of the year but
a tempering in steel demand is expected in the second half. Rising iron ore stock levels at Chinese ports, combined
with a number of growth projects coming on line, is anticipated to put pressure on iron ore prices during the next 
six months.

Overview of six months ended 30 June 2017
Total tonnes mined were 125 Mt, a 13% increase. Total production increased to 21.9 Mt with significant productivity
improvements at Sishen helping to deliver 15.6 Mt and a continued solid performance at Kolomela delivering 6.3 Mt. Total
sales volumes increased by 5% to 21.2 Mt (1H16: 20.2 Mt) on the back of export sales of 19.5 Mt (1H16: 18.1 Mt) due to
higher production.

Kumba achieved an average cash break-even price of US$43/tonne (CFR China) in the first six months of 2017, an
increase of US$14/tonne from the average for the full year 2016. Controllable costs increased by US$1/tonne as a result 
of a US$2/tonne increase from mining cost inflation and higher waste mining volumes, partially offset by a further 
reduction in controllable overhead costs of US$1/tonne through continued cost optimisation. Uncontrollable costs increased 
as a result of higher freight rates (US$3/tonne) and lower lump and market premiums (US$5/tonne), higher mineral royalties 
(US$1/tonne) and a stronger currency which added US$4/tonne.

Headline earnings increased by 53% to R4.6 billion (1H16: R3 billion), mainly as a result of the 29% increase in the
average realised iron ore export price to US$71/tonne (1H16: US$55/tonne), and 5% higher total sales volumes.
Attributable and headline earnings for the period were R14.37 and R14.42 per share respectively.

Sishen mine
The successful execution of the restructuring and mine plan redesign has increased the mine’s flexibility and improved
the run rates on key operating parameters. The new mine plan, Operating Model and significant fleet productivity gains
of 57% helped drive Sishen’s improved performance. Sishen focused on increased operator training and equipment direct
operating hours (DOH) through higher attendance rates, changed shift patterns and more accountability at supervisory
levels. Through these measures and a committed workforce, the mine has been able to reduce its reliance on contractors 
and as productivity rises, this trend is expected to continue. In the pit, wider benches, changed blast sizes and improved
shovel productivity contributed to the increase in mining volumes. Better shovel and truck DOH have added an extra five
production hours per day. Implementation of the Operating Model has resulted in an 84% improvement in mine to plan
compliance since 2015.
 
As a result, total tonnes mined at Sishen increased by 11% to 92.9 Mt (1H16: 83.7 Mt) with 39% less trucks. As per the
plan, the mine’s stripping ratio increased to 4.7 for the six months, compared to 3.5 for the same period in 2016.
 
Production increased by 35% to 15.6 Mt (1H16: 11.5 Mt) due to a combination of increased plant throughput and higher
yields. Waste mined was 76.6 Mt, an 18% increase for the period. Higher than normal levels of rainfall impacted
performance in 1Q17 but the tonnages were recovered in the second quarter. 

Kolomela mine
Kolomela production was impeded by rain and weather delays in 1Q17, but improved substantially in the second quarter
to remain on track to achieve full year guidance. Productivity and efficiencies of the Kolomela drill fleet increased by
20% with the introduction of automated drilling technology. The Operating Model implementation has been responsible for
a 7.6% improvement in DSO plant throughput.

Total tonnes mined increased by 21% to 32.2 Mt, (1H16: 26.7 Mt). Waste mined was 25.4 Mt (1H16: 20.2 Mt), an increase
of 26%, as planned. The mine produced 6.3 Mt of ore (1H16: 5.9 Mt), a 7% increase, from 3% more ex-pit ore, benefiting
from stockpiled material.
 
Operating Model
The implementation of the Operating Model continues to yield operational efficiency improvements. The stabilised
roll-outs at the Kolomela plant and Sishen shovel maintenance area continue to demonstrate the benefits from the completed
implementations. The model ensures more stable operations, reduced variability and enhanced capability and efficiency,
providing a structured approach for continuous improvement. 

Logistics
Despite severe weather disruptions at port and rail, Kumba’s volumes railed on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore Export
Channel increased by 14% to 20.8 Mt (1H16: 18.3 Mt), as a result of increased production.
 
Kumba shipped 19.5 Mt (1H16: 18.1 Mt) from the Saldanha port destined for the export market, an increase of 8%,
including 0.2 Mt shipped through the multi-purpose terminal (MPT) at the Saldanha port.

Sales
Total sales increased by 5% to 21.2 Mt (1H16: 20.2 Mt), as export sales volumes of 19.5 Mt (1H16: 18.1 Mt), including
0.3 Mt from third party producers, were aided by higher production levels. CFR sales accounted for 65% of export sales
volumes (1H16: 70%). Finished product inventory held at the mines and ports increased from 2.3 Mt to 4.4 Mt. China
accounted for 60% (1H16: 65%) of Kumba’s export sales portfolio while the share of EU/MENA/Americas region increased to
20%, as Kumba further diversified its customer portfolio in the region. The group’s lump:fine ratio was 63:37 for the
period (1H16: 63:37).

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue
The group’s total revenue from continuing operations increased by 22% to R21.5 billion for the period compared to
R17.6 billion for the comparable period in 2016, mainly as a result of the 29% increase in the average realised iron ore
export price to US$71/tonne (1H16: US$55/tonne), and 5% higher total sales volumes. These gains were partially offset by
the strengthening of the average Rand/US$ exchange rate (1H17: R13.21/US$1 compared to 1H16: R15.40/US$1). Firmer freight
rates resulted in a R652 million increase in shipping revenue.

Kumba’s FOB achieved prices improved by US$16/tonne compared to 1H16, driven by stronger average iron ore index prices
offsetting impacts of higher freight rates and lower lump premiums. The average 62% Platts index increased by US$22/tonne,
whilst the lump premium decreased by US$3/tonne and freight rates increased by US$5/tonne compared to 2016. The FOB
achieved price increased by US$2/tonne due to pricing our China sales in the month of arrival.

Average lump premiums increased by 76% to US$0.08/dmtu in 2Q16 from that of the first quarter, on the back of
increased demand for direct charge material supported by stronger steel prices. However, the first half average of 
US$0.07/dmtu is 53% lower than the 1H16 average of US$0.15/dmtu.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 11% to R13.8 billion compared to R12.4 billion in the first half of 2016; principally
as a result of the 23% increase in production volumes and inflationary pressure on input costs. This was partially
offset by saving on mining costs from productivity measures, savings from overhead reductions, reduced use of contractors and
lower diesel prices. Selling and distribution costs remained flat despite the 14% increase in sales volumes railed.

R444 million higher freight costs were incurred due to the Platts freight rate on the Saldanha-Qingdao route
increasing to US$10/wmt. Spot freight rates averaged US$9.91/tonne, an 87% increase from US$5.29/tonne in 1H16. 

Cost savings were achieved through continued aggressive management of overheads and by focusing on high value project
and technical studies, partially offset by inflation.

Unit cash costs at Sishen mine increased by 5% to R311 per tonne (FY16: R296 per tonne) primarily a result of 10%
higher waste mining volumes and inflationary cost pressure, partially offset by productivity gains in mining and processing
activities which resulted in an increase in production volumes, and higher deferred waste stripping costs capitalised,
driven by a higher stripping ratio of 4.7. Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R252 per tonne (FY16: R201 per tonne), 
a 25% increase from higher mining volumes, above inflationary pressures from higher fuel prices, and the costs
incurred for the crushing of feedstock material for the modular plant. 

Operating profit
Kumba’s operating profit margin increased by 7 percentage points to 36% (1H16: 29%). The group’s mining operating
margin increased to 39% (1H16: 32%), excluding the net freight loss incurred on shipping operations mainly as a result of
long-term fixed price chartering contracts. Operating profit increased by 50% to R7.7 billion (1H16: R5.2 billion).
 
Cash flow
The increased profitability on the back of higher average realised iron ore prices and increase in sales volumes
during the six months positively impacted the group’s cash generating ability. Cash flow generated from operations was 
R11.7 billion (1H16: R7.6 billion). The group ended the period with a net cash position of R13.5 billion 
(1H16: R548 million; 2H16: R6.2 billion). Capital expenditure of R1.1 billion was incurred, R0.2 billion on 
stay-in-business (SIB) activities, R0.7 billion on deferred stripping, and R0.2 billion on expansions, which included 
R137 million on the Dingleton project. The relocation of the remaining houses for the Dingleton project has progressed well 
and is expected to be completed on schedule and within budget.

The group expects total capital expenditure for 2017 (including deferred stripping) to be in the range of R3.0 billion
to R3.1 billion.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
There have been no material changes to the ore reserves and mineral resources as disclosed in the 2016 Kumba
Integrated Report.

Board expresses gratitude to Ms Parboosing for her valued contribution to the Company. Mr Itumeleng Lebepe was appointed
as acting Company secretary from 1 July 2017.

OUTLOOK
Sishen’s solid and consistent performance and ongoing improvements since the restructuring have resulted in guidance
being revised. Total production for 2017 is expected to be in the range of 41 - 43 Mt, with Sishen producing between 
28 - 29 Mt of product and 155-165 Mt of waste. Kolomela is expected to produce 13 - 14 Mt in 2017, aided by further 
improvements in plant efficiency and throughput rates. Waste guidance remains at 50 - 55 Mt for the year. 

Export sales volumes are expected to be under pressure as a result of adverse weather conditions during the wet
Western Cape winter months, as well as the annual maintenance shutdown on the iron ore export channel during 2H17. Full year
sales guidance is 41 - 43 Mt. Domestic sales volumes of up to 6.25 Mt are contracted to ArcelorMittal SA in terms of the
supply agreement, however, 3 - 3.5 Mt is the expected volume for 2017.

Iron ore prices are expected to remain under pressure in the short to medium term. The group’s performance remains
sensitive to the volatility in iron ore export prices and the Rand/US$ exchange rate. Kumba will continue to optimise its
assets by stepping up financial and operational performance through an increased focus on extracting value from the
entire value chain enabling growth in free cash flow and returns. The Company will remain focused on maintaining a strong
balance sheet to provide flexibility in the face of price volatility.

The presentation of the Company’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 will be available on the Company’s website 
www.angloamericankumba.com at 08:00 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11:30 CAT on 25 July 2017.

    2.1. Accounting policies                                                                                                                
         The accounting policies and methods of computation applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated 
         interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with 
         those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements.                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
         No new standards, amendments to published standards or interpretations which became effective for the year 
         commencing on 1 January 2017 had an effect on the reported results or the group accounting policies. The group 
         did not early adopt any new, revised or amended accounting standards or interpretations.                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
    2.2. Going concern                                                                                                                      
         In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, 
         the directors are required to consider whether the group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
         future. The financial performance of the group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in which the group 
         operates. Factors exist which are outside the control of management which can have a significant impact on the 
         business, specifically the volatility in the Rand/US$ exchange rate and the iron ore price.                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
         These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Board is 
         satisfied that the group is sufficiently liquid and solvent to be able to support the current operations for the 
         next 12 months.                                                          
                                                                                                                                     
    2.3. Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions                                                                                   
         In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
         management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are consistent 
         with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
    2.4. Change in estimates                                                                                                                
         The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions are a key area where management’s 
         judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows 
         required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use of certain estimates 
         and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate. The closure 
         provisions are updated at each balance sheet date for changes in these estimates.                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
         The life of mine (LoM) plan on which accounting estimates are based only includes proved and probable ore reserves 
         as disclosed in Kumba’s 2016 annual ore reserves and mineral resources statement. The most significant changes in 
         the provision for 2017 arises from the change in the LoM for both Sishen and Kolomela. The effect of the change in 
         estimate of the rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions, which was applied prospectively from 1 January 2017, 
         is detailed below:

    corporate, administration and other expenditure not allocated to the reported segments.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                  
    The total reported segment revenue compromises revenue from external customers, and is measured in a manner consistent 
    with that disclosed in the income statement. The performance of the operating segments are assessed based on earnings 
    before interest and tax (EBIT), which is consistent with ‘Operating profit’ in the financial statements. Finance 
    income and finance costs are not allocated to segments, as treasury activity is managed on a central group basis.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                  
    Total segment assets comprise finished goods inventory only, which is allocated based on the operations of the segment 
    and the physical location of the asset.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                  
    Depreciation, staff costs and additions to property, plant and equipment are not reported to the CODM per segment, 
    but are significant items which are included in EBIT and/or reported on for the group as a whole.

12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                         
    The two matters which were reported as contingent liabilities at 31 December 2016, being the South African Revenue Service 
    matter and the matter regarding the Sishen municipal rates and taxes, were resolved during the interim period. There were 
    no contingent liabilities at 30 June 2017.                           
                                                     
13. GUARANTEES                                     
    The total guarantees issued in favour of the DMR in respect of the group’s environmental closure liabilities at 
    30 June 2017 were R2.8 billion (30 June 2016: R2.8 billion and 31 December 2016: R2.8 billion). Included in this 
    amount are financial guarantees for the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of the group to 
    the DMR in respect of Thabazimbi mine of R438 million (30 June 2016: R438 million and 31 December 2016: R438 million). 
    ArcelorMittal SA has guaranteed R730 million of this amount by means of bank guarantees issued in favour of SIOC.                           
                                                     
    As a result of the annual revision of closure costs, a shortfall of R450 million arose. Guarantees of the shortfall 
    will be issued in due course.                           
                                                     
14. REGULATORY UPDATE                              
    Mining Charter                                 
    Significant uncertainty remains around the Mining Charter III, released on 15 June 2017, which impacts future 
    empowerment of mining companies and granting of new mining rights. 

    On 14 July 2017, the Chamber of Mines advised that the Minister of Mineral Resources has given a written undertaking
    that the Minister and the DMR will not implement or apply the provisions of the 2017 Reviewed Mining Charter in any 
    way, pending judgment in the urgent interdict application brought by the Chamber of Mines. Kumba welcomes the 
    undertaking and will continue to engage through the Chamber of Mines.
                                                     
15. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                           
    The group subscribes to the Code of Good Corporate Practices and Conduct and complies with the recommendations of the 
    King III Report. In November 2016, the Board charter was aligned with the provisions of all relevant statutory and 
    regulatory requirements including among others, King IV. Full disclosure of the group’s compliance is contained in 
    the 2016 Integrated Report.                           
                                                     
16. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD                         
    There have been no material events subsequent to 30 June 2017, not otherwise dealt with in this report.                           
                                                     
17. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT                         
    The auditors, Deloitte & Touche, have issued their unmodified review report on the condensed consolidated interim 
    financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The review was conducted in accordance with ISRE 2410 
    Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.                           
                                                     
    The auditor’s report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is available for inspection at the 
    Company’s registered office.                           
                                                     
    Any reference to future financial performance included in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by 
    the Company’s auditors. The auditor’s report does not necessarily report on all the information contained in the 
    financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the review 
    engagement they should obtain a copy of the auditor’s report together with the accompanying financial information 
    from the registered office.

Sishen production increased by 38% to 7.9Mt due to improved mining productivity as a result of
fleet efficiencies and higher plant yields. Waste removal increased by 38% to 42.7Mt, compared
to 31.1Mt in Q2 2016 (H1 2017: 76.6Mt). Sishen’s solid and consistent performance and
ongoing improvements since the restructuring have resulted in guidance being revised. Sishen
is expected to produce between 28-29Mt of iron ore in 2017 and 155-165Mt of waste.

Kolomela production increased to 3.5Mt, up 11% compared to Q2 2016, due to productivity
improvements. Waste mined increased by 22% to 15.3Mt through ongoing improvements in
operational efficiency. Kolomela is on track to meet full year production and waste guidance for
2017 of 13-14Mt and 50-55Mt respectively.

Export sales increased by 8% to 9.4Mt compared to Q2 2016. Total finished product stocks
were 4.4Mt, compared to 3.5Mt at year end. Sales volumes were delayed to H2 due to
unfavourable weather at Saldanha port. Full year sales guidance has been increased to 41-
43Mt.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017
Shareholders are advised that Kumba is currently finalising its
results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (“the period”),
which will be released on the Stock Exchange News Service of the
JSE Limited (“SENS”) on 25 July 2017.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
requirements, and further to the trading statement released on
SENS on 11 May 2017 in which the Company indicated that headline
earnings per share (“HEPS”) and basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
for the period would be at least 20% higher than the previous
six months ended 30 June 2016 (“the comparative period”);
shareholders are advised that headline earnings for the period
are likely to be between R4,373 million and R4,741 million, with
basic earnings for the period expected to be between R4,355
million and R4,722 million. HEPS is likely to be between R13.70
and R14.85, an increase of between 46% and 58%. Basic EPS is
expected to be between R13.64 and R14.79, an increase of between
47% and 59%.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the
comparative period (released on SENS on 26 July 2016) were R3,009
million and R2,974 million respectively, while reported HEPS and
EPS for the comparative period were R9.41 and R9.30
respectively.

The increase in earnings for the period is largely attributable
to higher export iron ore prices, partially offset by the
stronger Rand/US$ exchange rate. More information will be
provided in the Company’s results for the period to be released
on SENS on 25 July 2017.

The financial information, on which this trading statement is
based, has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s
external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDING 30 JUNE 2017

Shareholders are advised that Kumba’s results for the six months ending
30 June 2017 (""the period"") will be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”) on 25 July 2017.

In accordance with paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, shareholders are further advised that both headline
earnings and basic earnings for the period are likely to be at least
R602 million (20%) higher than reported headline earnings and basic
earnings for the prior comparative 6 months ended 30 June 2016 (“the
comparative period”).

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the six months ended
30 June 2016 (as released on SENS on 26 July 2016) were R3,009 million
and R2,974 million respectively, while reported headline earnings per
share (“HEPS”) and earnings per share (“EPS”) for the comparative period
were R9.41 and R9.30 respectively.

The expected increase in earnings is largely attributable to an increase
in export iron ore prices during the period.

In this regard, HEPS and EPS are also likely to be at least R1.88 and at
least R1.86 per share higher (at least 20% higher), respectively, than
reported HEPS and EPS for the comparative period.

A further trading statement will be released as soon as the Company has
reasonable certainty on the expected HEPS and EPS ranges for the period.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external
auditors.

Sishen production increased by 31% to 7.7Mt due to improved mining productivity,
resulting in higher plant throughput. As expected, production decreased 10% on the
previous quarter as Q4 2016 benefitted from greater access to low strip ratio ore. Waste
removal of 34Mt, in line with Q1 2016, was hampered by higher than expected rainfall during
the quarter however, mining rates improved in the latter part of the quarter to levels required
to meet full year guidance of 150-160Mt.

Kolomela production increased by 3% to 2.8Mt compared to Q1 2016, driven by higher plant
throughput. Q1 2017 production versus that in Q4 2016, was down 10% due to rain
stoppages. Waste mined increased by 32% to 10.1Mt in support of production growth and
ongoing improvements in operational and mining efficiency. Going forward, waste removal is
expected to improve to meet full year guidance for 2017 of 50-55Mt.

Export sales rose by 7% to 10.1Mt compared to Q1 2016. Total finished product stocks were
3.2Mt, compared with 3.5Mt at 31 December 2016, in line with optimum level of
approximately 3Mt.

Kumba’s Chief Financial Officer to step down

Kumba announces that Frikkie Kotzee, Chief Financial Officer and executive director of the Company, has
decided to step down from his role after five years.

Mr Kotzee engaged with the Kumba Board in December 2016 to indicate his preference to step down during
the course of 2017, once a number of major strategic and financial deliverables had been completed. In
order to ensure a smooth transition, Frikkie has agreed to remain with the Company until Kumba’s Annual
General Meeting on 11 May 2017.

Fani Titi, Chairman of Kumba said: “The Board thanks Frikkie for his invaluable contribution and leadership
over the past five years. We have valued his integrity and unwavering commitment to the highest levels of
governance and excellence. We wish Frikkie the best in his future endeavours.”

Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive, added: “Frikkie has played a crucial leadership role in ensuring
Kumba’s financial sustainability during trying times. He will be missed as a valued member of the executive
team.”

Frikkie Kotzee commented: “I would like to thank Kumba for what has been an excellent opportunity to serve
as CFO. It has been very rewarding professionally and I have had the privilege of working with an exceptional
board and management team. After five years and with a strengthened balance sheet and a major
restructuring of the business successfully executed, I believe the time is right for me to step down.”

The Kumba Board will now begin a search process of internal and external candidates to identify a
successor.

This announcement is made in accordance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Listings Requirements.

SAFETY
Safety remains the key priority for the group. Regrettably two of our colleagues, Grahame Skansi and Gideon Dihaisi,
lost their lives in the first half of the year. During the year, we have greatly strengthened our focus on the prevention
of injuries and the elimination of fatalities, and adopted a framework to drive this objective with an emphasis on
leadership, operational risk management and the implementation of critical controls. This was supported by increasing
employee engagement, safer technologies, and additional leadership interventions aimed at pursuing a zero harm workplace. 
The total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR), a measure of frequency of injuries, reduced to 0.78 (2015: 0.89) and the
lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) was 0.28 (2015: 0.23).

A PLEASING SET OF RESULTS IN A YEAR OF TRANSITION
Over the past two years, Kumba implemented key interventions to reset the cost base and preserve cash. This entailed
moving from a volume to a value- based strategy by reconfiguring the mines to reduce the amount of waste mined and to
reduce costs in all operational areas. The strong set of results delivered in 2016 reflects not only the benefit of higher
iron ore prices, but the progress made in the execution of this strategy. Headline earnings per share increased by 131%
to R27.30 (2015: R11.82). Basic earnings rose to R26.98 per share, compared to the R1.46 per share in 2015 which was
impacted by the impairment charge relating to Sishen mine of R6 billion. Normalised earnings were 108% higher than the
comparative period at R27.10 per share (2015: R13.02 per share).

Sishen delivered a robust performance despite the operational challenges experienced in the first half as a result of
the transition to the revised pit configuration. The new mine plan, based on a lower cost pit shell, was successfully
implemented and the mine delivered against key priorities for the year, achieving a marked recovery in productivity during
the second half of the year. The substantial workforce restructuring was completed and regrettably some 2,500 full-time
employees and contractors left the Company. This took place mainly through voluntary separation and without any work
stoppages. We are pleased that overall labour relations have been stable throughout the year. The mine delivered a strong
improvement in operational performance for the full year, producing 28 Mt, exceeding our target of 27 Mt. Waste mined of
137 Mt was at the lower end of the targeted range. 

Kolomela exceeded expectations yet again, producing 12.7 Mt, benefiting from increased throughput as a result of
further plant optimisation. The mine, which was originally designed to produce 9 Mtpa, is on track to produce between 13 Mt
and 14 Mt in 2017 without significant additional capital expenditure. 

Total production for the year was 41.5 Mt, a decrease of 8%, in line with planned lower mining volumes at Sishen.
Export sales of 39.1 Mt were achieved. Higher realised iron ore prices and robust cost management resulted in the group's
operating margin rising from 24% to 38%. Kumba realised an average FOB price of US$64/tonne in 2016 (2015: US$53/tonne)
due to efficient marketing activities and a greater demand for higher grade ore. This was aided by the 15% weaker average
ZAR/US$ exchange rate (2016: R14.69; 2015: R12.76), partially offset by 11% lower total sales volumes of 42.5 Mt 
(2015:47.8 Mt).

Controllable costs reduced by 34% driven by a 24% decrease in operating expenditure to R25.4 billion and 65% lower
capital expenditure of R2.4 billion. As a result, free cash flow generation increased by 181% to R16.7 billion,
strengthening the balance sheet to a net cash position of R6.2 billion. Kumba's average cash breakeven price for the year 
reduced to US$29/tonne from US$49/tonne in 2015, below the guided range of US$32 - US$40/tonne. 

The tough decisions taken to reset the cost base, stabilise operating performance and improve financial health, have
made the Company more resilient and better positioned to cope with volatile market conditions. Going forward the group is
targeting further improvements in productivity rates and reductions in operating costs. Ongoing headwinds, such as cost
inflation, achieving the required improvement in operational performance at Sishen and the rising strip ratio, make
further progress from the current base essential.

REGULATORY UPDATE
Sishen 21.4% residual mining right granted
In October 2016, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) granted the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining
right for the Sishen mine to Kumba's subsidiary, Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (SIOC) following the completion of an
internal appeal process, as prescribed by section 96 of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA).
 
As a result of the grant of the residual 21.4% undivided share, SIOC is now the sole and exclusive holder of the right
to mine iron ore and quartzite at the Sishen mine. This residual mining right will be incorporated into the 78.6%
Sishen mining right that SIOC successfully converted in 2009.

The consent to amend SIOC's mining right, by the inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share, is subject to
various conditions. The conditions, where applicable, will ultimately form part of the conditions to the Sishen mining right.
These include the requirement for the continuation of the existing Existing Export Parity price based supply agreement between
SIOC and ArcelorMittal SA Limited (AMSA) in its role as a strategic South African steel producer, as well as SIOC's
continued support of skills development, research and development and initiatives to enable preferential procurement.

Settlement agreement with SARS
The group has concluded an agreement with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to settle a dispute relating to
assessments received for the years 2006 to 2010 inclusive, and the tax treatment of the relevant issues in the years 2011
to 2015 inclusive, for a full and final total settlement amount of R2.5 billion.

An amount of R1.5 billion had previously been provided for in the group's annual financial statements for the tax
years up to 2015, and an additional R1.0 billion has been accounted for in 2016 in respect of this settlement agreement.
The settlement will be paid in full in Q1 2017, with appropriate adjustments made for current advance payments held on
account.
 
The 2016 tax charge has been computed on a basis that is consistent with the settlement agreement.

As a responsible corporate citizen, our policy is to be tax compliant in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 

DIVIDEND
In line with the board's policy of declaring excess cash, the declaration of a dividend is reviewed at each interim
and annual reporting period, taking into account, amongst other things, the group's net funding position. The board
remains cognisant of the volatility in certain uncontrollable market factors, such as iron ore prices, which are expected to
be under pressure from continued supply growth, as well as exchange rates and freight rates.
 
While the reinstatement of the dividend is a key priority for the group, the board concluded that it would be prudent
to remain ungeared over the short to medium term whilst the period of price volatility continues. Furthermore, in order
to maintain balance sheet flexibility in the context of the Anglo American portfolio review, the board has decided not
to declare a final 2016 dividend, but will review this again during the course of 2017.

UNWIND OF ENVISION
On 10 November 2016, the second phase of SIOC's employee share ownership scheme trust, Envision, came to an end. As a
result of the weighted average share price being below the strike price on vesting date, none of the shares vested to
beneficiaries of the Trust. Consequently there was no capital distribution to employees. However, over Envision's second
tenure of five years, the Trust received R1.58 billion in dividends, of which R557 million was distributed to employees
(~R75,000 per employee after tax).

THABAZIMBI TRANSFER TO AMSA
SIOC and AMSA announced that they have entered into an agreement to transfer Thabazimbi mine to AMSA. The agreement is
expected to become effective in the first half of 2017. Upon the transaction becoming effective, the employees, assets
and liabilities will transfer to AMSA at a nominal purchase consideration plus the assumed liabilities of which 96% is
already AMSA's contractual liability. These liabilities include the mine's social closure plan based on the identified
need of the Thabazimbi community. If the conditions are not satisfied by 28 April 2017 (or a later date agreed to by the
companies), the agreement will lapse and SIOC will proceed with the closure of the mine. 

The transfer would simplify the current arrangement by making AMSA solely responsible for Thabazimbi's closure and
rehabilitation.
 
The Thabazimbi mine assets and related liabilities that will transfer to AMSA have been presented separately in the
balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale at 31 December 2016 (refer to note 10 in the
summarised consolidated financial statements).
 
MARKET OVERVIEW
Iron ore prices (Platts 62% Fe CFR China) improved from previous lows of US$38.50/dmt in mid-December 2015 to
US$79.65/dmt by the end of 2016, approximately doubling from the beginning of the year. The average index iron ore price for
the year increased by 5.3% to US$58/dmt. The price rise has been supported by a moderate recovery in Chinese crude steel
production and easing supply growth from Australia and Brazil. The average lump premium also benefited, increasing by
6.1% during 2016 to US$0.15/dmtu by year end, on the back of greater demand for direct charge materials and increased
environmental inspections in China which primarily targeted sintering capacity.

Seaborne supply growth, although moderating, in combination with subdued growth in crude steel production is expected
to put pressure on prices going forward.

Sishen mine
Sishen delivered a robust performance despite a challenging first half. During the year a new mine plan, based on a
lower cost pit shell, was finalised and successfully implemented. The workforce restructuring was completed without
interruption and mining was stabilised at higher second half run rates.
 
The mine produced 28.4 Mt (2015: 31.4 Mt) for the full year, a decrease of 10% with total tonnes mined reducing by 32%
to 178.3 Mt (2015: 261.4 Mt) in line with the new plan. The higher production resulted from improved mining
productivity, access to low strip ratio ore and higher plant yields during the second half. Waste removal was within the  
lower end of the targeted range (135 - 150 Mt) at 137 Mt (2015: 222 Mt), impacted by equipment efficiencies. Run rates have 
been stable, stockpiles built up and contractor capacity is in place to ensure targets are met.
 
The Sishen modular plant progressed to feasibility phase and is expected to be commissioned in 2018, and will produce
0.7 Mt over the life of mine, with indicative capital expenditure of around R400 million. 

Kolomela mine
Kolomela continued to surpass expectations producing 12.7 Mt (2015: 12.1 Mt), an increase of 5%, as efficiencies and
throughput in the plant continued to improve. The mine is on track to produce between 13 Mt and 14 Mt for 2017. Total
tonnes mined increased by 6% to 64 Mt (2015: 60.6 Mt), including 50.2 Mt of waste (2015: 45.7 Mt), an increase of 10%, in
line with higher production. 

The mine plan at Kolomela was optimised, which included the ramping up of production, and the deferral of mining at
the third pit. The modular plant was also commissioned in the third quarter and is on track to deliver ~0.7 Mt in 2017.
 
The drive to increase plant throughput will continue at Kolomela using the Operating Model and technology benefits.
The mine is targeting a 20% improvement in fleet efficiency for 2017 to offset cost inflation. Kolomela's life of mine
decreased from 21 to 18 years as a result of the planned ramp-up in production.

Logistics
Total ore railed was 39.8 Mt, a decrease of 2.6 Mt in line with lower production from Sishen. Although, higher
production rates were achieved in the second half, this resulted in rail and port constraints, which were exacerbated by the
planned maintenance shutdown in the third quarter. Rail volumes included 0.1 Mt purchased from third party producers.
Kumba shipped 38.7 Mt from the Saldanha port for the export market, an 11% decrease from the 43.5 Mt in 2015.

Sales
Total sales decreased by 11% to 42.5 Mt (2015: 47.8 Mt). Export sales of 39.1 Mt were achieved, 10% lower as a result
of planned lower production at Sishen. China accounted for 64% (2015: 63%) of the export sales portfolio and CFR sales
accounted for 70%. The group's lump:fine sales ratio was 64:36 for the period (2015: 65:35). Domestic sales to AMSA
amounted to 3.4 Mt (2015: 4.3 Mt).

Finished product stock reduced from 4.7 Mt at the end of 2015 to a more optimal level of 3.5 Mt at 31 December 2016.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
Impairment assessment
In the prior year, the group recognised an impairment charge of R6 billion with respect to the property, plant and
equipment of Sishen mine. Given that market conditions have improved in the current year, it was considered appropriate to
re-assess Sishen mine for impairment at 31 December 2016.
 
Despite the short-term volatility in iron ore prices, continued supply growth is expected to put pressure on long-term
iron ore prices. In this context, no portion of the impairment charge previously recognised was reversed.

Refer to note 5 in the summarised consolidated financial statements which detail the key assumptions applied in
preparing the impairment calculation.

Discontinued operation
Following the decision to close the Thabazimbi mine in 2015, mining activities ceased in September 2015 and the
remaining plant operations ceased on 31 March 2016. The Thabazimbi operation is therefore classified as a discontinued
operation for the year ended 31 December 2016, and as a result, the comparative figures have been restated to present the
discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.
 
Revenue
The group's total revenue of R40.8 billion for the period increased by 13% from R36.1 billion in 2015, mainly as a
result of the increase in average realised FOB iron ore prices (2016: US$64/tonne; 2015: US$53/tonne), and the weaker
average ZAR/US$ exchange rate (2016: R14.69; 2015: R12.76). This was partially offset by 11% lower total sales volumes of
42.5 Mt (2015: 47.8 Mt). Capesize freight rates from Saldanha to China averaged $6.81/tonne for the year, a 15% decrease,
resulting in a R665 million decrease in freight revenue.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses, excluding impairments and royalties, decreased by 10% as a result of the stringent cost control measures
implemented. Mining costs decreased by 17% in real terms from lower mining volumes, fuel prices and contractors' rates. This
was offset by a decrease in the capitalisation of deferred stripping costs due to lower waste volumes and strip ratio at
Sishen.

Unit cash costs at Sishen mine decreased by 5% to R296/tonne, (2015: R311/tonne), driven by the 38% decrease in waste
mined. The lower mining volumes were partially offset by lower production volumes, lower deferred stripping and input
cost pressures. Cost escalation was contained below inflation principally as a result of lower fuel prices. 

Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R201/tonne (2015: R178/tonne), a 13% increase. Higher mining volumes and lower 
deferred stripping were the main contributors. Cost escalation was contained well below inflation at 3% as a result of lower 
diesel prices and cost of blasting material, which was partially offset by higher production. 

Operating profit
Operating profit of R15.3 billion increased by 78% (2015: R8.6 billion excluding the impairment charge). Kumba's
operating profit margin increased to 38% (2015: 24%), 41% from mining activities (2015: 27%). The weakening of the 
ZAR/US$ exchange rate and the increase in iron ore prices for the year contributed to the increase in profitability.

Cash flow
The group's cash generated from operations increased by 24% from R13.8 billion in 2015 to R17.2 billion. The cash was
used to pay income tax of R3.4 billion (2015: R0.6 billion) and capital expenditure of R2.4 billion (2015: R6.8 billion)
was incurred. The increase in the income tax paid in 2016 was as a result of higher profitability and the lower capital
expenditure incurred during the year. At 31 December 2016 the group had a net cash position of R6.2 billion (2015: net
debt position of R4.6 billion). The group's working capital position remains healthy and included an increase of 
R2.1 billion in trade and other receivables on the back of higher realised prices. 

Expansion capital expenditure of R0.9 billion focused on the Dingleton relocation project and R1.2 billion was spent on
stay-in-business (SIB) activities, including heavy mining equipment and infrastructure, and R0.3 billion deferred stripping
was capitalised. Capital expenditure for 2017, including deferred stripping, is expected to be in the range of R2.6 billion 
to R2.8 billion, and between R3.5 billion and R3.7 billion for 2018, excluding unapproved projects.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
The following changes are reported to the ore reserves and mineral resources relative to that disclosed in the 2015
Kumba Integrated Report.

As at 31 December 2016, Kumba, from a 100% reporting perspective, had access to ore reserves of 744 Mt (at 59.7% Fe)
at its two mining operations (Sishen and Kolomela), a 16% net decrease from 2015.
 
Sishen mine's ore reserves reduced by 18% (120.5 Mt). This is in line with the guidance provided in the 2015 resource
and reserve statement which indicated that reserves were expected to reduce by ~150 Mt as a result of the selection of a
smaller, but more cost effective, pit layout for the Sishen life of mine. Commensurately, the mineral resources reduced
by 19% (98.6 Mt). A larger reduction in mineral resources was offset by the inclusion of 213 Mt of lower grade mineral
resources, following the approval of the prefeasibility study for the Sishen low grade project. 

Kolomela's ore reserves decreased by 10%, primarily due to production. The Kolomela mineral resources increased by 8%
due to the re-allocation of ore reserves to mineral resources associated with a decrease in the Kapstevel South pit
layout size.

As indicated in 2015, Thabazimbi mine's production ceased in 2016, and the mineral resources have been removed from
the portfolio as Kumba can no longer demonstrate reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.

Kumba's estimated mineral resources, in addition to its ore reserves at the two operations and the Zandrivierspoort
magnetite project, totalled 1.1 billion tonnes (at 46.5% Fe), a year-on-year decrease of 8%.

MINING CHARTER 
Significant uncertainty remains around the draft Mining Charter III process which may impact future empowerment of
mining companies and granting of new mining rights. The Chamber of Mines is actively engaging in order to obtain greater
clarity as to the future requirements and Kumba continues to closely monitor these developments.

CHANGES IN DIRECTORATE
The following non-executive directors have stepped down from the board in 2016:
- Mr T O'Neill as non-executive director on 6 February 2016
- Mr LM Nyhonyha as independent non-executive director on 31 December 2016

The board thanks the directors for their contributions and guidance during their respective tenures and wishes them
all the best in their future endeavours.

The Chief executive and executive director of the Company, Mr Norman Mbazima stepped down with effect from 
30 August 2016. 

The board thanks Mr Mbazima for his impeccable leadership over the last four years, which coincided with tumultuous
times for the mining sector and a steep decline in the iron ore price. He responded swiftly to these challenges, and
displayed the sort of temperament, technical insight and integrity which attracted the support of staff and stakeholders 
even as he led the Company through major changes. We wish him every success as he focuses on the wider imperatives of 
Anglo American in South Africa.

The Company announced the following appointments to the board:
- Mr TM Mkhwanazi as executive director and Chief executive on 1 September 2016
- Mr SG French as non-executive alternate director on 1 November 2016
- Ms NS Dlamini as non-executive director on 1 November 2016.

The board welcomes Mr Themba Mkhwanazi to his new role as Chief executive of Kumba. Mr Mkhwanazi was previously the
CEO of Anglo American's thermal coal business in South Africa. He has extensive experience in the resources industry,
including 18 years in South Africa, as well as in the USA and Australia. Sishen and Kolomela are world class assets, and the
board believes that Mr Mkhwanazi's proven technical, sales and management experience will add great value and will help
secure the long-term future of these high quality iron ore mines. 

OUTLOOK
The global and local macro-economic and socio-political environment remains challenging despite the recent rise in
iron ore prices. Given the current volatility and the long-term iron ore price outlook, cash preservation remains the
overriding priority at this stage. Improving productivity, alongside ongoing strict cost discipline and the realisation of
appropriate pricing for the Company's high quality products are very compelling levers to generate attractive returns with
low risk for shareholders. The core focus for 2017 will therefore be to step up these initiatives from current levels,
supported by the Operating Model and technology improvements, in order to realise the full potential of the assets,
provide confidence in delivery and enhance profitability.

These initiatives are expected to increase mining efficiencies, improve geological confidence and mine to plan
compliance, build buffer stockpiles, enhance plant efficiencies and maintain the product quality focus. Clear and concise 
plans are in place to deliver the required improvement. 

The group will continue with disciplined capital allocation and prioritising the reinstatement of dividends. In
addition work continues to progress the value accretive project pipeline by utilising beneficiation technologies for
application to ultrafine material to unlock value from what is currently regarded as waste. 

Sishen is expected to produce between 27 and 28 Mt of iron ore, and 150 to 160 Mt of waste, in 2017 - 2020. As
a result of the reconfigured pit, Sishen's life of mine increased from 15 to 17 years. The strip ratio is expected to
exceed 4 over the medium term, given higher waste requirements, with the average life of mine strip ratio at ~4. To 
achieve this, a strong focus on productivity, using the Operating Model, will be required, with an average improvement 
of 20% in mining equipment efficiencies from current levels. Going forward, our target is to keep Sishen's unit cash costs 
growth below mining inflation through the productivity initiatives.

The upgrade of the Sishen DMS plant to UHDMS has progressed to pre-feasibility stage and, as a result, the group has
declared an additional 213 Mt resource at Sishen. First production is expected by 2020, and is expected to add ~2 Mtpa over
Sishen's life of mine.
 
Kolomela is expected to produce between 13 - 14 Mtpa in 2017 - 2020, with further improvements in plant efficiency and
throughput rates, which will be delivered through the Operating Model and technology initiatives. The mine is targeting
20% equipment efficiencies for the year. Waste guidance remains at ~50 - 55 Mt from 2017 to 2020, in line with higher
production. The strip ratio is expected to be ~3.9 over the medium term, with the average life of mine strip ratio at 3.8. 
The ramp up of the modular plant is expected to be completed in 2017, contributing 0.7 Mtpa. Kolomela's unit costs are likely 
to increase principally due to cost escalations and the commissioning of the DMS modular plant. 

Kumba is targeting total sales of 40 - 42 Mt in 2017. Domestic sales volumes of up to 6.25 Mt are contracted to AMSA. 

Profitability remains sensitive to iron ore export prices and the ZAR/US$ exchange rate. Any reference to future
financial performance included in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company's auditors.

Further to the announcement by Anglo American in February 2016 of a potential exit from Kumba, the business and the
board, through a separately constituted committee, have focused on ensuring that Kumba is in a position to sustainably
continue business post an exit and that the appropriate governance is in place through an exit process. Shareholders will
be updated on any developments related to Anglo American's portfolio review, as appropriate.

The presentation of the Company's results for the year ended 31 December 2016 will be available on the Company's website 
www.angloamericankumba.com at 07:00 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11:30 CAT on 14 February 2017.

This measure of earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required in terms of International Financial Reporting 
Standards or the JSE Listings Requirements. Normalised earnings represents earnings from the recurring activities 
of the group.
                                          
This is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of Kumba for non-recurring 
expense or income items incurred during the year. The recognition of the deferred tax asset is a non-recurring 
item and has therefore been adjusted in determining normalised earnings.

    31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 10 February 2017.  

 2. Basis of preparation                                              
    The audited summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared, under the supervision of FT Kotzee CA(SA), 
    Chief financial officer, in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for provisional 
    reports, and the requirements of the South African Companies Act No 71 of 2008 applicable to summary financial statements. 
    The Listings Requirements require provisional reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the 
    measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial 
    Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial 
    Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial 
    Reporting.

    The audited summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost 
    convention except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments and biological assets which are stated at 
    fair value, and is presented in Rand, which is Kumba's functional and presentation currency.    

 3. Accounting policies                                              
    The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summarised 
    consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are 
    consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial 
    statements, except as disclosed below. 
    
    3.1 New standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations                                        
        None of the standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations which became effective for the year 
        commencing on 1 January 2016 had an impact on the group. 
        
    3.2 New standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been 
        early adopted                                        
        In 2016 the group did not early adopt any new, revised or amended accounting standards or interpretations. The 
        accounting standards, amendments to issued accounting standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the group 
        but not yet effective at 31 December 2016, are being evaluated for the impact of these pronouncements.

 4. Change in estimates                                              
    The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions is a key area where management's 
    judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows 
    required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use of certain estimates and 
    assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate. The closure provisions 
    are updated at each balance sheet date for changes in these estimates. The life of mine (LoM) plan on which accounting 
    estimates are based only includes proved and probable ore reserves as disclosed in Kumba's annual ore reserves and 
    mineral resources statement. The most significant change in the provision for 2016 arises from changes in the LoM, 
    inflationary changes and limited scope changes. The effect of the change in estimate of the rehabilitation and 
    decommissioning obligation quantum, which was applied prospectively from 1 January 2016, is detailed below:

    Impairment assessment                                              
    Kumba produces iron ore at Sishen and Kolomela mines in the Northern Cape province. The two mines are treated as separate 
    cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU consists of its respective mining assets located in the Northern Cape. In the 2015 
    financial year, Sishen was impaired by R6 billion, including an associated deferred tax credit of R1.7 billion. Kolomela 
    was not impaired.   
    
    The increases in iron ore prices and Kumba's market capitalisation in the current year were considered indicators for 
    potential impairment reversal for Sishen. The group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, 
    were assessed for impairment or reversal of impairment. Recoverable amounts were estimated for individual assets or, where 
    an individual asset cannot generate cash inflows independently, the recoverable amount was determined for the CGU to which 
    the asset belongs.  
    
    Consistent with the prior year, the carrying value of Kolomela at 31 December 2016 was recoverable and therefore, no 
    impairment charge was recorded. The recoverable amount of Sishen at 31 December 2016, determined on a discounted 
    cash flow (DCF) basis, was R19.9 billion, which was reasonably comparable to the carrying value of R19.5 billion. Despite 
    the short-term volatility in iron ore prices, continued supply growth is expected to put pressure on iron ore prices. As a 
    result, the group's assumption on the long-term iron ore price outlook remains conservative. In this context, the resulting 
    headroom for the Sishen CGU of R0.4 billion was considered not significant and therefore no portion of the impairment charge 
    previously recognised was reversed.  
    
    The DCF model is sensitive to forecast iron ore prices, the ZAR/US$ exchange rate and the discount rate applied. The 
    valuation is most sensitive to fluctuations in iron ore prices. It was considered whether a reasonably possible change 
    in any of the key assumptions, would result in additional impairment or reversal of previous impairment, as shown in the 
    table below:

    The group's committed debt facilities of R16.5 billion (R4.5 billion term facility and R12 billion revolving facility) 
    mature in 2020. At 31 December 2016, R4.5 billion of the committed facility had been drawn down. The directors approved 
    the early settlement of the term facility and notice was given to the lenders on 3 February 2017. As a result of the 
    settlement, the loan cannot be drawn again, effectively reducing the group's committed debt facilities to R12 billion. 
    The group also had undrawn uncommitted facilities of R8.3 billion at 31 December 2016. The group was not in breach of 
    any of its financial covenants during the year.

    SIOC and AMSA have entered into an agreement to transfer Thabazimbi mine to AMSA. The agreement is expected to become 
    effective in 2017, subject to certain conditions. Mining operations at Thabazimbi ceased in 2015 and processing operations 
    ceased on 31 March 2016. The identified assets and liabilities of Thabazimbi mine (as indicated in the disclosure below) will  
    be transferred at a nominal purchase consideration plus the assumed liabilities. If the conditions have not been satisfied  
    by 28 April 2017 (or a later date agreed to by the companies), the agreement will lapse and SIOC will proceed with closure 
    of the mine.  
    
    The requirements of IFRS 5 have been considered and as a result, the Thabazimbi mine assets and related liabilities 
    that will transfer to AMSA to be presented as part of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale as at 31 December 2016. 
    In addition, the results of Thabazimbi mine are presented as a discontinued operation for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
    Comparative figures have been restated where required. An impairment loss of R4 million has been recognised related to 
    the Thabazimbi mine assets that were not part of the lease with AMSA.

    1 Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
      or liabilities.                                        
    2 Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
      observable either directly or indirectly (i.e. derived from market-related prices).                                        
    3 Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on 
      observable market data. There were no level 3 measurement in 2016 or 2015.

    5 The iron ore derivatives are measured at fair value using market related inputs. The measurement is therefore 
      classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used in the model are the forward iron ore price 
      on the inception date as well as the iron ore price on the date the fair value calculation is performed. In 2016 
      these derivatives are presented as part of cash and cash equivalents.

    (a) Settlement agreement with SARS                                                                                                                                            
        In February 2016, the group announced the receipt of a tax assessment from the South African Revenue Service (SARS), 
        relating to Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd's (SIOC) overseas sales and marketing businesses, covering the 
        period 2006 to 2010, for the amount of R5.5 billion. This included interest and penalties of R3.7 billion. During 
        March 2016 the group submitted an application for the suspension of payment in relation to the assessment, followed 
        in July 2016 by its objection to the assessment.   
        
        In September 2016, SIOC received a letter of findings from SARS in relation to the 2011 tax year, indicating potential 
        adjustments to the Company's taxable income which would result in an additional tax liability of approximately 
        R1.0 billion, excluding any potential interest and penalties, should Kumba ultimately be assessed on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
        
        On 3 February 2017, the group concluded an agreement with the SARS to settle a dispute relating to the assessments 
        received for the years 2006 to 2010, and the tax treatment of the relevant issues in the years 2011 to 2015, inclusive, 
        for a full and final total settlement amount of R2.5 billion.   
        
        Kumba had previously provided for an amount of R1.5 billion in its annual financial statements for the financial years 
        up to 2015, and an additional R1.0 billion has been accounted for in 2016 in respect of this settlement agreement. The 
        settlement will be paid in full in the first quarter of 2017, with appropriate adjustments made for current advance 
        payments held on account.     
        
        As a responsible corporate citizen, the group's policy is to be tax compliant in all jurisdictions in which it operates.

        As previously reported, rates and taxes levied by the municipality at Sishen since 1 June 2014 were significantly higher 
        than previously levied. Subsequent to year end, the group settled the rates and taxes matter with the municipality at 
        Sishen. The settlement is effective immediately and property values and the quantum of the rates and taxes will be adjusted 
        retrospectively to the date of the publication of the 2014 municipal valuation roll.

    The group has issued financial guarantees in favour of the DMR in respect of its environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning 
    obligations to the value of R2.8 billion (2015: R2.3 billion). Included in this amount are financial guarantees for the 
    environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of the group in respect of Thabazimbi mine of R438 million 
    (2015: R438 million). AMSA has guaranteed R429 million of this amount by means of bank guarantees issued in favour of SIOC.   

    As a result of the annual revision of closure costs a further shortfall of R311 million arose. Guarantees for the shortfall 
    will be issued in due course. AMSA has guaranteed R300 million of this amount by means of bank guarantees issued in favour 
    of SIOC.

        In October 2016, the DMR granted the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine to Kumba's 
        subsidiary, SIOC following the completion of an internal appeal process, as prescribed by section 96 of the MPRDA.  
        
        As a result of the grant of the residual 21.4% undivided share, SIOC is now the sole and exclusive holder of the right 
        to mine iron ore and quartzite at the Sishen mine. This residual mining right will be incorporated into the 78.6% Sishen
        mining right that SIOC successfully converted in 2009.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
        The consent to amend SIOC's mining right, by the inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share, is subject to various 
        conditions. The conditions, where applicable, will ultimately form part of the conditions to the Sishen mining right. 
        These include the requirement for the continuation of the existing Export Parity Price (EPP) based supply agreement 
        between SIOC and AMSA in its role as a strategic South African steel producer, as well as SIOC's continued support of 
        skills development, research and development and initiatives to enable preferential procurement.

        mining companies and granting of new mining rights. The Chamber of Mines is actively engaging in order to obtain greater 
        clarity as to the future requirements and Kumba continues to closely monitor these developments.

Joint announcement - Thabazimbi mine to be transferred to ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd

Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (“SIOC”), a subsidiary of Kumba Iron Ore Limited
(“Kumba”), and ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited (“AMSA”) are pleased to announce that they have
entered into an agreement to transfer Thabazimbi mine (“the Mine”) to AMSA (“the Transfer”).

Until 2014 Thabazimbi was a captive mine owned and run by SIOC, but supplying ore exclusively to and
funded by AMSA. As a result AMSA is accountable for 96% of the Mine’s current rehabilitation liability,
with SIOC responsible for the site’s management and the remaining liability. The transfer would simplify
this arrangement by making AMSA solely responsible for Thabazimbi’s closure and rehabilitation.

Mining operations at Thabazimbi ceased on 1 September 2016. The identified assets and liabilities of the
Mine will be transferred at a purchase consideration of R1 plus the assumed liabilities. The remaining 63
SIOC employees currently engaged in mine rehabilitation and the preparation and finalisation of the
Mine closure plan will transfer to AMSA on comparable terms, conditions and benefits.

The needs of the Thabazimbi community were identified and have been incorporated into the Mine’s
social closure plan. AMSA, as part of its current financial obligation, will take over the entire social
closure plan and will be responsible for the execution, implementation and funding of these identified
projects while SIOC will retain a right of oversight.

The transfer is dependent on certain conditions being met, most notably: competition authority approval,
cession of the Thabazimbi mining rights in terms of section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act (“MPRDA”), and a satisfactory due diligence investigation by AMSA. On fulfilment of
these conditions, the employees, assets and liabilities will transfer to AMSA. If the conditions are not
satisfied by 28 April 2017 (or a later date agreed to by the companies), the agreement will lapse and
SIOC will proceed with the closure of the Mine.

“In line with our strategy to manage our costs more efficiently in what is a particularly difficult time for the
local steel industry, this agreement allows us to take full management control of the processes and costs
related to the rehabilitation liability at the Thabazimbi mine. In addition we will investigate the feasibility
of different options to possibly restart operations at the mine in order to supplement the company’s
sources of iron ore and with the potential of job creation” said Wim De Klerk, CEO of ArcelorMittal South
Africa.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said, “A transfer of the Thabazimbi mine to AMSA demonstrates
Kumba’s continued support for local beneficiation. This also simplifies the contractual relationship
between the parties around the effective management of rehabilitation. We are pleased with this
development as it would be to the benefit of both companies and stakeholders.”

The transfer is below the JSE transaction thresholds for both companies and this announcement is for
information purposes only.

Kumba agrees settlement with SARS

Kumba announces its agreement with the South African Revenue Service (“SARS”) to settle a
dispute relating to assessments received for the years 2006 to 2010 inclusive, and the tax
treatment of the relevant issues in the years 2011 to 2015 inclusive, for a full and final total
settlement amount of R2.5 billion (approximately $185 million). Shareholders are referred to the
announcements released on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on 29
February 2016 and 13 September 2016 regarding the tax discussions between Sishen Iron Ore
Company (“SIOC”), a 76.3% subsidiary of Kumba, and SARS.

Kumba had already provided for an amount of R1.5 billion in its annual financial statements for
the tax years up to 2015, and an additional R1.0 billion will be accounted for in 2016 in respect
of this settlement agreement. The settlement will be paid in full in Q1 2017, with appropriate
adjustments made for current advance payments held on account.

As a responsible corporate citizen, our policy is to be tax compliant in all jurisdictions in which
we operate.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “I am pleased that we have reached this important
settlement with SARS, providing clarity for all and enabling us to focus our efforts on ensuring
that Kumba continues to operate at the optimal level and furthers its position as a major
economic and social contributor to the South African economy.”

Kumba generates substantial value for all its stakeholders and is fully committed to the
transformation of the South African mining industry and to the wider societal and economic
benefits that the Company brings; for example in 2015 alone, a year during which the iron ore
price fell sharply, Kumba contributed R900 million in corporate taxes and mineral royalties, R4.7
billion in salaries and wages, R15.2 billion in local procurement, R6.8 billion of capital reinvested
in the business and R174 million in social investment in health, housing, education and small
business development.

Sishen produced 8.5Mt up 11% on 4Q15. Run rates during the quarter were in line
with the considerable improvement realised in Q3 2016 following the successful
completion of its restructuring to a lower cost pit shell. Full year production was
28.4Mt exceeding the guided target of 27Mt. The higher production was attributable to
improved mining productivity as well as access to low strip ratio ore and higher plant
yields during the second half of the year. Waste removal, as planned, was 32% lower
at 37Mt compared to 4Q15.

Kolomela production rose by 20% to 3.4Mt compared to Q4 2015, with the mine
exceeding its full year target of 12Mt to 12.7Mt. The improvement in production was
driven by higher levels of throughput as a result of further debottlenecking and
optimization of the plant. Waste mined was 59% higher than the corresponding period
in 2015 at 15.4Mt in line with higher production levels.

Export sales increased marginally compared to both 3Q16 and 4Q15 to 10.6Mt. Total
finished product stocks were 3.5Mt, compared to 3.1Mt at 30 September 2016.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016
Shareholders are advised that Kumba is currently finalising its
results for the year ended 31 December 2016 (“the period”),
which will be released on the Stock Exchange News Service of the
JSE Limited (“SENS”) on 14 February 2017.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
requirements, and further to the trading statement released on
SENS on 2 December 2016 in which the Company indicated that
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) and basic earnings per
share (“EPS”) for the period would be at least 20% higher than
the previous year ended 31 December 2015 (“the comparative
period”); shareholders are advised that headline earnings for
the period are likely to be between R8,453 million and R8,890
million, with basic earnings for the period expected to be
between R8,351 million and R8,782 million. HEPS is likely to be
between R26.36 and R27.72, an increase of between 123% and 135%.
Basic EPS is expected to be between R26.04 and R27.38.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the
comparative period (released on SENS on 9 February 2016) were
R3,792 million and R469 million respectively, while reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparative period were R11.82 and R1.46
respectively.

The increase in earnings is largely attributable to the increase
in export iron ore prices, as well as the impairment charge of
R5,978 million that was included in basic earnings but excluded
from headline earnings in the comparative period. More
information will be provided in the Company’s results to be
released on SENS on 14 February 2017.

The financial information, on which this trading statement is
based, has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s

Kumba’s results for the year ending 31 December 2016 (""the period"")
will be released on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“Listings

as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results
for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from
those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Headline earnings and basic earnings reported for the year ended
31 December 2015 (as released on SENS on 9 February 2016) (""the

while headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) and earnings per share
(“EPS”) reported for the comparative period were R11.82 and R1.46
respectively.

Kumba’s headline earnings and basic earnings for the period are likely
to be at least 20% higher than the comparative period translating to an
increase of at least R758 million and R94 million, respectively. In
this regard, HEPS and EPS are also likely to be at least 20% higher
than the comparative period translating to an increase of R2.36 and
R0.30, respectively.

The expected increase in earnings is largely attributable to the
increase in export iron ore prices during the year and the weaker
average ZAR/US$ exchange rate.

Shareholders are advised that a further trading statement will be
issued in due course to provide forecast ranges for HEPS and EPS as
required by the Listings Requirements.

Sishen’s production was up 46% to 8.3 Mt compared to Q2 2016 (3Q15: 7.7 Mt) following the
successful completion of its restructuring. The improvement in production was due to
increased run of mine feed rates, improved quality feedstock material and better plant yields.
The mine transitioned to a 3–shift roster system in early September, which is expected to
result in further improvements in equipment efficiencies over the medium term. Sishen
remains on track to achieve guided production of ~27 Mt for the full year.

Consistent with the mine’s lower cost pit configuration, waste removal decreased to 35 Mt
(compared to 60 Mt in 3Q15). Waste run rates remain in line with the full year guidance of
135-150 Mt.

Detailed work to refine the Sishen life of mine plan, based on the revised pit configuration,
was completed during Q3 2016. This life of mine plan validated the key performance metrics
for Sishen including production and waste volumes, which are in line with guidance
previously provided.

Kolomela’s production was up 8% to 3.4 Mt compared to Q2 2016 (3Q15: 3.3 Mt). Waste
mining increased to 14.6 Mt from 12.5 Mt during the same period. The mine is expected to
exceed its 12Mt production target for the full year, with a commensurate marginal increase in
waste.

Export sales increased by 18% to 10.3 Mt compared to Q2 2016 (3Q15: 9.8 Mt), reflecting
improved production volumes at Sishen during the quarter. Total finished product stocks
were 3.1 Mt, compared with 2.3 Mt at 30 June 2016.

Kumba granted residual 21.4% mining right for Sishen mine

Kumba Iron Ore Limited (“Kumba”) is pleased to announce that the Department of Mineral Resources
(“DMR”) has, after taking all the relevant considerations into account, granted the residual 21.4%
undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine to Kumba’s subsidiary, Sishen Iron Ore Company
(Pty) Ltd (""SIOC"") following the completion of an internal appeal process, as prescribed by section 96 of
the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act.

As a result of the grant of the residual 21.4% undivided share, SIOC is now the sole and exclusive holder
of the right to mine iron ore and quartzite at the Sishen mine. This residual mining right will be
incorporated into the 78.6% Sishen mining right that SIOC successfully converted in 2009.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “Kumba welcomes the news of being awarded the residual
right for the Sishen mine. As our track record shows clearly, Kumba is fully committed to transformation
and will continue contributing towards the achievement of South Africa’s developmental objectives. We
appreciate the work of the Department of Mineral Resources in bringing this matter to a successful
conclusion.”

The consent to amend SIOC’s mining right, by the inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share, is
subject to various conditions. The conditions, where applicable, will ultimately form part of the conditions
to the Sishen mining right. These include the requirement for the continuation of the existing Export Parity
Price (“EPP”) based supply agreement between SIOC and ArcelorMittal SA Limited (“ArcelorMittal”) in its
role as a strategic South African steel producer, as well as SIOC’s continued support of skills
development, research and development and initiatives to enable preferential procurement.

Notes to editors:
The Constitutional Court ruled on 12 December 2013 that the residual 21.4% undivided share of the
mining right in respect of SIOC’s Sishen mine remained available for allocation by the DMR and that,
based on the provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, only SIOC could
apply to be granted the residual right. SIOC subsequently applied to the DMR in relation to the residual
right.

The key terms of the supply agreement between Kumba and ArcelorMittal, as per the 6 November 2015
SENS announcement are as follows: The EPP will be calculated on the basis of an international index
(the “index price”) and, at certain index price levels, ArcelorMittal will receive a discounted price, as
follows: if the index price is between USD60/t and USD70/t, ArcelorMittal will receive a 5% discount to the
EPP; between USD70/t and USD80/t, a 6.25% discount would apply and at an index price above
USD80/t, a 7.5% discount would apply. If the index price is below USD60, ArcelorMittal will pay the EPP.

Kumba receives SARS letter of findings for 2011 tax year

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service
on 29 February 2016 regarding the receipt of a tax assessment from the South African Revenue
Service (“SARS”) by Kumba’s 73.9% owned subsidiary, Sishen Iron Ore Company (“SIOC”), in
relation to the tax years 2006 to 2010. SIOC subsequently submitted an objection to the
assessment as well as an application for the suspension of payment in relation to the
assessment and is awaiting a response from the Commissioner of SARS on both matters.

Kumba has now received a similar letter of findings from SARS in relation to the 2011 tax year,
indicating potential adjustments to the Company’s taxable income which would result in an
additional tax liability of approximately R1.0 billion, excluding any potential interest and
penalties, should Kumba ultimately be assessed on this basis. SIOC has cooperated fully with
SARS during the course of the audit but, supported by its specialist tax and legal advisors,
disagrees with SARS' audit findings and will respond to the letter accordingly and within the
prescribed period.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “As a responsible corporate citizen, Kumba and its
subsidiaries believe that all taxes owed under South African tax legislation have been paid and
that we comply with all applicable tax laws in all jurisdictions in which we operate.”

“Kumba generates substantial value for all its stakeholders and is fully committed to the
transformation of the South African mining industry and to the wider societal and economic
benefits that we bring; for example in 2015 alone, a year during which the iron ore price fell
sharply, our business contributed R900 million in corporate taxes and mineral
royalties, R4.7 billion in salaries and wages, R15.2 billion in local procurement, R6.8 billion of
capital reinvested in the business and R174 million in social investment in health, housing,
education and small business development.”
 
As previously disclosed, the field audit for the 2012 and 2013 tax years is in progress. Kumba
will update shareholders as appropriate.

2016, following Norman Mbazima’s decision to step down after four years to focus on his role as Deputy Chairman of Anglo American South Africa, with
effect from 31 August 2016. Norman Mbazima will remain a member of Anglo American’s Group Management Committee and will play a key role in the
processes to restructure and divest Anglo American plc’s non-core assets in South Africa, including its interest in Kumba.

Themba has been CEO of Anglo American’s Coal South Africa business since May 2014. Prior to this, he was Rio Tinto’s Regional General Manager for
the Americas and COO of Richards Bay Minerals.

Kumba’s chairman, Fani Titi said: “I would like to thank Norman for his impeccable leadership over the last four years. His leadership of Kumba coincided
with tumultuous times for the mining sector and a steep decline in the iron ore price. Norman responded swiftly to these challenges, never shying away
from the tough decisions needed to ensure the Company’s sustainability. Throughout his tenure, Norman displayed the sort of temperament, technical
insight and integrity which attracted the support of staff and stakeholders even as he led the Company through major changes. I wish him every success as
he focuses on the wider imperatives of Anglo American in South Africa. I welcome Themba to his new role as CEO of Kumba. Sishen and Kolomela are
world class assets, and I believe Themba’s proven technical, sales and management experience will add great value and will help secure the long-term
future of these high quality iron ore mines. The Board remains committed to the strategy of continuing to deliver a robust, sustainable long term business
based on the revised mine plans, cost base restructuring and operational efficiencies that have defined the last 2 years.”

Norman Mbazima said: “I have been privileged to lead Kumba through what has been a tough period for iron ore and for South African mining. Together
with the Kumba team, we have transformed the business to put it on a firmer footing, making the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the business’
profitability and long term health. I wish Themba well as he takes up the role as CEO and look forward to continuing to work closely with him as I consider
the optimal divestment path for Anglo American’s non-core interests in South Africa.”

Themba Mkhwanazi commented: “I am excited by the prospect of leading one of South Africa’s great success stories. Kumba has a rich mineral
endowment and a skilled and dedicated workforce enabling us to produce high quality lump and fine iron ore products to our steel customers around the
world. My energies will be focused on maintaining Kumba’s strong track record in safe production, mutually beneficial relationships and further increasing
productivity to ensure the sustainability of the business for the benefit of all our stakeholders

Kumba Iron Ore Limited (‘Kumba’ or ’the company‘ or ‘the group’) announces its results for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Safety
The focus on safety remains the key priority for the group. Regrettably, two of our colleagues lost their lives in the
first six months of the year. It is with deep regret that we report the deaths of Mr Grahame Skansi, a drill operator
at Kolomela mine, on 27 January 2016, and Mr Gideon Dihaisi, a learner electrician at Sishen mine, on 10 May 2016. Our
heartfelt condolences go out to their loved ones. Any injury or loss of life in the work environment is both tragic and
unacceptable. We have revised our safety programmes and plans to drive a turnaround. Interventions have been initiated to
enhance employees’ understanding of risk, ensure role clarity and improve overall engagement through safety
communication. The implementation of critical engineering controls for priority unwanted events continues. The total 
recordable  case frequency rate, a measure of frequency of injuries, was 0.83 (2015: 0.77) and the lost-time injury frequency 
rate (LTIFR) increased to 0.27 (2015: 0.22). The interventions in our safety performance are starting to yield results with
encouraging improvements in our leading indicator reporting.

Significant changes delivered
Norman Mbazima, Chief Executive of Kumba, notes, “This time last year, Kumba was facing a significantly deteriorating price
environment which brought about immense change to the industry. Iron ore prices have since declined by a further 13%,
reflecting the deep shift in commodity markets. Dynamic iron ore market fundamentals, including low cost supply, the flattening
of the cost curve and more muted demand from China, necessitated a thorough review of Kumba’s business in order to
further improve its competitive position and reduce cash costs. As a result, we moved decisively to implement major changes
which included closing unprofitable ore sources, moving Sishen to a lower cost pit shell, restructuring the entire
organisation, reducing cash costs, preserving cash and introducing operational improvements. I am pleased to report that we
have made substantial progress as reflected in this set of mid-year results.

We revised our asset portfolio by ceasing operations and commencing closure processes at the high cost Thabazimbi
mine, ramping up low cost production at Kolomela and significantly restructuring our core asset, Sishen, to cope with lower
prices. This enabled us to reset our operational and capital expenditure, bringing down cash costs and our cash
breakeven price to more competitive levels. The improvement in prices over the past six months from the low of $38.50/tonne 
in December 2015, the R3.1 billion savings in controllable costs, including a 61% reduction in capital expenditure 
to R1.3 billion, enabled us to generate strong free cash flow, which supported the substantial debt reduction 
from a net debt position of R4.6 billion at the end of 2015. At 30 June 2016, Kumba was in a net cash position of 
R548 million, which provides us with good financial flexibility to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. Kumba is 
now much more resilient and better positioned for lower prices.”

Operations reflect challenging first half
The first half of 2016 has been exceptionally challenging operationally as a result of the transition to the revised 2016 mine 
plan at Sishen and the consequential major reduction in the workforce. The revised mine plan necessitated an extensive
redeployment of mining equipment resulting in a 30% reduction in the mining fleet. We are considering the future use of the
equipment. 

The restructuring process at Sishen commenced on 28 January 2016 and involved a review of the complete organisational
structure. As such, the process affected every role on the mine as we aimed to ensure that the workforce matched the new
mine plan, in terms of the reduced equipment and substantially increased productivity rates. The process has largely
been completed and resulted in a reduction in the workforce of some 1,500 full-time employees and 900 contractors,
equivalent to a 31% overall reduction. This took place mainly through voluntary separation and without any work stoppages. 
We are pleased that overall labour relations have been stable throughout the period. 

Total production was reduced by 21% to 17.8 Mt, most of which was due to the significantly revised mine plan at
Sishen. This reduction was affected further by disruptions caused by the restructuring process, higher than normal rainfall
and safety related stoppages.

We have seen a marked recovery in productivity and key operational performance drivers at Sishen post the restructuring, 
which, together with Kolomela’s steady performance, gives us confidence that we will achieve full year guidance
on production of ~39 Mt. Notwithstanding the fact that the second half catch-up is likely to put pressure on the logistics
channel, we are confident of achieving our revised export sales guidance of ~38 - 39 Mt. 

Robust financial performance
Capital and cost discipline remains fundamental to our business model as we move forward in this uncertain and
volatile landscape. The transformation in our cash cost base has provided us with a reasonable uplift in our operating 
margin to 29%, compared to the 18% in 2H 2015, and in line with the 28% of 1H 2015. Despite lower realised prices and volumes,
on a normalised basis, our year on year financial performance has remained quite robust. Operating free cash flow was
strong, up 18% to R6.7 billion and we have delivered an improved return on capital employed of 37% (1H 2015: 34%). We aim to
continue to transform our cost base, working towards the most important shareholder principle - that of growing
sustainable free cash flow and reinstating the dividend.

No interim dividend
The board’s approach is to review the declaration of a dividend at each interim and annual reporting period. Taking
cognisance of the continued market volatility and uncertain outlook, we intend to continue to strengthen our balance sheet
as outlined above and focus our efforts on stabilising and further improving our operational performance. The board has
therefore decided not to declare an interim 2016 dividend.

Overview of six months ended 30 June 2016
Total tonnes mined were 110 Mt, 35% lower than the 170 Mt of 1H 2015, in line with the new pit configuration at
Sishen. Total production declined to 17.8 Mt due to the planned reduction in production at Sishen of 11.5 Mt, and a continued strong
performance at Kolomela of 5.9 Mt, with the balance made up by the final Thabazimbi volumes. Total sales volumes decreased
by 22% to 20.2 Mt (2015: 26 Mt) on the back of lower export sales of 18.1 Mt (2015: 23.2 Mt), due to the lower
production.

Kumba reduced controllable costs by $8/tonne from the average for the full year 2015 to achieve an average cash
breakeven price of $34/tonne (CFR China) in the first six months of 2016, well within the targeted range of $32/tonne -
$40/tonne. The improvements include savings in operating costs of $3.64/tonne, capital expenditure reduced by $4.83 tonne, 
and lower freight rates assisted further with approximately $2/tonne. FOB cash costs for the company were down 18% to
$27/tonne, while Sishen and Kolomela achieved $30/tonne and $21/tonne, respectively.

Headline earnings increased by 20% to R3 billion (2015: R2.5 billion), mainly as a result of the derecognition of a
deferred tax asset of R617 million in H1 2015. Earnings were impacted by lower realised iron ore export prices, which
weakened by 10% to an average of $55/tonne (2015: $61/tonne), partially offset by the favourable impact of a 29% weakening
of the Rand against the US Dollar. Attributable and headline earnings for the period were R9.30 and R9.41 per share,
respectively. Normalised earnings were 4% lower than the comparative period at R9.41 per share (2015: R9.78 per share).

Regulatory update
In 2015, Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Limited (SIOC) received notice from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR)
that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the amendment of SIOC’s mining right in respect of the Sishen mine,
by the inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine, subject to certain
conditions (which are described by the DMR as “proposals”). The conditions were not capable of being accepted by SIOC as
SIOC believes the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) does not provide for the imposition of such
conditions, they are not practically implementable and lack sufficient detail to provide the company with legal certainty. 

SIOC submitted an internal appeal in terms of section 96 of the MPRDA to the Minister of Mineral Resources, which sets
out the basis of its objections to the proposals. SIOC has not yet received a response and continues to engage with the
DMR in this regard.

SARS assessment
On 29 February 2016, the group announced the receipt of a tax assessment from SARS, relating to SIOC’s overseas sales
and marketing businesses, covering the period 2006 to 2010, for the amount of R5.5 billion. This included interest and
penalties of R3.7 billion. On 18 July 2016, the group submitted its objection to the assessment.

An application was submitted to the Commissioner of SARS for a suspension of payment. SARS granted the suspension of
payment until 31 July 2016 to allow for the evaluation of SIOC’s grounds of objection. SARS will resubmit SIOC’s
application for the suspension of payment to the relevant SARS committee to consider the continuation of the suspension in 
light of SIOC’s objection. 

The field audit, covering the 2011 to 2013 years of assessment, is in progress.

The group considered these matters in consultation with specialist external tax and legal advisers and disagrees with
SARS’ audit findings, and believes that all the above matters have been appropriately treated in the results for the six
months ended 30 June 2016.

Market overview
Global crude steel production contracted 2.5% to 794 Mt for the first half of 2016 (2015: 814 Mt). China’s production
of 401 Mt was 2% lower despite a 6% year on year increase in Chinese steel exports. The improvement in downstream demand
in China, driven by a record liquidity injection and accelerated infrastructure spending, has temporarily staved off
the overcapacity in the domestic steel sector, pushing steel prices higher. This positive demand environment and improved
steel mill margins have driven up Chinese crude steel production, boosting demand for iron ore. 

Global seaborne iron ore supply was 5% higher at 699 Mt (2015: 667 Mt) due to higher exports from Australia and
Brazil, tempered by seasonal disruptions. The price rally during 1H 2016 incentivised non-traditional higher cost supply
sources to re-enter the market. 

Notwithstanding the iron ore price recovery up to $70.50/tonne in April 2016 from the historic lows in 2015, average index
iron ore prices (CFR China 62% Fe) in the first half of 2016 were down 13%, from $60/tonne in 1H 2015 to $52/tonne. Trading 
in steel and iron ore futures has contributed to the significant price volatility over the period. Mine restarts, seasonal 
supply uptick and continued weakening supply and demand fundamentals are expected to result in further pressure on the iron 
ore price for the remainder of the year.

Sishen mine
Sishen’s operations were impacted by the implementation of the revised mine plan, which effectively halved mining
volumes, and the consequential major reduction in the workforce as detailed earlier. As a result, total tonnes mined at
Sishen decreased by 33% to 83.7 Mt (2015: 125.6 Mt). Through the implementation of the changes, the mine’s stripping ratio
reduced to 3.5 for the six months, compared to 5.7 for the FY 2015, which reflects the positive results expected from the
new plan.

Production at Sishen declined by 29% to 11.5 Mt (2015: 16.1 Mt) and waste mined was 64.9 Mt, a 40% reduction from
2015. Run rates for the half year were affected by the significant restructuring process, which commenced in the first
quarter, and which has now been substantially completed. This was further aggravated by higher levels of rainfall, and safety
incidences, including a fatality. Rainfall averaged 72 mm per month compared to a long-term average of 42 mm and an
average of 22 mm in the corresponding period. 

The successful restructuring has increased the mine’s flexibility and run rates on key operating parameters have shown
a marked improvement during June 2016. Average daily total tonnes handled and ex-pit ore improved by 28% and 38%,
respectively, compared to May 2016, in support of the guided production for the full year of ~27 Mt. 

Kolomela mine
At Kolomela, the revised mining plan announced at the end of 2015 was implemented, in line with the optimisation of
the mine. As a result, total tonnes mined was 24% lower at 26.7 Mt, (2015: 34.9 Mt). Waste mined was 20.2 Mt 
(2015: 26.3Mt), a decrease of 23%, as planned. Operations were impacted by a safety stoppage early in the period following 
the fatality which occurred in January 2016. The mine produced 5.9 Mt of ore (2015: 5.9 Mt) from 24% lower ex-pit ore,
benefiting from stockpiled material. Plant efficiencies and throughput continue to improve in support of the mine’s targets.

Operating Model
The implementation of the Operating Model continues to yield operational efficiency improvements and supported the
restructuring during H1 2016 at both mines, where the clarity of work that is assigned through the Operating Model assisted
greatly in the configuration of the new structures.

The roll out of the Operating Model at Sishen continues and has now been implemented in various parts of the mining
and maintenance departments. The first Operating Model implementation at Kolomela mine went live during H1 2016, where
work management processes were implemented at both the plant maintenance and plant operations. This work is currently in
the stabilisation phase, and the mine has already seen significant benefits from the implementation, most notably the
reduction in plant throughput variation.

Logistics
Kumba’s volumes railed on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore Export Channel were 16% lower at 18.3 Mt (including 0.7 Mt
railed to Saldanha Steel) (2015: 21.8 Mt), impacted by low stock levels as a result of reduced production. The group is in
ongoing discussions with Transnet to mitigate the impact of any volume shortfalls. Kumba shipped 18.1 Mt (2015: 23 Mt)
from the Saldanha port destined for the export market, down 21%, including 0.3 Mt shipped through the multi-purpose
terminal (MPT) at the Saldanha port.

Sales
Total sales were 22% lower at 20.2 Mt (2015: 26 Mt), as export sales volumes of 18.1 Mt (2015: 23.2 Mt), including 
0.7 Mt from third party producers, were impacted by the lower production. CFR sales accounted for 70% of export sales
volumes (2015: 68%). Finished product inventory held at the mines and ports decreased to 2.3 Mt from 4.7 Mt as at 
31 December 2015 (30 June 2015: 3.9 Mt). 65% of total export volumes were directed to China compared to 60% during the 
first half of 2015. The group’s lump:fine ratio was 63:37 for the period (2015: 67:33).

Financial results
Discontinued operation
Kumba announced the decision to initiate closure procedures at Thabazimbi on 16 July 2015, following an extensive
review of the mine in response to a combination of factors that affected the mine’s economic viability. Mining activities 
at Thabazimbi ceased in September 2015, while processing activities ceased on 31 March 2016. Thabazimbi is therefore
classified as a discontinued operation in the results for the period ended 30 June 2016, and the comparative figures have
been restated to disclose the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.

Revenue
The group’s total revenue from continuing operations of R17.6 billion for the period was 12% lower than the R20 billion 
for the comparable period in 2015, mainly as a result of the 10% drop in average realised iron ore export price to
US$55/tonne (2015: US$61/tonne), and 22% lower total sales volumes. In addition, lower freight rates resulted in a 
R535 million reduction in shipping revenue. This was partially offset by the 29% decline in the average Rand/US$ 
exchange rate (1H 2016: R15.40/US$1 compared to 1H 2015: R11.91/US$1), together with a higher lump premium in
the second quarter. Premiums increased by 69% to $0.18/dmtu in Q2 2016 from that of the first quarter, on the back of
increased demand for direct charge material supported by stronger steel prices. However, compared to the 1H 2015 average
of $0.20/dmtu, premiums were still down 28% to $0.15/dmtu.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses from continuing operations were 13% lower at R12.4 billion from R14.3 billion in the first half of 2015; 
principally as a result of lower total mining volumes, resulting in a 12% saving on mining costs, savings from overhead reductions, 
and lower diesel prices and contractor rates. Selling and distribution costs reduced by R217 million as a result of 16% lower
volumes railed. R457 million lower freight costs were incurred on the back of the Platts freight rate on the Saldanha-Qingdao 
route dropping by $2/wmt. Spot freight rates averaged R5.30/tonne, 31% down from $7.70/tonne in 1H 2015. This was
offset by inflationary pressure on input costs of 6.2%.

The reduction in permanent and fixed term employees through the labour restructuring process at Sishen resulted in
R377 million additional retrenchment cost in the period. This is expected to contribute to annual sustainable savings from
2017 going forward. Further savings were achieved through aggressive management of overheads and by curtailing project
and technical studies, partially offset by inflation and currency movements.
 
Unit cash costs at Sishen mine of R327 per tonne increased by 5% (FY 2015: R311 per tonne). This is primarily a result
of lower production volumes (+R87/tonne), lower deferred waste stripping costs capitalised driven by a lower stripping
ratio of 3.5, (+R58/tonne) and inflationary pressure on input costs (+R3/tonne), partially offset by lower mining
volumes (-R132/tonne).

Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R172 per tonne (FY 2015: R178 per tonne), a 3% decrease from lower mining
volumes (-R21/tonne) and overhead support services cost savings. This was partially offset by lower capitalisation of 
deferred waste stripping costs (+R8/tonne).

Operating profit
Kumba’s operating profit margin was 1% higher at 29% (2015: 28%). The group’s mining operating margin was reasonable
at 32% (2015: 32%), excluding the net freight loss incurred on shipping operations mainly as a result of long-term fixed
price chartering contracts. Operating profit decreased by 8% to R5.2 billion (2015: R5.6 billion). The lower revenue
outlined previously impacted profitability, partially offset by the savings in operating expenses.

Cash flow
Cash flow of R7.6 billion was generated from operations during the six months which enabled the group to end the
period in a net cash position of R548 million (1H 2015: net debt of R6.1 billion; 31 December 2015: net debt of R4.6 billion). 
Capital expenditure of R1.3 billion was incurred, R0.5 billion on stay-in-business (SIB) activities, R0.5 billion 
on deferred stripping, and R340 million on expansions, which included R309 million on the Dingleton project. The relocation
of the remaining houses for the Dingleton project has progressed well and is expected to be completed on schedule and
within budget.

The group expects total capital expenditure for 2016 (including deferred stripping) to be in the range of R2.9 billion
to R3.1 billion, excluding unapproved projects.

Ore reserves and mineral resources
There have been no material changes to the ore reserves and mineral resources as disclosed in the 2015 Kumba
Integrated Report. As reported in February 2016, it is expected that the 2016 Kumba ore reserves and mineral resources may
decrease materially (~150 Mt) from those stated in 2015, pending the update of the group’s ore reserves and mineral resources
in the second half of this year, including a detailed update for the reconfiguration of the Sishen mine.

Events after the reporting period
There were no significant events that occurred from 30 June 2016 to the date of this report, not otherwise dealt with
in this report.

Changes in directorate and executive management

Kumba announces Norman Mbazima’s decision to step down as Chief Executive after four years with the company to focus on his role 
as Deputy Chairman of Anglo American South Africa, effective 31 August 2016. Themba Mkhwanazi will take up the role of Chief 
Executive with effect from 1 September 2016. Themba is currently the CEO of Anglo American Coal South Africa.

The Board thanks Norman for his impeccable leadership over the last four years and wishes him every success as he focuses on the 
wider imperatives of Anglo American in South Africa.

Outlook
The review of Sishen’s 2016 mine plan and related mining model has been completed, including updated material and
metallurgical classification, providing more confidence in the plan that was revised late 2015. The second half of 2016 is
therefore expected to be a more stable operating environment and Kumba remains confident of delivering production and
waste targets for 2016 of ~27 Mt and ~135 - 150 Mt, respectively. This means a significantly increased run rate in H2 2016.
Good indications that the required run rate should be achieved were seen in June 2016. The mine continues to explore
opportunities to feed the plants from secondary sources of material, with the processing of some stockpile material
expected to materialise during the remainder of the year. Production and waste is expected to be ~27 Mt and ~150 Mt from 
2017 - 2020, respectively.

Kumba is accelerating study work on its low grade beneficiation projects at Sishen to utilise spare plant capacity,
which includes leveraging off low-grade technology to upgrade the DMS plant to UHDMS, as well as the construction of a
second modular plant at Sishen. This will further de-risk the mine plan and provide options to simplify and optimise the
plant feed strategy. Estimated capital expenditure for the second modular plant is expected to be ~R400 - R600 million. 
The two projects are expected to deliver additional production of ~3 Mtpa over the life of mine. 

Kolomela is on track to achieve ~12 Mt for this year, significantly above its original design capacity. Work continues
to achieve ~13 Mt in 2017, which will be aided by further improvements in plant efficiency and throughput rates. Waste
guidance remains at ~46-48 Mt in 2016, and ~50-55 Mt from 2017 - 2020. The construction of a modular plant at Kolomela
has commenced and is progressing well. The plant is expected to be commissioned in 2017, contributing ~0.7 Mtpa.
Estimated 2016 capital expenditure is ~R120 million with total project capital estimated at ~R420 million. Work is under 
way to extend production for the life of mine. 

The continuation of Kumba’s mine plan reviews during this period has not indicated any significant issues. Further
work is being undertaken to reconfirm all short, medium and long-term mine plans and guidance will be provided on these
horizons when this process has been completed.

Kumba continues to target a cash breakeven price of between $32/tonne and $40/tonne CFR for 2016. Volatility in non-controllable
costs, however, is anticipated to continue.

Export sales volumes are expected to be under pressure as we go through the winter months and experience the annual
maintenance shutdown on the iron ore export channel in H2, and from lower third party ore purchases, which resulted in
reduced stockpiles. Full year guidance has therefore been reduced to ~38 - 39 Mt compared to previous guidance of 40 Mt.
Domestic sales volumes of up to 6.25 Mt are contracted to ArcelorMittal SA in terms of the supply agreement, however ~3 Mt
is expected for 2016.

Iron ore prices are expected to remain under pressure in the short to medium term. The group’s profitability remains
sensitive to the volatility in iron ore export prices and the Rand/US$ exchange rate. Kumba will continue to optimise its
assets by stepping up financial and operational performance to grow free cash flow and returns. The company will focus
on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide flexibility to deal with price volatility.

Anglo American and Kumba continue to work together to evaluate options for the divestment of Anglo American’s 69.7%
shareholding and how the business can best create sustainable value for all its stakeholders. Shareholders will be updated
on any further developments, as appropriate.

The presentation of the company’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 will be available on the company’s
website www.angloamericankumba.com at 08h00 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11h30 CAT on 26 July 2016.

   This measure of earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards or the 
   JSE Listings Requirements. Normalised earnings represents earnings from the normal activities of the group.
   
   Normalised earnings is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of Kumba for abnormal expense or 
   income items incurred during the year. The derecognition of the deferred tax asset and a once-off gain realised on a lease receivable 
   are non-recurring items and have therefore been adjusted in determining normalised earnings in the comparative periods. There were 
   no adjusting items in the current period.                                                             


NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016

   1.      Corporate information                                                                                              
           Kumba is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in South Africa. The main business of Kumba, its 
           subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is the exploration, extraction, beneficiation, marketing, sale and shipping 
           of iron ore. The group is listed on the JSE Limited (JSE).
   
           The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Kumba and its subsidiaries for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
           were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 20 July 2016.
   
   2.      Basis of preparation                                                                                              
           The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared, under the supervision of FT Kotzee CA(SA), 
           Chief financial officer, in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting and in compliance with the JSE Listings 
           Requirements for interim reports, the South African Companies Act No 71 of 2008 and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides 
           as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards 
           Council.
  
           The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost 
           convention except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments and biological assets which are stated at fair 
           value, and are presented in Rand, which is Kumba’s functional and presentation currency. All financial information 
           presented in Rand has been rounded off to the nearest million.
  
           2.1.      Comparative figures                                                                     
                     The Thabazimbi mine is classified as a discontinued operation for the period ended 30 June 2016, and as a result, 
                     the comparative figures have been restated to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing 
                     operations. Refer to note 10 for more information.                      
           2.2.      Accounting policies                                                                     
                     The accounting policies and methods of computation applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated 
                     interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent 
                     with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial 
                     statements.                      
                     No new standards, amendments to published standards or interpretations which became effective for the year 
                     commencing on 1 January 2016 had an effect on the reported results or the group accounting policies. The group 
                     did not early adopt any new, revised or amended accounting standards or interpretations. The accounting 
                     standards, amendments to issued accounting standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the group but 
                     not yet effective at 30 June 2016, are being evaluated for the impact of these pronouncements.                                                                                                                  
           2.3.      Going concern                                                                           
                     In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, 
                     the directors are required to consider whether the group can continue in operational existence for the 
                     foreseeable future. The financial performance of the group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in 
                     which the group operates. Factors exist which are outside the control of management which can have a significant 
                     impact on the business, specifically the volatility in the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate and the iron ore price.                      
                     These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a going-concern basis. The board is 
                     satisfied that the group is sufficiently liquid and solvent to be able to support the current operations for the 
                     next 12 months.                      
           2.4.      Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions                                        
                     In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
                     management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are 
                     consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.                      
           2.5.      Change in estimates                                                                     
                     The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions are a key area where 
                     management’s judgement is required. The closure provisions are measured at the present value of the expected 
                     future cash flows required to perform the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use 
                     of certain estimates and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the future cash flows and the 
                     discount rate. The closure provisions are updated at each balance sheet date for changes in these estimates.                      
                     The life of mine plan on which accounting estimates are based, only includes proved and probable ore reserves 
                     as disclosed in Kumba’s 2015 annual ore reserves and mineral resources statement. The Kolomela life of mine 
                     plan used to calculate the rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions was revised. This resulted in an 
                     increase in the provisions.                      
                     The effect of this change, which was applied prospectively from 1 January 2016, is detailed below:

            Thabazimbi mine in response to a combination of factors which adversely affected the mine’s economic viability which 
            resulted in the decision taken in 2015 to close the mine. The Thabazimbi operation is classified as a discontinued 
            operation for the period ended 30 June 2016, and as a result, the comparative figures have been restated to present

            The iron ore derivatives are measured at fair value using market-related inputs. The measurement is therefore classified

                      On 29 February 2016, the group announced the receipt of a tax assessment from SARS, relating to SIOC’s overseas 
                      sales and marketing businesses, covering the period 2006 to 2010, for the amount of R5.5 billion. This included 
                      interest and penalties of R3.7 billion. On 18 July 2016, the group submitted its objection to the assessment.
  
                      An application was submitted to the Commissioner of SARS for a suspension of payment. SARS granted the suspension 
                      of payment until 31 July 2016 to allow for the evaluation of SIOC’s grounds of objection. SARS will resubmit 
                      SIOC’s application for the suspension of payment to the relevant SARS committee to consider the continuation of 
                      the suspension in light of SIOC’s objection.
  
                      The field audit, covering the 2011 to 2013 years of assessment, is in progress.
  
                      The group considered these matters in consultation with specialist external tax and legal advisers and disagrees 
                      with SARS’ audit findings and believes that all the above matters have been appropriately treated in the results 
                      for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

                      Rates and taxes levied by the Municipality at Sishen effective from 1 June 2014 reflected a significant increase 
                      amounting to R575 million (June 2015: R278 million and December 2015: R437 million). Management objected to the 
                      higher valuation and exhausted all appeals to the Municipality. The matter will now be referred to the Valuations 
                      Appeal Board for a final decision. Management is of the view that the municipal valuation is fundamentally flawed 
                      and acknowledges its obligation for rates and taxes based on a reasonable valuation.    

   14.      Guarantees                                                  
            The total guarantees issued in favour of the DMR in respect of the group’s environmental closure liabilities at 30 June 2016 
            are R2.8 billion (June 2015: R2.3 billion and 31 December 2015: R2.3 billion). Included in this amount are financial 
            guarantees for the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of the group to the DMR in respect of 
            Thabazimbi mine of R438 million (June 2015: R429 million and 31 December 2015: R438 million), which ArcelorMittal SA has 
            guaranteed by means of bank guarantees issued in favour of SIOC. As a consequence of the revision of closure costs, a shortfall 
            of R633 million arose (of which R329 million relates to ArcelorMittal SA). SIOC is in discussions with ArcelorMittal SA 
            regarding the shortfall.

            In 2015, SIOC received notice from the DMR that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the amendment of 
            SIOC’s mining right in respect of the Sishen mine, by the inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining 
            right for the Sishen mine, subject to certain conditions (which are described by the DMR as “proposals”). The conditions 
            were not capable of being accepted by SIOC as SIOC believes the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) 
            does not provide for the imposition of such conditions, they are not practically implementable and lack sufficient 
            detail to provide the company with legal certainty.

            SIOC submitted an internal appeal in terms of section 96 of the MPRDA to the Minister of Mineral Resources, which set out 
            the basis of its objections to the proposals. SIOC has not yet received a response and will continue to engage with the 
            DMR in this regard.

In order to position the company to withstand the significant decrease in iron ore prices,
Kumba revised the Sishen mine plan and reconfigured the pit to a lower cost shell.

Sishen’s operations were impacted by the implementation of the revised mine plan, which
effectively halved mining volumes, and resulted in a ~31% reduction in the number of
permanent employees and contractors. As a result, production for the quarter decreased by
21% to 5.7 Mt (2015: 7.2 Mt) and waste mined by 47% to 31 Mt.

Run rates were affected by the significant restructuring process, which began in the first
quarter, and which has now been substantially completed. Run rates were also affected by
higher than normal levels of rainfall and safety incidences including a fatal incident in May
which resulted in the issuing of a Section 54 notice.

The successful restructuring increased mine flexibility and run rates on key operating
parameters showed a marked improvement during June 2016. Total tonnes handled and ex-
pit ore increased by 28% and 38% respectively from May 2016 to June 2016, in support of
the guided production level of 27 Mt for the full year.

Kolomela produced 3.2 Mt for the quarter, a 10% increase (2015: 2.9 Mt). Waste mining
decreased to 12.5 Mt from 13.2 Mt in 2015, in line with the optimisation of the mine. Plant
efficiencies and throughput continue to improve in line with the mine’s full year production
target of 12 Mt, as guided for 2016.

Processing activities at Thabazimbi ended on 31 March 2016, following the ceasing of mining
activities on 30 September 2015. Mine closure processes are going according to plan.

Total sales decreased by 26% to 9.7 Mt (2015: 13.0 Mt) and more than total production of 8.9
Mt, as stocks were further reduced to a level of 2.3 Mt (2015: 3.9 Mt).

Logistics volumes for the quarter were impacted by low stock levels through the logistics
chain as a result of lower production. At the mines, finished product stock reduced to 1.1 Mt
and port stockpiles to 1.2 Mt, while total finished product stock decreased to 2.3 Mt by 30
June 2016 (2015: 3.9 Mt).

2016

Kumba Iron Ore Limited (“Kumba”) today released its production and sales report for the
quarter ended 31 March 2016. Throughout this report, production and sales volumes referred

shareholders of Kumba as well as the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Total production from Kumba decreased to 8.9 Mt as Sishen transitioned to a lower cost
   pit configuration. This is 27% less than Q1 2015 and 18% lower compared to Q4 2015.
- Total export sales volumes decreased by 18% compared to Q1 2015 and by 11%

Sishen mine produced 5.8 Mt, a decrease of 34% compared to Q1 2015 and 24% lower than
Q4 2015. Waste removal was lower at 33.9 Mt versus 49.3 Mt in Q1 2015. The reduction in
production and waste volumes was in line with the mine’s lower cost pit configuration.

Sishen continues to experience feedstock constraints which have been exacerbated by
higher levels of rainfall experienced during the quarter. Solutions are being implemented to
increase mine flexibility. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged at ~27 Mt of
production. As previously indicated, detailed work to refine the Sishen life of mine plan based
on the revised pit configuration is ongoing and will be finalised during 2016.

The Section 189 process is on track with consultations on the organisational structures
completed. The material changes, due to the revised pit configuration and related
restructuring require significant management focus to ensure that productivity continues to
improve and safety is maintained.

Kolomela produced 2.7 Mt for the quarter, a decrease of 9% on Q1 2015 and 5% on Q4
2015, due to a section 54 stoppage as a result of a fatality that occurred on-mine in January
2016. Run rates have improved subsequently and the mine remains on track to produce 12
Mt.

Export sales of 9.4 Mt decreased by 18% relative to Q1 2015 and 11% to Q4 2015, due to
lower production. Total finished product stocks were 3.2 Mt, compared to 4.7 Mt at the end of
2015 as stocks were drawn-down to more optimal levels. Export sales guidance remains at
~40 Mt for 2016.

Domestic sales volumes decreased by 19% relative to Q1 2015 and doubled compared to
Q4 2015 to 1.2 Mt, based on customer requirements.

At Thabazimbi, mining activities ceased on 30 September 2015 and processing activities
ceased on 31 March 2016. Closure of the mine is proceeding according to plan.

Kumba to vigorously defend SARS tax assessment

Kumba announces the receipt by its 73.9% owned subsidiary, Sishen Iron Ore Company
(""SIOC"") of a tax assessment from the South African Revenue Service (""SARS"") in relation
to the tax years 2006 to 2010, for the amount of ZAR5.5 billion (US$345 million). This
amount includes ZAR3.7 billion (US$230 million) in interest and penalties.

SIOC has cooperated fully with SARS during the course of the audit, but, supported by its
specialist tax and legal advisors, disagrees with SARS' audit findings. SIOC is therefore in
the process of preparing an objection to the assessment, together with an application to the
Commissioner of SARS for a suspension of payment until the matter is resolved.

Norman Mbazima, CEO of the Company, said: ""As a responsible corporate citizen, Kumba
and its subsidiaries believe that all taxes owed under South African tax legislation have been
paid and that we comply with all applicable tax laws in all jurisdictions in which we operate.""

""Kumba generates substantial value for all its stakeholders and is fully committed to the
transformation of the South African mining industry and to the wider societal and economic
benefits that we bring; for example in 2015 alone, a year during which the iron ore price fell
sharply, our business contributed R900 million in corporate taxes and mineral
royalties, R4.7 billion in salaries and wages, R15.2 billion in local procurement, R6.8 billion
of capital reinvested in the business and R174 million in social investment in health, housing,
education and small business development.""

Kumba’s contribution to South Africa

Kumba is a responsible corporate citizen and a major contributor to the South African
economy and the communities around its operations. For example, Kumba has paid R30
billion in taxes and royalties over the last five years and an additional R4.4 billion when you
include taxes that we generate (payroll taxes).

KUMBA IRON ORE LIMITED 
AUDITED PRELIMINARY SUMMARISED ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

Kumba Iron Ore Limited (‘Kumba’ or ‘The Group’) announces its results for the year 
ended 31 December 2015

POSITIONING KUMBA FOR THE FUTURE

Norman Mbazima, chief executive of Kumba notes, “The sharp decline and volatility 
in the iron ore price over the past year, has been a significant factor for Kumba 
and the mining industry in general. We have responded decisively to position our 
business to withstand a longer period of lower iron ore prices. A shift in strategy 
from a volume to a value based strategy led to a reconfiguration of our mines to 
reduce the amount of waste and to save costs. Sishen’s pit was restructured to a 
lower cost shell, production at Kolomela was increased by ramping up low cost 
tonnes and optimising the waste profile, and mining at Thabazimbi was stopped.

In addition, strict capital discipline and significant structural changes to cost 
was achieved through savings on capital expenditure, overheads, study costs and 
headcount reduction. These measures are part of a key objective – to preserve 
cash, reduce debt and ultimately position our business to grow sustainable free 
cash flow and shareholder returns over the long term.”

KEY FEATURES

-  No loss of life in 2015
-  42% drop in average iron ore price to US$56/t severely impacted earnings
-  Total production decreased by 7% to 44.9 Mt 
-  Reorganisation and capital management delivered reduction of R4 billion in 
   controllable cost
-  HEPS 66% lower at R11.82 per share, R6 billion impairment
-  Net debt reduced by 42% to R4.6 billion

Kumba’s full year results reflected the challenging market conditions, with the 
realised FOB iron ore price declining 42% to $53/t largely resulting in a 66% 
decrease in headline earnings to R11.82 per share (2014: R34.32). Basic earnings 
per share were R1.46 (2014: R33.44) due to a significant impairment charge of 
R6 billion relating to Sishen mine as a consequence of the low price environment 
and actions taken to restructure the business. 

Total production declined 7% to 44.9 Mt due to operational challenges at Sishen 
mine.  Kolomela continued to perform well, and record export sales of 43.5 Mt were 
achieved by the company. 

Stringent cost management delivered a R4 billion reduction in controllable costs, 
while capital conservation measures and the suspension of the dividend helped to 
improve the Group’s net debt position to R4.6 billion, down 42%. The Group achieved 
an average cash breakeven price of $49/t for the year as lower realised lump 
premiums and reduced production partially offset cost savings. Towards the end of 
2015 Kumba was operating at a cash breakeven price of $41/t, well below the target 
of $45/t, aided by the weaker local currency and lower freight rates.

SAFETY 
Safety is a key priority for the Group and it is notable that no loss of life was 
reported for the 2015 year. 

It is with deep regret and sadness that we report the death of one of our 
colleagues, Graham Skansi, a drill operator, in an incident at Kolomela mine on 
27 January 2016.

The Group remains committed to zero harm and will continue to put greater emphasis 
on measures that prevent injuries and the loss of life.

Effective critical control monitoring triggered lifesaving responses to ensure that 
no one was harmed during the significant slope failure at Thabazimbi in June 2015. 
The total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR), a measure of frequency of 
injuries, was 0.89 (2014: 0.87) and the lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 
remained at 0.23, although less injuries were recorded together with reduced 
severity.

The Group continues to focus on key safety improvement drivers, with the emphasis 
on re-enforcing the awareness of critical controls and greater operational 
discipline. 

ACTIONS TAKEN DURING THE YEAR
During the year the Group took significant steps to protect its balance sheet by 
preserving capital and reducing costs.  A key area of focus was moving from a 
volume to a value based strategy by reconfiguring the mines to reduce the amount of 
waste mined and to save costs in all operational areas.   

As a consequence, the Sishen pit was restructured to a lower cost shell, Kolomela 
increased production incrementally by ramping up low cost tonnes and the waste 
profile was optimised. Mining at Thabazimbi ceased in September 2015 and the mine 
remains on track to cease all operations by Q2 2016.

Despite growth in mining volumes and lower production at Sishen, on-mine cash 
costs reduced by R1.1 billion in 2015.

A second priority was assessing every item of proposed capital expenditure with a 
view to cancelling, reducing the cost or delaying the expenditure. For the year, 
capex was reduced by 20% to R6.8 billion (including deferred stripping).   

Thirdly, the company focused on savings on overheads, study costs and headcount 
rationalisation, delivering savings of R0.9 billion.  

On 28 January 2016, the company commenced a consultation process in terms of 
section 189 of the Labour Relations Act at Sishen. The restructuring of the mine 
will impact approximately 2,633 Kumba employees. Contractors at the mine have 
commenced with their restructuring process and approximately 1,300 contractors will 
be affected. Extensive consultations are being conducted with all stakeholders.

In line with the Group’s cash preservation strategy, the board has decided to 
maintain its suspension of the dividend.  

CONTINGENT LIABILITY
As at 30 June 2015, the Group advised that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) 
were in the process of reviewing certain of the Group’s tax matters. After the half 
year SARS issued the Group with a letter of findings relating to its tax audit 
covering the period 2006 to 2010, indicating potential adjustments to the Group’s 
taxable income for the period of R6.5 billion which would, if the company is 
finally assessed on this basis, result in additional tax of approximately 
R1.8 billion, excluding any potential interest and penalties. As at 31 December 
2015 the Group had responded to the letter of findings, strongly objecting to the 
basis for the proposed adjustments, including representations on why interest and 
penalties, if any, should not be raised. The Group is awaiting SARS’s response. 
These matters have been considered in consultation with external tax and legal 
advisors, who support the Group’s position set out in its objection. Furthermore, 
during 2015 SARS notified the Group of its intention to conduct a field audit 
covering the 2011 to 2013 years of assessment, which is in progress. The Group 
believes that these matters have been appropriately treated in the results for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. 

REGULATORY UPDATE
Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Limited (SIOC) received notice from the Department of 
Mineral Resources (DMR) that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the 
amendment of SIOC’s existing mining right in respect of the Sishen mine, by the 
inclusion of the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen 
mine, subject to certain conditions (which are described by the DMR as 
“proposals”). The conditions contained in the Letter of Grant relate substantively 
to domestic supply, support for skills development, research & development, and 
procurement.

SIOC believes that the Mineral & Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) does 
not provide for the imposition of such conditions as contained in the consent 
letter. 

Section 96 of the MPRDA allows for an internal appeal to the Minister of Mineral 
Resources. SIOC therefore submitted an internal appeal to the Minister, setting out 
the basis of its objections to the proposals, as required by the MPRDA. SIOC has 
not yet received a response to its appeal.

In the interim, SIOC continues to engage with the DMR in relation to the proposed 
conditions in order to achieve a mutually acceptable solution. Refer to note 16 in 
the summarised consolidated financial statements.

MARKET OVERVIEW
While supply growth has slowed somewhat, there is an ever more cautious outlook on 
China’s economic growth trajectory. China’s slowdown in investment expenditure has 
weighed particularly on prices for metals and minerals. As a result, 2015 marked a 
year of much weaker demand growth. Iron ore fundamentals deteriorated on the back 
of declining global demand and growth in low-cost supply, particularly from 
Australia.

Global crude steel production contracted 3%, with increased competition in export 
markets.  Chinese growth slowed despite record steel exports while Japan, Korea and 
Taiwan moderated on weak domestic demand and increased competition, particularly 
from Chinese exports, in seaborne steel markets.  Rising imports and capacity 
closures impacted European crude steel output.  

Global seaborne iron ore supply rose 3% in 2015 led by an increase of 7% in 
Australian exports with major infrastructure and capacity projects now reaching 
execution. The ramp-up of Minas-Rio and rising shipments to Malaysia supported an 
8% increase in Brazilian exports.  

The index iron ore price (CFR China 62% Fe) at the beginning of the financial year 
was US$71.75 per tonne, falling to a low of US$38.50 per tonne in December 2015, 
due to the strong growth in supply and slower crude steel production growth in 
China.

Sishen mine
Sishen production of 31.4 Mt decreased 12% (2014: 35.5 Mt), with total tonnes mined 
rising to 261.4 Mt (2014: 229.9 Mt). The decline in production was mainly due to 
difficulties in providing the DMS plant with the correct quality feedstock because 
of a shortage of sufficient exposed high grade ore required for blending. In order 
to improve exposed ore levels and increase operational flexibility, it was 
necessary to mine more waste material, which increased by 19% to 222.2 Mt (2014: 
187.2 Mt). 

During the year the deteriorating price environment necessitated a further 
optimisation of the Sishen mine plan. It was decided to reconfigure the Sishen pit 
to a lower cost shell to safeguard the mine’s viability at lower prices.  

Waste movement is expected to be materially below previous guidance of ~230 Mt at 
~135 Mt and production guidance for 2016 is reduced from 36 Mt to ~27 Mt, with an 
average stripping ratio of 3.5 over the period 2016 to 2020. In the medium term, 
the mine will also be exploring further opportunities to utilise spare plant 
capacity, including the use of low grade stockpiles. It is expected that the life 
of mine will remain stable at ~15 years due to the lower production rates. This 
will be reviewed and finalised during 2016 in accordance with SAMREC code 
requirements.

This mining profile will require detailed planning and effective implementation of 
the Operating Model will be crucial. The mine has already seen a 24% improvement in 
efficiency in internal waste mining activity of the North Mine, where work 
management aspects of the Operating Model were introduced in August 2014. The 
Operating Model was implemented at pre-strip mining and heavy equipment activities 
at Sishen in July 2015 and is working well.  

Kolomela mine
Kolomela mine continued to perform well.  

Production of 12.1 Mt (2014: 11.6 Mt) increased 4%, as efficiencies and throughput 
in the plant continued to improve. Total tonnes mined were 14% lower at 60.6 Mt 
(2014: 70.4 Mt), including 45.7 Mt of waste (2014: 55.5 Mt), a decrease of 18%.  

During the year a new mine plan was implemented which included the ramping up of 
production to 13 Mtpa by 2017, and the cessation of mining at the third pit which 
was deferred to 2019. In order to maintain plant feed rates, waste mining was 
revised upwards from previously guided 35 Mt – 38 Mt to 46 Mt – 48 Mt. 

Despite the increased rate of production the life of mine has been extended to 
21 years (excluding inferred material) due to the conversion of the Kapstevel South 
mineral resource to ore reserves. The average LOM stripping ratio has increased 
from 3.3 to 3.9 with the stripping ratio in the medium term remaining at ~3.6.

Thabazimbi mine
Mining at Thabazimbi ceased in September 2015. Material mined previously was 
processed during the last quarter of the year and this will continue until the 
second quarter of 2016. Closure procedures are in progress and all activity at the 
mine is expected to cease at the end of 1H16.  

Logistics
Transnet’s good performance enabled the mines to rail 42.4 Mt to the port, a slight 
increase of 0.2Mt (2014: 42.2 Mt). This included 0.8 Mt purchased from third party 
producers. Kumba shipped 43.5 Mt from the Saldanha port for the export market, 
8% more than the 40.1 Mt in 2014.

Sales
Total sales for Kumba were 6% higher at 47.8 Mt (2014: 45.3 Mt). Export sales 
increased by 8% underpinned by the availability of stock and increased shipments 
through the multi-purpose terminal (MPT) at Saldanha port of 3.4 Mt (2014: 0.7 Mt). 
China accounted for 63% (2014: 57%) of Kumba’s export sales portfolio and of this 
CFR sales accounted for 69%. The Group’s lump:fine ratio was 65:35 for the period 
(2014: 67:33), with lump products achieving an average premium of $6/t (2014: 
$14/t) as the shift in the focus of Chinese steel mills from productivity to cost 
led to reduced price differentials across iron ore grades.  

Domestic sales to ArcelorMittal SA amounted to 4.3 Mt. The two companies have 
reached  agreement to amend the supply contract from that of cost-based to price 
based on an export parity price. 

As a result of the higher sales and lower production, finished product stock 
reduced from the 6.5 Mt at the end of 2014 to 4.7 Mt at 31 December 2015.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

Revenue
The Group’s total revenue of R36.1 billion for the period decreased 24% from 
R47.6 billion in 2014, mainly as a result of the significant drop in average 
realised FOB iron ore prices (2015: US$53/tonne; 2014: US$91/tonne) offset to an 
extent by the weaker average ZAR/US$ exchange rate (2015: R12.76; 2014: R10.83), as 
well as 6% higher total sales volumes of 47.8 Mt. Capesize freight rates from 
Saldanha to China averaged $8/tonne for the year, down 45%, resulting in 
R482 million lower freight revenue.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses, excluding impairments, were 2% lower as a result of the 
stringent cash preservation measures implemented. Inflationary linked input cost 
pressure, higher non- cash cost items (depreciation and rehabilitation) and 
increased distribution costs from MPT throughput pushed operating expenses higher. 
This was offset by labour and overhead cost savings, lower fuel prices and freight 
rates, lower mineral royalties on the back of reduced profitability, and higher 
capitalisation of deferred stripping costs. 

The reconfiguration of the Sishen pit to a lower cost shell together with the 
significant impact of the weaker iron ore price outlook, has resulted in an 
impairment charge relating to Sishen mine of R6 billion (pre-tax).

Unit cash costs at Sishen mine were R311/tonne, 14% higher than the R272/tonne of 
2014, mainly driven by the 19% increase in waste mined. Lower production volumes 
added R36/tonne. Input cost pressures (R10/tonne), higher mining volumes 
(R23/tonne) and buffer stock utilisation (R23/tonne) were partially offset by 
overhead cost savings (R11/tonne) and deferred stripping (R42/tonne). Cost 
escalation was contained below inflation principally as a result of lower fuel 
prices. Going forward, the revised mining plan is expected to benefit unit cost 
through the reduction in mining volumes. Further benefits are expected from the 
reduction in oil prices, increasing productivity and the benefits of the Operating 
Model.

Kolomela mine incurred unit cash costs of R178/tonne (2014: R208/tonne), a 14% 
decrease. 

Lower mining volumes (R30/tonne) and higher production (R7/tonne) were the main 
contributors. Cost escalation was contained well below inflation at 3% (R7/tonne) 
mainly as a result of lower diesel prices and cost of blasting material. This was 
partially offset by higher mining contractor rates as a result of increased 
travelling distances. 

Operating profit
Operating profit of R8.6 billion (excluding the impairment) decreased by 56% 
(2014: R19.6 billion). Kumba’s operating profit margin decreased to 24% (2014: 
41%), 27% from mining activities (2014: 45%). The fall in iron ore prices outlined 
previously impacted profitability.

Cash flow
The Group’s cash generated from operations was down 36% from R21.8 billion in 2014 
to R13.8 billion. The cash was used to pay the 2014 final dividend of R3.3 billion 
(2014: R15.2 billion) and income tax of R0.6 billion (2014: R4.2 billion). At 
31 December 2015 the Group had a net debt position of R4.6 billion (2014: 
R7.9 billion). The Group’s working capital position remains healthy, although 
impacted by a decrease of R2.2 billion in trade and other receivables on the back 
of lower realised prices. 

Capital expenditure of R6.8 billion was incurred. Expansion capex of R0.9 billion 
focused on the Dingleton relocation project and R3 billion on stay-in-business 
(SIB) activities (including heavy mining equipment and infrastructure) and 
R2.9 billion deferred stripping. In light of the current pricing environment, the 
Group has reduced capital expenditure guidance (excluding deferred stripping) for 
2016 to 2018 from what was previously guided, and optimised our project portfolio 
resulting in the deferral of some of the capital spend to later years. For the 
Dingleton project the Group anticipates total spend of R2.7 billion versus the 
R4.2 billion as previously guided. As a result, the Group expects capital 
expenditure (excluding deferred stripping) for 2016 to be in the range of 
R2.4 billion to R2.6 billion, for 2017 to be between R2.9 billion and R3.1 billion, 
and 2018 to be between R3.5 billion and R3.7 billion (excluding unapproved 
projects).
 
Deferred stripping capital expenditure per mine estimates are shown in the table 
below. The decrease expected at Sishen mine is mainly as a result of higher 
stripping ratios excluded from the new pit design in certain areas of the pit.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

The following changes are reported to the ore reserves and mineral resources as 
disclosed in the 2014 Kumba Integrated Report.

As of 31 December 2015, Kumba, from a 100% ownership reporting perspective, had 
access to ore reserves of 885.6 Mt (at 60.0% Fe) at its three mining operations 
(Sishen, Kolomela and Thabazimbi), a year-on-year decrease of 3%. The Thabazimbi 
ore reserve has been materially reduced by 9 Mt (93%) to 0.7 Mt due to the 
reclassification of ore reserves to mineral resources as a result of the mine 
closure. The remaining mineral resource of 8.4 Mt will be reclassified to mineral 
inventory once mine closure has been finalised.

Kumba’s estimated mineral resources, in addition to its ore reserves at these three 
operations and the Zandrivierspoort magnetite project, totalled 1.2 billion tonnes 
(at 50.4% Fe), a year-on-year decrease of 8%.

The net decrease of 3% in Kumba’s ore reserves in 2015 is primarily attributable to 
annual run-of-mine production of 47.8 Mt. The overall decrease in mineral resources 
of 8% was mainly due to the conversion of a portion of the Kapstevel South mineral 
resource at Kolomela to ore reserves. As a result the Kolomela reserve life has 
increased by two years to 21 years at the end of 2015 (including inferred 
material), despite the planned increase in annual production to 13 Mt from 2017.

It is expected that the 2016 Kumba ore reserves and mineral resources may decrease 
materially from those stated in 2015, pending the update of the long-term forward 
looking iron ore price and the reconfiguration of Sishen mine to a lower cost pit 
shell. Early indications are that the Sishen mine ore reserves will decrease by an 
estimated 23% (±150 Mt) but that the reserve life will remain stable at ~15 years 
due to the lower production rates. These figures are preliminary in nature and 
exclude 2016 depletion and other movements that may realise due to annual 
geological model updates and revised long-term economic parameter forecasts. A 
complete life-of-mine (LOM) will be finalised in 2016 for both operations to 
determine the impact on resources and reserves in accordance with SAMREC Code 
requirements.

OUTLOOK

Rapidly changing market and economic fundamentals have resulted in the iron ore 
price falling faster and deeper than expected. The period ahead is likely to result 
in formidable changes for the industry with the market now pricing in a more muted 
trend for the iron ore price. As such the group does not expect a significant 
recovery in the iron ore price over the medium term. These circumstances have 
reinforced the need to make tough decisions for the business and to take necessary 
action to safeguard the viability of the operations.

Whilst significant progress has been made to protect the balance sheet, the Group 
is undertaking further actions to conserve cash in order to ensure that Kumba is 
robust enough to withstand a longer period of low prices. Further savings are 
anticipated to deliver ~$10/t reduction in controllable costs for 2016, largely 
from on-mine cash cost reductions through the implementation of the new mine plan 
for Sishen and ongoing cost initiatives including headcount rationalisation and 
salary freezes for senior and mid management. Further study cost optimisation is 
expected with continued focus on SIB capital reductions from curtailment of fleet 
procurement and other mine projects. The ongoing benefits from the continued 
implementation of the Operating Model is setting the mines up well for the 
execution of the revised plans. 

As a result, Kumba’s cash breakeven price is anticipated to reduce to below 
$40/t in 2016, however the Group expects further volatility in freight and exchange 
rates. At current spot indicators, though, the Group’s balance sheet should 
continue to deleverage.

Production at Sishen is expected to be ~27 Mt in 2016-2020. Waste volumes are 
targeted at ~135-150 Mt in 2016-2020. In the medium term, the mine will continue to 
explore opportunities to fill any spare plant capacity through the use of low grade 
stockpiles.

Kolomela will produce 12 Mt in 2016 increasing to 13 Mtpa by 2017. Waste mining is 
forecast to be 46-48 Mt in 2016-2020.

Export sales are expected to be ~40 Mt in 2016 and domestic sales contracted to 
ArcelorMittal SA are 6.25 Mt.

Profitability remains sensitive to iron ore export prices and the Rand/US$ exchange 
rate. Any reference to future financial performance included in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s auditors.

The presentation in support of the company’s results for the year ended 31 December 
2015 will be available on the company’s website www.angloamericankumba.com at 
07h30 CAT and the webcast will be available from 11h30 CAT on 9 February 2016.

The calculation of basic and diluted 
normalised earnings per share is based on 
the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue as follows:
  Weighted average number of ordinary shares        320 817 364        320 662 676

This measure of earnings is specific to Kumba and is not required in terms of 
International Financial Reporting Standards or the JSE Listings Requirements. 
Normalised earnings represents earnings from the recurring activities of the group.  

This is determined by adjusting the headline earnings attributable to the owners of 
Kumba for non-recurring expense or income items incurred during the year. The 
derecognition of the deferred tax asset and a once-off gain realised on a lease 
receivable are non-recurring items and has therefore been adjusted in determining 
normalised earnings.

NOTES TO THE AUDITED SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.  Corporate information
Kumba is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in South Africa. 
The main business of Kumba, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is the 
exploration, extraction, beneficiation, marketing, sale and shipping of iron ore. 
The group is listed on the JSE Limited (JSE).

The audited summarised consolidated financial statements of Kumba and its 
subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the directors on 5 February 2016.

2.  Basis of preparation 
The audited summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared, under 
the supervision of FT Kotzee CA(SA), chief financial officer, in accordance with 
the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, 
and the requirements of the South African Companies Act No 71 of 2008 applicable to 
summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports 
to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and 
recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by 
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. 

The audited summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the historical cost convention except for certain financial 
instruments, share-based payments and biological assets which are stated at fair 
value, and is presented in Rand, which is Kumba’s functional and presentation 
currency.

3.  Accounting policies 
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements from which the summary consolidated financial statements were derived 
are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with 
those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated 
annual financial statements, except as disclosed below.

3.1  New standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations
     None of the standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations 
     which became effective for the year commencing on 1 January 2015 had an impact 
     on the group.

3.2  New standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are 
     not yet effective and have not been early adopted
     In 2015 the group did not early adopt any new, revised or amended accounting 
     standards or interpretations. The accounting standards, amendments to issued 
     accounting standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the group but 
     not yet effective at 31 December 2015, are being evaluated for the impact of 
     these pronouncements.

3.3  Comparatives
     Comparative figures are restated in the event of a change in accounting policy 
     or reclassification of line items in the balance sheet. The inventory balance 
     was reclassified in the current year, please refer to note 6 for more 
     information.

4.  Change in estimates
The measurement of the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning provisions 
are a key area where management's judgement is required. The closure provisions are 
measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows required to perform 
the rehabilitation and decommissioning. This calculation requires the use of 
certain estimates and assumptions when determining the amount and timing of the 
future cash flows and the discount rate. The closure provisions are updated at each 
balance sheet date for changes in these estimates. 

The LOM plan on which accounting estimates are based only includes proved and 
probable ore reserves as disclosed in Kumba’s annual ore reserves and mineral 
resources statement. Sishen’s rehabilitation provision increased by R305 million 
and Kolomela’s by R23 million in 2015. This increase relates to changes in the LOM 
at Sishen and Kolomela, normal inflationary adjustments as well as the 
incorporation of waste dump and infrastructure growth. Thabazimbi’s rehabilitation 
provision increased by R288 million in 2015. R114 million relates to a reduction in 
the LOM from 2023 to 2016 as a result of the closure decision. 

The effect of the change in estimate, which was applied prospectively from 
1 January 2015, is detailed below:
                                                                           Audited

earnings per share.

Expansion capital expenditure comprises mainly of the Dingleton Project, which 
would enable Sishen mine to extract ore resources between the mine and the town, 
made good progress in 2015. SIB capital expenditure to maintain operations was 
principally for the replacement and rebuild of the mining fleet, expansion of 
diesel storage capacity, mine dewatering and regulatory and standard compliance 
related projects.

As a result of the revision of the group's mine plans, the group reassessed the 
nature of its work-in-progress inventories. Previously all work-in-progress 
inventory balances were classified as current. After the reassessment, it was 
concluded that not all work-in-progress inventory will be processed within the next 
year.  Work-in-progress inventory balances which will not be processed within the 
next year are reclassified to non-current. This reassessment was applied 
retrospectively and as a result, comparative figures were reclassified.

1 This impairment charge relates to Sishen mine.  The impairment charge in 2014 
  relates to Thabazimbi mine’s deferred stripping asset. 

10.  Impairment of assets
Kumba produces iron ore at Sishen and Kolomela mines in the Northern Cape Province. 
The two mines are treated as separate cash-generating units (CGU’s). Each CGU 
consists of its respective mining assets located in the Northern Cape. Given the 
low iron ore price environment, as well as supply and demand pressure, an 
impairment test was performed. This was based on the fair value less costs of 
disposal of the CGU.  The carrying value of Kolomela is recoverable and therefore 
no impairment charge was recorded. The valuation of Sishen at 31 December 2015, 
determined on a discounted cash flow (DCF) basis, is R20.5 billion. Consequently 
an impairment charge of R6 billion (before tax) was recorded against the carrying 
value of Sishen with an associated deferred tax credit of R1.7 billion. The post-
tax impairment charge is R4.3 billion.  

The valuation is sensitive to the iron ore price and further deterioration in long-
term prices may result in additional impairment. The DCF model is most sensitive to 
forecasted iron ore prices and the ZAR/USD exchange rate. The table below sets out 
the impact of an increase or decrease of 5% in the forecasted iron ore price and 
ZAR/USD exchange rate assumptions on operating profit or loss.

1)  After impairment charge

The total reported segment revenue is measured in a manner consistent with that 
disclosed in the income statement. 

The performance of the operating segments are assessed based on a measure of 
earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT), which is measured in a manner 
consistent with ’Operating profit’ in the financial statements. Finance income and 
finance costs are not allocated to segments, as treasury activity is managed on a 
central group basis. 

Total segment assets comprise finished goods inventory only, which is allocated 
based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the assets. 

’Other segments’ comprise corporate, administration and other expenditure not 
allocated to the reported segments.

12.  Fair value estimation
The carrying value of financial instruments not carried at fair value approximates 
fair value because of the short period to maturity or as a result of market related 
variable interest rates.  Investments held by the environmental trust amounting to 
R818 million (2014: R791 million) are carried at fair value. The fair value 
measurements are classified as level 1.

During the period, Kumba, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various 
sale, purchase and service transactions with associates, joint ventures, fellow 
subsidiaries, its holding company and Exxaro Resources Limited. These transactions 
were subject to terms that are no less favourable than those offered by third 
parties.

14.  Contingent liability 
a)  As at 30 June 2015, the group advised that the South African Revenue Service 
   (SARS) were in the process of reviewing certain of the group’s tax matters. 
    After the half year SARS issued the group with a letter of findings relating to 
    its tax audit covering the period 2006 to 2010, indicating potential 
    adjustments to the group’s taxable income for the period of R6.5 billion which 
    would, if the company is finally assessed on this basis, result in additional 
    tax of approximately R1.8 billion, excluding any potential interest and 
    penalties. As at 31 December 2015 the group had responded to the letter of 
    findings, strongly objecting to the basis for the proposed adjustments, 
    including representations on why interest and penalties, if any, should not be 
    raised. The group is awaiting SARS’s response. These matters have been 
    considered in consultation with external tax and legal advisors, who support 
    the group’s position set out in its objection. Furthermore, during 2015 SARS 
    notified the group of its intention to conduct a field audit covering the 2011 
    to 2013 years of assessment, which is in progress. The group believes that 
    these matters have been appropriately treated in the results for the year ended 
    31 December 2015.

b)  Rates and taxes levied by the Municipality at Sishen effective from 1 June 2014 
    reflected a significant increase amounting to R437 million. Management objected 
    to the higher valuation of the relevant land and the Municipality appointed a 
    valuator who is reviewing the objections lodged. Management is of the view that 
    the municipal valuation is fundamentally flawed and acknowledges its obligation 
    for rates and taxes based on a reasonable valuation.

15.  Guarantees
The group has issued financial guarantees in favour of the DMR in respect of its 
environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations to the value of 
R2.3 billion (2014: R2.3 billion). Included in this amount are financial guarantees 
for the environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations of the group 
in respect of Thabazimbi mine of R438 million (2014: R438 million). ArcelorMittal 
S.A. has guaranteed R429 million of this amount by means of bank guarantees issued 
in favour of SIOC. As a result of the annual revision of closure costs a further 
shortfall of R861 million arose (of which R318 million relates to 
ArcelorMittal SA). Guarantees for the shortfall will be issued in due course.

16.  Regulatory update
21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights

In December 2013 the Constitutional Court ruled that SIOC held a 78.6% undivided 
share of the Sishen mining right and that, based on the provisions of the MPRDA, 
only SIOC can apply for, and be granted, the residual 21.4% share of the mining 
right at the Sishen mine. The grant of the mining right may be made subject to such 
conditions considered by the Minister to be appropriate. SIOC applied for the 
residual right early in 2014. 

SIOC received notice from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) that the 
Director General of the DMR had consented to the amendment of SIOC’s existing 
mining right in respect of the Sishen Mine, by the inclusion of the residual 
21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine, subject to certain 
conditions (which are described by the DMR as “proposals”). The conditions 
contained in the Letter of Grant relate substantively to domestic supply, support 
for skills development, research & development, and procurement.

SIOC believes that the MPRDA does not provide for the imposition of such conditions 
as contained in the consent letter, and further that certain of the conditions, 
described as “proposals”, are not practically implementable and lack sufficient 
detail to provide the company with legal certainty as to the requirements for 
compliance. SIOC therefore believes that the proposals are incapable of being 
unilaterally complied with. The most significant of these proposals include the 
reversion to the lapsed 2001 cost based supply agreement with ArcelorMittal SA, as 
well as the establishment of a supplier park to provide the mining industry with a 
significant portion of its capital goods in support of local procurement.

Until the legal and practical implications of the proposed conditions have been 
clarified with the DMR, SIOC is unable to accept the conditions. 

Section 96 of the MPRDA allows for an internal appeal to the Minister of Mineral 
Resources. SIOC therefore submitted an internal appeal to the Minister, setting out 
the basis of its objections to the proposals, as required by the MPRDA. SIOC has 
not yet received a response to its appeal.

In the interim, SIOC continues to engage with the DMR in relation to the proposed 
conditions in order to achieve a mutually acceptable solution.

17.  Corporate governance
The group subscribes to the Code of Good Corporate Practices and Conduct and 
complies with the recommendations of the King III Report. Full disclosure of the 
group’s compliance will be contained in the 2015 Integrated Report.

18.  Events after the reporting period
On 28 January 2016 SIOC commenced with a consultation process in terms of section 
189 of the Labour Relations Act at its Sishen mine in the Northern Cape. SIOC’s 
decision to commence a section 189 process follows the reconfiguration of the 
Sishen pit to a lower cost shell due to the continued low iron ore price 
environment. 

The new configuration reduced the waste and production profiles of the mine to 
~135 Mt and ~27 Mt respectively. The reduction in planned mining and production 
activities resulted in a re-evaluation of the on-mine equipment and the workforce 
required to support this reduced profile. Subject to consultation, it is currently 
estimated that c. 2,633 employees and 1,300 contractors may be affected. 

The group is in the process of determining the impact of this decision on the Ore 
Reserves and Mineral Resources as declared in the 2014 Kumba Integrated Report. 
Early indications are that the Sishen Mine ore reserves will decrease by an 
estimated 23% (±150 Mt) without reducing the life of the mine. These figures are 
preliminary in nature and exclude 2016 depletion and other movements that may 
realise due to annual geological model updates and revised long-term economic 
parameter forecasts. A complete life-of-mine will be finalised in 2016 for both 
operations to determine the impact on resources and reserves in accordance with 
SAMREC Code requirements. 

No further material events have occurred between the end of the reporting period 
and the date of the release of these audited summarised consolidated financial 
statements, not otherwise dealt with in this report.

19.  Independent auditors’ report
These summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2015 have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified opinion 
thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified opinion on the annual financial 
statements from which these summarised consolidated financial statements were 
derived.

A copy of the auditor’s report on the annual consolidated financial statements is 
available for inspection at the company’s registered office, together with the 
financial statements identified in the respective auditor’s reports.

Any reference to future financial performance included in this announcement has not 
been reviewed or reported on by the company’s auditors.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

Shareholders are advised that Kumba is currently finalising
its results for the year ended 31 December 2015 (“the
period”), which will be released on SENS on 9 February 2016.

In accordance with section 3.4 (b) of the JSE Limited Listings
requirements and further to the trading statement released on
SENS on 6 November 2015 in which the Company indicated that
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) and basic earnings per
share (“EPS”) for the period would be more than 20% lower than
the previous year ended 31 December 2014 (“the comparative
period”); shareholders are advised that headline earnings for
the period are likely to be between R3,674 million and R3,863
million, with basic EPS for the period expected to be between
R440 million and R487 million. HEPS is likely to be between
R11.45 and R12.05, a decrease of between 65% and 67%. Basic
EPS is expected to be between R1.37 and R1.52, a decrease of
between 95% and 96%.

Reported headline earnings and basic earnings for the
comparative period (released on SENS on 10 February 2015) were
R11,006 million and R10,724 million respectively, while
reported HEPS and EPS for the comparative period were R34.32
and R33.44 respectively.

The decrease in earnings is largely attributable to the
significant   decrease  in   export   iron  ore    prices. The
deteriorating iron ore price environment has necessitated a
reconfiguration of the Sishen pit to a lower cost shell. This,
together with the significant impact of the weaker iron ore
price outlook, has resulted in an impairment charge relating
to Sishen mine of R6 billion (pre-tax). The impairment charge
will be included in basic earnings but excluded from headline
earnings. More information will be provided in the Company’s
results to be released on SENS on 9 February 2016.

Included in both HEPS and basic EPS is the derecognition of a
deferred tax asset of R617 million, as well as a gain realised
on a finance lease receivable of R232 million in the current
period. Normalised earnings per share, excluding these items,
are likely to be between R12.62 and R13.27, a decrease of
between 61% and 63% on the normalised earnings per share of
the comparative period of R34.32.

The financial information, on which this trading statement is
based, has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s
external auditors.

RESTRUCTURING OF SISHEN MINE AND COMMENCEMENT OF SECTION 189 PROCESS

Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (“SIOC”), an operating company of Kumba Iron Ore Limited, today
commenced a consultation process in terms of section 189 and 189A of the Labour Relations Act. Kumba
Iron Ore Limited is a business unit of Anglo American.

The consultation about workforce reductions follows a decision to restructure Sishen Mine to a lower cost
pit configuration. This was necessitated by sharply lower iron ore prices and both increased capital costs
and increased operating expenses due to the current high waste stripping requirements. The new mine
plan will exclude areas with high strip ratios, resulting in less waste needing to be mined as well as a
decreased level of iron ore production. The new Sishen mine plan significantly reduces mining and
production activities and necessitates a re-evaluation of the equipment and workforce needed to support
a smaller, more focused operation.

The restructuring of the mine will impact approximately 2,633 Kumba employees. Contractors at the mine
have commenced with their restructuring process and approximately 1,300 contractors will be affected.
SIOC is conducting extensive consultations with all stakeholders.

Norman Mbazima, CEO, stated: ‘This has been an extremely difficult decision but, after exhausting all
other avenues and doing all we could have done to reduce costs, we have no choice but to take more
significant steps to preserve the viability of the mine. We are mindful of the sensitivity that this situation
demands, and are committed to supporting all our employees at Sishen, as we have done throughout the
other restructuring processes at Kumba. We aim to ensure that our people are treated with the same care
and respect throughout this difficult process.’

Kumba will engage and update all stakeholders as necessary.

Kumba Iron Ore – Production from Kumba Iron Ore decreased by 12% to 10.9 million tonnes.

Sishen produced 7.7 million tonnes, a decrease of 17%. Production continued to be impacted by a lack of
sufficient exposed high quality ore for blending purposes as the mine transitions to the lower cost pit
configuration.

Full year production at Sishen was in line with the revised targeted production of ~31Mt as indicated in the
Q32015 production statement. Waste mined for the quarter was 54.3 million tonnes down 10%, in line with
the full year revised guidance of ~230 Mtpa.
At Kolomela, efficiencies and throughput at the plant continued to improve, partially offset by planned plant
maintenance during October, resulting in production of 2.9 million tonnes for the quarter, a 5% increase.
Waste mining remained flat at 9.7 million tonnes.

Mining ceased at Thabazimbi in September 2015 and the closure process remains on track.

Export sales reached 10.5 million tonnes, a decrease of 10% due to lower production. Total finished product
stocks were 4.7 million tonnes, compared with 6.5 million tonnes at 31 December 2014 as stocks were
drawn down to optimal levels.

The financial information on which the above forecast is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the company’s external auditors.

Extension of Cautionary
On 15 December 2015, Kumba extended the cautionary announcement relating to the notice from the
Department of Mineral Resources (""DMR"") that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the
amendment of Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd.'s (""SIOC"") mining right in respect of the Sishen Mine to
include the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen Mine, subject to certain
proposed conditions.

Shareholders are hereby advised to continue exercising caution when dealing in the company's shares and
securities, until a further announcement is made.

Extension of cautionary and update on Sishen Mine's 21.4% mining right

On 3 November 2015, Kumba advised shareholders that it had received notice from the Department of
Mineral Resources (""DMR"") that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the amendment of
Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd's (""SIOC"") mining right in respect of the Sishen Mine to include the
residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine, subject to certain conditions
(which are described by the DMR as ""proposals"").

Until the legal and practical implications of the proposed conditions have been clarified with the DMR,
SIOC is unable to accept the conditions. Section 96 of the Mineral & Petroleum Resources Development
Act (""MPRDA"") allows for an internal appeal to the Minister of Mineral Resources. Kumba therefore
submitted an internal appeal to the Minister as per the requirements of the MPRDA.

In the interim, Kumba continues to engage with the Minister of Mineral Resources in relation to the
proposed conditions in order to achieve a mutually beneficial solution.

The conditions contained in the Letter of Grant relate substantively to domestic supply, support for skills
development, research & development, and procurement.

Shareholders will be updated as appropriate and are hereby advised to continue exercising caution when
dealing in the Company's shares and securities, until a further announcement is made.

Note to Editors:
The Constitutional Court ruled on 12 December 2013 that the residual 21.4% undivided share of the
mining right in respect of Kumba's Sishen mine, which is owned by Kumba's subsidiary SIOC, remained
available for allocation by the DMR and that, based on the provisions of the MPRDA, only SIOC could
apply to be granted the residual right. SIOC subsequently applied to the DMR in relation to the residual
right.

Kumba Operational Update

Sishen Mine Reconfiguration
Shareholders are advised that the deteriorating price environment has necessitated a further optimisation
of the Sishen mine plan that was set out at the Group’s interim results on 21 July 2015. Kumba has
decided to reconfigure the Sishen pit to a lower cost shell configuration in order to optimise margins. This
is in line with the Company’s strategy to focus on value (cash generation) over volume, thereby
safeguarding the mine’s viability at lower prices.

“Our industry is under tremendous pressure with the market now pricing in a more muted trend for the
iron ore price over the medium to longer term. This is driven mainly by the expectation that supply growth
will remain strong, against the backdrop of an ever more cautious outlook on China’s economic growth
trajectory. These circumstances have reinforced the need to make tough decisions for our business, that
will enable it to withstand a longer period of much lower prices,” said CEO Norman Mbazima.

The new pit shell configuration will allow for a more flexible approach, reduce execution risk and lower
capital cost over the life of mine. The mine will target FOB unit costs of ~$30/t and a breakeven price of
~$40/t CFR for 2016. Waste movement is expected to be materially below previous guidance of ~230mt,
at ~135 Mt and production is expected to be reduced from previous guidance of 36 Mt for 2016 to ~26 Mt.

Kolomela continues to perform strongly
In order to reduce costs, Kolomela has been transitioned from three pits to two in the short to medium
term. The mine is targeting a 2016 FOB unit cost of ~US$27/t and a breakeven price of ~$38/t CFR for
2016. The production target remains at 13Mt by 2017.

Thabazimbi closure on track
The Thabazimbi mine closure is progressing according to plan with the processing of previously mined
material continuing until 1H2016.

Norman Mbazima emphasised, “Our first priority remains safety as we start to implement our plan to
continue delivering improvements in performance and cost competitiveness. Attention remains focused
on taking every step possible to ensure that we maintain positive cash generation to see this cycle
through.”

Further details will be provided at the Anglo American investor presentation this morning in London. The
presentation will begin at 11.00am CAT and end at approximately 1.00pm CAT, and will be webcast live
via the Anglo American website [www.angloamerican.com]. The presentation slides will be available on
Kumba's website [www.angloamericankumba.com] from 11.00am CAT today.

A further operational update will be given at the Company’s 2015 annual results presentation on 9
February 2016.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements and is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond Kumba's control and all of which are based on the Company's
current beliefs and expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in
this announcement are estimates and have not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's
external auditors.
