Management comments as follows:

Employees

Our employees continue to be our top priority in terms of securing their health,
well-being and where possible, maintaining their incomes in the face of the
fallout from the global COVID-19 pandemic (COVID). We have seen limited
cases of infections within our various businesses around the world, which are
managed within strict business best practices and local government
requirements. None of these infections have materially impacted on our ability
to operate.

We are conscious this is a stressful and difficult time for all our people and are
offering help where we are able. We continue to work with our customers and
suppliers in navigating the crisis and plotting the way forward.

Overall market conditions

Where lockdown restrictions have been eased, we have seen demand in the
discretionary spend sectors recover, however any businesses associated with
‘large crowds’, such as entertainment, sports events, business travel,
conventions and conferences, aviation and the cruise line industry remain
largely shuttered. The requirement of major institutions, many of whom are in
large inner capital cities, for employees to work from home has reduced activity
levels of our national customers. Some of this activity has shifted into suburban
areas and more rural locations as people continue to seek out eating-away-
from-home opportunities.

Most independent customers have reopened and have been able to adapt to
the varying economic conditions relatively well. The recovery of our larger
national customers has been much slower and activity levels remain subdued.
Our diversification into the home delivery new channel in a few businesses has
reduced as activity has returned in our traditional channels, however we have
continued to supply some products into independent retail related channels.
The overall contribution of these initiatives is small and remains generally non-
core.

Non-discretionary demand from our institutional customers, including serving
hospitals, aged care, prisons, the military, and government departments has
continued and is relatively stable.

Our governmental support programs in several countries to provide food and
care packages to the most vulnerable members of society via home delivery,
have ceased in most jurisdictions.

Current trading performance

The financial year started relatively well, with most geographies seemingly
coming out of the worst of the COVID crisis, with July showing a strong financial
performance, particularly in Europe and UK. Unfortunately, this started
deteriorating in August and has worsened with Europe and UK now firmly in the
grip of a harsh second wave that is showing little sign of easing. This is having
a significant impact on us once again. Fortunately, we are a diversified
business, with Australia, New Zealand and Asia doing well, and our other
Emerging Market constituents continuing to improve on a month-to-month
basis.

Group sales (in constant currency) for the financial year to date peaked in the
week ended August 2nd at 87% versus the corresponding week in F2020 but
had eased to 71% of the corresponding weekly sales for the week ended
November 8th.

All our businesses continue to fully operate in each geography however each
country is at a different stage of the COVID crisis. Sales progression by division
and for the group as a whole, between the period July 1st and November 8th as
shown in the table below, reflects the different stages of the COVID impact on
our markets.

   •   Australasia (AUS) - Sales have fluctuated between 84% and 96% of
       F2020 demand despite localised lockdowns in both Auckland (New
       Zealand) and Victoria (Australia) over the period.

   •   United Kingdom (UK) - Bidfood UK sales improved through the
       summer period assisted by the Shield Pack business in July, the “Eat
       out to Help Out” scheme in August and the return of the education sector
       in September. Fresh UK sales in September were 57% of last year, down
       from 61% in August. However as reported COVID cases increased,
       sales in our UK operations decreased in October and November as local
       and national restrictions began to bite.

   •   Europe (EUR) - Sales reached a low of 48% of the F2020 activity levels
       in the week of November 8th as the second wave of lockdowns limited
       activity across EUR from mid-October onwards, and this looks likely to
       continue through the winter.

   •   Emerging Markets (EM) - Other than in Greater China where the
       recovery was quick, the COVID pandemic has had a much longer and
       deeper impact in our EM region. However, through the quarter, sales in
       EM have continued to improve, particularly in South Africa and Turkey.
       Angliss Greater China has tracked at or better than the comparative
       Q1 F2020.

Currency volatility has positively impacted our rand-translated results and will
remain a significant factor for the remainder of F2021. Currency movements for
Q1 F2021 are shown below:

                          Q1 F2021             Q1 F2020
                                                                    % change
                       Average FX rate      Average FX rate
        AUD:ZAR              12,09               10,27                17,7
        EUR:ZAR              19,76               16,30                21,2
        GBP:ZAR              21,84               18,07                20,8

Our group gross profit percentage for the Q1 F2021 has been maintained at
similar levels to the comparative quarter in F2020, benefitting from the mix of
smaller independent customers, however under a little pressure in certain
businesses who are driving market share gains.

Throughout the crisis, our focus has been on making sure that our businesses
retain as much human capital capacity and internal IP as we are able, in order
to scale-up as activity levels return, as we have seen quickly happen across
many regions in which we operate. To enable us to ‘retain the muscle’ of the
businesses, we have continued to access various government wage assistance
schemes in jurisdictions where we are eligible to do so, in order to protect as
many of our staff as possible. Unfortunately, this hasn’t negated the need to
furlough some employees and permanently reduce headcount where
restructuring was required.

With lower levels of activity, operating costs as a percentage of net revenue
increased from 18,8% to 19,5%. In the quarter, constant currency operating
expenditure (opex) declined by 14,2% compared to a constant currency
revenue decline of 17,1%. We estimate that 35% to 40% of the cost base is
relatively fixed so we will not see a linear reduction in opex as revenues decline,
particularly where the onset of the resurgent spread of the virus as in the UK
and Europe results in rapid and sudden lockdowns imposed by governments.

For Q1 F2021, the group made a pleasing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest,
Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) equivalent to 5,2% of monthly net revenue
compared to 5,9% in Q1 F2020.

Non-IFRS 16 finance charges were 12,7% higher in Q1 F2021 driven up by the
forex translation impact and imputed interest on the DAC put option. Excluding
these impacts, real net finance charges were lower by 20% arising out of the
benefits of lower capex and better working capital management.

Working capital days are better by 8 days in Q1 F2021, a great result achieved
by our operations despite a few areas of anticipated absorption. Our inventories
are in good shape, customers are generally paying well, and our payable terms
are normalised.

We completed a sale & leaseback of a Hong Kong property for HK$325 million
and will conclude on two other properties in the next few months. These asset
sales are part of our property maximisation strategy in terms of end-of-useful-
life properties, where we are taking advantage of very low yields currently being
achieved in many markets on industrial property.

Free cash flow (excluding dividends but after operating cashflows, working
capital and capex) for Q1 F2021 amounted to an inflow of R1,2 billion, some
R2,6 billion better than the comparative Q1 F2020. This has been achieved by
improved cash generated from operations (after working capital), capex in line
with depreciation and proceeds received on the sale of the Hong Kong property
in August.
Cashflow evolution since March 2020

As at March 31st 2020 the group’s net debt was £338 million. Through April
and May during the initial strict government lockdown’s, cashflow was
aggressively managed which resulted in net debt levels being maintained. As
markets reopened from June onwards, group sales improved from week-to-
week which resulted in excellent cash generation through to August. Net debt
levels during October and November are stable at levels around £175 million
to £185 million, but approximately £200 million better when compared to the
prior year.

Liquidity

Our priority remains to ensure that our operations have sufficient liquidity for
their respective requirements. We believe that the group has sufficient liquidity
for the foreseeable future. The group and its subsidiaries have as at
September 30th, cash and cash equivalents of R7,2 billion (£336,1 million),
gross borrowings of R11,7 billion (£540,9 million) of which R6,7 billion is short
term. Total headroom available, including uncommitted facilities and cash and
cash equivalents, is R21,6 billion (£998,9 million).

Debt covenants
The group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest cover
ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the effects of
IFRS 16) of not less than 5x. As at September 30th 2020, the group was well
within these covenant ranges and does not believe there will be any breach
thereof for the year ending June 2021.

Update on under-performing businesses

Going into the COVID crisis we had problems in our Spain, Germany and Fresh
UK activities. We have taken remedial action with these businesses, and
although the financial numbers don’t yet show it, we are well on the track to
recovery with all of them. Spain remains the largest challenge, the senior
management team has been changed, we bought out the minorities, the
business has been significantly downscaled and now we just need sales to
return. Fresh UK has also been significantly streamlined and excess costs and
capacity taken out, without diminishing its position as a specialist supplier of
seafood, meat and produce. Germany is operating effectively and once sales
return, so too will profits.

Strategic future

Bidcorp’s current focus is to operate at the ‘new normal’ which is being dictated
by the unpredictability we are seeing in many markets arising out of the ‘second
waves’ prevalent in the northern hemisphere now. It is not possible at this time
to confidently predict activity levels until we see consistent levelling off and
decline in the spread of COVID. Our businesses in UK and Europe are well
prepared to ride out the next phase of the COVID pandemic, likely to persist
through the winter months. The Group has taken steps to ensure that
management are incentivised to guide our businesses through the short-term
effects of COVID whilst seeking longer-term growth opportunities to return the
group to pre-COVID activity levels.

We continue to believe that there will not be any long-term fundamental shift in
consumer behavior of eating-away-from-home and evidence suggests that not
much has changed in those markets where normality and confidence has
returned. If anything, we are seeing growth particularly in our “sweet spot” target
market, namely the smaller to mid-size independent customer.

Large supply disruptions haven’t materialised as predicted, however for our
products imported into China the supply chain has been strained for products
sourced in Europe, USA, and South America. In most of our businesses, the
majority of product is procured locally. There is an element of disruption
currently being experienced in global shipping and container availability, and
we continue to adapt our procurement as necessary.

No significant acquisitions in the foodservice space have become evident yet,
however we believe economic conditions will result in opportunities coming to
market. The ability to explore opportunities in new markets remains hindered
by the general prohibition on international travel into and from many parts of the
world. In existing markets, we are confident we are gaining market share
against competitors, many of whom do not have the financial strength of
Bidcorp. We have concluded a small in-country acquisition in the Middle East
and are looking at some potential targets in Chile, Brazil, Australia, New
Zealand, Malaysia, and Germany. We do however need to understand that
acquisitions made now are riskier than before due to the uncertainty and
disruption of the past nine months.

We have scaled back much discretionary spend in capex and other business
expenses. We are considering future investments in those jurisdictions where
activity levels have returned as the time delay between conceptualisation and
conclusion can be up to three years.

Our ecommerce platform remains a source of competitive advantage and
continues to evolve primarily to cater for our wholesale customers. Our digital
transformation journey has accelerated through this crisis, and we are seeing
some great benefits, particularly with regards to insights through data analytics,
of which we have the benefit of a multi-jurisdictional view. For retail customers,
who can either collect or elect home-delivery, this remains a fringe activity
catering to the current environment.

Comment

Bernard Berson, CE, commented as follows:

   “Although our financial results are down, our motivation and confidence
   are up, and we are very fortunate to have the team that we do around
   the world running our businesses. Our competitive position is good even
   though our industry has been particularly hard hit. We believe hospitality
   will bounce back strongly and we will be ready to take advantage of
   these opportunities. In the meantime, it’s about a focus on long-term
   sustainability, strength, and resilience. I believe we are doing better than
   most. This is helped by our (deliberate) geographic diversity, our
   (deliberate) de-emphasising of large volume, low-margin business in
   favour of smaller to mid-size independent customers, and our
   (deliberate) decentralised and entrepreneurial approach to how we
   manage our business across 35 geographies.”

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, Bidcorp is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the year ended June 30 2020, will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding year ended June 30 2019.

Shareholders are referred to the trading update provided to the market on June 15 2020 and are
further advised that: -

Bidcorp has been significantly impacted by the catastrophic economic and social consequences of the
COVID 19 pandemic (COVID) which took hold across every operating geography from late January
2020 onwards. As a consequence of the lockdowns and restrictions caused by COVID, sales declined
by 28% in the last quarter of the financial year against the last quarter in the comparative period, and
significant abnormal costs were incurred including additional receivables provisioning of R785 million,
inventory obsolescence of R248 million and restructuring costs of R470 million. Asset impairments of
R940 million have been taken, the most significant of which relates to goodwill on our Spanish
operation.

In respect of continuing operations, headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) is expected to be between
45% (794,0 cents per share) and 50% (721,8 cents per share) lower than the comparative year (F2019:
1443,6 cents per share) and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is expected to be between 66% (493,3
cents per share) and 70% (435,3 cents per share) lower than the comparative year (F2019: 1451,0
cents per share).

In addition to the aforementioned impacts of COVID, our discontinued operations, Best Food Logistics
and PCL distribution, were successfully exited in March. Accordingly, HEPS from total operations is
expected to be between 45% (737,3 cents per share) and 50% (670,3 cents per share) lower than the
comparative year (F2019: 1340,5 cents per share) and EPS from total operations is expected to be
between 68% (394,0 cents per share) and 72% (344,8 cents per share) lower than the comparative
year (F2019: 1231,4 cents per share).

It is expected that Bidcorp will release its full year results for the year ended June 30 2020 on or about
August 26 2020. The information above has not been reviewed and reported on by the group’s
external auditors.

CAPITAL MARKETS TRADING UPDATE Q4 F2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are advised Bidcorp today, Monday June 15th 2020, wishes to
update the market on the trading environment across its operations, with
particular emphasis on the impacts of the COVID-19 (COVID) crisis. This is in
terms of Bidcorp’s requirement of continuous disclosure in terms of the JSE
Listings Requirements and needs to be read in conjunction with the update
provided on April 14th 2020.

Management comments as follows on:
Our employees have been our top priority, good progress has been made in
terms of securing their health, well-being and where possible, maintaining their
incomes. To date, most of our employees have managed to avoid any health
impact from the COVID pandemic with a limited number of cases having been
reported in South Africa and Chile.

Sadly, one employee has succumbed to the disease in South Africa. We have
extended our sincere condolences to the family and his colleagues within the
Group. Our heart goes out to all those affected by the pandemic and we remain
committed to play our role through various support initiatives across our
operations.

We continue to work with our customers and suppliers in navigating the fallout
from this crisis and plotting the way forward.

Current trading performance
As noted in the April update, the full impact of the economic crisis became
evident from April onwards. Group sales for the week ended April 5th reached
a low of 37% versus the corresponding week in F2019 but had recovered to
65% of the corresponding sales for the week ended May 31st. For the past week
ended June 14th, sales have improved to 67% compared to the same week in
the prior year.
All our businesses have continued operating in each geography; however each
country is at a different stage of the COVID crisis. Sales progression by division
and for the Group as a whole, as shown in the table over the page between the
period March 1st and June 14th reflects the different stages of the COVID impact
on our markets. Please note that weekly comparatives to last year should be
viewed as a trend; as the timing of public holidays, school holidays and other
events can have an impact on any one week in isolation.

   •   Australasia (AUS) – Despite hitting a low of 35% of its F2019 demand
       in the week of April 19th, sales have recovered to 83% of the F2019 level
       in the week ended June 14th.
   •   United Kingdom (UK) – UK achieved a low of 30% of its F2019 sales
       in the week of April 5th however sales have recovered to 56% of the
       F2019 level in the week of June 14th. Most of this activity has arisen away
       from our traditional markets.
   •   Europe (EUR) - Sales reached a low of 27% of the F2019 activity levels
       in the week of April 19th however has recovered to 62% of the F2019
       level in the week of June 14th. Eastern Europe appears to be further
       along the economic recovery path than what we are experiencing in
       western Europe. Activity levels in Italy (weekly sales low of 17% to a
       current 43%), Spain (weekly sales low of 7% to a current 31%) and the
       Netherlands (weekly sales low of 12% to a current 55%) are
       experiencing a slower recovery.
   •   Emerging Markets (EM) – Sales in mainland China have recovered and
       are now exceeding those of the comparative week in F2019. Weekly
       sales in Hong Kong and Macau are tracking at about 20% behind the
       comparative week in F2019, additionally subdued by the resurgence of
       the political unrest. Activity levels in the other emerging market countries
       in which the Group operates (South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey and the
       Middle East) remain subdued as the path out of the COVID crisis still
       lags that of Australasia and Europe.

Our Group gross profit percentage over the months of April and May have been
maintained at their pre-COVID levels despite the severity and suddenness of
the worldwide lockdowns.

Even though all our businesses have, and continue to experience reduced
levels of activity, the Group has been cognisant of the need to retain as much
human capital capacity as we are able, in order to scale-up as activity levels
return, as we are seeing in a number of businesses. We have accessed various
government wage assistance schemes in a number of businesses where we
are eligible to do so, in order to protect as many of our staff as possible,
unfortunately this hasn’t negated the need to temporarily stand down and
furlough some employees.

The board and executive management have taken a 30% reduction in fees and
salary respectively in Q4 F2020 and we are evaluating whether this should be
extended post June 2020. All businesses where salary reduction initiatives
were implemented will continue to align themselves with the impacts in their
respective workforces.

With lower levels of activity, variable costs have been taken out the businesses
as much as possible bearing in mind that all businesses have traded through
the past 3 months, each to varying degrees.

For the month of April, the Group made a positive EBITDAC (Earnings Before
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation, and COVID adjustments)
equivalent to 2,2% of monthly revenue. For the month of May the Group made
a positive EBITDAC (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and
Amortisation and COVID adjustments) equivalent to 4,4% of monthly revenue.
The COVID adjustments relate to abnormal receivables provisioning and
restructuring costs arising out of the current crisis which amounted to
R317 million for April and R177 million for May.


Overall market conditions
Demand in the discretionary spend sectors, particularly across hotels,
restaurants, pubs, leisure and travel related segments remains weak but are
improving off a near zero base. Many customers are reopening and emerging
from their ‘hibernation’ at a pace quicker than we had anticipated, however
those businesses associated with ‘large crowds’, such as entertainment, sports
clubs and travel, remain shuttered. Our businesses have diversified into new
channels, such as home delivery and supply to other retail related channels,
however the overall contribution of these initiatives is small and remains non-
core.
Non-discretionary demand from our institutional customers , including serving
customers such as hospitals, aged care, prisons, the military and government
departments has stabilised.
Our governmental support programs in several countries to provide food and
care packages to the most vulnerable members of society via home delivery,
have continued. We are grateful to our staff who are involved with these for
their valued and selfless contribution.
Ongoing actions being undertaken by the businesses in the current
environment:


Workplaces
As activity levels have increased and more staff return to the work, so has the
need to increase compliance throughout our work environments. Our priority
remains ensuring a safe workplace for our staff through maintaining exceptional
hygiene standards in line with each environment and jurisdiction
recommendations and legislations.
Social distancing in the workplace remains an effective methodology to contain
the risk of infections with operations operating under strict sanitization protocols
to prevent any potential risk of cross-contamination.
Working remotely for those employees who can do so has been encouraged.
Discretionary travel and commuting have been discontinued.


Liquidity
Our priority has been to ensure that our operations have sufficient liquidity for
their respective requirements. Further headroom has been created and we
believe that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. The
Group and its subsidiaries have available to it, as at June 10th 2020, headroom
facilities of R17,4 billion (£823 million) which is in addition to our existing net
debt. Our net debt at May 31st 2020 was R7,6 billion (£353 million, at the month
end exchange rate of R21,67:£1).
Free cash flow (excluding the interim dividend paid in March 2020 but after
operating cashflows, working capital and capex) for the period from
January 1st 2020 to May 31st 2020 amounted to an outflow of R470 million
(£24 million) highlighting a concerted effort by operational management to
aggressively manage their cashflows in these trying circumstances.


Debt covenants
The Group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest cover
ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the effects of
IFRS16) of not less than 5x. As at May 31st 2020, the Group was well within
these covenant ranges and does not believe there will be any breach thereof
for the year ended June 2020.


Dividends
As noted in the interim financial results commentary, the Group is conscious of
the need to balance gearing and shareholder returns (in light of the Group’s
stated dividend policy). Management anticipate that as the economic recovery
gains strength, gearing is likely to increase as our working capital investment
increases in the return of the businesses to growth. Accordingly, it is too early
to determine the status of the final dividend for the year ending June 2020 and
any changes to the Group’s dividend policy beyond that.

Working capital
The working capital cycle has been well-managed by our operations across the
Group in the context of having experienced a significant shutdown of a large
part of the customer base. Collections from customers through April and May
have exceeded our expectations under the circumstances and where required,
payment plans have been agreed to. We expect further stress in some of the
customer base and our businesses continue to work alongside those affected
customers to proactively manage this. All businesses have and continue to
evaluate their credit loss exposure which will result in additional provisioning,
the exact quantum of which is unquantifiable at this stage. We insure a
proportion of our current credit book however the ability of many customers to
obtain insurance is becoming increasingly difficult.

Our businesses through April and May have actively managed their inventory
exposure, particularly their short-dated stock. All inventory obsolescence has
been expensed as incurred and we do not believe our current broad range of
ambient and frozen products, all of which have longer shelf-lives, presents a
significant further exposure. All stock continues to be carefully monitored and
remains fit for our customer base.

Through March and April, payables were aggressively managed in conjunction
with our suppliers however supplier payment cycles were largely regularised by
the end of May.

Our expectation is that we will see the working capital cycle normalise in the
months ahead even though some working capital pressures may manifest as
markets open and we experience a return to a more normalised customers
credit cycle, however some counter to this is we will be selling our inventory
that has largely been paid for.


Strategic future
Bidcorp’s current focus is to predict the likely ‘new normal’ that will exist post
the short-term effects of the COVID crisis. Our initial assessment was that
activity levels would return to levels of 75% – 85% of pre-COVID levels in the
next 12 to 18 months but we now believe this number will be higher and
hopefully sooner. Our businesses are preparing to ride out the next phase of
the economic recovery with these activity levels in mind. We believe that there
will not be any fundamental shift in consumer behavior of eating-away-from-
home and early anecdotal evidence suggests that human muscle memory in
respect of socialisation remains an important component of the consumers
existence.

Unfortunately, not all of our operations entered this crisis in as strong a market
position as we would have liked and in order to ensure their long-term survival,
will require restructuring to achieve simplification and focus on their core
competencies and markets. In this respect, management are evaluating our
Spanish operations to focus on their independent customer base in their core
markets. Depending on the extent of the restructuring required, this may
necessitate some impairment of the goodwill associated with this operation.
Our recovery in China has been hampered by supply chain disruptions of
products sourced in Europe, USA and South America. Whilst this has assisted
with ensuring that we trade our current inventory judiciously, we are unable to
establish whether this is a short-term aberration only in relation to our Greater
China operation or is likely to become a long-term supply chain issue. In most
of our businesses, the majority of product is procured locally so this is unlikely
to have any material impact across the Group.

No significant acquisition opportunities in the foodservice space have become
evident and we believe is premature to be exploring these in the current
environment. There is the possibility of market share gains should competitors,
without the financial strength of Bidcorp, exit the industry. We are finalising the
acquisition of a distressed business in northern Italy and expect more of these
in-country type of opportunities to present themselves in the months ahead.
We continue to scale back any discretionary spend in capex and other business
expenses. We are also not committing to any large investments for future years
until we have greater clarity on the outlook.

Our ecommerce platform remains a source of competitive advantage and has
been adapted to cater for retail customers, who can either collect or elect home-
delivery. There has been good take-up of home deliveries in many countries,
but this remains a fringe activity catering to the current environment.


Trading statement

Bidcorp believes that the worst of the COVID crisis is behind the Group however
significant uncertainty persists as to the speed and depth of the economic
recovery in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

Bidcorp’s financial results in April, May and as anticipated in June as well, have
been adversely affected by crisis and accordingly shareholders are advised, in
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, that both headline earnings per share
and basic earnings per share for the year to June 2020 is expected to be more
than 20% lower than the comparative year to June 2019.

The Company will issue a further trading statement with more specific guidance
ranges once there is reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline
relative to the comparable period.

COVID-19: IMPACT ON BIDCORP

Shareholders are advised Bidcorp today, Tuesday, April 14 2020, wishes to
update the market on the trading environment across its operations, with
particular emphasis on the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This is in terms of
the requirement of issuers to assess the impact, if any, that the outbreak may
have on business operations and an issuers disclosure obligation in terms of
the JSE Listings Requirements.

Bidcorp’s UK logistics activities (Bestfood Contract Distribution and PCL),
which were classified as Discontinued Operations, were exited fully at the
beginning of March 2020 as expected and within the terms and conditions as
previously outlined.

Management comments as follows on Bidcorp’s operations around the world:
   •   The safety of our employees is top of mind, securing their health, well-
       being and where possible, maintaining their incomes in order that they
       can emerge from this crisis employed and motivated.
   •   Furthermore, maintaining our relationships with our customers and
       suppliers is a priority as all parties navigate the significant and rapidly
       changing fallout from this crisis.

Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   •   Trading for the 9 months to March 31 2020 (on a like-for-like basis,
       excluding the impact of IFRS 16) has held up reasonably well and
       broadly in line with expectations (measured in home currencies),
       however the full effects of the COVID-19 crisis across many of our
       operations only appeared in the second half of March and the full impact
       will become evident from April onwards.
   •   Being part of the food distribution industry, all our businesses have been
       designated as essential services and have continued operating in all
       geographies. Demand for food products has substantially diminished in
       many discretionary spend sectors, particularly across hotels,
       restaurants, pubs, leisure and travel related segments. Our businesses
       are actively seeking solutions for each market and attempting to replace
       a small portion of this lost revenue in new channels, such as home
       delivery and supply to other retail related channels.
   •   Non-discretionary activities to institutional customers continues,
       including serving customers such as hospitals, aged care, prisons, the
       military and government departments in many of our businesses. We are
       experiencing an uptick in demand generally from these segments but
       expect this to normalise once the consumer panic and stockpiling eases.
       We are sharing the experiences of operations in geographies that are
       ahead of others in the crisis, to pre-empt some of the sales opportunities
       and cost saving measures where possible.
   •   We are very proud to be part of governmental programs in several
       countries to provide food and care packages to the most vulnerable
       members of society via home delivery, during the very difficult and strict
       lockdown period. Our staff who are involved with this are to be
       commended and thanked for their valued and selfless contribution.
   •   It is very difficult to quantify the exact amount of decline we are
       experiencing as different countries are at different stages of the crisis
       and have implemented various strategies to fight the virus, which have
       a differing impact on our end-customer base, and vary from week to
       week. In China, we are seeing a very encouraging and quick bounce
       back in demand, and our volumes are quickly approaching the levels of
       a year ago. In our other major geographies, we are currently
       experiencing a short-term decline of volumes of between 45% to 70%
       relative to weekly volumes achieved during the comparative period in
       2019.

Actions being undertaken by the businesses in the current environment

Workplaces:
   •   Cleanliness and food safety have always been a top priority in our
       businesses, however we have increased compliance throughout our
       work environments, as well as additional hygiene standards and
       requirements such as masks and sanitizers, as each environment and
       jurisdiction recommend and legislates.
   •   Social distancing is implemented in operations with teams working
       separate shifts and between shifts sanitizing and clean down to prevent
       any potential risk of cross contamination.
   •   Working remotely has been encouraged wherever possible.
   •   Discretionary travel and commuting have been discontinued.

Costs:
   •   All our businesses are experiencing reduced levels of activity and we
       must be innovative on how we protect our staff yet manage the cost
       base. In some areas we have reduced working hours to 60% - 80% of
       the normal shift and have requested staff to take annual / unpaid leave
       where possible to assist in managing these costs down and to protect
       jobs wherever possible. We have also unfortunately had to temporarily
       stand down and furlough some employees. There is quite a bit of fluidity
       regarding various government wage assistance schemes in respect of
       eligibility, timing and coverage. We are doing our best to access these in
       all countries where we qualify. The Group is cognisant of the need to
       retain as much human capital capacity as we are able to in order to
       scale-up as quickly as circumstances allow once normality returns in our
       various territories.
   •   The Board and executive management are taking a 30% reduction in
       fees / salary for the fourth quarter of F2020 (and beyond if need be) to
       help support the business. All businesses have also implemented salary
       reduction initiatives to align themselves with the impacts in the general
       workforces.
   •   Wherever possible other variable costs are being downscaled, and the
       lower level of activity assists in this, in areas such as fuel, electricity and
       waste. We own a substantial portion of our properties and fleet, and
       where we don’t, we are actively negotiating property rental reductions as
       well as fleet dehires.

Liquidity:
   •   Our priority is to make sure that in our decentralised environment, our
       operations have sufficient liquidity for their requirements. We believe the
       Group has sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future in terms of
       headroom and we are working with our banking partners to further
       increase liquidity. The Group has available to it, as at March 31 2020,
       headroom and facilities of R9,6 billion (£425 million) which is in addition
       to our existing net debt. For reference, our total net debt at
       December 31 2019 was R4,9 billion.

Debt covenants:
   •   The Group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest
       cover ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the
       effects of IFRS16) of not less than 5x. As at December 2019, the Group
       was well within its covenants with its net debt to EBITDA ratio at 0,6x
       and the interest cover ratio at 27x.

Working capital:
   •   To date the working capital cycle has been well-managed by our
       operations across the Group. However, we do expect there to be stress
       in our customer base and detailed work is being undertaken to
       understand the impact of this. In many businesses, we insure a
       proportion of the credit book. We do understand that there will be an
       element of our customer base that may struggle to pay us in agreed
       terms, and we are proactively managing this on a customer by customer
       basis. It must be emphasised that a number of our customers are still
       open and trading, although some at much-reduced rates than before.
   •   Furthermore, work is being undertaken to understand the impact of
       obsolescence on our inventory. Our businesses have already
       undertaken initiatives to reduce exposure to short dated stock. We
       generally carry a broad range of ambient and frozen products all of which
       have longer shelf lives, but all stock is being carefully monitored. There
       is not a major financial loss anticipated at this stage, as inventory usage
       was very actively monitored and actioned on short life product.
   •   We do expect working capital pressures to become more evident once
       the market reopens in particular with regard to customers credit cycle.

Strategic initiatives

   •   Bidcorp’s current strategy is to ensure the sustainability of the
       businesses in the current environment. As jurisdictions around the world
       are being subject to quarantine and lockdown regulations from
       governments, new sales opportunities are being sought such as the
       supply of food into retail environments, direct to retail customer sales via
       ecommerce platforms, growth in restaurant and hotel kitchens where
       they are being used to prepare pre-cooked meals for collection, home
       delivery and many different government feeding initiatives (quarantine
       centers, temporary hospitals and frontline healthcare worker
       accommodation).
   •   Acquisition opportunities in the foodservice space will become evident
       but it is premature to be exploring these in the current environment.
       There is the possibility of market share gains should competitors, without
       the financial strength of Bidcorp, exit the industry.
   •   We have cut back on any discretionary spend in capex and other
       business expenses. We are also scaling back any large capex plans for
       future years until we have greater clarity on the outlook.
   •   Our ecommerce platform has been adapted to cater for retail customers,
       who can either collect or want home delivery. There has been good take-
       up of home deliveries in many countries, but this remains a fringe activity.
       Our ecommerce platform has seen good growth during this period, and
       our development team have implemented some great features and
       enhancements to our offering, which will greatly benefit our digital
       platforms in the future.

Prospects

Management’s expectations for F2020 remain unquantifiable under the current
uncertain and unpredictable environment.
Commenting on today's announcement Bernard Berson, Chief Executive
Officer of Bidcorp, said:
   •   ""Bidcorp’s strength lies in its strong and decentralised management
       teams who are best placed to navigate the crisis at the coalface in each
       of its operating jurisdictions. Bidcorp is financially strong and enters this
       period of uncertainty with relatively low levels of gearing and a robust
       business model. Our businesses are designated essential services
       which means we are playing a critical role in servicing those most
       affected by the crisis.”
   •   ""I am very proud of the dedication and courage of our people around the
       world during these challenging times as we contemplate the new normal
       future. Tough conditions don’t last forever but tough teams do.”
   •   “We strongly believe in our business model and that our customers and
       demand will bounce back over time. There will be opportunities for us to
       explore in our operating geographies and beyond in the months to come,
       and we have an amazing team of people around the world who are up
       to the challenge and will ensure our market leading position and great
       operational excellence continue as the world recovers from this dark
       chapter.”

Shareholders will be kept informed on an ongoing basis as further information
comes to light.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, Bidcorp is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the 6 months ended December 31 2019, will differ by at least 20% from
those of the previous corresponding 6 months ended December 31 2018.

Shareholders are advised that:

As a result of the capital write-offs incurred in the discontinued operations in the comparative
period, basic earnings per share (""EPS"") from total operations is expected to be between 20% (674,5
cents per share) and 22% ( 685,8 cents per share) higher than the comparative period (2019: 562,1
cents per share) and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") from total operations is expected to be
between 4% (707,7 cents per share) and 6% (721,3 cents per share) higher than the comparative
period (2019: 680,5 cents per share).

In respect of continuing operations, HEPS is expected to be between 3% (721,2 cents per share) and
5% (735,2 cents per share) higher than the comparative period (2019: 700,2 cents per share) and
EPS is expected to be between 3% (719,7 cents per share) and 5% ( 733,6 cents per share) higher
than the comparative period (2019: 698,7 cents per share), reflecting the challenging trading
environment in many of our operational geographies.

It is expected that Bidcorp will release its half-year results for the six months ended December 31
2019 on or about February 19 2020. The information above has not been reviewed and reported on
by the Group's auditors.
