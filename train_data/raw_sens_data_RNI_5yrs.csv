COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 30 September 2020 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 30 September 2020

As at 30 September 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.55 billion, a decrease of EUR 260 million from 30 June 2020. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 30 September 2020. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 30 September 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization ('WHO') announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has continued to cause significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. The fair value of the Fund's investments will continue to be impacted by these factors. At the time of this announcement the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown.

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 30 September 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 26.57 (30 June 2020: EUR 28.09) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

Unquote

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in due course and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") - EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE


The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.19000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 25 August 2020 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018 in respect of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. 

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend is ZAR 20.74010 : Euro 1. This exchange rate is determined on 18 August 2020. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per Reinet South African Share is 315.24952 ZAR cents, as set out in the table below:

             Gross dividend     South African       Net dividend
             per share          dividend tax        per share
             (in ZAR cents)     at 20%              (in ZAR cents)
                                (in ZAR cents)

Total        394.06190              (78.81238)           315.24952

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the Reinet South African Shares is anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""          Tuesday, 25 August 2020

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from
the commencement of business on          Wednesday, 26 August 2020

No cross-border movements of Reinet ordinary shares will be permitted between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch and Luxembourgish stock exchanges (Euroclear Nederland, Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) and the clearing and settlement system for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Strate) between Tuesday, 25 August 2020 and Friday, 28 August 2020, both days inclusive, and no Reinet South African Shares may be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 26 August 2020 and Friday, 28 August 2020, both days inclusive.

Note to former holders of certificated depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares (""Certificated DRs""):

Upon the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme in December 2017, the holdings of former holders of Certificated DRs were dematerialised through Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited reflecting Reinet South African Shares in dematerialised form in a valid account with a CSDP or broker as specified by the former holder of Certificated DRs, or, in the absence of such specification, in a nominee account for the benefit of the former holders of Certificated DRs, if and to the extent that they held 10 or more depository receipts. Former holders of Certificated DRs that have not specified a valid account with a CSDP or broker at the time of the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme are advised to regularise their accounts with their CSDP by contacting Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited to surrender their certificates and to obtain assistance and information on the process they must follow in order to regularise their holdings and to ensure their bank mandates are up to date.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE	


NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 JUNE 2020

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S., has today announced its net asset value as at 30 June 2020 as follows: 

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 30 June 2020

As at 30 June 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.8 billion, an increase of EUR 0.4 billion from 31 March 2020. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 30 June 2020. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 30 June 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization ('WHO') announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has continued to cause significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. The fair value of the Fund's investments will continue to be impacted by these factors. At the time of this announcement the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown.

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 30 June 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 28.09 (31 March 2020: EUR 25.71) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in due course and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 31 MARCH 2020

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 31 March 2020 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 31 March 2020

As at 31 March 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.4 billion, a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion from 31 December 2019. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 31 March 2020. The NAV calculation is subject to completion of the year-end audit.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 31 March 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organisation (""WHO"") announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has led to significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. At the time of this announcement the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains highly uncertain and is continuously changing. 

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 31 March 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 25.71 (31 December 2019: EUR 31.87) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in May 2020 and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

REINET EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS APPROVES REVISIONS TO THE TERMS OF THE PROSPECTUS

An Extraordinary General Meeting (the 'Meeting') of Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the 'Company') was held in Luxembourg today to approve proposed revisions to the investment guidelines of Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('Reinet Fund'), which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company issued at the time of the reorganisation of the Company and the listing of its shares in 2008 and subsequently amended in 2012 with the approval of a general meeting of shareholders of the Company. 
 
The Meeting also considered the deletion of the paragraph ""Limits on Illiquid Securities"" restricting investments in illiquid securities to no more than 50 per cent of the net assets of Reinet Fund.  

At the Meeting, a total of 137 729 895 ordinary shares and all the 1 000 management shares were present or represented by proxy, representing 74.74% of the total voting rights at the record date (10 January 2020) of 184 290 891, being the total shares in issue (195 942 286) less the treasury shares (11 651 395), the voting rights attached to which are suspended. Of the shares present or represented, 99.97% voted in support of the two proposed resolutions relating to i) the amendment of the investment guidelines and ii) the removal of the limits on illiquid securities. 

Commenting on the outcome of the meeting, Mr van Zyl, who acted as the Chairman of the Meeting, said:

Quote

""Our philosophy is to find and invest in assets that offer long-term growth potential. It is therefore important that Reinet have the flexibility to manage the size of and further investment in certain key investments, which will remain a feature of the portfolio. Having obtained shareholder approval at today's Meeting allows Reinet Fund to expand its exposure to certain key assets as required, which will be in the long term interest of the Company's shareholders. We thank shareholders for their strong support in this regard.""

As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. may differ from that of the Fund. The net asset value per share of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will also differ from that of the Fund due to the difference in number of shares in issue.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


REINET INVESTMENTS PROPOSES REVISIONS TO THE TERMS OF THE PROSPECTUS

The Board of Reinet Investment Manager S.A., acting on behalf of Reinet Investments S.C.A. ('the Company') proposes to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to consider revisions to the prospectus (the 'Prospectus') of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A. F.I.S. (the 'Fund'), which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company issued at the time of the reorganisation of the Company and the listing of its shares in 2008 and subsequently amended in 2012 with the approval of a general meeting of shareholders of the Company.

Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') manages a diversified portfolio of investments allowing for an emphasis on several key investments which the Fund Manager believes may add substantial value. The proportion of the Fundâ€™s assets represented by such key investments may be substantially higher than that of the other investments in the Fund's portfolio. 

It is proposed that the Prospectus is amended to allow an investment in such a key asset of up to 50 per cent of the Fund's total assets with all other assets remaining below 30 per cent of total assets. If the limits are exceeded as a result of market movements, adjustments to the portfolio will only be made when considered to be in the interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Commenting on the rationale for this proposed amendment, Johann Rupert, Chairman of the Company, said:

Quote

As communicated previously, Reinet remains focused on pursuing the planned diversification of the Fundâ€™s investment portfolio; its investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') has provided the Fund with the capacity to fund new opportunities, either through borrowing or through the realisation of part of the shareholding. As at 30 September 2019 the Fund had sold over 16 million BAT shares for total proceeds of some EUR 720 million and made new investments of some EUR 2.4 billion in pursuit of further diversification of the Fund.

Whilst the Fund has significantly expanded its portfolio of new investments, the Fund Manager believes that the existence of certain key investments will remain a feature of the portfolio and is considered the most optimal way of creating value for the Fund's shareholders. 

Our philosophy is to find and invest in assets that offer long-term growth potential. We therefore invest to deliver strong returns over the long term, rather than to deploy short-term investment strategies designed to generate short-term results. However, we are currently limited â€“ due to risk diversification requirements - in our efforts to develop certain key investments that have the potential to achieve long term growth. An additional contribution of capital in certain key investments (other than BAT) could, over time, increase the Fund's current exposure to an investment beyond the 30 per cent threshold. This possibility has been discussed with the CSSF, the Fund's regulator, and has subsequently been approved.

Whilst on the one hand now placing a limit on the overall exposure of a single investment, in obtaining shareholder approval for the amendment to the Prospectus, Reinet will have more flexibility over time to manage the size of and further investment in key investments, which will be in the long term interest of the Reinet shareholders.

Unquote

On a separate point, the Prospectus restricts investments in illiquid securities to no more than 50 per cent of the net assets of the Fund. It is proposed to delete this restriction, as liquidity constraints are not directly relevant for the Fund, it being closed ended and investing for the long term, such that it does not have regular and unpredictable redemption obligations towards its shareholder, also noting that the Fund's shareholder is the listed and regulated securitisation vehicle Reinet Investments S.C.A. which has its ordinary shares listed and traded on three regulated stock exchanges.

Upon shareholder approval, the investment guidelines and the investment objective and policy which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company and subsequently amended in 2012 will automatically be updated and the Fund will submit its amended prospectus for approval to the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, the Luxembourg financial services regulator. 

It is anticipated that the shareholders' meeting will be held on 24 January 2020 to consider the revisions to the Prospectus.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") - EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE


The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.19000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 27 August 2019 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018 in respect of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. 

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend is ZAR 17.04250 : Euro 1. This exchange rate is determined on 20 August 2019. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per Reinet South African Share is 259.04600 ZAR cents, as set out in the table below:

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. ANNOUNCES SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME

Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the ""Company"") announces today the commencement of a third share buyback programme. Under the programme, commencing on 19 June 2019, the Company intends to purchase shares at market price for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 44 million subject to a maximum of 2.75 million shares over a period ending 23 August 2019 at the latest.

The purpose of the programme is to return value to the shareholders of the Company. Shares repurchased under the programme may be used for any legitimate purpose, such as consideration for acquisitions.

The programme will be executed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by an intermediary. The Company will not at any time have the right to instruct the intermediary to amend the parameters of the repurchase programme allowing the intermediary to execute share repurchases in the market during both open and closed periods.

The programme will be executed within the limits of the existing authority granted by the Company's shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 28 August 2018, including but not limited to the current limitation that the repurchase price must be at a price no more than an amount equal to 110% of the reference price of the ordinary shares on the relevant exchange; the reference price being the weighted average price of such ordinary shares during the five days of trading immediately prior to the acquisition of such shares. In addition, buybacks will not be at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Purchases under the programme shall not on any trading day on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""trading days"") exceed 25% of the average daily volume of the shares traded during the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase.

Concurrently, the Rupert family has declared its intention not to sell any shares during the duration of this programme.

The Company will publish regular updates relating to the programme and a further announcement on completion or expiration of the programme, all of which will also be available at www.reinet.com/investor-relations/company-announcements.html

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") - DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE


The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.19 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 27 August 2019 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends, which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018 in respect of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday, 20 August 2019.

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the Reinet South African Shares is anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""       Tuesday, 27 August 2019

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from

payment date                            Wednesday, 4 September 2019

No cross-border movements of Reinet ordinary shares will be permitted between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch and Luxembourgish stock exchanges (Euroclear Nederland, Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) and the clearing and settlement system for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Strate) between Tuesday, 27 August 2019 and Friday, 30 August 2019, both days inclusive, and no Reinet South African Shares may be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 28 August 2019 and Friday, 30 August 2019, both days inclusive.

Note to former holders of certificated depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares (""Certificated DRs""):

Upon the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme in December 2017, the holdings of former holders of Certificated DRs were dematerialised through Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited reflecting Reinet South African Shares in dematerialised form in a valid account with a CSDP or broker as specified by the former holder of Certificated DRs, or, in the absence of such specification, in a nominee account for the benefit of the former holders of Certificated DRs, if and to the extent that they held 10 or more depository receipts. Former holders of Certificated DRs that have not specified a valid account with a CSDP or broker at the time of the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme are advised to regularise their accounts with their CSDP by contacting Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited to surrender their certificates and to obtain assistance and information on the process they must follow in order to regularise their holdings and to ensure their bank mandates are up to date.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTARY
 
Dear Shareholder,
 
Overview
Since inception, Reinet has invested some EUR 2.4 billion and generated an 8 per cent annual return for its investors based on the listed share price, with the underlying net asset value increasing at a rate of 10 per cent per annum.
 
At the annual general meeting in August 2018, shareholders gave their approval for Reinet to buy back up to 20 per cent of its own shares. Reinet subsequently initiated two share buyback programmes. The first ran from November 2018 to January 2019 when 3.2 million ordinary shares were repurchased for a cost of EUR 42 million or EUR 13.11 per share. The second programme commenced in February 2019; this programme aims to repurchase up to 5 million shares for a maximum cost of EUR 75 million. As at 31 March 2019, 1.8 million ordinary shares had been repurchased for a cost of EUR 26 million or EUR 14.28 per share. The adjusted net asset value per share stands at EUR 25.56 on 31 March 2019.
 
At 31 March 2019, the Company's net asset value amounted to EUR 4.8 billion, a decrease of EUR 297 million or 5.8 per cent compared to a year ago. This predominantly reflects the decrease in the share price of British American Tobacco from GBP 41.31 at 31 March 2018 to GBP 31.94 at 31 March 2019 which had a negative impact of EUR 674 million. The Company also spent EUR 68 million as part of the share buyback programmes up to the end of March 2019. Offsetting these decreases is an increase in the value of Pension Corporation of EUR 175 million, dividends received and receivable of EUR 148 million from British American Tobacco, together with the positive impact of the strengthening of the US dollar and sterling against the euro during the year.

Business developments
In the year under review, Reinet made investment commitments of EUR 223 million and invested a total of EUR 250 million in new and existing portfolio assets. Investments made include a new investment in Grab Holdings, a Singapore based technology company offering ride-hailing transport services, food delivery and payment solutions in Southeast Asia, of EUR 43 million. Reinet also supported the launch of the Prescient China Equity fund with a EUR 44 million investment, together with further amounts invested in support of our existing relationships with EUR 56 million to the Trilantic funds, EUR 22 million to Snow Phipps' third fund and our related co-investments and EUR 57 million to RLG Real Estate Partners.

The investment in British American Tobacco represented some 52.2 per cent of Reinet's net asset value at 31 March 2019, compared to 62.4 per cent a year ago. British American Tobacco continued its strong underlying performance, with Reynolds American, Inc. now fully included for the first full year. However, the market still reflects uncertainty in respect of the impact of the changes the industry is going through and anticipated regulatory developments. We are confident that British American Tobacco remains an attractive long-term investment and that the current industry challenges will be appropriately managed.

The investment in Pension Corporation represented some 30.6 per cent of Reinet's net asset value at 31 March 2019, compared to 25.4 per cent a year ago. Pension Corporation continues to perform well, writing some GBP 7.1 billion of new business in 2018 compared to GBP 3.7 billion in 2017, with its embedded value increasing from GBP 2.9 billion to GBP 3.6 billion, assets under management increasing from GBP 25.7 billion to GBP 31.4 billion and with a solvency ratio of 167 per cent at the end of 2018. The outlook remains positive for Pension Corporation as it is very well placed to compete for the ever-increasing pipeline of business coming to market in the UK. New business volume in 2019 to date has remained strong.

Last year I commented on our focus of investing to achieve long-term growth in net asset value in an increasingly more volatile global context. We will continue to invest in and support our portfolio of assets whilst looking to realise value from those smaller investments where the time and money spent is disproportionate to their ability to make a meaningful long-term impact on the net asset value.

Reinet remains committed to provide shareholders with an investment vehicle which will manage their funds in a conservative manner whilst aiming to achieve growth over the long-term. General rising risk levels and uncertainty require us to place great emphasis on long-term outcomes and on investing in and supporting our portfolio where further funding may be required to reach their full potential.

Dividend
The Board of Directors of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes a dividend of EUR 0.19 per share, payable in September 2019. This represents an increase of 5.6 per cent over the dividend paid last year.

Changes to the board of overseers
Following the retirement of Mr Denis Falck from the Board of Overseers at the 2018 annual general meeting, the shareholders approved the appointment of Mr Stuart Robertson with effect from 1 October 2018. Mr Robertson is a Chartered Accountant and a former partner at KPMG based in Zurich.

Outlook
With rising debt levels, global uncertainty and political divisions in both the USA and Europe, finding good opportunities for investment can be a challenge and protecting the downside becomes more important.
 
In times of uncertainty, Reinet's approach is to maintain value for its shareholders over the long-term. Our focus will remain on businesses that we understand and business partners that we know and trust. In addition, the buyback programme allows Reinet to repurchase shares at prices substantially below the intrinsic value of the underlying assets.
 
Reinet's Directors, Overseers and employees have continued to provide valuable support over the year, I thank them all for their commitment to Reinet's future development.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The net asset value ('NAV') of the Company comprises total assets less total liabilities, and equates to total equity under International Financial Reporting Standards. The decrease in the NAV of EUR 297 million during the year reflects the decrease in the fair value of certain investments, including British American Tobacco p.l.c. Offsetting these decreases in value are dividends received and receivable from British American Tobacco p.l.c. and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited and derivative assets. The Company also funded the purchase of its own ordinary shares through two approved buyback programmes.
 
The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the strengthening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro, offset by the weakening of the South African rand against the euro has resulted in an overall increase in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying the current year-end exchange rates to the March 2018 assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in the March 2018 NAV of some EUR 168 million.
 
SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME
On 19 November 2018, the Company announced the commencement of a share buyback programme in respect of a maximum of 3.2 million ordinary shares for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 55 million. The programme ran from November 2018 to January 2019 when 3.2 million ordinary shares were repurchased for a cost of EUR 42 million, plus transaction costs.
 
On 6 February 2019, the Company announced the commencement of a second share buyback programme in respect of a maximum of 5 million ordinary shares for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 75 million closing on 31 May 2019. At 31 March 2019, 1.8 million ordinary shares have been repurchased for a cost of EUR 26 million, plus transaction costs.
 
All ordinary shares repurchased are held as treasury shares.
 
In accordance with IAS 32 paragraph 23, a liability of EUR 49 million has been recorded in respect of the maximum potential amount still to be paid in order to complete the current programme. Should the programme complete at current share price levels, the remaining consideration will be less than the liability provided for.
 
NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE
The NAV per share and the adjusted NAV per share are calculated by dividing the NAV and adjusted NAV respectively by the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 190 919 614. The adjusted NAV is calculated by reversing the liability in respect of future repurchases of shares of EUR 49 million. The adjusted NAV is considered relevant as it eliminates the timing difference between the additional liability recorded for future share repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased as at 31 March 2019.

INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders.
 
Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2.4 billion and at 31 March 2019 has committed to provide further funding of EUR 430 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below. New commitments during the year under review amounted to EUR 223 million, and a total of EUR 250 million was funded during the year.
 
LISTED INVESTMENTS
 
BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Richard Burrows, Chairman of BAT and Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive of BAT, writing in its annual report for 2018 commented:
 
'Our 2018 results demonstrate not only that our combustible business is in good shape, but that our investment in a multi-category approach to our potentially reduced risk-product business is starting to pay off with encouraging results across all categories.
 
2018 reported revenue and profit from operations are up 25 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, and while this is of course due primarily to our first full year's inclusion of results from the US, we have nonetheless again exceeded our target of high single figure adjusted diluted constant currency EPS growth with an increase of 11.8 per cent.
 
While the business is continuing to perform well, it is impossible for us to ignore investor sentiment, which has been negatively impacted by the regulatory threats in the US and competitor dynamics in the potentially reduced-risk product categories. However, we are confident that our strategy of continuing to deliver shareholder returns today while investing in the future remains the right one.
 
FDA regulatory proposals have driven some uncertainty in the US operating environment, our long track record of success in the face of regulatory change and our strong portfolio of brands give us confidence that we will be able to manage these issues. We are additionally reassured by the fact that, in order to withstand judicial review, any regulation of menthol in cigarettes must be developed through a comprehensive rule-making process, be based on a thorough scientific review and consider all unintended consequences.
 
Our Chief Executive, Nicandro Durante, retires at the beginning of April 2019. During his eight years in the role he has grown the business substantially, delivering consistent and strong growth in both earnings and dividends.
 
We would like to welcome Jack Bowles, our current CEO Designate, to the role of Chief Executive effective 1 April 2019. The Board was delighted to have been able to appoint such an experienced and dynamic successor from within BAT.'
 
During the year under review, dividend income recorded from BAT amounted to EUR 148 million (GBP 131 million), being BAT's second, third and fourth 2018 quarterly dividends, together with the first 2019 quarterly dividend of some EUR 40 million (GBP 35 million) with a record date of 22 March 2019. The first 2019 quarterly dividend will be paid on 8 May 2019 and has been included in the NAV as at 31 March 2019, due to the record date falling in the financial year.
 
Reinet sold some 44 thousand BAT shares in the year under review for total proceeds of some EUR 1 million (GBP 1 million) and thus holds 68.0 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.96 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 2 523 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 3 198 million), being some 52.2 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 41.31 at 31 March 2018 to GBP 31.94 at 31 March 2019.
 
BAT continues to perform well with the first full year of results from Reynolds American, Inc. contributing to the strong financial results in the year. However, the market still has concerns in respect of the impact of changes in the industry and of regulatory developments. We are confident that British American Tobacco remains an attractive long-term investment and that the current industry challenges will be appropriately managed.
 
In its 2018 annual report, BAT reports that it performs a periodic reassessment of the risks faced as a consequence of the UK's decision to exit the EU (Brexit), including potential risks relating to increased costs of capital, transactional and translational foreign exchange rate exposures, supply chain continuity, taxation and changes in customs duty, and talent acquisition and retention.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

(the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the net asset value of investment funds, discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples, as appropriate. The third-party valuation reports and key assumptions used within these reports are reviewed by the external auditors.

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc ('Pension Insurance Corporation'), is a specialist insurer of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides secure and stable retirement income for its policyholders through market-leading customer service, comprehensive risk management and excellence in asset and liability management.

In 2018, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension business with premiums of GBP 7.1 billion as a result of 30 new business transactions completed during the year, up from GBP 3.7 billion in 2017 which represented 20 transactions. New business transactions in 2018 include BHS (GBP 800 million of liabilities), Siemens (GBP 1.3 billion of liabilities) and Rentokil (GBP 1.5 billion of liabilities). The new business activity was supported by internal capital resources and GBP 350 million of debt raised in September 2018.

At 31 December 2018, Pension Insurance Corporation held GBP 31.4 billion in assets (31 December 2017: GBP 25.7 billion) and had insured more than 192 000 pension fund members (31 December 2017: 151 000). Clients include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals and the public sector.

Tracy Blackwell, Chief Executive Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation commented:
'In what was the 10th anniversary year of our first transaction, signed in the summer of 2008, Pension Corporation completed a record GBP 7.1 billion of new business premiums.

The overall value of the business, as measured under Market Consistent Embedded Value ('MCEV') methodology, was GBP 3 638 million (2017: GBP 2 932 million) at year-end, an increase of 24 per cent in the year. The Group's IFRS profit before tax was GBP 477 million (2017:  GBP 383 million), an increase of 25 per cent in the year. The investment portfolio was GBP 31.4 billion (2017: GBP 25.7 billion), reflecting strong new business flows, payments to existing policyholders and market movements. Finally, the solvency ratio of the Group's main subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation, was 167 per cent at 31 December 2018, particularly pleasing given the amount of new business we wrote.

New business levels were partly backed with a record GBP 2.5 billion invested in secure long-term assets on a private basis, such as social housing, renewable energy and the university sector. We also reinsured GBP 5.6 billion of longevity risk, a record amount, and our pool of highly rated reinsurance counterparties now stands at eleven. In total, Pension Insurance Corporation has now reinsured 74 per cent of total longevity risk (2017: 73 per cent).

Our purpose is straightforward to define: it is to pay the pensions of our current and future policyholders. Our business has therefore been built on an absolute focus on our policyholders and the standard of customer service they receive, so we were delighted to win another award for this from the Institute of Customer Service. We were also proud to be named an 'Outstanding Employer of the Year'.

In the current period, Reinet acquired additional shares from other Pension Corporation shareholders for an amount of GBP 6.3 million. As a result, Reinet owns 43.72 per cent of Pension Corporation, up from 43.45 per cent at 31 March 2018.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 480 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 1 305 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation's audited embedded value at 31 December 2018 of GBP 3.6 billion (31 December 2017: GBP 2.9 billion), valuation multiples drawn from industry data and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.
The increase in estimated fair value over the year is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects primarily new business written in the year together with the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the year. This is offset by an 11 per cent decrease in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information of listed peer-group companies in the UK insurance sector.

Pension Insurance Corporation continues to pursue new business opportunities with over GBP 1.6 billion of liabilities insured to date in 2019 and a strong pipeline of new business opportunities.

Pension Insurance Corporation has considered the risks associated with the UK leaving the EU ('Brexit') and the potential impact that this may have on its business model and policyholders. This includes scenario assessments to assess whether appropriate controls are in place to ensure that contractual relationships with various stakeholders continue to operate as intended post Brexit - including the ability to pay policyholders, relationships with banking and reinsurance counterparties and legislation around data security. Scenarios have also been performed considering potential macro-economic impacts to ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate the potential balance sheet impacts of market movements in a worst-case Brexit scenario on its solvency and liquidity position.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
Where Reinet invests in funds managed by third parties its philosophy is to partner with the managers of such funds and to share in fees generated by funds under management. This is the case with funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners, 36 South Capital Advisors, Milestone Capital, Prescient Investment Management China and Vanterra Capital. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the 'Investment Advisory Agreement'), entered into by the Fund Manager and Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'), Reinet pays no management fee to the Investment Advisor on such investments except in the case where no fee or a reduced fee below 1 per cent is paid to the third-party manager. In such cases, the aggregate fee payable to the Investment Advisor and the third-party manager is capped at 1 per cent.

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners ('Trilantic') is composed of Trilantic North America and Trilantic Europe, two separate and independent private equity investment advisors focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in their respective geographies. Trilantic North America primarily targets investments in the business services, consumer and energy sectors, and currently manages five funds. Trilantic Europe primarily targets investments in the industrials, consumer and leisure, telecommunication, media and technology, business services and healthcare sectors, and currently manages two funds.

Reinet and its minority partner invest in certain of the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together 'Trilantic Management'). Reinet and its minority partner, through Reinet TCP Holdings Limited, invest in two of the current funds under Trilantic's management. Reinet also directly invests in four additional funds under Trilantic's management. The terms of investment applicable to Reinet's investment in the Trilantic funds provide that Reinet will not pay any management fees or carried interest. In addition, Reinet receives a share of the carried interest payable on the realisation of investments held in the funds, once a hurdle rate has been achieved.

Reinet TCP Holdings Limited invests in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P., these funds are in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the year under review, distributions of some EUR 4 million were received (31 March 2018: EUR 21 million).

Reinet invests in Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. and Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., which both completed their investment period in June 2018 with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 8 million and receiving distributions of some EUR 32 million in the year under review. These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. being especially focused on the oil and gas sector.

During the year under review, Reinet also committed EUR 15 million (USD 17 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner, and EUR 86 million (USD 96 million) to Trilantic Capital Partners VI North America ('Fund VI') and its general partner. TEP II completed its fund raising in 2018 with total commitments of EUR 389 million (USD 437 million), Fund VI currently has commitments of EUR 2.3 billion (USD 2.5 billion) and expects to close its fund raising in mid 2019. Reinet's commitments amount to EUR 39 million (USD 44 million) and EUR 228 million (USD 256 million) respectively.

Charlie Ayres, Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners, commented:

'On 14 December 2018, we held subsequent closings with total capital commitments of USD 2.5 billion for Fund VI North America and USD 437 million for TEP II North America. On 3 December 2018, the LP Advisory Committee of Fund VI North America approved a six-month extension period for the fund. We are working with a discreet handful of investors, which have completed most, if not all, of their due diligence. Fund VI North America has closed on three investments to date and TEP II North America has closed on two investments to date. We appreciate the strong support received from our existing investors and welcome our new investors to the Trilantic North America family.

The US economy expanded by 2.9 per cent in 2018, after having posted growth rates of 2.2 per cent and 1.6 per cent in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are not convinced that the US economy can sustain accelerated growth for a third year in a row in 2019, but we do believe that it will stay above 2 per cent. Important economic indicators are showing, among other things, strong consumer confidence, a reasonable expectation of job creation and wage growth, better labour force participation and moderate inflation.

In April 2019, we celebrate our 10th anniversary as an independent firm having closed our management buy-out transaction from Lehman Brothers.

In conclusion, patience and flexibility remain essential in our deployment of capital, whether in new transactions or follow-on capital for existing portfolio companies. Over the past year and half, we have been 'net sellers' and 'cautious buyers' (with 10 significant realisations against five new portfolio investments), but we believe the pendulum has begun to swing back closer to neutrality. This bodes well for our substantial dry powder, but we will continue adhering to our investment discipline, which we believe has been critical in protecting capital, enhancing value and maximising risk-adjusted returns.'


Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, Chairman of Trilantic Europe, commented:

'2018 began with very strong GDP growth of 3 per cent in the EU. The year ended with full year actual growth of 0.8 per cent with member states such as Germany and Italy delivering around zero growth in Q4 2018. There are a number of factors to which the slowdown has been attributed. Policy change in the US caused a slowdown in global trade while political changes in Italy and Germany and unrest in France reduced investment appetite. Trilantic Europe anticipates EU GDP will continue to grow at a modest pace of around 1 per cent in 2019. Given a continued improvement in employment rates across the EU, combined with low wage pressure, the EU macroeconomic backdrop is, while unexciting, relatively sound.

The defining event in 2019 that will set the tone for European growth are the forthcoming elections of the EU delegates and presidents who will potentially shape a more divisive or cohesive set of economic policies. Against this European macroeconomic backdrop Trilantic Europe's portfolio, highly diversified by sector as well as geography, has performed well during 2018 and is forecasting further growth in 2019 based on the specific themes and attributes of each portfolio company. While providing support to our portfolio companies in the execution of their growth plans, Trilantic Europe will also continue its 15-year consistent top-down strategy of searching for value across the five sectors and geographies we cover.'

Reinet's investment in Trilantic Management and the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 216 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 180 million) of which EUR 4 million (31 March 2018: EUR 7 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2018 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to net capital contributions of EUR 29 million, the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments.

During the year under review, gains of EUR 11 million were realised and carried interest of EUR 16 million was received.

36 SOUTH MACRO/VOLATILITY FUNDS
36 South Capital Advisors LLP ('36 South') is an absolute return fund manager that specialises in managing global macro/volatility funds. 36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes.  Its global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments but to substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility.

Reinet has co-invested with the 36 South management team in the fund management and distribution companies. Reinet is also an investor in the following 36 South funds:

The Lesedi Fund; a positive-carry, long-volatility strategy with a primary focus of generating yield in 'normal markets', whilst retaining the potential to deliver larger positive returns in extreme market events. The fund invests in options that are expected to result in a positive return if the spot price remains the same, if volatility increases, and/or if there is a favourable movement of the price of the underlying asset. The current low interest and low volatility environment provides multiple opportunities for the fund to invest in such positions globally in equities, currencies, commodities and interest rates and in both bullish and bearish positions.
The Kohinoor Core Fund; a global macro/long volatility strategy which aims to achieve significant returns with commensurate risk over a medium-to long term investment period. It is designed to generate performance in a variety of market environments as the fund managers have extensive experience in identifying mis-valued assets whilst maintaining a mix of bullish and bearish positions. The fund invests up to 95 per cent in options and is a more concentrated version of the highly successful Kohinoor Series Funds.

Richard Haworth, Chief Executive Officer of 36 South, commented:

'36 South is a world recognised leader in the management of funds which look to outperform in times of extreme systemic events and the accompanying volatility.

Last year we saw sporadic outbreaks of idiosyncratic volatility in asset markets. However, they lacked the persistence and contagion normally associated with systemic events so any performance was not substantially realised. The price of volatility assets in general remains low, primary drivers being low interest rates and the willingness of Central Banks to inject liquidity into the markets at the first sign of stress.

Relatively becalmed markets and low volatility lead to disappointing Fund performances. However, notwithstanding this, the firm received significant new inflows as investors become increasingly nervous of the fragility of the financial markets.

36 South is looking to consolidate its position as a leader in this space and believes that it is well positioned to grow its AUM inorganically as investors become increasingly aware of the need to diversify their portfolio and have funds like ours in their mix as not only a diversifier but as a tail hedge. If crises are inevitable it is only a matter of time before global volatility has a regime change which should significantly organically grow the AUM as well.'

The investment in the funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 26 million, based on unaudited financial information received from the fund manager as at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 34 million). The estimated fair value of the investment in the fund management and distribution companies amounted to EUR 6 million (31 March 2018: EUR 6 million). The investments in total have an estimated fair value of EUR 32 million (31 March 2018: EUR 40 million). The change in valuation reflects the movement in the value of the underlying investments held by the funds.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS
Milestone China Opportunities funds, investment holdings and management company participation
Reinet has invested along with Milestone Capital in a management company based in Shanghai, and has also invested in certain funds and investment companies managed by Milestone Capital (together 'Milestone').

Milestone Capital has a strong track record in helping portfolio companies scale their operations and be listed on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges. Funds under management invest primarily in domestic Chinese high-growth companies seeking expansion or acquisition capital. Milestone funds seek to maximise medium- to long-term capital appreciation by making direct investments to acquire minority or majority equity stakes in those companies identified by Milestone's investment team. Current areas of investment include: restaurants; biopharmaceutical manufacturers; medical device manufacturers; food and beverage distribution; brands covering sportswear and apparel; big data services; e-commerce; power generation equipment; retail pharmacies and online education.

Yunli Lou, Managing Partner of Milestone Capital, commented:

'During 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, Milestone continued working closely with our portfolio companies to drive operational excellence and help with various strategic initiatives. Among our active portfolio companies, one leading e-commerce platform for beauty products completed a restructuring and fundraising based on a significantly higher company valuation than that in previous investment rounds when Milestone made its investment, one oncology-focused biotech company was successfully dual-listed on the NASDAQ in addition to the Taipei Exchange's Mainboard, and one big data service provider and one leading online education company completed new rounds of financing. Moreover, we also strived to achieve liquidity and realise returns for our investors. We had a partial realisation from our investment in a leading Chinese sportswear company by selling shares through the open market on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and received total proceeds that covered our investment cost in the company while preserving great upside value in our remaining stake.

2018 was a turbulent year in terms of global geopolitics, US-China relations, China internal economic challenges, as well as the Chinese domestic capital markets. While the Chinese economy struggled to find ways to transition from low-cost manufacturing, export-oriented economy, to innovation-based, consumption-led economy, the government continued its effort to crack down on corruption, tightened lending standards, and efforts to cool real estate prices and overseas investments. All these efforts led to lowered confidence levels and lowered investments and capital expenditure from both the public and private sectors. The domestic capital markets declined further for the year, with the Shanghai Composite Index declining 25.5 per cent and the Shenzhen Composite Index declining 33.9 per cent. The domestic stock market has wiped out USD 4.0 trillion of wealth since it reached the peak in 2015. For the full year 2018, the government reported a GDP growth of 6.6 per cent, the slowest pace since 2009. However, the absolute amount of GDP growth in dollar terms was the largest in China's history, reaching USD 1.2 trillion, or the equivalent of adding a Mexico, the 15th largest economy in the world. We believe the current uncertain environment and adjustments in the Chinese economy are healthy and will lay the foundation for the next stage of development.'

The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of EUR 82 million (31 March 2018: EUR 129 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2018 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2019.

The change in estimated fair value reflects capital repayments of EUR 47 million, offset by capital contributions, the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and increases in the value of listed investments. The capital repayments were made in the form of a distribution of existing holdings of shares in Soho and Li Ning with fair values of EUR 16 million and EUR 31 million respectively, these shares are now included in 'Other listed investments' and are shown above.

Prescient China funds and investment management company
Reinet invests in the Prescient China Balanced Fund, the Prescient China Equity Fund and the management company.

Prescient China Balanced Fund invests in equities, bonds, cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. It invests principally in instruments listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.

The Prescient China Equity Fund was launched in October 2018. The fund uses a systematic, quantitative approach to seek long term capital growth by investing primarily in China 'A' shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges by virtue of Prescient's Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor status granted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Both funds are managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited, a South African-listed fund manager, with the team based in Shanghai.

Liang Du, Portfolio Manager of Prescient China, commented:

'Over the past financial year the Prescient China Balanced Fund was down 1.7 per cent in US dollar terms compared to the Chinese market falling by 5.5 per cent. The Chinese market was tumultuous over the past year, with the market falling by almost 30 per cent towards the end of 2018 before recovering strongly in the first quarter of 2019. For most of 2018, fears of an escalating trade war between China and the US, a slowing economy, as well as a massive shadow banking clampdown resulted in the equity market turning very negative, bringing valuations near historic lows in China. Although hard economic numbers have failed to improve (yet) in the first quarter of 2019, a relaxation of shadow banking limits, a recovering property market, an increase in the MSCI index inclusion factor and a general improvement in sentiment all contributed to a very strong first quarter.  Our own models are currently bullish on the Chinese market, with cheap valuations, positive sentiment as well as supportive policies, the Balanced Fund is currently overweight in Chinese equities.

We also launched the Prescient China Equity Fund at the end of October 2018 during the turmoil. The Equity Fund has had a great start rising by 28 per cent since its launch. The Chinese market is of course not without its risks, should the economy slow meaningfully from here, or the global economy go into a recession, we will adjust our positioning accordingly.'

In October 2018, Reinet invested EUR 44 million (USD 50 million) in the Prescient China Equity Fund.

Reinet's total investment is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 110 million based on unaudited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 48 million). The increase in estimated fair value over the year under review is the result of the additional investment, together with increases in the value of underlying listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 23 million at 31 March 2019, based on audited financial information as at 31 December 2018, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2018: EUR 24 million).

NanoDimension funds and co-investment opportunities
Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension I, II and III limited partnerships.  The focus of each fund is to invest in and support the establishment, technology development and scale up, growth and commercialisation of companies leveraging the advancement of new atomic and molecular structures. Product applications range from molecular diagnostics, immuno-oncology, immuno-tolerance, organs on chip, DNA synthesis and energy storage.

Aymeric Sallin, Founder of NanoDimension Management Ltd, commented:

'2018 was a transformative year for the three NanoDimension funds. For NanoDimension I there were some important events that took place as we work towards winding up in the next two years. NanoDimension II increased in value from USD 100 million to USD 219 million, with over USD 120 million in realised value giving us the opportunity to return almost the entire capital called. A major driver was ARMO which completed one of the most successful IPOs of 2018. The 14 remaining companies have exciting potential. NanoDimension III has successfully raised approximately USD 350 million and is off to a solid start with seven investments made. We have also extended our operation in Europe based on the campus of EPFL, Switzerland.

Twist had a successful IPO on 31 October 2018, and we believe Click, Inscripta, and Orca are on exciting trajectories. These companies have tremendous potential and illustrate our mission at NanoDimension to invest in companies developing transformational technologies in, and at the convergence of physical sciences and life sciences. Advancements in semiconductors, lasers, microfluidics, computation, and data analysis are enabling a better understanding of biology, more personalised manufacturing to help realise the potential of personalised medicine, and true point-of-care diagnostics.'

Reinet's co-investment in Twist has been reclassified as a listed investment following the initial public offering in October 2018.

During the current year, Reinet sold its remaining unlisted co-investment for EUR 20 million (USD 22 million), realising a gain of EUR 5 million (USD 6 million) in the year and an overall loss of EUR 3 million (USD 4 million).

At 31 March 2019, the estimated fair value of Reinet's investment in the three funds amounted to EUR 26 million (31 March 2018: EUR 32 million for the three funds). The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 31 December 2018. The decrease in estimated fair value reflects capital distributions received of EUR 17 million, offset by capital contributions made, increases in the value of underlying investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Further information on NanoDimension is available at www.nanodimension.com.

Fountainhead Expert Fund
The Fountainhead Expert Fund was liquidated in December 2018 with proceeds of EUR 13 million (USD 15 million) being received by Reinet.

The original investment in the fund was EUR 15 million (USD 20 million). At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 17 million (USD 21 million); the decrease in value reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments during the period up to the liquidation date.

Snow Phipps funds and co-investment opportunities
Snow Phipps Group ('Snow Phipps') is a private equity firm focused on lower middle-market control investments. Snow Phipps seeks to invest USD 50 million to USD 150 million of equity in market-leading companies primarily headquartered in North America with enterprise values between USD 100 million and USD 500 million. Snow Phipps implements a strategy of creating long-term capital appreciation through active operational management of its portfolio companies. By utilising its engaged operational approach, Snow Phipps is able to execute transactions involving corporate carve-outs, generational and management change, and add-on acquisition strategies. Snow Phipps primarily targets investments in the industrial, consumer and business services sectors, and currently manages three private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments of USD 2.4 billion.

Reinet invests as a limited partner in Snow Phipps II, L.P., Snow Phipps III, L.P. and in five co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P.

Ian K. Snow, CEO and Partner of Snow Phipps, commented:

'Since our founding in 2005, Snow Phipps has consistently followed the same operationally focused strategy of investing in lower middle-market companies with attractive organic and acquisition-driven growth dynamics and defensible market positions. In our latest fund, Snow Phipps III, L.P., we continue with our successful approach of partnering with dedicated senior executives (our Operating Partners) and strong management teams to deliver highly attractive returns for investors.

In 2018, we continued to execute this investment strategy in Snow Phipps III, despite a highly competitive and highly priced deal-making environment. We completed one new platform investment as well as five strategic and complementary add-on acquisitions. In September 2018, Snow Phipps III acquired BlackHawk Industrial, a leading distributor of metalworking and industrial MRO products serving over 6 000 customers in North America. We also had a successful exit in the fund in 2018, selling Winchester Interconnect to Aptiv PLC, and we have returned over USD 245 million to Snow Phipps III investors. In addition, for Snow Phipps II, L.P., we completed one add-on acquisition during 2018, and we returned more than USD 35 million from one investment. In 2018, we deployed over USD 120 million in Snow Phipps II and Snow Phipps III equity commitments combined. We continue to build value in the current Snow Phipps portfolio.'

During the year under review, an investment (held both through Snow Phipps III, L.P. and as a co-investment) was sold for EUR 47 million (USD 54 million), realising a gain of EUR 31 million (USD 35 million).

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 105 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 90 million). The increase in the estimated fair value being due to additional capital contributed of EUR 26 million (USD 29 million) invested in two new co-investment opportunities alongside the funds, an increase in the estimated fair value of underlying investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year, offset by the distribution noted above.

Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund
The Palm Lane Credit Opportunity Fund was liquidated in the year under review with proceeds of EUR 92 million (USD 107 million) being received by Reinet.

The original investment in the fund was EUR 54 million (USD 70 million). At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 85 million (USD 105 million); the increase in value reflects increases in the value of underlying investments during the period up to the liquidation date.

Reinet realised an overall gain of EUR 32 million (USD 37 million) in respect of this investment.

GAM Real Estate Finance Fund
The GAM Real Estate Finance Fund ('REFF') was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its investment strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with primary focus on the UK. At December 2018, REFF held 9 investments.

Andrew Gordon and Martin Farinola, Investment Directors GAM, commented:

'The Real Estate Finance Fund invested in a diversified portfolio of 25 self-originated, private loans secured by commercial and residential real estate in the UK, Ireland and Belgium. The fund's investment objectives are to generate an attractive dividend yield while protecting against a material, downward adjustment in real estate values. The fund continued to pay dividends at or above the target rate during 2018 and, as at the end of 2018, 16 investments had been fully realised. One further investment has been fully realised following the year-end.

UK real estate values have remained relatively stable in spite of the slowing UK economy. Uncertainty around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will continue to weigh on the UK economy, however the real estate market has shown some strong, albeit isolated, areas of growth.'

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 37 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 53 million) based on audited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2018.

The decrease in estimated fair value is mainly due to repayments of capital in the year, mostly owing to early settlement of loans, offset by the strengthening of sterling against the euro.

Other fund investments
This includes small, specialist funds investing in private equity businesses, property and start-up ventures.

Other fund investments are valued in total at their estimated fair value of EUR 90 million at 31 March 2019 based on valuation statements received from the fund managers (31 March 2018: EUR 16 million).

Included in this section is a limited partner investment in RLG Real Estate Partners L.P. ('RLG'), a property fund which is managed by a subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA. RLG invests in and develops real estate properties, including luxury brand retail developments situated in prime locations throughout the world.

Reinet's investment in RLG is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 81 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 6 million). The movement in value is due to additional capital invested in the period of EUR 57 million, together with an increase in the underlying property value of EUR 18 million.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
Reinet has invested in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has previously invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets. These assets were held by Arendale Holdings Corp.

Bill Lanius, Chief Executive Officer of Arendale Holdings Corp, commented:

'The United States land development and mortgages business is invested in numerous properties in the U.S, with a geographical concentration in the south-eastern region. Investments are held in two distinct portfolios. The ""Legacy"" portfolio primarily consists of residential communities located in growth-oriented suburban areas. Those home sites are developed by the Company and typically marketed to production homebuilders. The ""Arendale"" portfolio includes golf course communities where the purchase of real estate and club memberships are discretionary, lifestyle decisions of individual customers, as well as other residential communities.

The golf course-related real estate assets did not perform to the budgets prepared at the time the investments were made, and required more capital than anticipated. In February 2019, the sale of the largest such holding (Silver Sun Partners) was successfully completed.'

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 79 million as at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 83 million).

The current valuation is based on audited financial statements as at 31 December 2018 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2019. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects repayments received during the year, offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

The investment in Silver Sun Partners (residential golf communities and adjacent land held for sale to future homeowners) was sold in a single transaction in the current year; the estimated fair value of the investment had however been written down to zero by Reinet in previous years.

Further information on Arendale is available at www.arendale.com.

DIAMOND INTERESTS
Reinet has invested in two projects in South Africa. Firstly, in an entity which extracts diamonds from the waste tailings of mining operations which began over a century ago at Jagersfontein in South Africa.  Developments in extraction technology since Jagersfontein was first mined, now allow the waste tailings to be reprocessed to recover gemstones. In addition, Reinet has an interest in a separate project, which has acquired rights to mine diamonds on a previously unexploited site at Rooipoort near Kimberley in South Africa. Both entities are fully operational and continue to repay loans to Reinet.

Henk van Zuydam, Chief Financial Officer of both projects, commented:

'The South African rand has remained volatile during the past year which potentially plays a major factor in the revenue and profitability of the diamond business but is hedged to some degree. The rough diamond market overall has experienced some price stability, however we have continued to see high attendance and strong demand at sale tenders held both in South Africa and Antwerp.

During the last quarter Jagersfontein completed the construction phase and commenced with commissioning of a new section of the plant which is estimated to add some 30 per cent capacity to the volume of material that can be treated. This plant is designed to enable the processing of lower grade material more profitably.

Rooipoort continued to recover a higher than expected amount of carats in the current operational area. However, on average the USD/ct achieved remained lower than the projected average due to the lack of high quality diamonds that were recovered. The highlight find and sale of the year was a 40.44ct fancy intense yellow diamond.'

In total, these projects are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 46 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 39 million) based on discounted cash flow projections. The increase in estimated fair value mainly reflects the impact of a re-evaluation of the remaining life of each project, known as 'life of mine', offset by repayment of loans and interest in the year amounting to EUR 3 million, and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

Reinet has borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in these projects and entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2018: ZAR 230 million) in order to mitigate currency risk.

OTHER INVESTMENTS
Other investments are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 67 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 59 million). The increase in the estimated fair value of other investments relates mostly to additional capital invested and the strengthening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the year.

There were no other significant changes in value in respect of other investments, either as a result of movements in the valuation of underlying investments, further amounts invested or returns of capital.

COMMITTED FUNDS
Funding commitments are entered into in various currencies including sterling, US dollar and South African rand and are converted into euro using 31 March 2019 exchange rates.

The table below summarises Reinet's outstanding investment commitments at 31 March 2019.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term commercial paper.
 
Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and at 31 March 2019 can be summarised as follows:
 
Cash and liquid funds EUR 360 m
Undrawn borrowing facility EUR 290 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above) (EUR 430 m)
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations (EUR 27 m)      

The undrawn borrowing facility comprises a revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A. of EUR 290 million (GBP 250 million) (see below).

Medium-term bank borrowings of EUR 635 million will be settled by the exercise of put options over BAT shares or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings or settled by available cash.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
BORROWINGS
In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America N.A., which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. At 31 March 2019, these facilities had not been drawn upon (31 March 2018: EUR nil).

During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 31 March 2019, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 581 million (GBP 500 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 561 million (GBP 493 million)). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the 'Premium Loan'). At 31 March 2019, the Premium Loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 54 million (GBP 46 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 70 million (GBP 61 million)). Some 4.4 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the Premium Loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium Loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 March 2019, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 27 million (31 March 2018: EUR 30 million); the decrease in the estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. This loan matures in March 2020.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) - OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 136 million at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 54 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares and the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the year, offset by the decrease in the time to maturity. The cost of the put options is considered as part of the overall cost of financing and is included in the fair value adjustment on outstanding contracts in the income statement below.

In the year under review, Reinet settled outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to ZAR 230 million realising a loss of EUR 0.4 million. Reinet then entered into a new forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2018: ZAR 230 million), which is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 1 million (liability) at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 2 million (liability)). The change in value reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 6 million (31 March 2018: EUR 7 million) and is in respect of a minority partner's share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 49 million being the maximum amount outstanding in respect of the current share buyback programme, an accrual of EUR 19 million in respect of the half-yearly management fee payable as at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR 23 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 7 million (31 March 2018: EUR 11 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 11 million (31 March 2018: EUR 28 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals, other payables and other receivables net to EUR nil (31 March 2018: EUR 1 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

Amounts payable are offset by other assets which comprise the BAT dividend receivable of EUR 40 million (31 March 2018: EUR 38 million) with a record date of 22 March 2019.

INCOME
Dividend income from BAT during the period amounted to EUR 148 million (GBP 130 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 208 million (GBP 180 million)). The movement is mainly due to BAT paying quarterly dividends in 2018 rather than interim and final dividends as in previous years. The dividends received from BAT during the year represent the second, third and fourth 2018 quarterly dividend paid and the first 2019 quarterly dividend declared in March 2019 and paid in May 2019.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits, investments and loans made to underlying investments. Included in other investment income are the foreign exchange movements on fees payable, other liabilities and other assets of EUR 8 million (loss) (31 March 2018: EUR 11 million (gain)).

Realised gains on investments of EUR 74 million were mainly in respect of realised gains of EUR 4 million on Li Ning, EUR 11 million on Trilantic, EUR 16 million on Milestone, EUR 12 million on NanoDimension, EUR 31 million on Snow Phipps, EUR 32 million on Palm Lane Credit Opportunity Fund, offset by realised losses of EUR 32 million on other investments.

Losses of EUR 0.4 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

Carried interest of EUR 16 million was attributable to Reinet in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

EXPENSES
The management fee for the year ended 31 March 2019 amounts to EUR 43 million (31 March 2018: EUR 51 million).

No performance fee is payable for the year ended 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2019, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods.

Operating expenses of EUR 9 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner'), EUR 3 million in respect of transaction fees, and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 5 million.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand-denominated borrowings.

The net tax income of EUR 16 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic, Snow Phipps and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.0 million BAT shares decreased in value by EUR 673 million during the year under review. Of this, EUR 741 million was attributable to the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms offset by EUR 68 million due to the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the year under review.

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 307 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 168 million, other listed investments of EUR 14 million, Trilantic funds of EUR 7 million, Prescient China funds and investment management company of EUR 20 million, United States land development and mortgages of EUR 6 million, Diamond interests of EUR 10 million and certain other investments. The above amounts include the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the strengthening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year under review.

The put options increased in value by EUR 82 million reflecting, in part, the decrease in value of BAT shares in the year and the strengthening of sterling against the euro. The estimated fair value of the forward exchange contracts liability decreased by EUR 1 million, reflecting the weakening of the South African rand against the euro.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates. An unrealised gain of EUR 3 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. An unrealised loss of EUR 21 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing, mainly due to the strengthening of sterling against the euro.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partner's shares in the earnings of Reinet TCP Holdings Limited.

DIVIDEND
The Company relies on distributions from Reinet Fund as its principal source of income from which it may pay dividends.

A cash dividend of EUR 0.18 per share totalling some EUR 35 million was paid in September 2018, following approval at the annual general meeting on 28 August 2018.

The General Partner has proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.19 per share subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 27 August 2019.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by the Company.

The Company has sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by and paid to holders of the Company's shares. SARS has confirmed that any such dividends will be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends will be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders unless those holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders will be required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further five years on 8 March 2018.

The dividend will be payable in accordance with the following schedule, subject to shareholder approval:

The last day to trade the Company's shares cum-dividend in Europe will be Wednesday, 28 August 2019 and in South Africa, Tuesday, 27 August 2019. The Company's shares will trade ex-dividend from Thursday, 29 August 2019 in Europe and from Wednesday, 28 August 2019 in South Africa. The record date for the Company's shares in Europe and in South Africa will be Friday, 30 August 2019.

The dividend on the Company's shares in Europe will be paid on Wednesday, 4 September 2019 and is payable in euro.

The dividend on the Company's shares in South Africa will be paid in South African rand on Wednesday, 4 September 2019. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 21 May 2019 on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service ('SENS').

No cross-border movements of Reinet ordinary shares will be permitted between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch and Luxembourgish stock exchanges (Euroclear Nederland, Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) and the clearing and settlement system for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Strate) between Tuesday, 27 August 2019 and Friday, 30 August 2019, both days inclusive.

Subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place on 27 August 2019, a dividend of EUR 0.19 per ordinary share will be paid to ordinary shareholders on 4 September 2019. The rand dividend amount per ordinary share will be calculated by reference to the euro/rand exchange rate prevailing on 20 August 2019, the currency conversion date.

The dividend paid in September 2018 amounted to ZAR 2.9861 per equivalent ordinary share, calculated as EUR 0.18 per ordinary share at an exchange rate of 16.5893. The proposed dividend of EUR 0.19 per ordinary share converted into rand at the current exchange rate of 16.10 amounts to ZAR 3.059, an effective increase of 2.4 per cent. This will be updated on 20 August 2019 with the actual exchange rate.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. ANNOUNCES EUR 75 MILLION SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME


Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the ""Company"") announces today the commencement of a second share buyback programme. Under the programme, commencing on 11 February 2019, the Company intends to purchase shares at market price for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 75 million subject to a maximum of 5 million shares over a period ending 31 May 2019 at the latest.

The purpose of the programme is to return value to the shareholders of the Company. Shares repurchased under the programme may be used for any legitimate purpose, such as consideration for acquisitions.

The programme will be executed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by an intermediary. The Company will not at any time have the right to instruct the intermediary to amend the parameters of the repurchase programme allowing the intermediary to execute share repurchases in the market during both open and closed periods.

The programme will be executed within the limits of the existing authority granted by the Company's shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 28 August 2018, including but not limited to the current limitation that the repurchase price must be at a price no more than an amount equal to 110% of the reference price of the ordinary shares on the relevant exchange; the reference price being the weighted average price of such ordinary shares during the five days of trading immediately prior to the acquisition of such shares. In addition, buybacks will not be at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Purchases under the programme shall not on any trading day on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""trading days"") exceed 25% of the average daily volume of the shares traded during the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase.

Concurrently, the Rupert family has declared its intention not to sell any shares during the duration of this programme.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The net asset value ('NAV') comprises total assets less total liabilities, and equates to total equity under IFRS. The decrease in the net asset value of EUR 944 million during the quarter is mainly due to the decrease in the share price of  British American Tobacco p.l.c., the decrease in the estimated fair value of Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited and the creation of a provision for the maximum cost of the buyback of the Company's ordinary shares. Offsetting these decreases in value are dividends received and receivable from British American Tobacco p.l.c. and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including an increase in the value of the derivative asset associated with the loan financing.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the fluctuation in value of other currencies against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current quarter end exchange rates to the September 2018 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 22 million. 

SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME
On 19 November 2018, the Company announced the commencement of a share buyback programme in respect of a maximum of 3.2 million ordinary shares for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 55 million. As of 31 December 2018, 2 087 441 ordinary shares have been repurchased at a cost of EUR 27.4 million and are held as treasury shares. In accordance with IAS 32 paragraph 23, a liability of EUR 27.6 million has been recorded in respect of the maximum potential amount still to be paid in order to complete the current programme. Should the programme complete at current share price levels, the remaining consideration will be less than the liability provided for.

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE
The adjusted net asset value per share of EUR 20.25 is calculated based on the NAV at 31 December 2018 reversing the liability in respect of future repurchases of shares of EUR 27.6 million, divided by the total number of shares outstanding (195 942 286) less the treasury shares held at 31 December 2018 (2 087 441).

INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. 

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2.4 billion and at 31 December 2018 committed to provide further funding of EUR 432 million to its current investments. New commitments during the quarter under review amounted to EUR 108 million.

Major items impacting the NAV, significant changes in carrying value and new investments during the quarter under review are described below.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity. 

During the quarter under review, dividend income recorded from BAT amounted to EUR 70 million (GBP 63 million), being BAT's third 2018 interim dividend of EUR 37 million (GBP 33 million), received in November 2018 together with the fourth interim dividend of some EUR 33 million (GBP 30 million) with a record date of 28 December 2018. The fourth interim dividend will be paid on 7 February 2019 and has been included in the NAV as at 31 December 2018. 

Reinet sold some 44 thousand BAT shares in the quarter under review for total proceeds of some EUR 1 million (GBP 1 million) and thus holds 68.0 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.96 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 1 892 million at 31 December 2018, being some 48.6 per cent of Reinet's NAV (30 September 2018: EUR 2 738 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 35.845 at 30 September 2018 to GBP 25.00 at 31 December 2018, resulting in a decrease in value of EUR 822 million; the carrying value is also impacted by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the quarter, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 23 million.

The BAT share price continued to decrease in the quarter under review, with the primary driver being the announcement by the US Food and Drug Administration of plans to review regulation relating to menthol cigarettes, together with the background of general market uncertainty. In a December 2018 announcement, BAT confirmed that the business continues to perform well with expected strong growth particularly in the new generation product categories. It remains well placed to manage the US regulatory proposals. BAT will announce its results for the year ending 31 December 2018 on or about 28 February 2019.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

OTHER LISTED INVESTMENTS
In the quarter under review, Reinet acquired some 357 thousand shares in Twist Bioscience Corp. The shares were acquired at the time of the initial public offering ('IPO') at a price of EUR 12 per share (USD 14 per share), for a total of EUR 4 million (USD 5 million). Prior to this, in 2017, Reinet acquired some 235 thousand shares in Twist Bioscience Corp. for EUR 4 million (USD 5 million) as a result of a NanoDimension co-investment opportunity, such shares are subject to lock-up provisions owing to the IPO until the end of April 2019. As at 31 December 2018, Reinet holds some 592 thousand shares in Twist Bioscience Corp. which were acquired for a total cost of EUR 8 million (USD 10 million).

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
During the current quarter, Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') secured the buy-in of the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme, with liabilities of GBP 1.5 billion in respect of 14 200 members. Pension Corporation also concluded a GBP 1.2 billion longevity reinsurance contract with SCOR, this builds upon a similar GBP 1 billion contract executed in 2017. 

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 205 million at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 1 428 million). This value takes into account Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value at 30 September 2018 of some GBP 3.4 billion, valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 31 December 2018 and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the relatively illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The decrease in the estimated fair value is mostly due to a 15 per cent decrease in peer group company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector, offset by an increase in Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value. The estimated fair value is further reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the quarter. The decrease in the peer group company valuation multiples is driven by a reduction in listed company valuations (FTSE 350 Insurance index down 16 per cent over the quarter) primarily owing to the general negative market sentiment in the United Kingdom in the run-up to Brexit. 

The demand for pension fund de-risking has continued to remain strong leaving Pension Corporation very well placed to grow given the likely strong pipeline of new deals coming to market. Pension Corporation continues to expand and invest in its asset management and asset origination capabilities, risk management and customer service delivery.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and related funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 224 million at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 194 million) of which EUR 4 million (30 September 2018: EUR 4 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 September 2018, adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to net capital contributions of EUR 22 million together with increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments, offset by the realisation of certain investments.

As at 31 December 2018, Reinet had committed EUR 38 million (USD 44 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner, and EUR 223 million (USD 255 million) to Trilantic Capital Partners VI (North America) L.P. ('Fund VI') and its general partner. TEP II held its final closing in December 2018 with total commitments of EUR 381 million (USD 437 million) and Fund VI had EUR 2.21 billion (USD 2.54 billion) of closed commitments as at 31 December 2018. Fund VI expects a final closing in early 2019 and Reinet's commitment will increase in line with the overall fund size.

SPECIALISED INVESTMENT FUNDS
NanoDimension funds and co-investment opportunities
Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension I, II and III limited partnerships ('NanoDimension').

Reinet's co-investment in Twist Bioscience Corp.('Twist') has been reclassified as a listed investment following the initial public offering in October 2018. The value of Twist at 30 September 2018 was EUR 4 million.

During the current quarter, Reinet sold its remaining unlisted co-investment for EUR 20 million (USD 22 million), realising a gain of EUR 5 million (USD 6 million) in the quarter and an overall loss of EUR 3 million (USD 4 million).

The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 30 September 2018. 

Further information on NanoDimension is available at www.nanodimension.com.

Fountainhead Expert Fund
The Fountainhead Expert Fund was liquidated in December 2018 with proceeds of EUR 13 million (USD 15 million) being received by Reinet.

At 30 September 2018, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 18 million, the decrease in value in the period reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments during the period up to the liquidation date.

Snow Phipps funds and co-investment opportunities
Reinet invests as a limited partner in Snow Phipps II, L.P., Snow Phipps III, L.P. and currently in five co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P.

During the current quarter, an investment (held both through Snow Phipps III, L.P. and as a co-investment) was sold for EUR 47 million (USD 54 million), realising a gain of EUR 31 million (USD 35 million) in the quarter.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 95 million at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 119 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by Snow Phipps at 30 September 2018. The decrease in the carrying value being due to the distribution noted above, offset by additional capital of EUR 15 million (USD 17 million) invested in two new co-investment opportunities and an increase in the estimated fair value of underlying investments in the quarter.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com

Further information on Reinet's investments may be found in the Reinet 2018 annual report which is available at www.reinet/investor-relations/reports.html.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS

Reinet's cash and liquid funds decreased from EUR 333 million at 30 September 2018 to EUR 309 at 31 December 2018. During the quarter, the BAT dividend received amounted to EUR 37 million and distributions from investments amounted to some EUR 86 million. Payments in respect of the share buyback programme amounted to EUR 27.4 million with related transaction costs of EUR 0.1 million; Reinet invested some EUR 90 million in underlying investments, payment of the management fee to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited amounted to EUR 20 million, payments of loans and interest amounted to EUR 6 million and taxes and other expenses amounted to EUR 4 million.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
Borrowings
During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 31 December 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 552 million (GBP 496 million) (30 September 2018: EUR 555 million (GBP 494 million)). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the 'Premium Loan'). As at 31 December 2018, the Premium Loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 56 million (GBP 50 million) (30 September 2018: EUR 60 million (GBP 54 million)). Some 5.2 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the Premium Loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium Loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. Reinet retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 December 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 27 million (30 September 2018: EUR 27 million). This loan matures in March 2020.

Derivative assets/(liabilities) – options and forward exchange contracts
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 167 million at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 73 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares offset by the decrease in the time to maturity, and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the quarter.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (30 September 2018: ZAR 230 million). The derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 0.4 million at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 0.2 million).

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 28 million in respect of the maximum amount outstanding in respect of the share buyback programme, an accrual of EUR 10 million in respect of the management fee payable at 31 December 2018 (30 September 2018: EUR 20 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 11 million (30 September 2018: EUR 15 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 34 million (30 September 2018: EUR 32 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. COMMENCES SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME


Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the ""Company"") announces today the commencement of a share buyback programme. Under the programme, commencing 20 November 2018, the Company intends to purchase shares at market price for an aggregate maximum amount of EUR 55 million subject to a maximum of 3.2 million shares over a period ending 15 March 2019 at the latest. 

The purpose of the programme is to return value to the shareholders of the Company. Shares repurchased under the programme may be used for any legitimate purpose, such as consideration for acquisitions.

The programme will be executed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by an intermediary. The Company will not at any time have the right to instruct the intermediary to amend the parameters of the repurchase programme allowing the intermediary to execute share repurchases in the market during both open and closed periods.

The programme will be executed within the limits of the existing authority granted by the Company's shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 28 August 2018, including but not limited to the current limitation that the repurchase price must be at a price no more than an amount equal to 110% of the reference price of the ordinary shares on the relevant exchange; the reference price being the weighted average price of such ordinary shares during the five days of trading immediately prior to the acquisition of such shares. In addition, buybacks will not be at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Purchases under the programme shall not on any trading day on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""trading days"") exceed 25% of the average daily volume of the shares traded during the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase.

Concurrently, the Rupert family has declared its intention not to sell any shares during the duration of this programme.

The Company will publish regular updates relating to the programme and a further announcement on completion or expiration of the programme, all of which will also be available at www.reinet.com/investor-relations/company-announcements.html

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The net asset value ('NAV') comprises total assets less total liabilities, and equates to total equity under IFRS. The decrease in the net asset value of EUR 286 million during the period is mainly due to the decrease in value of the investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. and the payment of a dividend to shareholders. Offsetting these decreases are the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. in the period, an increase in the value of Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited and an increase in the value of the derivative asset associated with the loan financing.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the fluctuation in value of other currencies against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current period-end exchange rates to the March 2018 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 6 million.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity. 

During the period under review, dividend income from BAT amounted to EUR 37 million (GBP 33 million), being BAT’s second 2018 interim dividend received in August 2018. The first 2018 interim dividend of EUR 38 million (GBP 33 million) was received in May 2018 and was recorded as a receivable in Reinet's March 2018 results. No amount has been recorded as receivable as at 30 September 2018 as the next dividend record date is in October 2018.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.97 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 2 738 million at 30 September 2018, being some 56.6 per cent of Reinet's NAV (31 March 2018: EUR 3 198 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 41.310 at 31 March 2018 to GBP 35.845 at 30 September 2018, resulting in a decrease in value of EUR 418 million; the carrying value is also impacted by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 42 million.

The BAT share price has recently decreased substantially. The tobacco industry is currently impacted by the US Food and Drug Administration's continued regulation efforts and the transformation strategies of industry players seeking to enhance their new generation products. Reinet continues to take comfort from the underlying financial results, strong dividends and future prospects of BAT, including the investment in Reynolds American Inc., decreased US tax rates and increased focus on next generation products.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value, Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the net asset value of investment funds, discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples, as appropriate. 

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited’s ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc ('Pension Insurance Corporation'), is a specialist insurer of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides secure and stable retirement income for its policyholders through market-leading customer service, comprehensive risk management and excellence in asset and liability management.

In the first six months of 2018, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension insurance business with record premiums of GBP 3.3 billion up from GBP 1.9 billion in the first half of 2017. It reported profits before tax of GBP 123 million (2017: GBP 140 million), post-tax profits of GBP 99 million (2017: GBP 115 million) and a solvency capital ratio of 175 per cent (December 2017: 160 per cent). 

Pension Insurance Corporation's new business pipeline in 2018 remains strong, with estimated new business premiums of over GBP 4 billion in 2018 to date, the largest deals transacted being with the Siemens Benefits Scheme at GBP 1.3 billion, the PA Pension Scheme at GBP 850 million and the BHS2 Pension Scheme at GBP 800 million. Pension Insurance Corporation continues to source and invest in secure, long-term bilateral debt to support the payment of pensions over the life of its policyholders. Notable new investments announced during 2018 include Halton Housing, University Partnerships Programme, The Mercer's Company, Phoenix Community Housing and Accord Housing Association, totalling more than GBP 310 million.

In May 2018, Pension Insurance Corporation entered into its sixth longevity reinsurance transaction since 2015 with Prudential Insurance Company of America who have reinsured an additional GBP 0.9 billion of longevity risk. In September 2018, Pension Corporation also issued GBP 350 million Tier 2 debt to support the further development and growth of the business.

In the current period, Reinet acquired additional shares from other Pension Corporation shareholders for an amount of GBP 6.3 million. As a result, Reinet owns 43.72 per cent of Pension Corporation, up from 43.45 per cent at 31 March 2018.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 428 million at 30 September 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 1 305 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation’s embedded value at 30 June 2018 of GBP 3.4 billion (31 December 2017: GBP 2.9 billion), valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 30 September 2018 and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the relatively illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The increase in the estimated fair value is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects new business written during the period, changes with respect to the cost of non-hedgeable risks and also bringing the embedded value basis in line with CMI2016, a more updated mortality basis reflecting recent mortality trends in the UK, and the effect of changing economic variables. This is offset by a 5 per cent decrease in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector. The increase in estimated fair value is reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. are in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the period under review, distributions of EUR 2 million were received (30 September 2017: EUR 1 million). 

Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. and Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., completed their investment period in June 2018 with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 4 million and receiving distributions of some EUR 27 million in the period under review.

The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 June 2018, adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to net capital contributions of EUR 18 million together with increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments, offset by the realisation of certain investments.

During the period under review, gains of EUR 16 million (30 September 2017: EUR 22 million) and carried interest of EUR 15 million (30 September 2017: EUR nil) were realised.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term commercial paper. 

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash and liquid funds                                   EUR 333 m

Undrawn borrowing facility                              EUR 281 m

Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer          (EUR 423 m)
to table above)

Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations        (EUR 27 m)

The undrawn borrowing facility comprises a revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A. of GBP 250 million.

Medium-term bank borrowings of EUR 615 million will be settled by the exercise of put options over BAT shares or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings or settled by available cash.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
BORROWINGS
During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 30 September 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 555 million (GBP 494 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 561 million (GBP 493 million)). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the 'Premium Loan'). As at 30 September 2018, the Premium Loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 60 million (GBP 54 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 70 million (GBP 61 million)). Some 4.1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the Premium Loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium Loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. Reinet retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 September 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 27 million (31 March 2018: EUR 30 million), the decrease in the estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the period. This loan matures in March 2020.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 73 million at 30 September 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 54 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares offset by the decrease in the time to maturity, and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period. The cost of the put options is considered as part of the overall cost of financing and is included in the fair value adjustment on outstanding contracts in the income statement below.

In the period under review, Reinet settled outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to ZAR 230 million realising a loss of EUR 0.4 million. Reinet also entered into a new forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2018: ZAR 230 million), which is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 0.2 million (liability) at 30 September 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 2 million (liability)). 

Refer to page 51 of the Reinet 2018 annual report for a description of Reinet's policy on foreign exchange exposure.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 6 million (31 March 2018: EUR 7 million) and is in respect of minority partners’ share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 20 million in respect of the management fee payable at 30 September 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 23 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 15 million (31 March 2018: EUR 11 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 32 million (31 March 2018: EUR 28 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 3 million (31 March 2018: EUR 1 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 30 September 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date. 

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited.

INCOME
Dividend income from BAT during the period amounted to EUR 37 million (GBP 33 million) (30 September 2017: EUR 138 million (GBP 119 million)). The movement is mainly due to BAT paying quarterly dividends in 2018 rather than interim and final dividends as in previous years. Dividend income recorded for the six months to September 2018 was BAT's second 2018 interim dividend of GBP 0.488 per share with a record date of 29 June 2018, being the only dividend with a record date falling in the period under review. Dividend income for the six months to September 2017 was the final 2016 dividend of GBP 1.181 per share together with the first 2017 interim dividend of GBP 0.565 per share. 

Interest income is earned on bank deposits, investments and loans made to underlying investments. Included in other investment income are the foreign exchange movements on fees payable, other liabilities and other assets.

Realised gains on investments of EUR 54 million were mainly in respect of investments realised by Trilantic, Milestone and Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund, offset by losses on other investments. 

Losses of EUR 0.4 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the period.

EXPENSES
The management fee for the period ended 30 September 2018 amounts to EUR 23 million (30 September 2017: EUR 27 million). Operating expenses of EUR 5 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner'), transaction costs of EUR 2 million and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 2 million.

A performance fee may be payable for the year ended 31 March 2019 if certain conditions are met. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2019, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods. No provision for the performance fee was accrued in respect of the six-month periods ended 30 September 2018 and 2017.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand denominated borrowings.

The net tax expense of EUR 9 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic, Snow Phipps and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares decreased in value by EUR 460 million during the period under review. Of this, EUR 418 million was attributable to the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms and EUR 42 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period under review. 

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 92 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 116 million (refer to the above for a full description of the overall movement of Pension Corporation during the period), offset by decreases in the estimated fair value of the Trilantic funds of EUR 5 million, United States land development and mortgages of EUR 6 million and certain other investments. The above amounts include the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in the period under review.

The put options increased in value by EUR 19 million, reflecting the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares during the period, offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro. The estimated fair value of the forward exchange contracts liability decreased by EUR 2 million, reflecting the weakening of the South African rand against the euro.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates.  An unrealised gain of EUR 3 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the period. An unrealised gain of EUR 7 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing. Of this, a gain of EUR 8 million is due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partner's shares in the earnings of the Reinet entity which holds the Trilantic interests.

DIVIDEND
A cash dividend of EUR 0.18 per share totalling some EUR 35 million was paid in September 2018, following approval at the annual general meeting on 28 August 2018. The Company only declares an annual dividend.

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated unaudited financial statements at 30 September 2018, on which this announcement is based, have been approved by the Board of the General Partner on 14 November 2018.

Notes for South African editors

Acknowledging the interest in Reinet's results on the part of South African investors, set out below are key figures from the results expressed in rand. 

Net asset value
Using the closing euro/rand exchange rate prevailing as at 30 September 2018 of 16.4119 and a rate of 14.5837 as at 31 March 2018.

                                 30 September 2018          31 March 2018

Net asset value                  ZAR 79 450 m               ZAR 74 771 m

Net asset value per share        ZAR 405.54                 ZAR 381.66

The increase in the net asset value reflects the decrease in the net asset value in euro terms offset by the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the period.

Loss for the period
Using the average euro/rand exchange rate for the six-month period ended 30 September 2018 of 15.7041 and an average rate of 15.0114 for the six-month period ended 30 September 2017.

                                 30 September 2018          30 September 2017

Loss for the period              (ZAR 3 942 m)              (ZAR 8 587 m)

The decrease for the period largely reflects the decrease in the loss in euro terms.

As at 30 September 2018, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4 822 million, a decrease of EUR 39 million from 30 June 2018.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE

The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.18 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 28 August 2018 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018 in respect of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend is ZAR 16.58930 : Euro 1. This exchange rate is determined as of 21 August 2018. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per Reinet South African Share is 238.88592 ZAR cents, as set out in the table below:
             Gross dividend     South African   Net dividend
             per share          dividend tax    per share

Total        298.60740          (59.72148)       238.88592

PERFORMANCE

NET ASSET VALUE
The decrease in the net asset value ('NAV') of EUR 270 million during the quarter reflects the decrease in the fair value of certain investments, including British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') and Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited. Partially offsetting these decreases is the dividend receivable from BAT, increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments and increases in the estimated fair value of derivative assets associated with put options related to borrowings where BAT shares are pledged as collateral.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro, offset by the depreciation of sterling and the South African rand against the euro has resulted in an overall increase in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying the current period end exchange rates to the March 2018 assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in the March 2018 net asset value of some EUR 18 million. 

Major items impacting the NAV and significant changes in carrying value during the quarter are described below.

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity. 

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.97 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 2 946 million at 30 June 2018, being 60.7 per cent of Reinet's NAV (31 March 2018: EUR 3 198 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 41.31 at 31 March 2018 to GBP 38.30 at 30 June 2018, resulting in a decrease in value of EUR 232 million; the carrying value is also impacted by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the quarter, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 20 million.

BAT declared a dividend of 48.8 p per share for holders on record at 29 June 2018. The dividend of some EUR 38 million (GBP 33 million) will be paid on 8 August 2018 and has been included in the NAV as at 30 June 2018.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.


UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc's ('Pension Insurance Corporation') new business pipeline in 2018 remains strong, with new business premiums of GBP 3.2 billion in the six months to 30 June 2018, the largest deals transacted being with the Siemens Benefits Scheme at GBP 1.3 billion and the PA Pension Scheme at GBP 850 million. Pension Insurance Corporation continues to source and invest in secure, long-term bilateral debt to support the payment of pensions over the life of its policyholders. Notable new investments announced during 2018 include Halton Housing, University Partnerships Programme, The Mercer's Company, Phoenix Community Housing and Accord Housing Association, totaling more than GBP 310 million.

During the second quarter of 2018, Pension Insurance Corporation entered into its sixth longevity reinsurance transaction since 2015 with Prudential Insurance Company of America who have reinsured an additional GBP 0.9 billion of longevity risk.

In the current quarter, Reinet acquired additional shares from other Pension Corporation shareholders for an amount of GBP 6.3 million. As a result, Reinet owns 43.72 per cent of Pension Corporation, up from 43.45 per cent at 31 March 2018.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 237 million at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 1 305 million). This value takes into account Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value at 31 March 2018 and valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 30 June 2018.

The decrease in estimated fair value at 30 June 2018 reflects a decrease in Pension Corporation's estimated embedded value, decreases in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the quarter. Offsetting these decreases is a small increase in Reinet's ownership percentage as noted above. Reinet retained the 10 per cent additional valuation adjustment previously applied largely allowing for the lack of ready liquidity for this investment.

Further information on Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com.


PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet's and its minority partner's investment in Trilantic Management and related funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 183 million at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 180 million) of which EUR 4 million (31 March 2018: EUR 7 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 March 2018 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios and cash movements in the quarter. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to capital contributions made in the quarter of EUR 17 million, increases in the fair values of underlying investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro. This is offset by capital distributions received in the quarter of EUR 10 million and the realisation of certain underlying investments.

As at 30 June 2018, Reinet had committed a total of EUR 23 million (USD 27 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner, and EUR 151 million (USD 176 million) to Trilantic Capital Partners VI (North America) L.P. ('Fund VI') and its general partner. TEP II had its first closing in August 2017 and Fund VI had its first closing in December 2017; each fund expects further closings in the coming months, at which time Reinet's commitment will increase in line with the overall fund size. As at 30 June 2018, TEP II and Fund VI had each made one investment.

During the period under review, gains of EUR 10 million were realised and carried interest of EUR 11 million received.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.



SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

NANODIMENSION FUNDS AND CO-INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension I, II and III limited partnerships.  

At 30 June 2018, the estimated fair value of Reinet's investment in the three funds and co-investments amounted to EUR 42 million (31 March 2018: EUR 54 million). The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 31 March 2018 adjusted for cash invested in the current quarter. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the quarter.

Further information on NanoDimension is available at www.nanodimension.com.

SNOW PHIPPS FUNDS AND CO-INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Reinet invests as a limited partner in Snow Phipps II, L.P., Snow Phipps III, L.P. and in four co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 101 million at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 90 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by Snow Phipps at 31 March 2018 adjusted for cash invested in the current quarter. The movement in value is due to an increase in the estimated fair value of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the quarter.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com.


OTHER FUND INVESTMENTS
Other fund investments include small, specialist funds investing in private equity businesses, property and start-up ventures. 

Other fund investments are valued in total at their estimated fair value of EUR 73 million at 30 June 2018 based on valuation statements received from the fund managers (31 March 2018: EUR 16 million).

Included in this section is a limited partner investment in RLG Real Estate Partners L.P. ('RLG'), a property fund which is managed by a subsidiary of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA. RLG invests in and develops real estate properties, including luxury brand retail developments situated in prime locations throughout the world.

Reinet's investment in RLG is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 63 million at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 6 million). The movement in value is due to additional capital invested in the quarter.


Further information on Reinet's investments may be found in the Reinet 2018 annual report which is available at www.reinet/investor-relations/reports.html
 

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in a liquidity fund holding highly rated short-term commercial paper. 

Reinet's cash and liquid funds decreased from EUR 322 million at 31 March 2018 to EUR 287 million at 30 June 2018. During the quarter, the BAT dividend received amounted to EUR 38 million and Reinet invested some EUR 86 million in underlying investments, including EUR 57 million in RLG. Management fees of EUR 23 million, accrued as at 31 March 2018, were paid to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'). Payments of loans and interest amounted to EUR 7 million. Distributions from investments amounted to some EUR 39 million and other expenses amounted to EUR 2 million.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
Borrowings
In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America, N.A. which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. At 30 June 2018 and 31 March 2018, these facilities had not been drawn upon.

During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022.  At 30 June 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 561 million (GBP 496 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 561 million (GBP 493 million)). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the 'Premium Loan'). At 30 June 2018, the Premium Loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 65 million (GBP 58 million) (31 March 2018: EUR 70 million (GBP 61 million)). Some 4.6 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the premium loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium Loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 June 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 28 million (31 March 2018: EUR 30 million); the decrease in the estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the quarter. This loan matures in March 2020.

Derivative assets/(liabilities) – options and forward exchange contracts
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 64 million at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 54 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares, offset by the decrease in the time to maturity and the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period.

In September 2017, Reinet entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2018: ZAR 230 million), which is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 1 million (liability) at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 2 million (liability)). The change in value reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the quarter.

OTHER LIABILITIES
Minority interest, fees payable and other liabilities, net of other assets
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 6 million (31 March 2018: EUR 7 million) and is in respect of a minority partner's share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 10 million in respect of the management fee payable as at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR 23 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 15 million (31 March 2018: EUR 11 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 31 million (31 March 2018: EUR 28 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 4 million (31 March 2018: EUR 1 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 30 June 2018 (31 March 2018: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

Amounts payable are offset by other assets which comprise the BAT dividend receivable of EUR 38 million; the dividend has a record date of 29 June 2018.

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

SHARE INFORMATION
The Company's ordinary shares are listed and traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (symbol 'REINI', Thomson Reuters code REIT.LU), on Euronext Amsterdam (symbol 'REINA', Thomson Reuters code REINA:AS) and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (symbol 'RNI', Thomson Reuters code RNIJ.J) with the ISIN number LU0383812293.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 JUNE 2018

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 30 June 2018 as follows:

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value statement as at 30 June 2018

As at 30 June 2018, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4 861 million, a decrease of EUR 268 million from 31 March 2018, which is principally due to the decrease in value of the Fund's investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. during the period.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE


The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.18 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 28 August 2018 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends, which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013, Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018.

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday, 21 August 2018.

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the Reinet South African Shares is anticipated to be as follows:

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTARY

Dear Shareholder,

Overview of last 10 years
October 2018 marks the 10th anniversary of the formation of Reinet. At its creation Reinet Fund held British American Tobacco shares, a portfolio of smaller investments and EUR 350 million in cash, stemming from the restructuring of Richemont. Since 2008, Reinet has sold over 16 million British American Tobacco shares for total proceeds of some EUR 720 million and borrowed some EUR 700 million using British American Tobacco shares as collateral; investments made to date amount to over EUR 2.1 billion and current outstanding commitments amount to EUR 445 million with EUR 322 million cash and liquid funds available. At 31 March 2018, the net asset value of the portfolio amounted to EUR 5.1 billion.

Total shareholder return taking into account the Initial Price of Reinet's shares, the market value of the Reinet share at year-end and dividends paid, is 8 per cent per annum.

At the end of 2017 Reinet listed its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, following the cancellation of its depository receipt program. Along with the original listing on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Reinet's ordinary shares are now traded on 3 stock exchanges with a very efficient exchange mechanism between them. The enhanced convertibility and increased market visibility should enhance liquidity in the Reinet share over time.

Business developments
The investment in British American Tobacco represented some 62.4 per cent of Reinet's net asset value at 31 March 2018, compared to 70.8 per cent a year ago. This percentage decrease reflects the significant decrease in the British American Tobacco share price from GBP 53.00 to GBP 41.31, with the value of the holding of 68.1 million shares falling to EUR 3.2 billion at 31 March 2018. The value of Reinet’s investment in British American Tobacco has thus decreased by some EUR 1 billion in the year; despite the current downturn in the share price we continue to take comfort from the underlying financial results, dividend flows and future prospects including the investment in Reynolds American, decreased US tax rates and increased focus on next generation products. 

Pension Corporation continues to perform well in a market segment receiving increasingly more attention. The company wrote some GBP 3.7 billion of new business in 2017 compared to GBP 2.6 billion in 2016 and the outlook remains positive. With strong growth in profitability, a reported solvency ratio under the Solvency II regime at 160 per cent and, combined with a recently announced initial A+ rating from Fitch, Pension Corporation remains well placed to continue to compete for new clients and grow its business. 

In the year under review, Reinet made investment commitments of EUR 312 million and invested a total of EUR 90 million in new and existing portfolio assets. Worthy of note is the new commitment to the respective successor funds of Trilantic North America, comprising EUR 152 million to date.

During the course of the year under review, Reinet's net asset value decreased by 14.6 per cent from EUR 6.0 billion to some EUR 5.1 billion. This reflects a significant decrease in the value of the investment in British American Tobacco offset in part by an increase in the value of the investment in Pension Corporation. The net asset value was also impacted by the weakening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro during the year.

The importance of the level at which Reinet shares trade is well appreciated by the Board of Directors. Despite the decrease over the last financial year the Board believes the Reinet portfolio continues to be appropriately placed. Our focus will remain on investing to achieve long-term growth in net asset value in an increasingly more volatile global context. We will continue to invest in and support our portfolio of assets where we have gained comfort to further develop, seeking to deploy new capital and importantly addressing smaller assets where the time and money spent is disproportionate to their ability to make a meaningful long-term impact on the net asset value.

Dividend
The Board of Directors of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes a dividend of EUR 0.18 per share, payable in September 2018. This represents an increase of 9 per cent over the dividend paid last year. 

Changes to the board of directors and board of overseers
Mr Eloy Michotte retired from the Board of Directors in May 2018 and Mr Denis Falck will retire from the Board of Overseers at the annual general meeting in August 2018. Both gentlemen have given nearly 10 years of service to Reinet, I wish to thank them both for their extremely valuable contribution to Reinet. 

Outlook
The last year has once again shown that we live in a very uncertain and unpredictable world. Political changes in many countries, significant fluctuations in currency values and in Reinet's instance the large decrease in the value of British American Tobacco shares were all unexpected. The ability of markets in general to withstand some of these shocks are tested regularly. Slowly rising interest rates and declining central bank support will add more risk and volatility to world markets.  Reinet will remain focussed on investing for the long-term and maintain its prudent approach in order to mitigate these risks.

Many people across the Reinet organisation and its investee companies have contributed to Reinet's performance. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all.

(3)     Total of realised proceeds and current fair value.
(4)     The invested amount for Trilantic Capital Partners includes an initial payment of USD 10 million.
(5)     Certain assets have been distributed and are now included in 'Vanterra C Change TEM and holding companies', ‘Other fund investments', 'Other investments' and in 'United States land development and mortgages'.
(6)     The exposure to the South African rand has been partially hedged by a forward exchange contract and borrowings in this currency.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The decrease in the net asset value of EUR 875 million during the year reflects the decrease in the fair value of certain investments, including British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') and United States land development and mortgages offset by the receipt of dividends from BAT and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, and derivative assets.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of sterling, the US dollar and the South African rand against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying the current year-end exchange rates to the March 2017 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the March 2017 net asset value of some EUR 280 million. 

INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. 

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2.1 billion and at 31 March 2018 has committed to provide further funding of EUR 445 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below. New commitments during the year under review amounted to EUR 312 million, and a total of EUR 90 million was funded during the year.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity. 

Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive of BAT, writing in its annual report for 2017 commented: 


'The Group delivered another set of strong financial results in 2017, despite a challenging trading environment. Following the transformational deal in July 2017, these results benefit from the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. while also demonstrating the strength of the organic business.

In light of the evolution of the business, with the addition of leading brands in the US, as well as the growing importance and progress of our potentially reduced-risk products, we have taken the opportunity to establish a new portfolio of priority brands.

Notwithstanding the good progress we are making with our potentially reduced-risk products, combustible cigarette products remain at the core of our business - delivering growth today and providing the funds required for investing in the future. I am therefore pleased that 2017 saw the Group yet again deliver another good performance.

The Group's financial performance was positively impacted by the accounting for the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. and the subsequent US tax reforms. These drove diluted earnings per share up by over 600 per cent to 1,830.0p.'


During the year under review, Reinet recorded dividends from BAT amounting to EUR 208 million (GBP 180 million), being BAT's final 2016 dividend and interim dividends for 2017 and 2018. In May 2018, after the end of the financial year, Reinet received the first payment in respect of BAT's 2018 financial year interim dividend; this amounted to EUR 38 million (GBP 33 million) and is included in the current reported year-end results. BAT did not pay a final 2017 dividend, and instead moved to interim dividends paid quarterly starting from 1 January 2018.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.97 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 198 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 4 249 million), being some 62.4 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 53.00 at 31 March 2017 to GBP 41.31 at 31 March 2018. 

The BAT share price has been volatile during the year under review, with an initial increase in price following the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 57.8 per cent of Reynolds American Inc. but subsequently decreasing following the announcement of the US Food and Drug Administration's decision to pursue regulation which proposes nicotine levels to be reduced to non-addictive levels. Reinet continues to take comfort from the underlying financial results, dividend and future prospects of BAT including the investment in Reynolds American Inc., decreased US tax rates and increased focus on next generation products.

SPDR GOLD SHARES

Reinet holds 230 000 shares with a market value of EUR 23 million as at 31 March 2018.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value, Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the net asset value of investment funds, discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples, as appropriate. 

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc (‘Pension Insurance Corporation'), is a specialist insurer of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides secure and stable retirement income for its policyholders through market-leading customer service, comprehensive risk management and excellence in asset and liability management.

In 2017, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension insurance business with premiums of GBP 3.7 billion up from GBP 2.6 billion in 2016. It reported an underlying operating profit of GBP 195 million (2016: GBP 177 million), pre-tax profits of GBP 391 million (2016: GBP 276 million) and a solvency capital ratio of 160 per cent (2016: 164 per cent). Pension Insurance Corporation has been operating under the Solvency II framework of governance since 1 January 2016.

At 31 December 2017, Pension Insurance Corporation held GBP 25.7 billion in assets (31 December 2016: GBP 22.6 billion) and had insured more than 151 000 pension fund members (31 December 2016: 134 000). Clients include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals and the public sector.

Tracy Blackwell, Chief Executive Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation commented:


'To fulfil our purpose of providing financially secure pensions to our policyholders, as well as transacting new business and growing that pool of policyholders, there are several key areas in which Pension Corporation, through its main operating subsidiary Pension Insurance Corporation, as a specialist insurance company, needs to excel. These include a clear, strong focus on getting the best outcome for our customers, the ability to source the right sort of assets, the development of deep working relationships with reinsurers and the need to retain excellent staff.

Our key financial metrics demonstrate the strength of the business. We finished the year with total new business premiums of GBP 3.7 billion, across 20 pension schemes, and took on responsibility for the pension payments of an additional 24 000 policyholders. Pension Insurance Corporation's underlying operating profit, which reflects management's view of the profitability of the business and its activities grew to GBP 195 million, an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year. At year-end, Pension Corporation's Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) stood at GBP 2 932 million, an increase of 13 per cent in the year, and Pension Insurance Corporation's solvency ratio was 160 per cent.

In 2017 we were proud to attain the Institute of Customer Service's (ICS) ServiceMark with Distinction – the only financial services company to have done so. Our stakeholders continue to give us excellent feedback, with over 98 per cent of policyholders expressing overall satisfaction with our service, and 99 per cent of employees expressing a belief that Pension Insurance Corporation will be successful over the next few years. 

2017 was a very successful year for us and I look forward to building on this in 2018 with all our stakeholders.'


Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 305 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 1 175 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation's audited embedded value at 31 December 2017 of GBP 2.9 billion (31 December 2016: GBP 2.6 billion), valuation multiples drawn from industry data and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The increase in estimated fair value over the year is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects new business written in the year and the effect of changing economic variables, together with a 2 per cent increase in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector. The increase in estimated fair value is reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
Where Reinet invests in funds managed by third parties its philosophy is to partner with the managers of such funds and to share in fees generated by funds under management. This is the case with funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners, 36 South Capital Advisors, Milestone Capital, Prescient Investment Management China and Vanterra Capital. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the 'Investment Advisory Agreement'), entered into by the Fund Manager and Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'), Reinet pays no management fee to the Investment Advisor on such investments except in the case where no fee or a reduced fee below 1 per cent is paid to the third-party manager. In such cases, the aggregate fee payable to the Investment Advisor and the third-party manager is capped at 1 per cent.

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners ('Trilantic') is composed of Trilantic North America and Trilantic Europe, two separate and independent private equity investment advisors focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in their respective geographies. Trilantic North America primarily targets investments in the consumer, energy, and business services sectors, and currently manages five funds. Trilantic Europe primarily targets investments in the industrials, consumer and leisure, telecommunication, media and technology, business services and healthcare sectors, and currently manages two funds.

Reinet and its minority partner invest in the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together 'Trilantic Management') and six of the eight current funds under Trilantic's management. The terms of investment applicable to Reinet's investment in the Trilantic funds provide that Reinet will not pay any management fees or carried interest. In addition, Reinet receives a share of the carried interest payable on the realisation of investments held in the funds, once a hurdle rate has been achieved.

Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. are in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the year under review, distributions of some EUR 21 million were received (31 March 2017: EUR 7 million). 

Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. and Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. are approaching the end of their investment period with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 30 million and receiving distributions of some EUR 46 million in the year under review. These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. being especially focused on the oil and gas sector.

During the year under review, Reinet committed EUR 21 million (USD 26 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner, and EUR 131 million (USD 160 million) to Trilantic Capital Partners VI North America ('Fund VI') and its general partner. TEP II had its first closing in August 2017 and Fund VI had its first closing in December 2017; each fund expects further closings in the coming months, at which time Reinet's commitment will increase in line with the overall fund size. As at 31 March 2018, TEP II had made one investment and Fund VI had no investments and no capital contributions have been made.

Charlie Ayres, Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners, commented:


'In 2017, we launched fundraising for two new funds, Fund VI North America and TEP II North America, and have already closed on nearly three-quarters of the USD 2.75 billion combined target committed capital. We plan to hold final closings for both funds in 2018. TEP II North America launched operations in Q1 2018 and Fund VI North America is expected to commence its operations in the second quarter.

We believe that US consumer confidence will remain high throughout 2018, supported by low unemployment, wage growth, and continued economic strength, which should be bolstered by the recent tax law changes.

We are more optimistic regarding the outlook of domestic companies in general. We will continue adhering to our investment discipline, which we believe has been critical in protecting capital, enhancing value and maximizing returns. We have fully (or partially) monetized companies and assets that have reached maturity, while methodically putting capital to work where we find attractive investment opportunities that can drive appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Patience and flexibility remain essential in our deployment of capital. We continue to strive to build value in our existing portfolio and focus on having our mature companies exit-ready to take advantage of attractive market dynamics. We are proud of our consistency in the performance of our funds over approximately 15 years and three fund vintages, through many business and commodity price cycles.'


Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, Chairman of Trilantic Europe, commented:


'The European macro environment in 2017 was less eventful than in prior years as the ECB reduced the size of its interventions, maintaining negative rates. Solid improvements in sovereign debt continued in Southern Europe, with Spain and Portugal delivering impressive export driven recoveries and France benefiting from significant presidential goodwill. Even Italy has exhibited export driven growth, but it continues to be dragged down by its high structural unemployment (most of it in the South of the country), declining public investment, and political instability environment. Outside the Eurozone, the UK stands out as a special case for European private equity investing as it decouples its future from the EU. Politics will play an outsized role in the outcome but we have a positive outlook on the investment prospects in certain sectors, including IT and business services, amongst others. Recently we have seen a number of positive economic signals in Europe including increased consumer spending, an export surplus, a new German and French willingness to increase public spending and lower personal income tax (which tends to translate immediately into spending). As a result, we believe that certain consumer facing industries and cyclical sectors will particularly benefit from an overall positive economic cycle.'

Reinet's and its minority partner's investment in Trilantic Management and all the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 180 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 202 million) of which EUR 7 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2017 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The decrease in the estimated fair value is due to distributions of EUR 36 million and by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro, offset by additional capital invested and increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments.

During the year under review, gains of EUR 31 million and carried interest of EUR 14 million were received.

36 SOUTH MACRO/VOLATILITY FUNDS
36 South Capital Advisors LLP ('36 South') is an absolute return fund manager that specialises in managing global macro/volatility funds. 36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes. Its global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments but to substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility.

Reinet has co-invested with the 36 South management team in the fund management and distribution companies. Reinet is also an investor in the following 36 South funds: 

The Lesedi Fund; a positive-carry, long-volatility strategy with a primary focus of generating yield in 'normal markets', whilst retaining the potential to deliver larger positive returns in extreme market events. The fund invests in options that are expected to result in a positive return if the spot price remains the same, if volatility increases, and/or if there is a favourable movement of the price of the underlying asset. The current low interest and low volatility environment provides multiple opportunities for the fund to invest in such positions globally in equities, currencies, commodities and interest rates and in both bullish and bearish positions. 

The Kohinoor Core Fund; a global macro/long volatility strategy which aims to achieve significant returns with commensurate risk over a medium-to long term investment period. It is designed to generate performance in a variety of market environments as the fund managers have extensive experience in identifying mis-valued assets whilst maintaining a mix of bullish and bearish positions. The fund invests up to 95 per cent in options and is a more concentrated version of the highly successful Kohinoor Series Funds. 

During the year under review, the investment in the 36 South Black Eyrar Fund was redeemed and the proceeds invested in the Lesedi Fund. A loss of EUR 10 million was realised on the 36 South Black Eyrar Fund on transfer, with proceeds of EUR 5 million invested in the Lesedi Fund.

Richard Haworth, Chief Executive Officer of 36 South, commented:


'36 South is a world recognised leader in the management of funds which look to outperform in times of extreme systemic events and the accompanying volatility. 

For a number of years now we have seen a bear market in the price of assets primarily driven by volatility due to the lack of these types of events. This culminated in extreme lows in prices of volatility assets last year which in turn leads to disappointing performance in such funds.

However, notwithstanding the performance, funds experienced significant new inflows as investors become increasingly nervous of the fragility of the financial markets. We expect this to continue.

36 South is looking to consolidate its position as a leader in this space and given the macroeconomic backdrop, believes that it is well positioned to grow it's AUM organically and inorganically as investors become increasingly aware of the need to have diversify their portfolio and have funds like ours in their mix as not only a diversifier but as a tail hedge.'


The investment in the funds is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 34 million, based on unaudited financial information received from the fund manager as at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 42 million). The estimated fair value of the investment in the fund management and distribution companies amounted to EUR 6 million (31 March 2017: EUR 7 million). The investments in total have an estimated fair value of EUR 40 million (31 March 2017: EUR 49 million). The change in valuation reflects the movement in the value of the underlying investments held by the funds.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS 
Milestone China Opportunities funds, investment holdings and management company participation
Reinet has invested along with Milestone Capital in a management company based in Shanghai, and has also invested in certain funds and investment companies managed by Milestone Capital (together 'Milestone').

Milestone Capital has a strong track record in helping portfolio companies scale their operations and be listed on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges. Funds under management invest primarily in domestic Chinese high-growth companies seeking expansion or acquisition capital. Milestone funds seek to maximise medium- to long-term capital appreciation by making direct investments to acquire minority or majority equity stakes in those companies identified by Milestone's investment team. Current areas of investment include: restaurants; biopharmaceutical manufacturers; medical device manufacturers; food and beverage distribution; brands covering sportswear and apparel; big data services; e-commerce; power generation equipment; retail pharmacies and online education.

Yunli Lou, Managing Partner of Milestone Capital, commented:


'Milestone made significant progress in 2017 as it continued working closely with its portfolio companies to drive operational excellence and drive strategic initiatives. Among the active portfolio companies, an oncology-focused biotech company was successfully listed on the Taipei Exchange's Mainboard and is currently in the process of dual-listing on Nasdaq; a biosimilar developer voluntarily delisted from the Taipei Exchange's Emerging Stock Board to relist on the new Hong Kong biotech market; and a big data service provider completed a new round of financing at a significantly higher valuation than in the previous round. Concurrent with the new round, Milestone made a partial realization of the investment and received total proceeds greater than the investment cost.
 
China's GDP grew by 6.9 per cent in 2017, above the government's annual growth target of 6.5 per cent. The Chinese economy continues to rebalance with the services industry accounting for 51.6 per cent of GDP, up from 45.3 per cent in 2012, when Xi Jinping became the Communist Party Chief. The Chinese consumer story remains compelling, driven by several sustainable factors such as strong income growth, low household debt and high household savings. This resulted in retail sales growth of 10.2 per cent and online retail sales growth of 32.2 per cent for the year. 

China's stock markets continued to expand due to reforms. With USD 8.5 trillion in market capitalization and more than 3,400 listed companies, China's A-share market is the second-largest in the world, behind the US During 2017, The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange ranked as the second and fifth largest globally in terms of funds raised. The Stock Connect program enabling investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets to trade shares in each other’s market, continues to boost both volume and demand for both Mainland China and Hong Kong listed companies. The upcoming inclusion of A-share stocks in MSCI is expected to increase the range of A-shares international investors can trade.'


The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of EUR 129 million (31 March 2017: EUR 135 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2017 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2018. The change in estimated fair value reflects capital repayments of EUR 3 million and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro, offset by increases in the value of listed investments.

Prescient China Balanced Fund and investment management company
Prescient China Balanced Fund ('Prescient China') is a fund managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited, a South African-listed fund manager, with the team based in Shanghai. The fund invests in equities, bonds, cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. It invests principally in instruments listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.

Liang Du, Portfolio Manager of Prescient China, commented:


'March 2018 signifies 5 full years since the inception of the fund.  Over the five years we’ve faced the initial China slower growth scare, property collapse scare, debt default scare, currency depreciation scare, bubble and crash. One can truly say being invested in China is certainly never boring.

By sticking to our processes of security selection and asset allocation we managed returns of 15 per cent p.a. beating inflation handily over a period that was not the most positive for the Chinese market. The returns came from time in the market, but also good asset allocation as well as stock selection over the period.

Cumulatively the fund is up around 100 per cent over the past 5 years, delivering returns uncorrelated with the rest of the world, and exactly those expected of a long-term growth fund, contributing to high returns and diversification. Our strong returns put us in the top 2 per cent of global flexible allocation funds in the Asia-Pacific region according to Bloomberg data since we started the fund.  We will continue to work very hard to continue delivering exceptional returns over the next 5 years.'


Reinet invests in Prescient China and in the management company. These investments are carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 48 million based on unaudited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 47 million). The increase in estimated fair value over the year under review is the result of increases in the value of underlying listed investments offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

SPECIALISED INVESTMENT FUNDS
Vanterra Flex Investments
Vanterra Flex Investments L.P. ('Vanterra Flex') was established in 2010 to invest in privately issued securities and to make direct investments in the US and emerging markets.

Reinet's investment in Vanterra Flex decreased in value from EUR 30 million at 31 March 2017 to EUR nil at 31 March 2018 due to the distribution of assets in the year under review. Certain of the distributed assets are now included in the captions 'Vanterra C Change TEM and holding companies' (EUR 4 million), 'Other fund investments' (EUR 8 million), 'Other investments' (EUR 6 million) and 'United States land development and mortgages' (EUR 1 million); other distributions resulted in a reduction in the minority interest liability (EUR 7 million). 

At the time of the distribution of Vanterra Flex's assets Reinet had made a total investment of USD 64 million and received distributions of cash and assets of USD 58 million, resulting in an overall loss to date of USD 6 million.

Further information on Vanterra is available at www.vanterra.com.

Reinet is an investor in Vanterra C Change TEM and in its general partner.  

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 24 million at 31 March 2018, based on audited financial information as at 31 December 2017, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2017: EUR 23 million).

As noted above, during the year assets amounting to EUR 4 million (USD 5 million) were distributed by Vanterra Flex and are now included in the investment in Vanterra C Change TEM.

NanoDimension funds and co-investment opportunities
Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension I, II and III limited partnerships. The focus of each fund is to invest in and support the establishment, technology development and scale up, growth and commercialisation of companies leveraging the advancement of new atomic and molecular structures. Product applications range from molecular diagnostics, immuno-oncology, immuno-tolerance, organs on chip, DNA synthesis to energy storage and electrochromic glass.

Aymeric Sallin, Founder of NanoDimension Management Ltd, commented:

'As the NanoDimension portfolio companies mature, there are exciting developments – products are being launched in the marketplace, drugs are advancing through clinical trials and showing initial signs of efficacy, top-tier management teams and board members are joining our portfolio companies. Amongst others:
•     On January 25, 2018, ARMO, the largest investment of NanoDimension II, completed a NASDAQ IPO at USD 17 per share. The initial filing was for USD 86 million, but it ended raising USD 128 million Since then the stock has traded between USD 25 and USD 57 per share. Over 400 patients have been enrolled in clinical trials. ARMO is currently conducting a Phase 3 in PDAC (Pancreatic Ductile Adenocarcinoma) as well as a Phase 2 in NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer).
•     Inscripta released a new CRISPR enzyme (MAD7). The company raised a new round of financing at a substantially higher valuation and now has the capital to work through commercial launch and unleash the potential of biology with its automated single cell writing instrument, consumables and a software suite. 

During 2017, Dr. Patrick Aebischer who led the EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) as President for 17 years, joined the team and is heading our Swiss office, helping bridge Silicon Valley with Europe. Patrick, is currently a board member of Nestlé, Lonza, Logitech, and the Novartis Venture Fund (Chairman).'


At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of Reinet's investment in the three funds and co-investments amounted to EUR 54 million (31 March 2017: EUR 44 million). The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 31 December 2017, together with an independent valuation of the co-investments. The increase in estimated fair value reflects capital contributions made and increases in the value of underlying investments offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Fountainhead Expert Fund 
Fountainhead Expert Fund ('Fountainhead') is a fund investing in a concentrated manner in global equities offering superior potential for capital appreciation and value realisation by benchmarking itself to global inflation and striving for absolute real returns through time.

Andre Cillie, Managing Partner of Andre Cillie Capital Management (Pty) Ltd, manager of Fountainhead, commented:


'2017 proved to be yet another frustrating and disappointing year. Deep value, concentrated investing has been out of favour for some time and we find ourselves in the same company as a host of noted value investors such as David Einhorn and Bruce Berkowitz.

To say that we are struggling to find new ideas with a sufficient margin of safety would be an understatement. The rest of the market trades at extreme levels in our opinion and this overvaluation is particularly acute amongst the market darlings.

While the last two years have been extremely frustrating, we still believe the portfolio is correctly positioned to benefit as the age of ""free money"" draws to a close and interest rates continue to normalise globally. All of our money is invested alongside yours and we feel confident that our patience will be duly rewarded, as we continue to focus on the facts instead of emotions.'


At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 17 million based on the unaudited valuation at that date provided by the fund manager (31 March 2017: EUR 29 million). The decrease in estimated fair value is the result of decreases in the value of underlying listed investments together the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Ian K. Snow, CEO and Partner of Snow Phipps, commented:


'In 2017, despite a highly competitive deal-making environment, we continued to execute the investment strategy in Snow Phipps III, completing three new platform investments, as well as two add-on acquisitions. In July 2017, Snow Phipps III acquired Ideal Tridon, a leading global engineering solutions designer and manufacturer of stainless steel and specialty clamps for a broad range of fastening and sealing applications.  In September 2017, Snow Phipps III acquired DecoPac, a leading direct-to-store distributor, technology and supply chain solutions provider for bakeries, professional cake decorators and baking enthusiasts across the US, Europe and Canada.  In October 2017, Snow Phipps III acquired Brook & Whittle, a leading technically-oriented North American manufacturer of premium prime label solutions.  In addition, for Snow Phipps II, L.P., we completed six add-on acquisitions during 2017.  In 2017, we deployed over USD 280 million in Snow Phipps II and Snow Phipps III equity commitments combined.  We also had three successful exits in 2017, returning USD 239 million to Snow Phipps II investors.  We continue to build value in the current Snow Phipps portfolio.'


Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 90 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 48 million), the increase in value being mainly due to additional capital invested in the year and increases in the value of underlying investments, offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

The investment in Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd. ('Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund') (previously JPS Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd), which was the first transaction introduced to Reinet by Renshaw Bay, focuses on liquid opportunities in the credit markets. Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund is managed by JP Morgan Asset Management. 

Palm Lane Credit Opportunities Fund’s investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through both capital appreciation and current income by taking positions in publicly traded and privately held securities, derivatives and other instruments (including bonds, credit default swaps and index options), primarily in credit and credit-related markets.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 85 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 94 million) based on the valuation at that date provided by the fund manager.

The decrease in estimated fair value during the year is due to decreases in the value of underlying investments together with the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

GAM Real Estate Finance Fund
The GAM Real Estate Finance Fund ('REFF') was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its investment strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with primary focus on the UK. At December 2017, REFF held 15 investments.

Jon Rickert, Investment Director of GAM, commented:


'The Real Estate Finance Fund invested in a diversified portfolio of 25 self-originated, private loans secured by commercial and residential real estate in the UK, Ireland and Belgium. The fund's investment objectives are to generate an attractive dividend yield while protecting against a material, downward adjustment in real estate value. In 2017, the fund paid dividends in excess of its target yield.  Through the end of 2017, ten of the fund's 25 investments had been fully realised.
 
UK real estate values have remained relatively stable in spite of the slowing UK economy. Management of the fund expect the uncertainty around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will continue to weigh on the UK economy. The Irish economy, on the other hand, has experienced robust growth; the Irish commercial real estate market continues to improve. The fund's investments benefit from the substantial downside protection inherent in loans.'


The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 53 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 75 million) based on audited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2017.

The decrease in estimated fair value is mainly due to repayments of capital in the year, mostly owing to early settlement of loans, together with the weakening of sterling against the euro.

Other fund investments
This includes small, specialist funds investing in private equity businesses, property and start-up ventures. 

In March 2018, Reinet invested some EUR 6 million in RLG Real Estate Partners LP, a property fund which is managed by a subsidiary of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA. 

These investments are valued at their estimated fair value of EUR 16 million at 31 March 2018 based on valuation statements received from the fund managers (31 March 2017: EUR 4 million).

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
Reinet has invested in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets. These investments are held in Arendale Holdings Corp.

John Kunkel, Chief Executive Officer of Arendale Holdings Corporation, commented:


'Arendale Holdings, Tideridge Holdings and Faircrest Holdings, are each holding companies that Reinet uses to make investments in US real estate.

Arendale owns, wholly or partially, several premier golf course communities as well as land acquired for environmental mitigation purposes.  Revenues and net income for 2017 remained relatively unchanged from the prior year.

Tideridge Holdings makes loans to a collection of primarily residential community development projects located in the South-Eastern US, while Faircrest Holdings owns a portfolio of loans made to the same project entities. No new loans were originated this past year and the balances are declining as the land is being sold-off in accordance with an overall disposition strategy. The two companies had positive cash flow of USD 1.1 million above the prior year and, even though the loan holdings are reducing, the fair value of the assets has increased slightly above the prior year (after adjusting for the current year sales).'


The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 83 million (31 March 2017: EUR 154 million), of which EUR nil is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2017: EUR 3 million).

The current valuation is based on audited financial statements as at 31 December 2017 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2018. The decrease in the estimated fair value, primarily reflects reductions in the expected rate of lot sales and lot prices, together with revised future costs; reductions in the value of specific properties (arising from management's view of the non-recoverability of a contractual receivable, and the dilutive effect of preferred returns earned by an unaffiliated investor at a golf community in which the United States land development and mortgages has a minority ownership); and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

DIAMOND INTERESTS
Reinet has invested in two projects in South Africa. Firstly, in an entity which extracts diamonds from the waste tailings of mining operations which began over a century ago at Jagersfontein in South Africa. Developments in extraction technology since Jagersfontein was first mined, now allow the waste tailings to be reprocessed to recover gemstones. In addition, Reinet has an interest in a separate project, which has acquired rights to mine diamonds on a previously unexploited site at Rooipoort near Kimberley in South Africa. Both entities are fully operational and continue to repay loans to Reinet.

Henk van Zuydam, Chief Financial Officer of both projects, commented:


'The rough diamond market has remained resilient in demand which is evident in the continued high attendance at the sales tenders held both in South Africa and in Antwerp. This resilience is in spite of the fact that the polished diamond market has remained under pressure during the course of the year. The fluctuating Rand remains a major factor in the revenue and profitability of the business, especially due to the significant strengthening of the South African rand from November 2017 which had a negative impact on the revenues.
 
Nonetheless, Jagersfontein achieved another solid financial year due to operational efficiencies in conjunction with the recovery of a number of higher value diamonds which resulted in higher US dollar value revenue. 
 
Rooipoort recovered a higher than expected amount of carats during the financial year. This higher recovery was however unfortunately more than offset by lower average US dollar per carat prices achieved at our tenders compared to forecast due to the smaller average size and lack of high quality  diamonds that have been recovered.'


In total, these projects are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 39 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 56 million) based on discounted cash flow projections. The decrease in estimated fair value mainly reflects repayment of loans and interest in the year amounting to EUR 10 million, and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

Reinet has borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in these projects and entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2017: ZAR 480 million) in order to mitigate currency risk.

OTHER INVESTMENTS
Other investments are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 59 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 64 million). The decrease in the estimated fair value of other investments relates mostly to capital repayments and the decrease in estimated fair value of the investment in a digital music industry initiative to EUR 10 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 15 million), reflecting start-up costs and intellectual property development expenditure. These decreases were offset by an increase in fair value of an investment in a 3D printing initiative to EUR 33 million (31 March 2017: EUR 25 million) and the inclusion of certain assets amounting to EUR 8 million distributed by Vanterra Flex as noted above.

There were no other significant changes in value in respect of other investments, either as a result of movements in the valuation of underlying investments, further amounts invested or returns of capital.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in a liquidity fund holding highly rated short-term commercial paper. 

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash and liquid funds                                                    EUR 322 m
Undrawn borrowing facility                                               EUR 284 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)           (EUR 445 m)
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations                         (EUR  30 m)

The undrawn borrowing facility comprises a revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A. of GBP 250 million. At 31 March 2018 the amounts drawn down were EUR nil (31 March 2017: EUR 101 million (GBP 85 million)).

Medium-term bank borrowings of EUR 631 million will be settled by the exercise of put options over BAT shares or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings or settled by available cash.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
BORROWINGS
In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America, N.A. which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. At 31 March 2018, these facilities had not been drawn upon (31 March 2017: EUR 101 million (GBP 85 million)).

During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 561 million (GBP 493 million) (31 March 2017: EUR 591 million (GBP 502 million)). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the ‘Premium Loan’). At 31 March 2018, the premium loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 70 million (GBP 61 million) (31 March 2017: EUR 90 million (GBP 77 million)). Some 4.6 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the premium loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 March 2018, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 30 million (31 March 2017: EUR 31 million); the decrease in the estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. This loan matured in March 2018 and was extended on the same terms to March 2020.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 54 million at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 29 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares offset by the decrease in the time to maturity, and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year. The cost of the put options is considered as part of the overall cost of financing and is included in the fair value adjustment on outstanding contracts in the income statement above.

In the year under review, Reinet settled outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to ZAR 480 million realising a loss of EUR 1 million. Reinet also has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2017: ZAR 480 million), which is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 2 million (liability) at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 3 million (liability)). The change in value reflects the reduction in the face value of the contract and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 7 million (31 March 2017: EUR 16 million) and is in respect of a minority partner’s share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 23 million in respect of the half-yearly management fee payable as at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR 22 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 11 million (31 March 2017: EUR 7 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 28 million (31 March 2017: EUR 25 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 1 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

Amounts payable are offset by other assets which comprise the BAT dividend receivable of EUR 38 million; the dividend has a record date of 23 March 2018.

(1) The reversal of the unrealised loss on derivative contracts represents the unrealised fair value of EUR 80 million as at 1 April 2016 on loan related derivative contracts settled during the year ended 31 March 2017; along with the original premium cost of EUR 55 million.
(2) The reversal of the unrealised loss on borrowings represents the unrealised loss as at 1 April 2016 on borrowings repaid during the year ended 31 March 2017.


INCOME
Dividends received and receivable from BAT increased from EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million) in the year ended 31 March 2017 to EUR 208 million (GBP 180 million) in the year ended 31 March 2018. The increase is due to the increase of GBP 1.11 per share in the dividends declared by BAT offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro at the time of the dividend payments. The dividends received from BAT during the year represent the final 2016 dividend paid in May 2017, the first 2017 interim dividend paid in September 2017, a second 2017 interim dividend paid in February 2018 and the first payment of the 2018 interim dividend declared in March 2018 and paid in May 2018. Interim dividends declared by BAT do not require shareholder approval and so the May 2018 dividend has been included in the results of the current year.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits, investments and loans made to underlying investments. Included in other investment income are the foreign exchange movements on fees payable, other liabilities and other assets.

Realised losses on investments of EUR 11 million were mainly in respect of realised losses of EUR 10 million on the 36 South macro/volatility funds and EUR 32 million on other investments, offset by realised gains on Trilantic of EUR 31 million. Reinet’s share of the Trilantic gains amounts to EUR 29 million with a further EUR 2 million being attributable to the minority partner.

Losses of EUR 1 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

Carried interest of EUR 14 million was attributable to Reinet in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

EXPENSES
The management fee for the year ended 31 March 2018 amounts to EUR 51 million (31 March 2017: EUR 48 million). 

No performance fee is payable for the year ended 31 March 2018 (31 March 2017: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company’s prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2018, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods. 

Operating expenses of EUR 6 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner') and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 5 million.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand-denominated borrowings.

The net tax expense of EUR 24 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic, Snow Phipps and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares decreased in value by EUR 1 billion during the year under review. Of this, EUR 906 million was attributable to the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms and EUR 145 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year under review. 

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 9 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 130 million, offset by decreases in the estimated fair value of the Trilantic funds of EUR 16 million, United States land development and mortgages of EUR 72 million and certain other investments. The above amounts include the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the depreciation of sterling, the US dollar and the South African rand against the euro in the year under review.

The put options increased in value by EUR 25 million reflecting, in part, the decrease in value of BAT shares in the year, offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro. The estimated fair value of the forward exchange contracts liability decreased by EUR 1 million, reflecting the reduction in the face value of the contract and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates. An unrealised gain of EUR 1 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. An unrealised gain of EUR 33 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing. Of this, EUR 24 million is due to the weakening of sterling against the euro.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partner’s shares in the earnings of the Reinet entity which holds the Trilantic interests.

(1) Includes cash and liquid funds held in the Company, Reinet Fund and its subsidiaries. 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Investments totalling EUR 58 million were made during the year, including Trilantic and Snow Phipps. Amounts invested were partially offset by repayments in respect of loans and interest received from Jagersfontein and Rooipoort, and distributions from other investments.

Proceeds from the sale of investments include EUR 67 million from Trilantic and EUR 21 million on other investments.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
A dividend of some EUR 32 million was paid to shareholders in September 2017 (September 2016: EUR 32 million).

EUR 1 million was paid in respect of the settlement of euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

In addition, Reinet repaid GBP 85 million to Bank of America, N.A. under a revolving facility agreement.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Dividends received from BAT increased from EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million) in the year ended 31 March 2017 to EUR 170 million (GBP 147 million) in the year ended 31 March 2018. The increase is due to the increase of GBP 0.62 per share in the dividends declared and paid by BAT offset by the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments. The dividends received from BAT during the year represent the final 2016 dividend paid in May 2017, the first 2017 interim dividend paid in September 2017 and a second 2017 interim dividend paid in February 2018. 

Carried interest of EUR 14 million was received in respect of the investment in Trilantic.

Interest of EUR 7 million was paid in respect of the sterling-denominated loans and EUR 3 million in respect of the South African rand-denominated loan in the year. 

No performance fee was payable for the year ending 31 March 2017 and no performance fee is payable in respect of the current year.

Net US tax payments of EUR 18 million were paid in the year under review. This amount includes taxes withheld by Trilantic in respect of gains and carried interest received, together with estimated taxes paid on gains and income which will be taxable in the US.

Cash and liquid funds decreased by EUR 38 million over the year to EUR 322 million as the amounts repaid in respect of bank borrowings and derivative liabilities, together with amounts invested in new investments, payment of the dividend, management fee and operating expenses exceeded amounts realised from investments.

DIVIDEND
The Company relies on distributions from Reinet Fund as its principal source of income from which it may pay dividends. 

A cash dividend of EUR 0.165 per share totalling some EUR 32 million was paid in September 2017, following approval at the annual general meeting on 29 August 2017.

The General Partner has proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.18 per share subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 28 August 2018. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by the Company.
 
The Company has sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by and paid to holders of the Company's shares. SARS has confirmed that any such dividends will be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends will be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders unless those holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders will be required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018.

The dividend will be payable in accordance with the following schedule, subject to shareholder approval:

The last day to trade the Company's shares cum-dividend in Europe will be Wednesday, 29 August 2018 and in South Africa, Tuesday, 28 August 2018. The Company's shares will trade ex-dividend from Thursday, 30 August 2018 in Europe and from Wednesday, 29 August 2018 in South Africa. The record date for the Company’s shares in Europe and in South Africa will be Friday, 31 August 2018.

The dividend on the Company's shares in Europe will be paid on Wednesday, 5 September 2018 and is payable in euro.

The dividend on the Company's shares in South Africa will be paid in South African rand on Wednesday, 5 September 2018. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 23 May 2018 on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service ('SENS').

No cross-border movements of ordinary shares will be permitted between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch and Luxembourgish stock exchanges (Euroclear Nederland, Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) and the clearing and settlement system for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Strate) between Tuesday, 28 August 2018 and Friday, 31 August 2018, both days inclusive.

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

Notes for South African editors

Acknowledging the interest in Reinet's results on the part of South African investors, set out below are key figures from the results expressed in rand. 

Net asset value
Using the closing euro/rand exchange rate prevailing as at 31 March 2018 of 14.5837 and a rate of 14.3027 as at 31 March 2017. 

                                          31 March 2018                     31 March 2017

Net asset value                           ZAR 74 771 m                      ZAR 85 845 m

Net asset value per ordinary share        ZAR 381.66                        ZAR 438.09

The decrease in the net asset value reflects the decrease in the net asset value in euro terms offset by the weakening of the rand during the year.

(Loss)/profit for the year
Using the average euro/rand exchange rate for the year ended 31 March 2018 of 15.1882 and the average rate of 15.4322 for the year ended 31 March 2017.

                                          31 March 2018                     31 March 2017

(Loss)/profit for the year                (ZAR 12 804 m)                    ZAR 12 546 m

The decrease in the profit for the year largely reflects the decrease in the net asset value in euro terms.

Headline earnings per share
To comply with the South African practice of providing Headline earnings per share data, the relevant data is as follows:

                                          31 March 2018                     31 March 2017

Unadjusted earnings per share             (EUR 4.30)                        EUR 4.15
Headline earnings per share *             (EUR 4.30)                        EUR 4.15

Unadjusted earnings per share             (ZAR 65.31)                       ZAR 64.04
Headline earnings per share *             (ZAR 65.31)                       ZAR 64.04
* There are no dilutive instruments

Subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 28 August 2018, a dividend of EUR 0.18 per ordinary share will be paid to ordinary shareholders on Wednesday, 5 September 2018. The rand dividend amount per ordinary share will be calculated by reference to the euro/rand exchange rate prevailing on Tuesday, 21 August 2018, the currency conversion date.

The dividend paid in September 2017 amounted to ZAR 2.5971 per equivalent ordinary share, calculated as EUR 0.165 per ordinary share at an exchange rate of 15.74. The proposed dividend of EUR 0.18 per ordinary share converted into rand at the current exchange rate of 14.83 amounts to ZAR 2.6694, an effective increase of 2.8 per cent. This will be updated on Tuesday, 21 August 2018 with the actual exchange rate.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 31 MARCH 2018

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 31 March 2018 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value statement as at 31 March 2018

As at 31 March 2018, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 5 129 million, a decrease of EUR 567 million from 31 December 2017, which is principally due to the decrease in value of the Fund's investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. during the period.

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 31 March 2018. The NAV calculation is subject to completion of the year-end audit.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 31 March 2018. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

Unquote

It is anticipated that the preliminary announcement of the results of Reinet Investments S.C.A. for the year ended 31 March 2018 and its net asset value at that date will be released during the week commencing 21 May 2018.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The increase in the net asset value ('NAV') of EUR 295 million during the quarter is largely a result of movements in the fair value of British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') and Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, together with the BAT dividend receivable of EUR 32 million. Partially offsetting these increases in NAV are decreases in the estimated fair value of derivative assets associated with put options related to borrowings due to an increase in the BAT share price, and the effect of the weakening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the quarter.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of other currencies against the euro has resulted in a decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current quarter end exchange rates to the September 2017 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 48 million.

Major items impacting the net asset value, significant changes in carrying value and new investments during the period under review are described below.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.97 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 836 million at 31 December 2017, being 67 per cent of Reinet's NAV (30 September 2017: EUR 3 606 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 46.72 at 30 September 2017 to GBP 50.08 at 31 December 2017. This increase in value is offset to some extent by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the quarter.

BAT declared a dividend of 43.6 p per share for holders on record at 28 December 2017. The dividend of some EUR 32 million will be paid on 8 February 2018 and has been included in the NAV as at 31 December 2017.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
During the current quarter, Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') completed a GBP 115 million investment in the Walney Extension Offshore Wind Farm Project; concluded a pension insurance buy-in with the trustees of the Wolsley Group Retirements Benefits Plan for a premium of some GBP 600 million; concluded a pension insurance buy-in with the trustees of the Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Fund for a premium of some GBP 725 million and concluded a pension insurance buy-in with the trustees of three defined benefit pension schemes sponsored by Pirelli UK Limited and Pirelli Tyres Limited for a premium of some GBP 100 million. Pension Corporation also entered into its fifth longevity reinsurance transaction since 2015 with Prudential Insurance Company of America who will reinsure and additional GBP 0.9 billion of longevity risk.

Reinet's investment in Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 286 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 1 206 million). This value takes into account Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value at 30 September 2017 and valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 31 December 2017.

The increase in estimated fair value at 31 December 2017 reflects an estimated increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value and increases in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector, offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the quarter. Reinet retained the 10 per cent additional valuation adjustment previously applied largely allowing for the lack of ready liquidity for this investment.

Further information on Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet's and its minority partner's investment in Trilantic Management and related funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 197 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 214 million) of which EUR 5 million (30 September 2017: EUR 9 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 September 2017 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios and cash movements in the quarter. The decrease in the estimated fair value is due to capital distributions received in the quarter of EUR 8 million and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro, offset by capital contributions of EUR 2 million and increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments.

As at 31 December 2017, Reinet has committed an amount of some EUR 22 million (USD 26 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner. In addition, in the current quarter Reinet committed EUR 79 million (USD 94 million) to Trilantic Capital Partners VI North America ('Fund VI') and its general partner. TEP II had its first closing in August 2017 and Fund VI had its first closing in December 2017; each fund expects further closings in the coming months, at which time Reinet's commitment will increase in line with the overall fund size. As at 31 December 2017, TEP II and Fund VI had no investments and no capital contributions have been made.

During the period under review, gains of EUR 3 million were realised and carried interest of EUR 10 million received.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.

SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

VANTERRA FLEX INVESTMENTS L.P.
Reinet's investment in Vanterra Flex Investments L.P. ('Vanterra Flex') decreased in value from EUR 26 million at 30 September 2017 to EUR 13 million at 31 December 2017 due to a distribution of assets in the period under review amounting to some EUR 13 million. Certain of the distributed assets are now included in the caption 'Vanterra C Change TEM and holding companies' (EUR 4 million) and 'United States land development and mortgages' (EUR 1 million); other distributions resulted in a reduction in the minority interest liability (EUR 8 million).

The remaining investment in Vanterra Flex is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 13 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 26 million). The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 30 September 2017.

The remaining assets held by Vanterra Flex are expected to be distributed directly to Reinet Fund or its subsidiaries before the end of March 2018; at which time all the assets acquired will be reallocated to the appropriate asset category which will include 'Other fund investments' and 'Other investments' as shown in the net asset value table above.

Further information on Vanterra Flex is available at www.vanterra.com.

SNOW PHIPPS FUNDS AND CO-INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
In 2011, Reinet committed to invest in Snow Phipps II, L.P. In the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment to Snow Phipps III, L.P., the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. Reinet has also invested in four co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 86 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 72 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by Snow Phipps at 30 September 2017 adjusted for cash invested in the current quarter. The movement in value is due to additional capital invested, together with an increase in the estimated fair value of underlying investments, offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the quarter.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com.


Further information on Reinet's investments may be found in the Reinet 2017 annual report which is available at www.reinet.com.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term commercial paper.

Reinet's cash and liquid funds decreased from EUR 313 million at 30 September 2017 to EUR 281 million at 31 December 2017. Reinet invested some EUR 28 million in underlying investments, including EUR 15 million in Snow Phipps III, L.P. Management fees of EUR 25 million, accrued as at 30 September 2017, were paid to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'). US taxes paid amounted to EUR 11 million and payments of loans and interest amounted to EUR 7 million. Distributions from investments amounted to some EUR 41 million and other expenses amounted to EUR 2 million.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
Borrowings
In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America N.A which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. At 31 December 2017, these facilities had not been drawn upon.

During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 31 December 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 561 million (GBP 499 million) (30 September 2017: EUR 564 million (GBP 497 million)).  The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction (the 'Premium loan'). As at 31 December 2017, the Premium loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 73 million (GBP 65 million) (30 September 2017: EUR 78 million (GBP 69 million)). Some 4.1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the Premium loan and future interest payments. As part of the medium-term financing arrangement and Premium loan a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 December 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 30 million (30 September 2017: EUR 28 million), the increase reflects the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the period. This loan matures in March 2018.

Derivative assets/(liabilities) – put and call options and forward exchange contracts
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 26 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 38 million). The decrease in the carrying value of the put options reflects the increase in value of the underlying BAT shares together with the decrease in the time to maturity and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (30 September 2017: ZAR 230 million). The derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 1 million at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: nil).

OTHER LIABILITIES
Minority interest, fees payable and other liabilities, net of other assets
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 7 million (30 September 2017: EUR 16 million) and is in respect of a minority partner's share in the gains and losses not yet distributed arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which it has an interest. The decrease in value during the period reflects Reinet's acquisition following the distribution of certain interests in Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages previously held in Vanterra Flex (see explanation above), along with a dividend of EUR 1 million paid to a minority partner.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 12 million in respect of the management fee payable at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR 25 million) a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 20 million (30 September 2017: EUR 27 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 26 million (30 September 2017: EUR 26 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 9 million (30 September 2017: EUR 8 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 December 2017 (30 September 2017: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited.

Other assets comprise the dividend receivable from BAT of some EUR 32 million. BAT declared a dividend of 43.6 p per share for holders on record at 28 December 2017, this will be paid on 8 February 2018. The dividend has been recorded as a receivable as at 31 December 2017.

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value statement as at 31 December 2017

As at 31 December 2017, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 5 696 million, an increase of EUR 297 million from 30 September 2017, which is principally due to the increase in value of the Fund's investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. during the period.

This valuation reflects the Fund’s shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 31 December 2017. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 31 December 2017. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

Unless otherwise indicated, capitalised words and terms contained in this announcement shall bear the same meanings ascribed thereto in the Circular as posted to Holders on 23 October 2017.

Background

Currently, Reinet Depositary Receipts trade in the ratio of ten Depositary Receipts to one Reinet Share.

Relevant Shareholders shall not hold fractions of Relevant Reinet Shares. One fraction is one tenth of a Relevant Reinet Share (a ""Fraction""). If the aggregate number of the Relevant Reinet Shares due to a Relevant Shareholder is not a whole number, then the number of Relevant Reinet Shares to be held by that Relevant Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, such that the Relevant Shareholder does not hold Fractions.

Reinet Securities SA shall pay an amount in cash, based on the 10-day VWAP of the Depositary Receipt as at the Register LDT, to Holders in lieu of their Fractions.

Cash amount to be paid to Holders in lieu of Fractions

The 10-day VWAP of the Depositary Receipts as at the Register LDT is R30.09703. Based on the ratio of 10 Depositary Receipts to 1 Relevant Reinet Share, Reinet Securities SA will accordingly settle the Fractions, through Computershare and the Holders' relevant Strate CSD participants and Brokers, based on an amount of R300.97033 for every Relevant Reinet Share.

Appendix: Cross-border trading process from Monday, 4 December 2017

a) Process for removals out of South Africa

The investor will need to instruct both its Strate and Euroclear Nederland custodians to move Reinet Shares from Strate to Euroclear Nederland. Any removal of Reinet Shares out of South Africa must be requested via the investor's CSDP or Broker, who will arrange with the investor for the completion of a J-A (Johannesburg to Amsterdam) removal request form. Request forms will be lodged with Computershare who will validate removal forms and record them for exchange control reporting. Only valid forms will be lodged by Computershare with Citibank South Africa. The forms are available from Computershare and any request for assistance can be directed to:

By email: removals@computershare.co.za. 
By phone: call the Computershare Global removals team in Johannesburg (the contact person is: Ms Janine Chembiah at +27 11 370-5596 / 5190).

b) Process for removals into South Africa

i.) Between Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE

The investor will need to instruct both its Euroclear Nederland custodian and its South African CSDP to move Reinet Shares from Euroclear Nederland to Strate. The Euroclear Nederland custodian will arrange for the setup of the Euroclear ""straight-through-processing"" (""STP"") instructions and will also complete a removal form which will be provided to Computershare.

ii.) Between the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (via Euronext Amsterdam) and the JSE

The investor will deliver Reinet Shares to the Citibank ""safekeeping"" account in Euroclear Nederland through Clearstream's or Euroclear Bank's account with Euroclear Nederland. The investor will then need to instruct both its Euroclear Nederland custodian and its South African CSDP to move Reinet Shares from Euroclear Nederland to Strate. The Euroclear Nederland custodian will arrange for the setup of the Euroclear STP instructions and will also complete a removal form A-J (Amsterdam to Johannesburg), which will be provided to Computershare.

Under the new cross-border trading mechanism, the transfer of Reinet Shares from Luxembourg or the Netherlands to South Africa will not involve any transfer in the share register of the Company. All Reinet Shares held by investors traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE will be dematerialised shares recorded in the share register of the Company in the name of Euroclear Nederland.

The entire Reinet Share cross-border transfer mechanism is managed through the custodial link between the two CSD platforms via Citibank South Africa. Investors wishing to move shares cross-border will need to arrange for their service providers in their respective markets to initiate the process. 

Any queries for assistance in relation to removals into South Africa can be directed to: sfsclientqueries@citi.com

Further details on the cross-border trading processes, including diagrams and removal instruction forms, will be made available on Wednesday, 22 November 2017 at 07:30 am CET on the Company’s website http://www.reinet.com/investor-relations/cross-border-share-transfer-process.html

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The decrease in the net asset value of EUR 604 million during the period is mainly due to the decrease in value of the investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c., decreases in certain other investments including United States land development and mortgages, the payment of a dividend and expenses. Offsetting these decreases is the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c in the period, an increase in the value of Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, an increase in the value of the derivative asset associated with the collar financing and the decrease in the estimated fair value of borrowings mainly due to the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of other currencies against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current period end exchange rates to the March 2017 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 269 million.

INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders.

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2.1 billion and at 30 September 2017 committed to provide further funding of EUR 252 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below of this report. The increase in commitments during the period under review amounted to EUR 31 million, and a total of EUR 42 million was funded during the period.

Major items impacting the net asset value, significant changes in carrying value and new investments during the period under review are described below.

LISTED INVESTMENTS
BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

During the period under review, Reinet received dividends from BAT amounting to EUR 138 million (GBP 119 million), being BAT's final 2016 dividend and interim 2017 dividend.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 2.97 per cent of BAT's issued share capital, a decrease from 3.65 per cent at 31 March 2017. This dilution is a result of the increase in BAT's share capital following the Reynolds American Inc, acquisition. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 606 million at 30 September 2017, being some 67 per cent of Reinet's net asset value (31 March 2017: EUR 4 249 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 53.00 at 31 March 2017 to GBP 46.72 at 30 September 2017, resulting in a decrease in value of EUR 485 million; the carrying value is also impacted by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 158 million.

The BAT share price has been volatile during the current period, with an initial increase in price following the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 57.8 per cent of Reynolds American Inc. but subsequently decreasing following the announcement of the US Food and Drug Administration's decision to pursue regulation that requires nicotine in cigarettes to be reduced to non-addictive levels.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

(the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the net asset value of investment funds, discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples, as appropriate.

At 30 June 2017, Pension Insurance Corporation had GBP 24.2 billion in financial investments (31 December 2016: GBP 22.6 billion) and had insured more than 145 000 pension fund members (31 December 2016: 134 900). Clients include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals and the public sector.

In the first six months of 2017, Pension Corporation made an operating profit of GBP 93 million, an 18 per cent increase over the same period in 2016, and wrote GBP 1.9 billion of premiums compared to GBP 918 million in the same period in 2016.

During 2017, Pension Corporation reinsured GBP 1 billion of longevity risk with SCOR, a new counterparty, reached an agreement with Retirement Advantage to fund equity release mortgages and welcomed CVC as a new shareholder.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 206 million at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 1 175 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation's embedded value at 30 June 2017 of GBP 2.6 billion (31 December 2016: GBP 2.6 billion), valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 30 September 2017 and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the relatively illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The increase in the estimated fair value is due to increases in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector and an increase in embedded value, offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners ('Trilantic') is composed of Trilantic North America and Trilantic Europe, two separate and independent private equity investment advisors focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in their respective geographies. Trilantic North America primarily targets investments in the consumer, energy, and business services sectors, and currently manages five funds. Trilantic Europe primarily targets investments in the industrials, consumer and leisure, telecommunication, media and technology, business services and healthcare sectors, and currently manages two funds.

Reinet and its minority partners invest in the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together 'Trilantic Management') and five of the seven current funds under Trilantic's management.

Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. are in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the period under review, distributions of EUR 1 million were received (30 September 2016: EUR 8 million).

Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P., Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., and their respective general partners continue to build their portfolios with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 19 million and receiving distributions of some EUR 31 million in the period under review. These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. being especially focused on the oil and gas sector.

In August 2017, Reinet committed an amount of some EUR 18 million (USD 21 million) to Trilantic Energy Partners II (North America) L.P. ('TEP II') and its general partner. TEP II had its first closing in August 2017 and expects further closings in the coming months, at which time Reinet's commitment will increase in line with the overall fund size. As at 30 September 2017, TEP II had no investments and no capital contributions have been made.

Reinet's and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and all the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 214 million at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 202 million) of which EUR 9 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 June 2017, adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to net capital contributions of EUR 10 million together with increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments.

During the period under review, gains of EUR 22 million were realised (30 September 2016: EUR 4 million).

SPECIALISED INVESTMENT FUNDS
Snow Phipps funds and co-investment opportunities
Snow Phipps Group ('Snow Phipps') is a private equity firm focused on lower middle-market control investments. Snow Phipps seeks to invest USD 50 million to USD 150 million of equity in market-leading companies primarily headquartered in North America with enterprise values between USD 100 million and USD 500 million.

In 2011, Reinet committed to invest in Snow Phipps II, L.P. In the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment to Snow Phipps III, L.P., the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. Reinet has also invested in three co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 72 million at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 48 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by Snow Phipps at 30 June 2017. The increase in value being due to additional capital invested and an increase in the estimated fair value of underlying investments in the period.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com

GAM Real Estate Finance Fund
The GAM Real Estate Finance Fund was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its investment strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with a primary focus on the UK.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 58 million at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 75 million) based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 30 June 2017.

The decrease in estimated fair value is mainly due to repayments of capital in the period, mostly owing to early settlement of loans, together with the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
Reinet has invested both directly and with partners to acquire interests in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets. These investments are held in Arendale Holdings Corp.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 100 million (31 March 2017: EUR 154 million), of which EUR 3 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2017: EUR 3 million).

The current valuation is based on unaudited financial statements as at 30 June 2017 adjusted for cash movements up to 30 September 2017. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects reductions in the expected rate of lot sales and lot prices, and revised future expenses. The decrease in value also reflects the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the period.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term commercial paper.

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash and liquid funds                                                        EUR 313 m
Undrawn borrowing facility                                                   EUR 284 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)               (EUR 252 m)
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations                             (EUR  28 m)

The undrawn borrowing facility comprises a revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A. of GBP 250 million. At 30 September 2017 amounts drawn down were EUR nil (31 March 2017: EUR 101 million (GBP 85 million)).

Medium-term bank borrowings of EUR 642 million will be settled by the exercise of put options over BAT shares or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings or settled by available cash.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
BORROWINGS
During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022. At 30 September 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 564 million (GBP 497 million) (31 March 2017: EUR 591 million (GBP 502 million)).  The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction. As at 30 September 2017, the premium loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 78 million (GBP 69 million) (31 March 2017: EUR 90 million (GBP 77 million)). Some 4.1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the premium loan and future interest payments. As part of this agreement a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 September 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 28 million (31 March 2017: EUR 31 million), the decrease reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the period. This loan matures in March 2018.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 38 million at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 29 million). The increase in the carrying value of the put options reflects the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares offset by the decrease in the time to maturity, and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period. The cost of the put options is considered as part of the overall cost of financing and is included in the fair value adjustment on outstanding contracts in the income statement below.

In the period under review, Reinet settled outstanding forward exchange contracts amounting to ZAR 480 million realising a loss of EUR 1 million. Reinet also entered into a new forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 230 million (31 March 2017: ZAR 480 million), which is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR nil at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: liability of EUR 3 million).

Refer to page 51 of the Reinet 2017 annual report for a description of Reinet's policy on foreign exchange exposure.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 16 million (31 March 2017: EUR 16 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 25 million in respect of the management fee payable at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 22 million) a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 27 million (31 March 2017: EUR 7 million) relating to realised and unrealised gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and Snow Phipps, and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 26 million (31 March 2017: EUR 25 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 8 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 30 September 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited.

INCOME
Dividends received from BAT increased from EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million) during the period to September 2016 to EUR 138 million (GBP 119 million) during the period under review. The increase is due to an increase of GBP 0.19 in the total dividend per BAT share offset by the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments. The dividends received from BAT during the period represent the final 2016 dividend paid in May 2017, as well as the interim 2017 dividend paid in September 2017.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits, investments and loans made to underlying investments. Included in other investment income are the foreign exchange movements on fees payable, other liabilities and other assets.

Realised gains on investments of EUR 22 million were mainly in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

Losses of EUR 1 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the period.

EXPENSES
The management fee for the period ended 30 September 2017 amounts to EUR 27 million (30 September 2016: EUR 23 million). Operating expenses of EUR 3 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner') and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 2 million.

A performance fee may be payable for the year ended 31 March 2018 if certain conditions are met. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2018, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods. The provision for the performance fee accrued in respect of the six-month period ended 30 September 2017 amounts to EUR nil (30 September 2016: EUR nil).

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand denominated borrowings.

The net tax expense of EUR 25 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, together with an increase in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic, Snow Phipps and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares decreased in value by EUR 643 million during the period under review. Of this, EUR 485 million was attributable to the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms and EUR 158 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period under review.

The unrealised fair value decrease of EUR 74 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 31 million (refer to above for a full description of the overall movement of Pension Corporation during the period), and decreases in the estimated fair value in respect of United States land development and mortgages and other investments of EUR 62 million and EUR 43 million respectively. The above amounts include the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the depreciation of other currencies against the euro in the period under review.

The estimated fair value of the collar financing derivative asset increased by EUR 9 million during the period, reflecting the decrease in the price of the BAT shares underlying the put options. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contracts decreased by EUR 3 million; the contracts were settled on 30 September 2017 resulting in a loss of EUR 1 million.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates. An unrealised gain of EUR 3 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the weakening of the South African rand during the period. An unrealised gain of EUR 32 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing. Of this, a gain of EUR 25 million is due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partners' shares in the earnings of the Reinet entities which hold the Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages interests, respectively.

DIVIDEND
A dividend of EUR 0.165 per share totalling some EUR 32 million was paid in September 2017, following approval at the annual general meeting on 29 August 2017. No interim dividend is proposed in respect of the six months ended 30 September 2017.

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated unaudited financial statements at 30 September 2017, on which this announcement is based, have been approved by the Board of the General Partner on 14 November 2017.

Notes:
 1. Holders will be notified of any amendments to these Salient Dates and Times on SENS and in the South African press.

 2. All dates and times indicated above are South African standard dates and times.

 3. If the vote is postponed, Forms of Proxy submitted for the vote will remain valid in respect of any such postponement.

 4. Holders are advised that there may be no rematerialisation or dematerialisation after Tuesday, 28 November 2017. Nothing precludes a Holder, upon becoming a Relevant Shareholder of the Company, from rematerialising their Relevant Reinet Shares.

4. Voting

Approval of the Resolution by Holders requires that not less than two thirds of the votes exercised are in favour of the amendment. The votes exercised must constitute no less than one third of the total exercisable votes in respect of all the issued Depositary Receipts as at the Voting Record Date. Holders shall exercise their votes by delivering proxies to the Transfer Secretaries in respect of the Resolution, in the form and manner set out in the Form of Proxy attached to the Circular. No meeting of Holders is required. A Holder that abstains shall be regarded as having exercised a vote against the Resolution. Any vote that is invalidly exercised shall not be regarded as a vote.

5. Consequences for Holders
 
5.1 Economic consequences for Holders

Holders will be in substantially the same economic position after implementation of the Proposed Transaction taking into account the value of their Depositary Receipts prior to the Proposed Transaction and the value of their Relevant Reinet Shares together with the cash payment for any fractional entitlements after implementation of the Proposed Transaction.

5.2 Fractions

Relevant Shareholders shall not hold fractions of Relevant Reinet Shares. If the aggregate number of the Relevant Reinet Shares to be held by a Relevant Shareholder is not a whole number, then the number of Relevant Reinet Shares to be held by that Relevant Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, such that the Relevant Shareholder does not hold a fraction of a Relevant Reinet Share. Reinet Securities SA shall pay an amount in cash (to be notified to Holders) to Holders in lieu of their fractions. The cash amount paid to Holders shall be based on the 10-day VWAP of the Depositary Receipt as at the Register LDT.

5.3 Tax consequences for Holders

The cancellation of the Depositary Receipts, such that the Holders that are taxpayers in South Africa shall become Relevant Shareholders of the Relevant Reinet Shares, will not constitute disposals of the Depositary Receipts for the purposes of capital gains tax or income tax.

Holders should seek advice from appropriate professional advisers if they are in any doubt whatsoever regarding their tax position.

6 Notice of Resolution and action required by Holders

In order to implement the Proposed Transaction the following resolution is proposed:

""Resolved that the amendment to the Deposit Agreement, as provided in the Addendum, in terms of which the Proposed Transaction is implemented whereby all Depositary Receipts are cancelled and Holders shall become Relevant Shareholders of the Company, be and is hereby approved.""

NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2017

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 30 September 2017 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value statement as at 30 September 2017

As at 30 September 2017, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 5 399 million, a decrease of EUR 424 million from 30 June 2017, which is principally due to the decrease in value of the Fund's investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. during the period.

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 30 September 2017. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 30 September 2017. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the ""Company"") announces its intention to undertake certain steps with a view to improving liquidity in the market for the Company's ordinary shares (the ""Reinet Luxembourg Shares"") currently listed and traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 


Key elements of the proposals

Following a review of the way in which Reinet Luxembourg Shares are held and traded, the board of directors of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the ""Board"") has resolved to:

*       Apply for a listing for the Reinet Luxembourg Shares on Euronext Amsterdam, in addition to the Company's listing of the Reinet Luxembourg Shares on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

*       Deliver Reinet Luxembourg Shares to holders of depository receipts and cancel the Company's depository receipt programme in South Africa. The depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet Luxembourg Shares will be replaced by Reinet Luxembourg Shares and holders of depository receipts will thereafter hold Reinet Luxembourg Shares directly. The Reinet Luxembourg Shares will then be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (the ""JSE"").

*       Put in place a simplified structure to facilitate cross-border trading in Reinet Luxembourg Shares between investors on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE.

Subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, it is envisaged that these proposals will be implemented in stages. Please see the Appendix to this announcement for further details on the expected timetable.


Comment from the Chief Executive Officer of Reinet Investments Manager S.A.

Commenting on the proposals, Mr. Wilhelm van Zyl said:

""We have reviewed several options for enhancing the tradability of the Company's shares, including improving the efficiency of the cross-border transfer process. The principal trading market for the Company's shares is currently the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, which is less liquid than other major European exchanges. Investors have faced difficulty when trading in their shares, especially in large blocks. Although depository receipts may currently be converted into Reinet Luxembourg Shares and vice versa, subject to the applicable exchange control regulations, it was felt that the level of administrative intervention in the conversion process limited market depth and liquidity between the Johannesburg and Luxembourg exchanges.

The proposals we are announcing today will grant our investors access to another market, Euronext Amsterdam, attracting a diverse and international investor base. The proposals will also provide for the delivery of Reinet Luxembourg Shares to depository receipt holders and cancellation of the depository receipt programme. This will permit the Company's shares to be moved seamlessly between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch, Luxembourg and South African stock exchanges (Euroclear, Clearstream and Strate).""


Benefits of the proposals

At present, significant trading in the Company's securities takes place on the JSE.  However, trading between the Company's investors in Europe and South Africa is limited, which in turn restricts liquidity in Europe. The Board considers that the Company's exchange traded valuation suffers as a result of this illiquidity, to the disadvantage of the Company's investors.

The Board considers that, if implemented, these proposals will provide greater flexibility for investors, facilitate easier trading of securities in the Company for all investors and improve liquidity in the market of the Company's securities.

Achievement of these goals will only be possible if investors in South Africa and Europe are able to trade across markets in an efficient way in the same instrument, which requires the cancellation of the Company's depository receipt programme.

The main features of the proposals are that the Reinet Luxembourg Shares which are to be listed on the JSE will be the same shares that are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Euronext Amsterdam and will carry the same rights.

Impact of the proposals

Subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from Euronext Amsterdam, the Reinet Luxembourg Shares will also be listed on Euronext Amsterdam. Further details in respect of the Euronext Amsterdam listing will be announced in due course.  

Subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from investors holding depository receipts, the Company's depository receipt programme will be cancelled. Currently, depository receipts trade in the ratio of ten depository receipts to one Reinet Luxembourg Share. For every ten depository receipts held at the time when the depository receipt programme is cancelled, investors will receive one Reinet Luxembourg Share which will, subject to JSE approval, be listed on the JSE. Further details in respect of the cancellation of the Company's depository receipt programme will be announced in due course, including the treatment of fractional entitlements.

Reinet Securities SA, which administers the Company's depository receipt programme, obtained a binding class ruling from the South African Revenue Service (the ""SARS Ruling"") confirming that the South African Revenue Service will regard the exchange of the Company's depository receipts for Reinet Luxembourg Shares as neither a disposal of the depository receipts nor an acquisition of the Reinet Luxembourg Shares. Accordingly, it is envisaged that the cancellation of the depository receipts will be tax neutral for South African resident investors, except where fractional entitlements are exchanged for cash.

A copy of the SARS Ruling will be made available on the Company's website in due course. Following the publication of further details in relation to the cancellation of the depository receipt programme, investors who are in any doubt as to their tax position (for example, holders of depository receipts who are resident outside South Africa) should contact a professional adviser.

After implementation of the cross-border trading arrangements, investors will be able to trade their Reinet Luxembourg Shares on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam or the JSE, via their usual bank or broker. For South African investors, foreign exchange regulations will apply as relevant for each investor. Further details in respect of the future cross-border trading arrangements will be announced in due course.

There is no need for holders of Reinet Luxembourg Shares or holders of depository receipts to do anything at this time.


Further information

Expected timetable of key dates for the Euronext Amsterdam listing, the cancellation of the Company's depository receipt programme and the listing of Reinet Luxembourg Shares on the JSE can be found at the Appendix to this announcement.

Reinet Securities SA – Exchange rate applicable for dividend payable in respect of DRs

To holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA,

Depository Receipt Code: REI

REINET SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE    RATE   APPLICABLE   FOR   DIVIDEND
PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF DRs

The dividend payable to holders of DRs is derived from the
dividend to be paid by Reinet to holders of Reinet shares.

The dividend in respect of the DRs is payable to South African
Common Monetary Area residents in South African rand via central
security depository participants in Strate for all dematerialised
holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited
for those on the certificated register.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.165 per share
from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be
approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting
to be held on Tuesday 29 August 2017 in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which
may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue
Service (‘SARS’) as to the treatment of any dividends to be
declared by Reinet and paid to holders of DRs. SARS confirmed to
Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as ‘foreign
dividends’ as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962.
Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African
dividend withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of DR holders
unless those DR holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-
resident holders of DRs are required to fill in the appropriate
SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

As DRs trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Reinet ordinary share,
the dividend entitlement per DR is as follows:

              Gross dividend    South African     Net dividend in
              per DR            dividend Tax      euros
              in euros          at 20%

              0.016500          (0.003300)        0.013200

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to South
African rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 15.74000 : Euro 1.
Accordingly the net dividend payable per DR is 20.77680 ZAR cents,
as set out in the table below:

                  Gross dividend       South African Net dividend
                  per DR               dividend tax   per DR
                  (in ZAR cents)       at 20%         (in ZAR cents)
                                       (in ZAR cents)

Total             25.97100             (5.19420)             20.77680

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the DRs is
anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade “cum dividend”           Tuesday, 5 September 2017

Trading commences “ex-dividend” from
the commencement of business on             Wednesday, 6 September 2017

DR dividend record date                     Friday, 8 September 2017

DR dividend payment date                    Friday, 15 September 2017

DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of
DRs between Wednesday, 6 September 2017 and Friday, 8 September
2017, both days inclusive.

DRs are issued subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement
entered into on 17 October 2008, most recently amended on
15 December 2010. By holding DRs, investors acknowledge that they
are bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Copies of the
Deposit Agreement may be obtained by investors from Reinet
Securities SA or Computershare Investor Services Proprietary
Limited.

Reinet Securities SA may appoint a depository agent or other
parties to assist in the administration of the DR programme and
may provide to such agents such information as it deems to be
appropriate, including information relating to the identity of
holders of DRs.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The decrease in the net asset value of EUR 182 million during the period is influenced by decreases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including BAT, Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited and United States land development and mortgages. The decrease in net asset value was offset by the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT'), the increase in estimated fair value of certain investments including the Trilantic funds together with decreases in the estimated fair values of borrowings mainly due to the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the period has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying the current period end exchange rates to the March 2017 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the March 2017 net asset value of some EUR 218 million.

Major items impacting the NAV and significant changes in carrying value during the period under review are described below:

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet received dividends from BAT during the period amounting to EUR 95 million (GBP 80 million), being BAT's final 2016 dividend.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 4 061 million at 30 June 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 4 249 million), being some 70 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 53.00 at 31 March 2017 to GBP 52.34 at 30 June 2017, this resulted in a decrease in value of EUR 51 million; the carrying value is also impacted by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 137 million.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
During the current period, Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') completed a GBP 60 million investment in the University of Essex student accommodation; concluded a pension insurance buy-in with the trustees of the 3i Group pension plan for a premium of some GBP 200 million; invested GBP 40 million in secured debt issued by Aldwyck Housing Group and reached an agreement with Retirement Advantage to fund equity release mortgages.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 165 million at 30 June 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 1 175 million). This value takes into account Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value at 31 March 2017, valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 30 June 2017 and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the relatively illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The decrease in the estimated fair value is mainly due to the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period, offset by increases in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector.

Further information on Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet's and its minority partners' investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 209 million at 30 June 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 202 million) of which EUR 10 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic management at 31 March 2017 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the valuation is due to additional capital invested, increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the period.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 113 million (31 March 2017: EUR 154 million), of which EUR 3 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2017: EUR 3 million).

The current valuation is based on recent management information adjusted for cash movements up to 30 June 2017. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects reductions in the expected rate of lot sales and lot prices, and revised future expenses. The decrease in value also reflects the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the period.

Further information on Arendale is available at www.arendale.com.

Further information on Reinet's investments may be found in the Reinet 2017 annual report which is available at www.Reinet.com.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in liquidity funds holding highly rated short-term commercial paper.

Reinet's cash and liquid funds increased from EUR 360 million at 31 March 2017 to EUR 408 million at 30 June 2017. During the period, the BAT dividend received amounted to some EUR 95 million and Reinet invested some EUR 9 million in underlying investments, including EUR 4 million in Trilantic Capital Partners and EUR 5 million in NanoDimension Funds and co-investment opportunities. Management fees of EUR 22 million, accrued as at 31 March 2017, were paid to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'). Distributions from investments amounted to EUR 11 million, interest paid amounted to EUR 7 million and other disbursements including foreign exchange impacts amounted to EUR 17 million.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES

BORROWINGS
In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America N.A which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. As at 31 March 2017 EUR 97 million (GBP 85 million) was drawn of which GBP 35 million is repayable in July 2017 and GBP 50 million in August 2017.

During early 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022.  At 30 June 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 569 million (GBP 499 million). The GBP 500 million financing transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction. As at 30 June 2017, the premium loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 83 million (GBP 73 million). Some 4.1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the premium loan and future interest payments.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 June 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 30 million (31 March 2017: EUR 31 million); the decrease in estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the period.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 27 million at 30 June 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 29 million). The decrease in the carrying value of the put option reflects the decrease in the time to maturity, the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period offset by the effect of the decrease in value of the underlying BAT shares.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 480 million (31 March 2017: ZAR 480 million). The derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 2 million at 30 June 2017 (31 March 2017: EUR 3 million). The change in value reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the period.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 16 million (31 March 2017: EUR 16 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 9 million (31 March 2017: EUR nil) in respect of a performance fee, EUR 12 million in respect of the management fee payable (31 March 2017: EUR 22 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 6 million (31 March 2017: EUR 7 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 26 million (31 March 2017: EUR 25 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 7 million (31 March 2017: EUR 10 million).

The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

REINET SECURITIES SA – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('REI DR')

The dividend payable to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA ('Reinet DRs') is derived from the dividend to be paid by Reinet Investments S.C.A., Luxembourg ('Reinet') in respect of the Reinet shares.

The Reinet DR dividend payable to South African Common Monetary Area residents is payable in rand and will be effected via central security depository participants in Strate for all dematerialised Reinet DR holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for Reinet DR holdings on the certificated register.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.165 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 29 August 2017 in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet DRs. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of Reinet DR holders unless those Reinet DR holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet DRs are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

As Reinet DRs trade in the ratio of 10 Reinet DRs to each Reinet ordinary share, the dividend entitlement per Reinet DR is as follows:

               Gross dividend    South African     Net dividend
               per Reinet DR     dividend Tax      per Reinet DR
               in euros          at 20%            in euros

               0.016500          (0.003300)        0.013200

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet DR dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday, 29 August 2017.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African Reinet DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""      Tuesday, 5 September 2017

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from
the commencement of business on        Wednesday, 6 September 2017

Reinet DR dividend record date         Friday, 8 September 2017

Reinet DR dividend payment date        Friday, 15 September 2017

Reinet DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of Reinet DRs between Wednesday, 6 September 2017 and Friday, 8 September 2017, both days inclusive.

Reinet DRs are issued subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement entered into on 17 October 2008, most recently amended on 15 December 2010. By holding Reinet DRs, investors acknowledge that they are bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Copies of the Deposit Agreement may be obtained by investors from Reinet Securities SA or Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited.

Reinet Securities SA may appoint a depository agent or other parties to assist in the administration of the Reinet DR programme and may provide to such agents such information as it deems to be appropriate, including information relating to the identity of holders of Reinet DRs.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTARY

Dear Shareholder,

Overview of results
During the course of the year under review, the Company's net asset value increased by 15 per cent to some EUR 6 billion at 31 March 2017. This increase reflects significant increases in the value of Reinet's investments in British American Tobacco and Pension Corporation, offset to some degree by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year.

Business developments
The investment in British American Tobacco represented some 70.8 per cent of Reinet's net asset value at 31 March 2017, compared to 67.3 per cent a year ago. This increase reflects the significant increase in the British American Tobacco share price from GBP 40.90 to GBP 53.00, the value of the holding of 68.1 million shares increasing to EUR 4 249 million at 31 March 2017. In 2016, British American Tobacco made a proposal to acquire the 57.8 per cent of Reynolds American which it did not already own. This, along with strong earnings, excellent growth across all business metrics and sterling depreciation, contributed to the significant increase in its share price. Reinet's investment in British American Tobacco is closely monitored and, although we have sold some shares in recent years to diversify Reinet's portfolio, the decision to maintain the position during the year under review has proved to be the correct one.

In June 2016, Reinet contributed GBP 139 million to a GBP 250 million capital increase by Pension Corporation and, in November 2016, the company raised a further GBP 250 million through the issuance of subordinated debt. The proceeds of these initiatives will support Pension Corporation in writing new business, as trustees of defined benefit pension funds and corporate decision makers continue to turn to wholesale insurance annuity products to de-risk pension fund and company balance sheets. Pension Corporation wrote some GBP 2.6 billion of new business in 2016 and continues to be well placed to benefit from this expanding market.

In the year under review, Reinet increased its total commitments by EUR 213 million and invested a total of EUR 290 million in new and existing portfolio assets.

Dividend
The Board of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes a dividend of EUR 0.165 per share, payable in September 2017. This represents an increase of 2.5 per cent over the dividend paid last year.

Changes to the board of overseers
The role of the Board of Overseers is to monitor the activities of both the Company and Reinet Fund. In addition, the Board acts as the audit committee of both the Company and Reinet Fund. Following the death of Dr Peter Kaul towards the end of the previous financial year, shareholders approved the appointment of Mr Stuart Rowlands at the 2016 annual general meeting. Mr Rowlands is Head of Financial Risk at the European Investment Bank, the development bank of the European Union, based in Luxembourg.

Outlook
The past twelve months have seen considerable upheaval in the global political environment, introducing further elements of uncertainty. The overall economic situation in the United States, Europe and Asia does, however, seem to be improving. Together with our partners, we see opportunities in the markets that we invest in and Reinet will continue to invest for the long-term, maintaining a prudent approach.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of our boards, management, the advisory team and our partners in the investee companies for their contribution to Reinet's performance during the year.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The increase in the net asset value of EUR 781 million during the year is influenced by the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including BAT and Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited. The increase in net asset value was offset by the payment of a dividend and expenses, together with decreases in the estimated fair values of certain investments, including 36 South and United States land development and mortgages, the settlement of derivative contracts associated with financing agreements and a decrease in value of certain derivative assets.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of sterling against the euro offset by the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying the current year end exchange rates to the March 2016 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the March 2016 net asset value of some EUR 243 million.

INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders.

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2 billion and at 31 March 2017 has committed to provide further funding of EUR 288 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below. The increase in commitments during the year under review amounted to EUR 213 million, and a total of EUR 290 million was funded during the year.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive of BAT, writing in its annual report for 2016 commented:

'Group revenue was up by 6.9% at constant rates of exchange, driven by good pricing. Reported revenue was 12.6% higher reflecting the transitional tailwind resulting from the relative weakness of sterling. On an organic basis, Group revenue was up by 5.3% at constant rates.

I am very pleased that we reached an agreement with the Board of Reynolds American in relation to the acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American that the Group does not currently own.

Our combustible tobacco business continues to perform extremely well and I am very pleased with the progress we are making with the Next Generation Products. Both would be made stronger by our proposed acquisition of Reynolds American, creating what will become a truly global tobacco and Next Generation Products company, delivering sustained long-term profit growth and returns.'

During the year under review, Reinet received dividends from BAT amounting to EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million), being BAT's final 2015 dividend and interim 2016 dividend. In May 2017, after the end of the financial year, Reinet received BAT's final dividend in respect of its 2016 financial year; this amounted to EUR 95 million (GBP 80 million) and is not included in the current reported year-end results.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 4 249 million at 31 March 2017, being some 71 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 40.90 at 31 March 2016 to GBP 53.00 at 31 March 2017. This increase in value is offset to some extent by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value, Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the net asset value of investment funds, discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples, as appropriate.

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc ('Pension Insurance Corporation') is one of the UK's leading providers of risk management solutions to defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation brings safety and security to scheme members' benefits through innovative, bespoke insurance solutions, which include deferred premiums and the use of company assets as part payment.

In June 2016, Pension Corporation raised GBP 250 million in additional capital; of this amount Reinet subscribed for an amount of EUR 179 million (GBP 139 million).

In November 2016, Pension Insurance Corporation raised a further GBP 250 million by the issuance of subordinated debt capital with an annual coupon of 8 per cent and a maturity of 10 years. The proceeds are to be used to meet projected demand from trustees of defined benefit pension funds for wholesale insurance annuity products. The bonds have been admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market.

In 2016, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension insurance business with premiums of GBP 2.6 billion. The result of the UK's referendum in June 2016 resulted in sharp falls in interest rates and increased currency and equity market volatility. Pension Insurance Corporation has been operating under the Solvency II framework of governance since 1 January 2016 and has effectively dealt with the continued volatility caused by the UK's referendum.

At 31 December 2016, Pension Insurance Corporation had GBP 22.6 billion in assets (31 December 2015: GBP 16.6 billion) and had insured more than 134 000 pension fund members (31 December 2015: 132 000). Clients include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals and the public sector.

Tracy Blackwell, Chief Executive Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation commented:

'As a specialist insurer our purpose is straightforward to define: it is to pay the pensions of our policyholders, both now and for the full term of their policies with us. Our expertise and specialisation has allowed us to develop a deep understanding of the factors that could prevent us fulfilling this purpose, as well as a robust, sophisticated approach to managing risk. So we were well positioned to meet the challenges of 2016, including the implementation of Solvency II, significant market volatility caused by political risk, and the poor funding position of many defined benefit pension funds, and therefore to take the opportunities that arose to continue building the business.

I am therefore delighted, but not at all surprised, that the company continued to perform very well through the year. Pension Insurance Corporation insured GBP 2.6 billion of pension liabilities in 2016 on terms consistent with our long-term IRR targets, and maintained our long-term market share of about 26 per cent. Our solvency ratio increased to 164 per cent at the year end, due to capital raised during 2016, but also the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. Pension Insurance Corporation is very much in a growth phase, building an asset pool which will throw off increasingly large cash flows for very many years. As a result of this our underlying operating profit was GBP 177 million, up from GBP 133 million last year, reflecting our continued growth and store of long-term future profits.

Alongside our exceptional customer service track record, the company has an enviable financial track record, demonstrating consistent growth and significant value generation over many years.'

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 175 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 920 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation's audited embedded value at 31 December 2016 of GBP 2.6 billion (31 December 2015: GBP 1.9 billion), valuation multiples drawn from industry data and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet's investment.

The increase in estimated fair value is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects new business written in the year and the effect of changing economic variables, together with the capital increase in the year ended 31 December 2016; this increase in estimated fair value is offset by a 2 per cent decrease in comparable company valuation multiples derived from public information relating to listed companies in the UK insurance sector. The increase in estimated fair value is further reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
Where Reinet invests in funds managed by third parties its philosophy is to partner with the managers of such funds and to share in fees generated by funds under management. This is the case with funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners, 36 South Capital Advisors, Milestone Capital, Prescient Investment Management China and Vanterra Capital. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the 'Investment Advisory Agreement'), entered into by the Fund Manager and Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'), Reinet pays no management fee to the Investment Advisor on such investments except in the case where no fee or a reduced fee below 1 per cent is paid to the third-party manager. In such cases, the aggregate fee payable to the Investment Advisor and the third-party manager is capped at 1 per cent.

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners ('Trilantic') is a global private equity firm focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in North America and Western Europe. Trilantic employs flexible transaction structures and has a strong heritage of partnering with family-owned businesses and providing growth capital to management teams. Trilantic primarily targets investments in the consumer, energy, industrials, technology, media and telecommunications, financial and business services sectors, and currently manages six private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments of USD 7.7 billion.

Reinet and its minority partners invest in the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together 'Trilantic Management') and four of the six current funds under Trilantic's management. The terms of investment applicable to Reinet's investment in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P., Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P., Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. and Trilantic Energy Partners (North America)  L.P. provide that Reinet will not pay any management fees or carried interest. In addition, Reinet receives a share of the carried interest payable on the realisation of investments held in the funds, once a hurdle rate has been achieved.

Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. is in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the year under review, distributions of some EUR 7 million were received.

In 2013 and 2014, Reinet committed to invest in Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P., Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., and their respective general partners. These US based funds are focused on North American opportunities with Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. being especially focused on the oil and gas sector. These funds continue to build their portfolios with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 33 million and receiving capital repayments of some EUR 4 million in the year under review.

Charlie Ayres, Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners, commented:

'We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the outlook of U.S. domestic companies in general and believe that patience and duration are necessary to battle the continued headwinds on the energy front. We will continue adhering to our investment discipline, which we believe has been critical in protecting capital, enhancing value and maximizing returns. We have both fully monetized and strategically partially monetized companies that have reached maturity, while methodically putting capital to work where we find attractive investment opportunities that can drive appropriate risk-adjusted returns.

Patience and flexibility remain essential in our deployment of capital. We continue to strive to build value in our existing portfolio and focus on having our mature companies exit-ready to take advantage of attractive market dynamics.'

Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. is also in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the year under review, distributions of some EUR 3 million were received.

Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, Chairman of Trilantic Europe, commented:

'2016 was a year where, globally, politics had a major role in valuations, both in public and private equity markets. The perception of an improving global macro environment in investors' minds became partially clouded by, in sequence, Brexit, then Donald Trump's unexpected victory, followed by the failed Italian referendum. The volatility of the first two quarters was overcome by positive momentum even in the aftermath of these truly unexpected political outcomes. It therefore appears that the markets are attracted more by low interest rates and abundant liquidity than scared by the prospects of a new world political landscape. Over the last 12 months, in addition to actively managing the portfolio, we made two new transactions for Trilantic Europe V, both being true to Trilantic Europe's strategy of making primary investments by acquiring directly from the founders and achieving transactions that are negotiated on a bilateral basis, outside of a competitive auction process.'

Reinet's and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and all the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 202 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 143 million) of which EUR 10 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on audited and unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2016 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the valuation is due to additional capital invested, increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year, offset by distributions of EUR 14 million.

During the year under review, gains of EUR 13 million and carried interest of EUR 4 million were received.

36 SOUTH MACRO/VOLATILITY FUNDS
36 South Capital Advisors LLP ('36 South') is an absolute return fund manager that specialises in managing global macro/volatility funds. 36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes.  Its global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments but to substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility.

Reinet has co-invested with the 36 South management team in the fund management and distribution companies. Reinet is also an investor in the following 36 South funds:

The 36 South Black Eyrar Fund; a left tail-risk protection strategy investing in volatility across all asset classes and geographical areas. The fund is designed to deliver significant returns should some or all financial asset markets suffer a lower tail-risk event, ie an asset price move of greater than three standard deviations towards lower equity markets, lower bond yields, lower commodities and higher currency volatility. The fund invests up to 95 per cent in options and investment levels will be decided upon based on these opportunities.

The Kohinoor Core Fund; a global macro/long volatility strategy which aims to achieve significant returns with commensurate risk over a medium to long term investment period. It is designed to generate performance in a variety of market environments as the fund managers have extensive experience in identifying mis-valued assets whilst maintaining a mix of bullish and bearish positions. The fund invests up to 95 per cent in options and is a more concentrated version of the highly successful Kohinoor Series Funds.

Richard Haworth, Chief Executive Officer of 36 South, commented as follows:

'36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes. Our global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments, but substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility. Consequently our funds are positioned in client portfolios with diversification and capital protection in mind.

Our funds main profit driver is volatility. Volatility in financial markets has been dampened significantly by Central Bank action and low interest rates. Consequently volatility is at multiyear lows which affects our performance negatively in the short term. However, longer term this ”drought” in volatility presents us with opportunities to populate our funds with cheap convexity which, if and when volatility returns, will result in significant outperformance. This outperformance generally comes at a time when our clients need it i.e. risk aversion periods, which makes the contribution all the more valuable.

Total 36 South assets under management have decreased from USD 941 million as at 31 March 2016 to USD 718 million as at 31 March 2017.

We continue to believe that volatility will experience some mean reversion given the current global macro environment.'

The investment in the funds is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 42 million, based on unaudited financial information received from the fund manager as at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 54 million). The estimated fair value of the investment in the fund management and distribution companies amounted to EUR 7 million (31 March 2016: EUR 8 million). The investments in total have an estimated fair value of EUR 49 million (31 March 2016: EUR 62 million). The change in valuation reflects the movement in the value of the underlying investments held by the funds.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS
Milestone China Opportunities funds, investment holdings and management company participation
Reinet has invested along with Milestone Capital in a management company based in Shanghai, and has also invested in certain funds and investment companies managed by Milestone Capital (together 'Milestone').

Milestone Capital has a strong track record in helping portfolio companies scale their operations and be listed on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges. Funds under management invest primarily in domestic Chinese high-growth companies seeking expansion or acquisition capital. Milestone funds seek to maximise medium- to long-term capital appreciation by making direct investments to acquire minority or majority equity stakes in those companies identified by Milestone's investment team. Current areas of investment include: restaurants; biopharmaceutical manufacturers; medical device manufacturers; food and beverage distribution; brands covering sportswear and apparel; big data services; e-commerce; power generation equipment; retail pharmacies and online education.

Yunli Lou, Managing Partner of Milestone Capital, commented:

'During the full year of 2016, Milestone deployed USD 12.0 million to three investments in healthcare and internet / new economy sectors, including two follow-on investments into existing portfolio companies to support their further growth. We continued to work closely with our portfolio companies on key strategic initiatives. During 2016, three of our portfolio companies completed new rounds of equity financing at valuations significantly higher than when we invested, and two companies filed for IPOs. We also fully exited from our investment in an online travel company with total proceeds of USD 10.7 million, or an IRR of 9.2 per cent over the investment period.

At a macro level, China's GDP growth further slowed down to 6.7 per cent, the lowest in 26 years. The consumer and services sectors continued to drive the growth, with an increase of 7.8 per cent compared to 3.3 per cent of the primary industry and 6.1 per cent of the secondary industry. During the past year, China continued its economic ”new normal state” with more moderate, consumer and services-driven growth. While the growth rate has decelerated from the double-digit golden era to the lowest in over a quarter of a century, the significant size and structural shift of the Chinese economy still provides abundant opportunities for investments, especially in consumer related areas such as consumption upgrade, healthcare, education, as well as supporting infrastructure such as e-commerce and big data.'

The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of EUR 135 million (31 March 2016: EUR 113 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2016 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2017. The change in estimated fair value reflects increases in the value of listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro.

Prescient China Balanced Fund and investment management company
Prescient China Balanced Fund ('Prescient China') is a fund managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited, a South African-listed fund manager. The fund invests in equities, bonds, cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. It invests principally in instruments listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.

Liang Du, Portfolio Manager of Prescient China, commented:

'The financial year ending March 2017 was a tough year for Chinese assets, with a 65 per cent equity, 35 per cent cash benchmark delivering 0 per cent return in US dollar terms. The fund, through good asset allocation as well as securities selections, was up 7.2 per cent in US dollar terms. This reflects the continued success of our models.  Over the longer term, the fund continues to deliver very strong returns, up 22.7 per cent p.a. over the past 3 years and 14 per cent p.a. since inception.  The fund continues to be very competitive vs. its peers ranking in the top 1 per cent of Asia focussed dynamic allocation funds in Bloomberg since inception.

The Chinese economy itself is showing some of the strongest economic numbers over the past eighteen months, moving out of deflation into mild inflation.  Growth has started to surprise on the upside, with both manufacturing as well as services Purchasing Managers Indices in strong positive territory.

Asset raising for Chinese funds remains challenging in the current environment.  AUM in the financial year remain similar to the start of the year.'

Reinet invests in Prescient China and in the management company. These investments are carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 47 million based on unaudited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 42 million). The increase in estimated fair value over the year under review is the result of increases in the value of underlying listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

SPECIALISED INVESTMENT FUNDS
Vanterra Flex Investments L.P.
Vanterra Flex Investments L.P. ('Vanterra') was established in 2010 to invest in privately issued securities and to make direct investments in the US and emerging markets. Vanterra seeks to construct a globally diversified private equity portfolio providing investors with long-term capital appreciation. Vanterra has co-invested alongside Reinet in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P., United States land development and mortgages, and Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials. Vanterra also has investments in established platforms in US healthcare, small business credit, distressed general partner secondaries and Brazil.

Reinet is an investor in both Vanterra and in its general partner.

This investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 30 million at 31 March 2017, based on unaudited financial information as at 31 December 2016, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2016: EUR 30 million).

In April 2017, Reinet reached agreement in principle with Vanterra and its general partner that Vanterra will be unwound, resulting in the underlying assets being transferred to and held directly by Reinet.

Further information on Vanterra is available at www.vanterra.com.

Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials
Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials ('Vanterra C Change TEM') was established in July 2010 to invest in companies and projects providing products or services that supply cleaner energy; create a more cost-effective building environment through the use of energy efficient technologies; and develop renewable resources as a substitute for fossil and other traditional fuels.

Reinet is a direct and indirect investor in Vanterra C Change TEM and in its general partner.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 23 million at 31 March 2017, based on audited financial information as at 31 December 2016, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2016: EUR 23 million).

NanoDimension funds and co-investment opportunities
Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension I and II Limited Partnerships.  The focus of each fund is to invest in and support the establishment, technology development and scale up, growth and commercialisation of companies leveraging the advancement of new atomic and molecular structures. Product applications range from molecular diagnostics, immuno-oncology, immuno-tolerance, organs on chip, DNA synthesis to energy storage and electrochromic glass.

Aymeric Sallin, Founder of NanoDimension Management Ltd, commented:

'2016 was a record year for NanoDimension in terms of investment activity with 6 new investments. This acceleration reflects the increased quality of our deal flow, the culmination of over 10 years of work together as a team and the fact that talented and experienced teams are now leveraging the technological building blocks developed over the last decade to engineer disruptive products and rapidly bring them to market. For example, Twist moved from concept to selling genes through an e-commerce platform in less than 4 years. In line with this maturity, we are seeing many companies moving away from components or materials towards building full systems and products. Data generated by those systems and products is becoming more important and valuable thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Combined with innovative business models the potential additional value could be significant. Investing at the convergence of the technologies that organized atoms and molecules is a pillar of the 4th industrial revolution and we are thrilled to contribute to its success.'

At 31 March 2017, the estimated fair value of Reinet's investment in the two funds and a co-investment amounted to EUR 44 million (31 March 2016: EUR 48 million). The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 31 December 2016, together with an independent valuation of the co-investment. The decrease in estimated fair value reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Fountainhead Expert Fund
Fountainhead Expert Fund ('Fountainhead') is a fund investing in a concentrated manner in global equities offering superior potential for capital appreciation and value realisation by benchmarking themselves to global inflation and striving for absolute real returns through time.

Andre Cillie, Managing Partner of Andre Cillie Capital Management (Pty) Limited, manager of Fountainhead, commented:

'The fund has rebounded significantly over the last year in terms of performance but we remain very constructive about the return prospects for the fund over the next few years. Markets overall are not cheap and finding new investment ideas with a significant margin of safety is proving difficult. We believe the investment environment for the next few years, unlike what we have experienced since the financial crisis, will reward bottom up concentrated stock picking.

While the last two years have been painful, at no stage did we fall in the trap of buying stocks above intrinsic value, in fact we added to the most undervalued companies as prices collapsed. While we bought early, the fact that stocks declined significantly below even the discounted levels we bought does not change the value proposition. In fact, in many instances given that management has been aggressively buying back shares at ever greater discounts has simply amplified the future returns we would have expected. This rebound has now started and we are once again outperforming, but we believe the move is very much in its infancy.'

At 31 March 2017, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 29 million based on the unaudited valuation at that date provided by the fund manager (31 March 2016: EUR 19 million). The increase in estimated fair value is the result of increases in the value of underlying listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Snow Phipps funds and co-investment opportunities
Snow Phipps Group ('Snow Phipps') is a private equity firm focused on lower middle-market control investments. Snow Phipps seeks to invest USD 50 million to USD 150 million of equity in market-leading companies primarily headquartered in North America with enterprise values between USD 100 million and USD 500 million.

Snow Phipps primarily targets investments in the industrial, consumer and business services sectors, and currently manages three private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments of USD 2.4 billion.

In 2011, Reinet committed to invest in Snow Phipps II, L.P. In the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment to Snow Phipps III, L.P. the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. In addition, in the current year, Reinet committed to invest in two co-investment opportunities.

Ian K. Snow, CEO and Partner of Snow Phipps, commented:

'Since our inception in 2005, Snow Phipps has focused on the same operationally driven strategy of investing in companies with attractive growth dynamics and defensible market positions.  Our latest fund, Snow Phipps III, L.P., is a continuation of a decade-long history of successfully partnering with retained senior executives (our Operating Partners) and strong management teams to deliver superior returns for investors. Despite a competitive deal-making environment, in 2016 we already began executing this investment strategy in Fund III, completing two new platform investments, as well as several add-on acquisitions.  In June 2016, Snow Phipps acquired Electric Guard Dog, a market leader in electric fences in the United States, and subsequently completed the add-on of Perimeter Security Systems.  Also in June 2016, Snow Phipps acquired Winchester Electronics, a leading provider of custom engineered interconnect solutions for high reliability applications, and has subsequently completed two add-on acquisitions.  In addition, for Snow Phipps II, L.P., we completed our final platform investment in June 2016 of ECRM, a business services provider of sourcing solutions for retailers and product manufacturers.  In 2016, we deployed over USD 230 million in Fund II and Fund III equity commitments combined.  In addition, we continue to build value in the existing Snow Phipps portfolio and are also focusing on preparing our mature companies to be exit-ready.'

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 48 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 8 million), the increase in value being mainly due to additional capital invested in the year.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com

JPS Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd.
The investment in JPS Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd. ('JPS Credit Fund'), which was the first transaction introduced to Reinet by Renshaw Bay, focuses on liquid opportunities in the credit markets. JPS Credit Fund is managed by JP Morgan Asset Management.

JPS Credit Fund's investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through both capital appreciation and current income by taking positions in publicly traded and privately held securities, derivatives and other instruments (including bonds, credit default swaps and index options), primarily in credit and credit-related markets.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 94 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 84 million) based on the valuation at that date provided by the fund manager.

The increase in estimated fair value during the year is due to increases in the value of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

GAM Real Estate Finance Fund
The GAM Real Estate Finance Fund ('REFF') was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its investment strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with primary focus on the UK. At December 2016, REFF held 21 investments.

Jon Rickert, Investment Director of GAM, commented:

'The Real Estate Finance Fund invested in a diversified portfolio of 25 self-originated, private loans secured by commercial and residential real estate in Western Europe. The fund's investment objectives are to generate a dividend yield of 6 to 8 per cent per annum and a total net return of circa. 10 per cent while protecting against a material, downward adjustment in real estate values. The fund's last investment was completed in the second quarter of 2016, and income and principal are being distributed on a regular basis consistent with the fund's objectives. Through the end of 2016, four of the fund's 25 investments had been fully realised generating a gross IRR above 15 per cent. The fund's remaining investments had an average loan-to-value ratio under 70 per cent at year-end 2016.

The result of the UK's referendum in June 2016 initially impacted UK property prices, however this has been followed by relatively stable performance of the UK economy and commercial real estate market. Management of the fund expect the uncertainty created by Brexit negotiations to begin to weigh on the UK economy over the next couple of years; Europe will not be unaffected either. However, due to active performance monitoring, management remains confident about the performance of the fund.'

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 75 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 83 million) based on audited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2016.

The decrease in estimated fair value is mainly due to repayments of capital in the year, mostly owing to early settlement of loans, together with the weakening of sterling against the euro.

Other fund investments
This includes small, specialist funds investing in private equity businesses, start-up ventures and listed securities. These investments are valued at their estimated fair value of EUR 4 million at 31 March 2017 based on valuation statements received from the fund managers (31 March 2016: EUR 5 million).

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
Reinet has invested both directly and with partners to acquire interests in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets. This latter investment is known as Arendale.

John Kunkel, Chief Executive Officer of Arendale Holdings Corporation, commented:

'United States land development and mortgages is opportunistically invested in numerous real estate and hospitality assets throughout the United States through two distinct property portfolios.

The Arendale portfolio includes several premier golf course communities that are positioned in the luxury segment of the market. Arendale acquired these properties as distressed assets and continues to employ a patient approach to value realization. Although revenues for our most recent fiscal year (for both real estate sales and club operations) increased by 21 per cent while operating expenses decreased by 9 per cent, we still have a way to go to break even.

The Legacy portfolio is comprised of properties primarily located in metropolitan areas and sold to production-oriented builders for construction of homes at prices that appeal to the general public. During the past year, we generated substantial cash flow from the sale of Legacy assets and continued to create value in others through the land development and entitlement process.'

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 154 million (31 March 2016: EUR 164 million), of which EUR 3 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2016: EUR 2 million).

The current valuation is based on audited financial statements as at 31 December 2016 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2017. The decrease in the estimated fair value primarily reflects reductions in the expected rate of lot sales along with increases in discount rates used to calculate fair value, offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

Further information on Arendale is available at www.arendale.com.

DIAMOND INTERESTS
Reinet has invested in two projects in South Africa. Firstly, in an entity which extracts diamonds from the waste tailings of mining operations which began over a century ago at Jagersfontein in South Africa.  Developments in extraction technology since Jagersfontein was first mined, now allow the waste tailings to be reprocessed to recover gemstones. In addition, Reinet has an interest in a separate project, which has acquired rights to mine diamonds on a previously unexploited site at Rooipoort near Kimberley in South Africa. Both entities are fully operational and continue to repay loans to Reinet.

Henk van Zuydam, Chief Financial Officer of both projects, commented as follows:

'The rough diamond market experienced a tough trading year as the industry had to deal with a number of disruptive exogenous factors. Arguably the most significant event impacting on the industry was the decision by the Indian authorities to demonetise the large denomination Rupee notes. In the short term it had a significant effect on the Indian buyers, specifically on the smaller goods. However, based on the most recent tender held, the short-term negative effect of the demonetisation has started to normalise.

The rough diamond market has remained resilient in demand, which is evident in the continued high attendance of buyers throughout the Companies' sales channels both in South Africa and in Antwerp.

Jagersfontein achieved solid financial results for the financial year. This was realised through the continued drive for operational efficiencies in conjunction with the recovery of a number of higher value diamonds, which resulted in increased revenue.

Rooipoort experienced a tough year, with a number of operational challenges including a prolonged period of labour unrest and lower than expected revenue due to the yield of diamonds being lower than expected in the area that is currently being mined.'

In total, these projects are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 56 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 59 million) based on discounted cash flow projections. The decrease in estimated fair value mainly reflects repayment of loans and interest in the year amounting to EUR 8 million, offset by the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

Reinet has borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in these projects and entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 480 million (31 March 2016: ZAR 550 million) in order to mitigate currency risk.

OTHER INVESTMENTS
The decrease in the estimated fair value of other investments relates mostly to the investment in a digital music industry initiative with an estimated fair value of EUR 15 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 25 million), reflecting start-up costs and intellectual property development expenditure.

There were no other significant changes in value in respect of other investments, either as a result of movements in the valuation of underlying investments, further amounts invested or returns of capital.

COMMITTED FUNDS
Funding commitments are entered into in various currencies including sterling, US dollar and South African rand and are converted into euro using 31 March 2017 exchange rates.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks and in a liquidity fund holding highly rated short-term commercial paper.

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash and liquid funds                                                          EUR 360 m
Undrawn borrowing facility                                                     EUR 194 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)                 (EUR 288 m)
Cash required to meet short-term sterling borrowing obligations               (EUR 101 m)
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations                               (EUR  31 m)

The borrowing facility comprises a revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A. of GBP 250 million. At 31 March 2017, EUR 101 million (GBP 85 million) of this facility had been drawn and is repayable within six months. Some 3.2 million BAT shares have been pledged to collateralise the amount borrowed as at 31 March 2017.

Medium-term bank borrowings of EUR 681 million will be settled by the exercise of put options over BAT shares or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings or settled by available cash.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
BORROWINGS
In 2012, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million, medium-term collar financing arrangement; in accordance with the loan repayment terms, this loan was repaid between December 2016 and March 2017.

During 2017, Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, which runs to 2022.  At 31 March 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 591 million (GBP 502 million).  The transaction includes the purchase by Reinet of put options over approximately 15.5 million BAT shares for a premium of some EUR 92 million (GBP 79 million) payable over the life of the transaction. The premium loan is carried as a liability at an estimated fair value of EUR 90 million (GBP 77 million). Some 4.5 million BAT shares have also been pledged to collateralise the premium loan and future interest payments. As part of this agreement a portion of BAT shares are on loan to Merrill Lynch International. The Company retains the economic benefit of all shares on loan.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 March 2017, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 31 million (31 March 2016: EUR 26 million); the increase in estimated fair value is due to the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro during the year.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
As part of the aforementioned GBP 500 million medium-term financing arrangement, Reinet purchased put options which provide protection should the value of the BAT shares used to secure the borrowings fall below a certain amount. Proceeds received as a result of the put options being exercised could be used to repay the amounts borrowed in full. The put options are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 29 million at the balance sheet date. The cost of the put options is considered as part of the overall cost of financing and is included in the fair value adjustment on outstanding contracts in the income statement below.

Along with its repayment of the aforementioned GBP 300 million borrowing, Reinet cash settled associated call options in an amount of EUR 131 million (GBP 112 million) in the year. The estimated fair value of these options at 31 March 2016 was EUR 80 million (GBP 63 million); the fair value of these options increased during the period before settlement in line with the increase in the BAT share price. These settlement costs are considered as part of the overall cost of financing and are reflected as other financing expenses in the income statement.

In 2012, Reinet chose to borrow GBP 300 million as opposed to selling approximately 9.6 million BAT shares and by doing so has retained the appreciation and dividend income on these BAT shares. The costs noted above are offset by dividends received of some GBP 63 million over the last five years and appreciation of the BAT shares of some GBP 208 million between February 2012 and 31 March 2017.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 480 million (31 March 2016: ZAR 550 million). The derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 3 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: asset of EUR 2 million). The change in value reflects the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 16 million (31 March 2016: EUR 15 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 22 million in respect of the half-yearly management fee payable as at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 22 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 7 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 25 million (31 March 2016: EUR 18 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 10 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 5 million) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee (if applicable) and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

(1) The reversal of the unrealised gain on shares sold represents the unrealised gain as at 1 April 2015 on the 6.25 million BAT shares sold during the year ended 31 March 2016.
(2) The reversal of the unrealised loss on derivative contracts represents the unrealised fair value of EUR 80 million as at 1 April 2016 on loan related derivative contracts settled during the year ended 31 March 2017; along with the original premium cost of EUR 55 million.
(3) The reversal of the unrealised loss on borrowings represents the unrealised loss as at 1 April 2016 on borrowings repaid during the year ended 31 March 2017.


INCOME
Dividends received from BAT decreased from EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million) during the year under review to EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million). The decrease is due to the reduction in the number of BAT shares held following the sales in February and March 2016 together with the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments, offset by an increase of GBP 0.06 in the total dividend per BAT share. The dividends received from BAT during the year represent the final 2015 dividend paid in May 2016, as well as the interim 2016 dividend paid in September 2016.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits and loans made to underlying investments.

Realised gains on investments of EUR 13 million were mainly in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds. Reinet's share of the Trilantic gains amounts to EUR 12 million with a further EUR 1 million being attributable to the minority partner.

Losses of EUR 4 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

Carried interest of EUR 4 million was attributable to Reinet in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

EXPENSES
The management fee for the year ended 31 March 2017 amounts to EUR 48 million (31 March 2016: EUR 46 million).

No performance fee is payable for the year ended 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: EUR 5 million) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2017, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods.

Operating expenses of EUR 6 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner') and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 5 million.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand-denominated borrowings.

Other financing expenses include the cost of settlement of call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement which amounted to EUR 131 million (GBP 112 million). Reinet cash settled the liability and in doing so retained the underlying BAT shares, the future BAT dividends and the potential increase in value of the shares. The total expense of the collar over the period of the loan amounted to EUR 186 million (GBP 156 million). Fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the collar have been recorded as fair value adjustments in prior years (see below); these have been reversed following settlement.

In 2012, Reinet chose to borrow GBP 300 million as opposed to selling approximately 9.6 million BAT shares and by doing so has retained the appreciation and dividend income on these BAT shares. The costs noted above are offset by dividends received of some GBP 63 million over the last five years and appreciation of the BAT shares of some GBP 208 million between February 2012 and 31 March 2017.

The net tax expense of EUR 2 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic funds and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares increased in value by EUR 737 million during the year under review. Of this, EUR 970 million was attributable to the increase in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms offset by EUR 233 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year under review.

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 77 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 76 million, an increase in the estimated fair value of the Trilantic funds of EUR 29 million, offset by decreases in the estimated fair value of the investments in United States land development and mortgages, 36 South and certain other investments. The above amounts include the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the depreciation of sterling and the appreciation of the US dollar and South African rand against the euro in the year under review.

The collar financing derivative liability was settled in the year, thereby reversing the previously recorded unrealised loss of EUR 135 million. The put options purchased in the year under review decreased in value by EUR 63 million reflecting, in part, the increase in value of BAT shares in the period since the options were issued. The estimated fair value of the forward exchange contracts decreased by EUR 4 million, thereby changing from an asset at the beginning of the year to a liability at the end of the year, reflecting the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates. An unrealised loss of EUR 5 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. An unrealised gain of EUR 31 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing which was repaid during the year. Of this, EUR 28 million is due to the weakening of sterling against the euro.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partners' shares in the earnings of the Reinet entities which hold the Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages interests, respectively.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Investments totalling EUR 262 million were made during the year, including Pension Corporation, Selecta, United States land development and mortgages, Trilantic and Snow Phipps. Amounts invested were partially offset by repayments in respect of loans and interest received from Jagersfontein and Rooipoort, and distributions from REFF and other investments.

Proceeds from the sale of investments include EUR 17 million realised through Trilantic, and EUR 3 million on the sale of other investments.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
A dividend of some EUR 32 million was paid to shareholders in September 2016 (September 2015: EUR 31 million).

Financing expenses for the settlement of call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement amounted to GBP 112 million (EUR 131 million).

In addition, EUR 4 million was paid in respect of the settlement of euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

Net bank borrowings amounted to GBP 285 million in the year. The GBP 300 million, medium-term loan was repaid to Deutsche Bank A.G. in accordance with the loan repayment terms and Reinet entered into a GBP 500 million, medium-term financing arrangement with Merrill Lynch International, that runs to 2022. In addition, Reinet borrowed GBP 85 million from Bank of America, N.A. under a revolving facility agreement.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Dividends received from BAT decreased from EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million) during the year under review to EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million). The decrease is due to the reduction in the number of BAT shares held following the sales in February and March 2016 together with the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments, offset by an increase of GBP 0.06 in total dividend per share. The dividends received from BAT during the year represent the final 2015 dividend paid in May 2016, as well as the interim 2016 dividend paid in September 2016.

Carried interest of EUR 4 million was received in respect of the investment in Trilantic.

Interest of EUR 8 million was paid in respect of the sterling-denominated loans and EUR 3 million in respect of the South African rand-denominated loan in the year.

The performance fee of EUR 5 million was paid in respect of the year ending 31 March 2016. No performance fee is payable in respect of the current year.

Net US tax repayments of EUR 1 million were received in the year under review. This amount includes taxes withheld by Trilantic in respect of gains and carried interest received, together with estimated taxes paid on gains and income which will be taxable in the US.

Cash and liquid funds decreased by EUR 20 million over the year to EUR 360 million as the amounts repaid in respect of bank borrowings and derivative liabilities, together with amounts invested in new investments, payment of the dividend, performance fee and operating expenses exceeded amounts realised from investments and new bank financing received.

DIVIDEND
The Company relies on distributions from Reinet Fund as its principal source of income from which it may pay dividends.

A cash dividend of EUR 0.161 per share totalling some EUR 32 million was paid in September 2016, following approval at the annual general meeting on 30 August 2016.

The General Partner has proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.165 per share subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 29 August 2017.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by the Company.

The Company has sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of the Company's shares ('DRs'). SARS has confirmed that any such dividends will be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends will be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of DR holders unless those holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident DR holders will be required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

The dividend will be payable in accordance with the following schedule, subject to shareholder approval:

The last day to trade the Company's shares and the DRs cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 5 September 2017. Both the Company's shares and the DRs will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 6 September 2017. The record date for the Company's shares will be Thursday, 7 September 2017 and for the DRs will be Friday, 8 September 2017.

The dividend on the Company's shares will be paid on Friday, 8 September 2017 and is payable in euro.

The dividend in respect of the DRs will be paid on Friday, 15 September 2017. The DR dividend is payable in South African rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in euro to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to DR holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 23 May 2017 on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service ('SENS').

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

Net asset value statement as at 31 March 2017

As at 31 March 2017, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 6 004 million, an increase of EUR 522 million from 31 December 2016.

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 31 March 2017. The NAV calculation is subject to completion of the year-end audit.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 31 March 2017. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The decrease in the NAV of EUR 30 million during the quarter is largely a result of movements in the fair value of British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') and increases in the estimated fair value of loans payable. Partially offsetting these decreases in NAV are the increase in the estimated fair value of Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, a decrease in the estimated fair value of derivative liabilities associated with the collar financing due to a decrease in the BAT share price, and the effect of the strengthening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the quarter.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the appreciation of other currencies against the euro has resulted in an increase in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current quarter end exchange rates to the September 2016 assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in value of some EUR 127 million.

Major items impacting the NAV and significant changes in carrying value during the quarter under review are described below.

LISTED INVESTMENTS

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 690 million at 31 December 2016, being 67 per cent of Reinet's NAV (30 September 2016: EUR 3 874 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange decreased from GBP 49.30 at 30 September 2016 to GBP 46.20 at 31 December 2016. This decrease in value is offset to some extent by the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the quarter.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

Reinet's investment in Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 122 million at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 1 070 million). This value takes into account Reinet's estimate of Pension Corporation's embedded value at 30 September 2016 and valuation multiples drawn from industry data at 31 December 2016.
The increase in estimated fair value at 31 December 2016 reflects increases over the quarter under review in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector. The estimated fair value is further increased by the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the quarter. Reinet retained the 10 per cent additional valuation adjustment previously applied largely allowing for the lack of ready liquidity for this investment.
Of interest, in the final six months of the 2016 calendar year, PIC insured GBP 140 million of the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund, GBP 250 million of the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme and GBP 230 million of the Pilkington Scheme. It also completed a GBP 150 million pensioner buy-in and invested in Hertfordshire Housing. In January 2017, PIC signed a GBP 190 million pensioner buyout of the GKN Group Pension Scheme and a GBP 90 million Civil Aviation Authority Pension Scheme buy-in. The new business pipeline remains encouraging.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet's and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and related funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 186 million at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 161 million) of which EUR 9 million (30 September 2016: EUR 9 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 September 2016 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to capital contributions of EUR 10 million, increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the quarter.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.

SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

SNOW PHIPPS FUNDS AND CO-INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
In 2011, Reinet committed to invest up to USD 10 million (EUR 10 million) in Snow Phipps II, L.P. In the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment of USD 100 million (EUR 95 million) to Snow Phipps III, L.P. the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. In addition, in the current year Reinet committed USD 20 million (EUR 19 million) to two co-investment opportunities.
Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 50 million at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 37 million), the increase in value being due to additional capital invested of EUR 10 million, and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the quarter.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 158 million (30 September 2016: EUR 149 million), of which EUR 3 million is attributable to minority partners (30 September 2016: EUR 2 million).

The current valuation is based on unaudited financial statements as at 30 June 2016 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 December 2016. The increase in the valuation reflects additional net capital contributions of EUR 3 million in the quarter along with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro, offset by provisions against certain estimated land values.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European banks. 

Reinet's cash and liquid funds decreased from EUR 194 million at 30 September 2016 to EUR 46 million at 31 December 2016. Reinet invested some EUR 27 million in underlying investments, including EUR 10 million in Trilantic Capital Partners and EUR 10 million in Snow Phipps III, L.P. Management fees of EUR 21 million, accrued as at 30 September 2016, were paid to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'). Amounts paid to settle bank borrowings and related call options totalled EUR 108 million, distributions from investments amounted to EUR 11 million and other disbursements including interest paid amounted to EUR 3 million.

In December 2016, Reinet entered into borrowing facilities with Bank of America N.A which permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 250 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. At 31 December 2016, these facilities had not been drawn upon. In January 2017 GBP 35 million was drawn with repayment due after 6 months.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
Borrowings
In February 2012, in order to meet its ongoing commitments, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million, medium-term collar financing arrangement. At 31 December 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 294 million (30 September 2016: EUR 347 million). The decrease in estimated fair value reflects the repayment of GBP 50 million offset by the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the quarter. As at 31 December 2016, 11.4 million BAT shares were pledged as security in respect of the remaining loan and related put and call options (30 September 2016: 13.7 million BAT shares).

The remaining bank borrowings under the medium-term collar financing arrangements noted above will be settled either by the delivery of BAT shares pursuant to the put and call options in place, by existing liquid funds or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over and be replaced by other borrowings.

The collar financing arrangement involves the purchase by Reinet of put options and the sale by Reinet of call options. The remaining unpaid net option premium is payable over the period to March 2017 and is carried as a liability at its estimated fair value of EUR 2 million as at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 5 million). Some 0.3 million BAT shares remain pledged to guarantee the balance of the net option premium and a portion of the interest payments.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 December 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 31 million (30 September 2016: EUR 29 million), the increase reflects the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the quarter.

Derivative assets/(liabilities) – put and call options and forward exchange contracts
Put and call options in respect of the aforementioned medium-term collar financing arrangement are carried at their respective fair values at the balance sheet date. The net derivative liability is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 68 million at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 183 million). The decrease in the value of the liability is due to the settlement of part of the liability in December 2016 amounting to EUR 49 million (GBP 41 million), together with a decrease in the BAT share price of some GBP 3 per share, offset by the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the quarter. The remaining options expire or alternatively will be settled before 31 March 2017.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 480 million (30 September 2016: ZAR 480 million). The derivative liability in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 2 million at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: asset of EUR 1 million). 

OTHER LIABILITIES
Minority interest, fees payable and other liabilities, net of other assets
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 16 million (30 September 2016: EUR 15 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 11 million in respect of the management fee payable at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR 21 million) a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 12 million (30 September 2016: EUR 11 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic Capital Partners and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 24 million (30 September 2016: EUR 21 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 8 million (30 September 2016: EUR 8 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 December 2016 (30 September 2016: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date. 

The performance fee, if applicable, and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The increase in the NAV of EUR 289 million during the period is influenced by the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT'), movements in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including BAT, and decreases in the estimated fair value of loans payable. Offsetting these increases in NAV is the decrease in the estimated fair value of the investments in United States land development and mortgages, an increase in the value of derivative liabilities associated with the collar financing and the effect of the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euro; the depreciation of other currencies against the euro has resulted in a decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current period exchange rates to the March 2016 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 365 million.

Major items impacting the NAV, significant changes in carrying value and new investments during the period under review are described below.

LISTED INVESTMENTS
BRITISH AMERICAN
TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet received dividends from BAT during the period under review amounting to EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million), being BAT's final 2015 dividend and interim 2016 dividend.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 874 million at 30 September 2016, being 70 per cent of Reinet's NAV (31 March 2016: EUR 3 512 million). The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 40.90 at 31 March 2016 to GBP 49.30 at 30 September 2016, with a marked increase following the UK's referendum in June 2016. This increase in value is offset to some extent by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

SELECTA
BIOSCIENCES, INC.
In June 2016, Reinet invested EUR 4 million in Selecta Biosciences, Inc. ('Selecta') acquiring 350 000 shares in its initial public offering on the NASDAQ.

Selecta is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using proprietary synthetic vaccine particle technology to discover and develop targeted therapies that are designed to modulate the immune system to effectively and safely treat rare and serious diseases.

Selecta is also a portfolio company of NanoDimension, pre and post the initial public offering.

Further information on Selecta is available at www.selectabio.com.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders.

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 2 billion and at 30 September 2016 committed to provide further funding of EUR 302 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below. The increase in commitments during the period under review amounted to EUR 207 million, and a total of EUR 251 million was funded during the period.

Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value, Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reporting and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuations are based on the net asset value of investment funds as well as discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples for other entities, as appropriate.

PENSION INSURANCE
CORPORATION
GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly-owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc ('Pension Insurance Corporation') is one of the UK's leading providers of risk management solutions to defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation brings safety and security to scheme members' benefits through innovative, bespoke insurance solutions, which include deferred premiums and the use of company assets as part payment.

In June 2016, Pension Corporation raised GBP 250 million in additional capital; of this amount Reinet subscribed for an amount of EUR 179 million (GBP 139 million).

In the first six months of the 2016 calendar year, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension insurance business with premiums of GBP 918 million compared to GBP 702 million in the same period last year. New business prospects remain within expectations for the rest of the year. The result of the UK's referendum in June 2016 has resulted in sharp falls in interest rates and increased currency and equity market volatility. Pension Insurance Corporation has been operating under the Solvency II framework of governance since 1 January 2016 and has effectively dealt with the volatility caused by the UK's referendum. Of interest, as part of Pension Insurance Corporation's investment programme an investment of GBP 100 million was made in debt secured on the Thames Tideway Tunnel; this investment has a maturity profile of almost 50 years.

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 1 070 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 920 million), this value takes into account Pension Corporation's estimated embedded value at 30 June 2016 of GBP 2.5 billion (31 December 2015: GBP 1.9 billion) and valuation multiples drawn from industry data.

The change in estimated fair value is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's estimated embedded value which reflects new business written by Pension Insurance Corporation and the effect of changing economic variables, together with the capital increase in the half year ended 30 June 2016; offset by decreases in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector. These comparable market multiples are 6 per cent lower than those applied at 31 March 2016, reflecting the market movements relative to embedded value of the sector during the period which includes the effect of the market movement following the UK's referendum in June 2016. The estimated fair value is further reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
TRILANTIC CAPITAL
PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners ('Trilantic') is a global private equity firm focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in North America and Western Europe. Trilantic employs flexible transaction structures and has a strong heritage of partnering with family-owned businesses and providing growth capital to management teams. Trilantic primarily targets investments in the consumer, energy, industrials, technology, media and telecommunications, healthcare, financial and business services sectors, and currently manages six private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments of USD 7.6 billion.

Reinet and its minority partners invest in the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together 'Trilantic Management') and four of the six current funds under Trilantic's management.

Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. are in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the period under review, capital contributions of EUR 2 million were made and combined distributions of some EUR 8 million were received of which EUR 4 million (30 September 2015: EUR 2 million) was in respect of carried interest.

Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P., Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., and their respective general partners continue to build their portfolios with Reinet making capital contributions of some EUR 17 million in the period under review. Underlying investments are still considered to be at an early stage, however increases in value are being reported.

Reinet's and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 161 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 143 million) of which EUR 9 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 June 2016 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the estimated fair value is due to capital contributions of EUR 19 million together with increases in the estimated fair value of underlying investments, offset by distributions received.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.

RENSHAW BAY AND RELATED INVESTMENTS
Renshaw Bay Real
Estate Finance Fund
The Renshaw Bay Real Estate Finance Fund ('REFF') was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its real estate strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with a focus on the UK. The result of the UK's referendum in June 2016 initially impacted UK property prices, however over the past few months it appears that transaction activity is back to pre-referendum levels and the weakness of sterling has resulted in an increase in demand for commercial office space with rental income remaining stable. Management of REFF have completed a stress analysis of the fund and concluded that due to the benefits from its loan, property type and geographic diversity, they remain comfortable with the positioning of the portfolio.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 73 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 83 million) based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 30 June 2016. The decrease in estimated fair value is due to capital repayments received from early repaid loans together with the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS
Milestone China
Opportunities funds,
investment holdings
and management
company participation
Reinet has invested along with Milestone Capital in a management company based in Shanghai, and has also invested in certain funds and investment companies managed by Milestone Capital (together 'Milestone').

The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of EUR 132 million (31 March 2016: EUR 113 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 30 June 2016 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 30 September 2016. The change in estimated fair value reflects capital contributed in the period together with increases in the value of underlying listed and unlisted investments.

SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS
Snow Phipps funds
and co-investment
opportunities
Snow Phipps is a private equity firm which targets investments in market-leading companies in the industrials, services and consumer sectors primarily headquartered in North America.

In 2011, Reinet committed to invest up to USD 10 million (EUR 9 million) in Snow Phipps II, L.P. In the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment of USD 100 million (EUR 89 million) to Snow Phipps III, L.P. the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. In addition, in the current period Reinet committed USD 20 million (EUR 18 million) to two co-investment opportunities.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 37 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 8 million), the increase in value being mainly due to additional capital invested in the period.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com.

UNITED STATES
LAND DEVELOPMENT
AND MORTGAGES
Reinet has invested both directly and with partners to acquire interests in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 149 million (31 March 2016: EUR 164 million), of which EUR 2 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2016: EUR 2 million).

The current valuation is based on unaudited financial statements as at 30 June 2016 adjusted for cash movements up to 30 September 2016. The decrease in the valuation reflects more conservative estimates of land values and rates of lot sales, together with increases in running costs of the golf club communities.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European-based banks.

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash at bank                                                                                 EUR 194 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)                               (EUR 302 m)
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations (refer to note below)                       (EUR  29 m)

Existing bank borrowings of EUR 352 million under the medium-term collar financing arrangements noted below will be settled either by the delivery of BAT shares pursuant to the put and call options in place, by existing liquid funds or the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

The previously undrawn borrowing facilities comprised a facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch of GBP 150 million and a facility with Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. of GBP 150 million, in total GBP 300 million (EUR 346 million). These facilities expired at 30 September 2016. Reinet is in the process of renewing or replacing these with alternative arrangements.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVES
Borrowings
In February 2012, in order to meet its ongoing commitments, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million, medium-term collar financing arrangement. At 30 September 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 347 million (31 March 2016: EUR 380 million). The decrease in estimated fair value reflects the weakening of sterling against the euro, offset by a decrease in interest rates during the period. The collar financing arrangement involves the purchase by Reinet of put options and the sale by Reinet of call options over 13.7 million BAT shares. The remaining unpaid net option premium is payable over the period to 2017 and is carried as a liability at its estimated fair value of EUR 5 million as at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 11 million). Some 1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to guarantee the balance of the net option premium and a portion of the interest payments.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 September 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 29 million (31 March 2016: EUR 26 million), the increase reflects the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the period.

Derivative assets/(liabilities) â€“ put and call options and forward exchange contracts
Put and call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement noted above are carried at their respective fair values at the balance sheet date. The net derivative liability is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 183 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 80 million). The increase in the value of the liability is due to the increase in the BAT share price of over GBP 9 per share in the period. These options expire or alternatively will be settled before 31 March 2017.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 480 million (31 March 2016: ZAR 550 million). Outstanding contracts amounting in total to ZAR 550 million were settled on 30 September 2016 realising a loss of EUR 4 million.  New forward exchange contracts to sell ZAR 480 million in one year's time were entered into the same date. The derivative asset in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 1 million at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 2 million).

OTHER LIABILITIES
Minority interest, fees payable and other liabilities, net of other assets
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 15 million (31 March 2016: EUR 15 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the estimated fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 21 million in respect of the management fee payable at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 22 million) a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 11 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 21 million (31 March 2016: EUR 18 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 8 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 30 September 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 5 million) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee, if applicable, and management fee are payable to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited.

INCOME
Dividends received from BAT decreased from EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million) during the period to September 2015 to EUR 127 million (GBP 103 million) during the period under review. The decrease is due to the reduction in the number of BAT shares held following the sales in February and March 2016 together with the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments, offset by an increase of GBP 0.06 in the total dividend per BAT share. The dividends received from BAT during the period represent the final 2015 dividend paid in May 2016, as well as the interim 2016 dividend paid in September 2016.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits and loans made to underlying investments.

Total realised gains on investments of EUR 4 million was in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

Carried interest of EUR 4 million was attributable to Reinet in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

EXPENSES
A performance fee may be payable for the year ended 31 March 2017 if certain conditions are met. The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's prospectus, published on 10 October 2008, including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2017, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods. The provision for the performance fee accrued in respect of the six-month period ended 30 September 2016 amounts to EUR nil (30 September 2015: EUR nil).

The management fee for the period ended 30 September 2016 amounts to EUR 23 million (30 September 2015: EUR 23 million). Operating expenses of EUR 3 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner') and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 2 million.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand denominated borrowings.

The net tax expense of EUR 4 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, together with an increase in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic funds and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares increased in value by EUR 362 million during the period under review. Of this, EUR 660 million was attributable to the increase in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms offset by EUR 298 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period under review.

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 68 million in respect of other investments includes a decrease in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 29 million, primarily due to the application of market multiples (refer above for a full description of the overall movement of Pension Corporation during the period), a decrease in the estimated fair value in respect of the Trilantic funds of EUR 1 million, a decrease in the estimated fair value of the investment in United States land development and mortgages of EUR 30 million, an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Diamond interests of EUR 5 million together with decreases of EUR 13 million in respect of the estimated fair value of certain other investments. The above amounts include the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the depreciation of other currencies against the euro in the period under review.

The estimated fair value of the collar financing derivative liability increased by EUR 103 million during the period, reflecting the increase in the price of the BAT shares underlying the put and call options. The estimated fair value of the derivative asset in respect of the forward exchange contracts decreased by EUR 1 million; the contracts were settled on 30 September 2016 resulting in a loss of EUR 4 million.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates.  An unrealised loss of EUR 3 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the strengthening of the South African rand during the period.  An unrealised gain of EUR 34 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing. Of this, a gain of EUR 33 million is due to the weakening of sterling against the euro exchange rate during the period.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partners' shares in the earnings of the Reinet entities which hold the Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages interests, respectively.

PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD
Net realised income for the period amounted to EUR 111 million (30 September 2015: EUR 210 million). Net profit attributable to shareholders, taking into account unrealised fair value adjustments, was EUR 321 million (30 September 2015: EUR 38 million).

DIVIDEND
A cash dividend of EUR 0.161 per share totalling some EUR 32 million was paid in September 2016, following approval at the annual general meeting on 30 August 2016. No interim dividend is proposed in respect of the six months ended 30 September 2016.

Reinet Investments S.C.A. ('Reinet')
To holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA, in respect of Reinet Investments S.C.A. ordinary shares ('DRs') traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange under the ISIN number CH0045793657
Depository Receipt Code: REI

REINET SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF DRs

The dividend payable to holders of DRs is derived from the dividend to be paid by Reinet to holders of Reinet shares.

The dividend in respect of the DRs is payable to South African Common Monetary Area residents in South African rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services (Pty) Limited for those on the certificated register.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.161 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday 30 August 2016 in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of DRs. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividend withholding tax at 15 per cent in the hands of DR holders unless those DR holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of DRs are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

As DRs trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Reinet ordinary share, the dividend entitlement per DR is as follows:

               Gross dividend    South African     Net dividend in
               per DR            dividend Tax      euros
               in euros          at 15%

               0.016100          (0.002415)        0.013685


The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to South African rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 16.15050 : Euro 1. Accordingly the net dividend payable per DR is 22.10196 ZAR cents, as set out in the table below:

                  Gross dividend     South African  Net dividend
                  per DR             dividend tax   per DR
                  (in ZAR cents)     at 15%         (in ZAR cents)

Total             26.00231           (3.90035)      22.10196

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the DRs is anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""      Tuesday, 6 September 2016

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from
the commencement of business on        Wednesday, 7 September 2016

DR dividend payment date               Friday, 16 September 2016

DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of DRs between Wednesday, 7 September 2016 and Friday, 9 September 2016, both days inclusive.

DRs are issued subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement entered into on 17 October 2008, most recently amended on 15 December 2010. By holding DRs, investors acknowledge that they are bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Copies of the Deposit Agreement may be obtained by investors from Reinet Securities SA or Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited.

Reinet Securities SA may appoint a depository agent or other parties to assist in the administration of the DR programme and may provide to such agents such information as it deems to be appropriate, including information relating to the identity of holders of DRs.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The increase in the NAV of EUR 294 million during the period reflects the increase in value of, and receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT'), and decreases in the estimated fair value of loans payable, offset by decreases in the estimated fair value of certain investments.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euros; the depreciation of sterling against the euro following the UK's recent referendum, has resulted in a decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. This decrease was offset to a small extent by the appreciation of other currencies against the euro. Applying 31 March 2016 exchange rates to the current period's assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in value of some EUR 228 million.

The short-term impact of the UK's referendum to leave the European Union resulted in volatility in equity markets and a weakening in the value of sterling, however the long-term impacts are as yet unknown.

Major items impacting the NAV during the period under review are described below:

LISTED INVESTMENTS
BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet received dividends from BAT during the quarter amounting to EUR 89 million (GBP 70 million), being BAT's final 2015 dividend.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 951 million at 30 June 2016, being some 72 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 40.900 at 31 March 2016 to GBP 48.425 at 30 June 2016, with a marked increase in the days following the UK's referendum in June 2016. This increase in value is offset by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the period, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 207 million.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
During the current period, Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited ('Pension Corporation') raised GBP 250 million in additional capital; of this amount Reinet invested an additional EUR 179 million (GBP 139 million).

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 983 million at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 920 million), this value takes into account Pension Corporation's unaudited embedded value at 31 March 2016, the capital increase in the current period, valuation multiples drawn from industry data and period end foreign exchange rate.

The increase in estimated fair value is due to an increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects new business written and the effect of changing economic variables, together with the capital increase in the period; this increase in estimated fair value is offset by decreases in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector. These comparable market multiples are 14 per cent lower than those applied at 31 March 2016, reflecting the market movements relative to embedded value of the sector during the period, which includes the effect of the market movement following the UK's referendum. The increase in estimated fair value is further reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period, the effect of which amounts to some EUR 59 million.

Further information on Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS
TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Reinet's and its minority partners' investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 158 million at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 143 million) of which EUR 10 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 March 2016 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The increase in the valuation is mainly due to additional capital invested in the period.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilantic.com.

RENSHAW BAY AND RELATED INVESTMENTS
Renshaw Bay Real Estate Finance Fund 
The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 70 million at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 83 million) based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 March 2016.

The decrease in estimated fair value is mainly due to distributions received from the fund as well as the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period.

SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS
Snow Phipps funds and co-investment opportunities
Snow Phipps is a private equity firm which targets investments in market-leading companies in the industrials, services and consumer sectors primarily headquartered in North America.

In 2011, Reinet committed to invest up to USD 10 million in Snow Phipps II, L.P.; in the year ended 31 March 2016, Reinet made a commitment of USD 100 million (EUR 88 million) to Snow Phipps III, L.P. the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P. and in the current period Reinet committed USD 20 million (EUR 18 million) to two co-investment opportunities.

Reinet's investment in the two funds and associated co-investments is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 43 million at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 8 million), the increase in value being mainly due to additional capital invested in the period.

Further information on Snow Phipps is available at www.snowphipps.com.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 151 million (31 March 2016: EUR 164 million), of which EUR 2 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2016: EUR 2 million).

The decrease in the valuation reflects expected decreases in land values and in the forecast rate of lot sales, and increases in running costs of the golf club communities, offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the period.

Further information on Arendale may be found at www.arendale.com.

COMMITMENTS
Commitments made in the period amounted to EUR 205 million, including EUR 179 million in respect of Pension Corporation, EUR 18 million in respect of co-investments alongside Snow Phipps III, L.P., EUR 4 million in respect of United States land development and mortgages and EUR 4 million in Selecta Biosciences Inc.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European banks.

During the quarter under review Reinet received dividends from BAT amounting to EUR 89 million and invested some EUR 235 million in underlying investments, including EUR 179 in Pension Corporation. Performance and management fees of EUR 27 million accrued as at 31 March 2016 were paid to Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the 'Investment Advisor'). Other movements including distributions from investments, loan repayments and foreign exchange impacts amount to EUR 5 million.

Reinet has in place borrowing facilities which will permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 300 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. The borrowing facilities comprise a facility with Bank of America for GBP 150 million and a facility with Morgan Stanley of GBP 150 million. At 30 June 2016, these facilities had not been drawn upon.

BANK BORROWINGS AND RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
BORROWINGS
In February 2012, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million, medium-term collar financing arrangement. At 30 June 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 361 million (31 March 2016: EUR 380 million).  The decrease in estimated fair value reflects the weakening of sterling against the euro in the period. The collar financing arrangement involves the purchase by Reinet of put options and the sale by Reinet of call options over 13.7 million BAT shares. The remaining unpaid net option premium is payable over the period to 2017 and is carried as a liability at its estimated fair value of EUR 8 million as at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 11 million). Some 1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to guarantee the balance of the net option premium and a portion of the interest payments.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 30 June 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 27 million (31 March 2016: EUR 26 million); the increase in estimated fair value is due to the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro during the period.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – PUT AND CALL OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
Put and call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement noted above are carried at their respective estimated fair values at the balance sheet date. The net derivative liability is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 173 million at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 80 million). The increase in the value of the liability is due to the increase in the BAT share price of over GBP 7 per share in the period.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 550 million (31 March 2016: ZAR 550 million). The derivative asset in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR nil at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: liability of EUR 2 million). The change in value reflects the strengthening of the South African rand against the euro in the period.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 14 million (31 March 2016: EUR 15 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR11 million in respect of the management fee payable as at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 22 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 11 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 21 million (31 March 2016: EUR 18 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 6 million (31 March 2016: EUR 10 million).

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 30 June 2016 (31 March 2016: EUR 5 million) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance and management fees are payable to the Investment Advisor.

The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

REINET SECURITIES SA – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF REINET SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS

The dividend payable to holders of Reinet Securities SA' South African Depository Receipts ('Reinet DRs') is derived from the dividend to be paid by Reinet Investments S.C.A., Luxembourg ('Reinet') to holders of Reinet shares.

The Reinet DR dividend payable to South African Common Monetary Area residents is payable in rand and will be effected via central security depository participants in Strate for all dematerialised Reinet DR holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for Reinet DR holdings on the certificated register.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.161 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday 30 August 2016 in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet DRs. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 15 per cent in the hands of Reinet DR holders unless those Reinet DR holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet DRs are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

As Reinet DR's trade in the ratio of 10 Reinet DRs to each Reinet share, the dividend entitlement per Reinet DR is as follows:

               Gross dividend    South African     Net dividend 
               per Reinet DR     dividend Tax      per Reinet DR
               in euros          at 15%            in euros

               0.016100          (0.002415)        0.013685

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet DR dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday, 30 August 2016.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African Reinet DRs are anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""      Tuesday, 6 September 2016

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from
the commencement of business on        Wednesday, 7 September 2016

Reinet DR dividend record date         Friday, 9 September 2016

Reinet DR dividend payment date        Friday, 16 September 2016

Reinet DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of Reinet DRs between Wednesday, 7 September 2016 and Friday, 9 September 2016, both days inclusive.

Reinet DRs are issued subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement entered into on 17 October 2008, most recently amended on 15 December 2010. By holding Reinet DRs, investors acknowledge that they are bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Copies of the Deposit Agreement may be obtained by investors from Reinet Securities SA or Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited.

Reinet Securities SA may appoint a depository agent or other parties to assist in the administration of the Reinet DR programme and may provide to such agents such information as it deems to be appropriate, including information relating to the identity of holders of Reinet DRs.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTARY

Dear Shareholder

Overview of results

The Company's net asset value at 31 March 2016 amounted to EUR 5 221 million, an increase of 3 per cent above last year's figure of EUR 5 077 million. This reflects principally significant increases in the value of Reinet's investments in British American Tobacco and Pension Corporation. However, Reinet's net asset value was negatively impacted by the weakening of the pound sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the latter part of the year.

Business developments

Continuing our policy of diversifying out of the British American Tobacco position as and when funds are required to invest in other opportunities, 6.25 million shares were sold during the year under review. As a result, Reinet's interest in British American Tobacco represented some 67.3 per cent of the net asset value at 31 March 2016, compared to 70.5 per cent a year ago. Nevertheless, the value of the remaining holding of 68.1 million shares in British American Tobacco increased in value to EUR 3 512 million at 31 March 2016. We remain confident in the future prospects for this global business.

At 31 March, the proceeds of these sales were held to fund a further investment in Pension Corporation, which is expected to close in June this year. Reinet has committed to co-invest alongside current and new investors in a recently announced capital increase by Pension Corporation in order to support the continued growth of this business. Pension Corporation has had an excellent year, writing significant new business and insuring a record number of pension fund members. The additional capital will support Pension Corporation and allow it to take advantage of the increasing demand from companies wishing to exit or de-risk their defined contribution pension plans, whilst remaining fully compliant with its regulatory requirements, which – for good reason – are increasingly stringent.

Reinet continues to pursue the planned diversification of its investment portfolio and during the year committed USD 100 million to Snow Phipps III, a US fund investing in the US middle-market private equity space. Reinet has been an investor since 2011 in the predecessor to this fund. Snow Phipps III expects to make its first investments in the summer of 2016. Reinet has continued to make investments in line with its commitments to other investee companies during the year and new commitments were entered into amounting in total to EUR 201 million.

Dividend

The Board of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes an increase in the annual dividend to EUR 0.161 per share. This represents an increase of 2.5 per cent over the dividend paid last year. 

Changes to the Board of Overseers

The role of the Board of Overseers is to oversee and control the activities of both Reinet Investments and Reinet Fund. In addition, the Board acts as the audit committee of both Reinet Investments and Reinet Fund. During the year under review, Mr John Li, a former senior partner in the Luxembourg office of an international accounting firm, was appointed to the Board. 

I am sorry to report, towards the end of the financial year, the death of Dr Peter Kaul, who had been a member of the Board since 2009 and whose connections with the Company and its predecessors went back to before the formation of Richemont in 1988. We will miss his insight and understanding of Reinet and its underlying interests and send our deepest condolences to his family. We are in the process of identifying a new member for the Board of Overseers.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our management and advisory teams and our partners in the investee companies for their contribution to Reinet's performance during the year.

Outlook

The global economic situation has not improved significantly over the last twelve months. Cash and government bonds attract negative interest rates in Europe and the economic situation in the United States and in China is unsettled. In addition, the geopolitical situation has, if anything, worsened. This calls for prudence.

Our goal remains that of looking to maintain a pattern of long-term growth in shareholders' capital; we will continue to seek investment opportunities where funds can be deployed with a high degree of security and where we believe Reinet can add value.

PERFORMANCE
NET ASSET VALUE
The increase in the NAV of EUR 144 million during the year is influenced by the receipt of dividends from British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT'), the sale of 6.25 million BAT shares, realisations of investments, in particular by Trilantic Capital Partners, increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments, including BAT and Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited and decreases in the estimated fair value of loans payable. Offsetting these increases are decreases in the estimated fair value of investments in United States land development and mortgages and Renshaw Bay, together with the effect of the weakening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro in the year.

The Company records its assets and liabilities in euros; the depreciation of other currencies against the euro has resulted in a decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current year exchange rates to the March 2015 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in value of some EUR 404 million.

LISTED INVESTMENTS
BRITISH AMERICAN
TOBACCO P.L.C.
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Nicardo Durante, Chief Executive of BAT, writing in its annual report for 2015 commented:

'We delivered outstanding results in 2015, against a very challenging external environment and with significant adverse transactional foreign exchange rate movements. Driven by a very strong second half of the year, with cigarette volume higher by 1.7%, total Group cigarette volume for the full year was down only 0.5%, to 663 billion. This was significantly better than the overall estimated industry decline of 2.3%. After excluding the impact of the TDR acquisition, organic cigarette volume decline was still ahead of the market at 0.8%.

Market share in our Key Markets increased by over 40 bps. This was driven by an excellent performance from our Global Drive Brands, which grew volume by an exceptional 8.5% and increased market share by 120 bps. At constant rates of exchange, we grew revenue by 5.4%, adjusted profit from operations by 4.0% and adjusted diluted earnings per share by 10.1%. Excluding the significant transactional effect of foreign exchange on the cost of raw materials and leaf, adjusted profit from operations would have grown by approximately 10%.

Price mix of 5.9% was up from 4.2% in 2014. Underlying operating margin grew by around 160 bps, although on a reported basis it was down by 60 bps to 38.1%. This was largely due to the adverse transactional impact of unfavourable foreign exchange described above. These excellent results in 2015 are once again proof of the strength of our strategy. They were achieved despite unprecedented adverse exchange rate movements and continuing pressure on consumers' disposable income.'

During the year under review, Reinet sold 6.25 million BAT shares at an average price of GBP 38.585 per share; the aggregate proceeds amounting to EUR 307 million.

Reinet received dividends from BAT during the year amounting to EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million), being BAT's final 2014 dividend and interim 2015 dividend. In May 2016, after the end of the financial year, Reinet received BAT's final dividend in respect of its 2015 financial year; this amounted to EUR 88 million (GBP 70 million)and is not included in the current reported year-end results.

Reinet holds 68.1 million shares in BAT, representing some 3.7 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of Reinet's investment in BAT amounted to EUR 3 512 million at 31 March 2016, being 67 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 34.885 at 31 March 2015 to GBP 40.900 at 31 March 2016. This increase in value is offset to some extent by the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year.

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

SPDR GOLD SHARES
During the year under review, Reinet invested EUR 22 million in SPDR Gold shares ('GLD'), the largest physically backed gold exchange traded fund in the world. Over the long term gold can provide a hedge against inflation and offer some protection against value changes in turbulent economic and political times.

Reinet holds 230 000 shares with a market value of EUR 24 million as at 31 March 2016.

Further information on GLD can be found at www.spdrgoldshares.com.

UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
Reinet seeks, through a range of investment structures, to build partnerships with other investors, specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders.

Since its formation in 2008, Reinet has invested over EUR 1 750 million and at 31 March 2016 committed to provide further funding of EUR 348 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table below. The increase in commitments during the year under review amounted to EUR 201 million.

Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value, Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies, management reporting and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuations are based on the net asset value of investment funds as well as discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples for other entities, as appropriate.

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION
GROUP LIMITED
Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited's ('Pension Corporation') wholly owned subsidiary, Pension Insurance Corporation plc ('Pension Insurance Corporation') is one of the UK's leading providers of risk management solutions to defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation provides tailored pension insurance buyouts and buy-ins to the trustees and sponsors of UK defined benefit pension funds. Pension Insurance Corporation brings safety and security to scheme members' benefits through innovative, bespoke insurance solutions, which include deferred premiums and the use of company assets as part payment. In 2015, Pension Insurance Corporation wrote new pension insurance business of GBP 3.8 billion of premiums including a GBP 2.4 billion pension insurance buyout with the trustees of the Philips UK pension fund. This transaction covers the pension benefits of around 26 000 UK pension scheme members. At 31 December 2015 Pension Insurance Corporation had GBP 16.6 billion in assets (31 December 2014: GBP 13.8 billion) and had insured more than 132 000 pension fund members (31 December 2014: 103 600). Clients include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals and the public sector.

Tracy Blackwell, Chief Executive Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation commented:

'2015 was a landmark year for Pension Insurance Corporation. We insured a record GBP 3.8 billion of liabilities, which just pipped the GBP 3.7 billion of liabilities we insured in 2013, we were one of only nineteen UK insurers to have our Internal Model approved by the Regulator as part of our Solvency II transition, and we attained recognition by a key industry body for our excellence in customer service. As a consequence, the overall value of the company grew 20% year-on-year.
 
In each of the past couple of years we have seen more than GBP 10 billion per annum of pension fund liabilities secured through insurance. With the markets having such a poor start to 2015, we were slightly concerned that pension funds would be put off transacting. However, the pipeline quickly filled up and we had a very busy year. Our conclusion was that those pension funds with a long-term plan, which includes aligning assets and liabilities as well as putting the right structures and processes in place to facilitate a buyout, can still transact despite market gyrations. In terms of context, GBP 10 billion is only about 0.5% of the total universe of defined benefit pension fund liabilities, which currently total more than GBP 2 trillion. An increase in the percentage of the total pension fund liabilities that transacts from 0.5% to between 1% and 2% per year is not implausible. Should that happen, trustees and their advisers want to know that there is capacity in the market. They will also want to be confident they are getting a fair price. Healthy competition helps bring confidence, but at the same time there remain high barriers to entry into this market.

We have become a leading insurer in our sector because our customers value innovative thinking, flexibility in delivery, high levels of customer service and our rigorous approach to pension risk management.'

Reinet's investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 920 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 907 million), this value takes into account Pension Corporation's audited embedded value at 31 December 2015 of GBP 1 873 million (31 December 2014: GBP 1 624 million) and valuation multiples drawn from industry data.

The increase in estimated fair value is due to the increase in Pension Corporation's embedded value which reflects the expected release of margins, return on surplus assets and new business written, offset by the effect of changing economic variables during the year ended 31 December 2015; this increase in estimated fair value is offset by decreases in comparable valuation multiples being applied by the market in valuing listed companies in the UK insurance sector. These comparable market multiples are 15 per cent lower than those applied at 31 March 2015, reflecting the market movements relative to embedded value of the sector during the year. The change in estimated fair value also reflects the reduction of a discount applied by the Fund Manager from 20 per cent at 31 March 2015 to 10 per cent at 31 March 2016; the reduction reflects the increased maturity of the business. The increase in estimated fair value is further reduced by the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year.

In May 2016, subsequent to the Company's year-end, Pension Corporation announced its intention to raise capital of GBP 250 million (EUR 315 million). Reinet Fund has committed to invest up to GBP 140 million (EUR 177 million).

In 2013 and 2014, Reinet committed to invest in Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P., Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P., and their respective general partners. These US based funds are focused on North American opportunities with Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. being especially focused on the oil and gas sector. These funds continue to build their portfolios at a steady pace.

Charlie Ayres, Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners, commented:

'We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the outlook of US domestic companies in general and believe that patience and duration are necessary to battle the continued headwinds on the energy front. We will continue adhering to our investment discipline, which we believe has been critical in protecting capital, enhancing value and maximising returns. We have both fully monetised and strategically partially monetised companies that have reached maturity, while methodically putting capital to work where we find attractive investment opportunities that can drive appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Patience and flexibility will be essential in our deployment of capital. We continue to strive to build value in our existing portfolio and focus on having our mature companies exit-ready to take advantage of attractive market dynamics.'

Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P.is also in the process of realising value from underlying investments. In the year under review, distributions of some EUR 69 million were received. 

Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, Chairman of Trilantic Europe, commented:

'2015 has been characterised by a number of key developments in the world economy that have had and will have a lasting influence on currency movements, economic growth and asset prices. Among the economic trends that emerged in 2015 which we believe are relevant for Trilantic Europe's investment strategy are (i) the divergence of monetary policy between the US and Europe; (ii) the reversal of a six-year trend of growth and stability in developing economies, caused by a slowdown in global trade; (iii) the challenges facing the European banking system; (iv) the low economic growth in Europe which has, however, not been an impediment to asset prices growth and (v) a tumultuous period in European politics in 2015 with populist parties gaining traction in Spain, France, Germany and to some extent the UK with the Brexit referendum. Despite being rather alarming, these trends can present opportunities for value-oriented investors like Trilantic Europe but require in-depth analysis and actions – both in terms of decisions concerning existing portfolio companies and of selecting new investment opportunities that are compatible with the challenging scenario outlined above. Consequently, 2015 has been an important year for Trilantic Europe, which have seen positive developments in several fronts by (i) closing the fundraising of Trilantic Europe V at EUR 900 million; (ii) executing three successful exits from Trilantic Europe IV which resulted in distributions of c. 88% of invested capital by the fund and (iii) signing the first three investments of Trilantic Europe V on transactions that tick all the boxes of what we define as a ""Trilantic Europe deal” - value investing in proprietary transactions sourced through our network in primary transactions partnering with the entrepreneurs and founding family.'

Reinet's and its minority partners' investment in Trilantic Management and all the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 143 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 231 million) of which EUR 10 million (31 March 2015: EUR 20 million) is attributable to minority partners. The estimated fair value is based on audited and unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2015 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The decrease in the valuation is due to distributions of EUR 99 million together with the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year, offset by additional capital invested.

During the year under review, carried interest of EUR 6 million was received (31 March 2015: EUR 3 million).

RENSHAW BAY AND RELATED INVESTMENTS
Renshaw Bay advisory
and investment 
management company
In 2011, Reinet co-invested with Mr William T. Winters, RIT Capital Partners plc and Renshaw Bay's management team in an advisory and investment management business, known as Renshaw Bay. 

Following the departure of Mr Winters, Renshaw Bay completed the transfer of its Real Estate Finance business to entities in the group headed by GAM Holding AG and in December 2015 the Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. was dissolved. As a result of these developments, Reinet re-evaluated the expected cash flows from the business and accordingly adjusted the value of its investment in Renshaw Bay.

Richard Berliand, Chairman of the Management Committee of Renshaw Bay, commented:

'In August 2015, Renshaw Bay agreed the sale of the principal assets of its real estate finance business to companies in the independent asset management group headed by GAM Holding AG. The sale to GAM was completed on 2 October 2015 and, in the context of senior management changes at Renshaw Bay in 2015, provided an excellent opportunity for the preservation and development of the value of the real estate finance business for Renshaw Bay's investors and shareholders.

Although Renshaw Bay's structured finance business had made significant progress since its first fund was launched in late 2013, the decision was made in 2015 to reduce that aspect of the business, some structured finance-related activities are continuing. The number of Renshaw Bay's personnel was reduced substantially in the second half of 2015, commensurate with these changes.'

The investment in Renshaw Bay is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 11 million at 31 March 2016 based on future cash flow information provided by Renshaw Bay's management team (31 March 2015: EUR 33 million).

Following its investment in Renshaw Bay, Reinet also invested in JPS Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd, Renshaw Bay Real Estate Finance Fund and Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. These investments are described below.

Further information on Renshaw Bay may be found at www.renshawbay.com.

JPS Credit Opportunities
Fund (Cayman) Ltd. 
The investment in JPS Credit Opportunities Fund (Cayman) Ltd ('JPS Credit Fund'), which was the first transaction introduced to Reinet by Renshaw Bay, focuses on liquid opportunities in the credit markets. JPS Credit Fund is managed by JP Morgan Asset Management.

JPS Credit Fund's investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through both capital appreciation and current income by taking positions in publicly traded and privately held securities, derivatives and other instruments (including bonds, credit default swaps and index options), primarily in credit and credit-related markets.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 84 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 85 million) based on the valuation at that date provided by the fund manager.

The decrease in estimated fair value during the year is due to increases in the value of underlying investments offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

Renshaw Bay Real
Estate Finance Fund
In October 2015, Renshaw Bay completed the transfer of its Real Estate Finance business to entities in the group headed by GAM Holding AG.

The Renshaw Bay Real Estate Finance Fund (""REFF”) was created to take advantage of opportunities resulting from a funding gap between the expected demand for commercial real estate finance and its availability from banks, other traditional lenders and equity investors. Its real estate strategy focuses on the origination of commercial real estate loans primarily in Western Europe, and with a focus on the UK. REFF held its successful final closing at the end of February 2015 with committed capital of GBP 258 million. At December 2015, REFF held eighteen investments, in addition, there are six investments in progress which will be financed over the current year.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 83 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 55 million) based on audited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2015.

The increase in estimated fair value is mainly due to Reinet's capital contributions in the year.

Renshaw Bay Structured 
Finance Opportunity L.P.
During the year under review, Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. was dissolved with all cash and remaining assets returned to its limited partners.

Reinet had invested a total of EUR 46 million in the fund; in connection with the dissolution it received cash distributions amounting to EUR 38 million and a distribution of assets with an estimated fair value of EUR 9 million.

The assets received are included in 'Other investments'.

36 SOUTH GLOBAL
MACRO/VOLATILITY
FUNDS
36 South Capital Advisors LLP ('36 South') is an absolute return fund manager that specialises in managing global macro/volatility funds. 36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes.  Its global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments but to substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility.

Reinet has co-invested with the 36 South management team in the fund management and distribution companies. Reinet is also an investor in the following 36 South funds:

The 36 South Black Eyrar Fund which is a left tail-risk protection strategy investing in volatility across all asset classes and geographical areas. The fund is designed to deliver significant returns should some or all financial asset markets suffer a lower tail risk event, ie an asset price move of greater than 3 standard deviations towards lower equity markets, lower bond yields, lower commodities and higher currency volatility. The fund invests up to 95 per cent in options and investment levels will be decided upon based on these opportunities.

The Kohinoor Core Fund which was launched in March 2011 and is the 'high octane' offering within the Kohinoor Strategy. Up to 95 per cent of initial capital is invested in the options portfolio and it aims to achieve significant returns with commensurate risk over a medium- to long-term investment period.

Richard Haworth, Chief Executive Officer of 36 South, commented as follows:

'36 South was established in 2001 and specialises in finding cheap convexity, principally in long-dated options, across all asset classes. Our global volatility strategies are designed to perform well in most market environments, but substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility.

Markets experienced volatility in both August and January which was reflected in the strongly positive performance in those months. These gains were given back however as Central Banks seemed determined to dampen down volatility and institute measures which reverse negative market direction whenever these moves start to get meaningful. This has the result of not only dampening down our positive performance, but has resulted in losses on the portfolio of some 20% over the financial year. These results are within expectations given the market environment. Whilst these may persist in the short term, we believe the net effect will be an outsize volatility/market move in the medium- to long-term resulting in commensurate returns to the portfolio. Assets under management increased however by some 7% reflecting continual support from the investment community for our product offering.'

The investment in the funds is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 54 million, based on unaudited financial information received from the fund manager as at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 69 million). The estimated fair value of the investment in the fund management and distribution companies amounted to EUR 8 million (31 March 2015: EUR 8 million). The investments in total have an estimated fair value of EUR 62 million (31 March 2015: EUR 77 million). The change in valuation reflects the movement in the value of the underlying investments held by the funds.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS
Milestone China Opportunities
funds, investment holdings and
management company
participation
Reinet has invested along with Milestone Capital in a management company based in Shanghai, and has also invested in certain funds and investment companies managed by Milestone Capital (together 'Milestone').

Milestone Capital has a strong track record in helping portfolio companies scale their operations and be listed on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges. Funds under management invest primarily in domestic Chinese high-growth companies seeking expansion or acquisition capital. Milestone funds seek to maximise medium- to long-term capital appreciation by making direct investments to acquire minority or majority equity stakes in those companies identified by Milestone's investment team. Current areas of investment include: restaurants; B2C online travel services; bio-pharmaceutical manufacturers; medical device manufacturers; food and beverage distribution; brands covering sportswear and apparel; big data services; e-commerce; power generation equipment; retail pharmacies and online education.

Yunli Lou, Managing Partner of Milestone Capital, commented:

'2015 was a productive year for Milestone. Throughout the year, we deployed USD 45.3 million to five investments in consumer, healthcare and internet / new economy sectors, including four follow-on investments into existing portfolio companies to support further growth. We continued to work closely with our portfolio companies to drive operational excellence and help with various strategic initiatives. During 2015, one of our portfolio companies completed its listing on the Taiwan Emerging Stock Board, and two portfolio companies completed new rounds of equity financing. We also fully exited from our investment in a men's apparel company with total proceeds of USD 36.6 million, or an IRR of 58.3% over a 19-month period.

China's GDP growth in 2015 decelerated to 6.9% from 7.3% in 2014, the lowest since 1991, in line with market expectations. The growth continued to be largely driven by the consumer and services sectors (the tertiary industry), accounting for 50.5% of GDP, 2.4% higher than the previous year, the fourth consecutive year as the largest part and the first year in history to account for over 50% of China's GDP. Consumption remained strong and contributed 66.4% of GDP growth in 2015, while manufacturing and construction further weakened. We believe that the Chinese economy's rebalancing towards a more-consumption, less-investment and less-export driven structure will continue, where retail is expected to continue its double-digit growth while old growth engines such as heavy industries and infrastructure construction will continue to lose steam. While slowdown is inevitable, this rebalancing will create a healthier structure for long-term growth.'

The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of EUR 113 million (31 March 2015: EUR 116 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2015 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2016. The change in estimated fair value reflects the decrease due to the repayment of capital, decreases in the value of listed investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro.

Prescient China Balanced 
Fund and investment 
management company
Prescient China Balanced Fund ('Prescient China') is a fund managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited, a South African-listed fund manager. The fund invests in equities, bonds, cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. It invests principally in equities and other instruments listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.

Liang Du, Portfolio Manager of Prescient China, commented:

'2015 was a volatile year, with the equity market rising in the first half before decreasing in the second half and continuing into the first quarter of 2016. Under a volatile market the fund performed well, outperforming the benchmark as well as market based indices in 2015. This resulted in the fund being the best performing unit trust in South Africa for a second year running for the 2015 calendar year. At the end of March 2016 the fund will have been in operation for three years.  Since inception the fund has comfortably beaten its benchmark of Chinese Inflation + 3% by around 13% and when compared to a market based benchmark of 65% equity 35% cash, the fund is ahead by 7%. With the market falling in the second half the operating environment became much harder, as China once again became an unfashionable investment destination.'

Reinet invests in Prescient China and in the management company. These investments are carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 42 million based on unaudited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 48 million). The decrease in estimated fair value over the year under review is the result of decreases in the value of underlying listed investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

SPECIALISED PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS
Vanterra Flex 
Investments L.P.
Vanterra Flex Investments L.P. ('Vanterra') was established in 2010 to invest in privately issued securities and to make direct investments in the US and emerging markets. Vanterra seeks to construct a globally diversified private equity portfolio providing investors with long-term capital appreciation. Vanterra has co-invested alongside Reinet in Trilantic Fund IV, the United States land development and mortgages, Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials I, L.P. and Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials AIV-A, L.P. Vanterra also has investments in established platforms in US healthcare, small business credit, distressed general partner secondaries and Brazil.

Shad Azimi, Managing Partner of Vanterra Capital, commented:

'In 2015, the private equity markets enjoyed another strong year of capital distributions despite public market volatility and increasing economic uncertainty.  A large amount of dry capital remaining in funds continued to fuel competition for deals and push investment multiples to new highs.

We began to achieve meaningful exits in 2015 as we shifted our focus from investing to harvesting the portfolio and generating liquidity.  The majority of our geographic exposure is in the US, which has benefited from a strong sellers' market.  This was evidenced by impressive portfolio company exits in Trilantic Capital Partners Fund IV and Cressey and Company Health Care Fund IV.  We achieved significant milestones for several portfolio companies in Vanterra Transformative Energy and Materials. Our exposure to Brazil through BTG Pactual Brazil Investment Fund I was negatively impacted by foreign currency depreciation and continued economic headwinds in the country, and therefore we anticipate longer hold periods in Brazil.  

In 2016, Vanterra will look to realise value in older positions, and will continue to execute on its operational and strategic initiatives within its newer core platforms. Some of the older vintage platforms have already demonstrated their ability to achieve successful realisations in select investments.  Vanterra expects that the next few years will be when the hard work put in during the harvesting period will lead to meaningful exits across the majority of our platforms.'

Reinet is an investor in both Vanterra and in its general partner.

Vanterra is in the process of disinvesting and distributing assets. During the year under review distributions amounting to EUR 15 million were received.

This investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 30 million at 31 March 2016, based on unaudited financial information as at 31 December 2015, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2015: EUR 53 million). The decrease in estimated fair value is due mainly to the distributions received, decreases in the value of listed investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro.

Vanterra C Change
Transformative Energy
and Materials
Vanterra C Change Transformative Energy and Materials ('Vanterra C Change TEM') was established in July 2010 to invest in companies and projects providing products or services that supply cleaner energy; create a more cost-effective building environment through the use of energy efficient technologies; and develop renewable resources as a substitute for fossil and other traditional fuels.

Dan Matloff, Chief Financial Officer of TEM Capital, commented:

'Over the past year, Vanterra C Change TEM narrowed its focus to the portfolio companies with the highest upside potential, while recovering as much capital as possible from other investments.  The IPO of Talgo, S.A., provided Vanterra C Change TEM with a 3.3x multiple of invested capital (in US dollar terms), for the 45% of our holding that we sold.  Also, we sold one of the remaining two businesses in our building materials platform, to generate cash and focus our efforts on the one with greater upside potential.  Our 76%-owned alternative cement portfolio company has a patent-issued technology product that displaces ordinary Portland cement, the second-most consumed commodity in the world.  Over the past year, the company made meaningful progress, building the operational team, growing revenues, and entering 2016 with a significantly improved feedstock supply situation that enables ongoing improvements to operating results. The Vanterra C Change TEM fund continues to focus on limiting further commitments, while maximising returns on our existing investments.'

Reinet is an investor in Vanterra C Change TEM and in its general partner.

In the year under review, Reinet received a distribution of EUR 7 million from Vanterra C Change TEM and its general partner, following the partial sale of its holding in Talgo, S.A. Of this distribution EUR 6 million represents a recallable return of capital and EUR 1 million represents capital returned.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 23 million at 31 March 2016, based on audited financial information as at 31 December 2015, adjusted for cash movements and changes in prices of listed investments (31 March 2015: EUR 30 million). The decrease in estimated fair value is due mainly to the repayment of capital, decreases in value of listed investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro.

NanoDimension funds
and co-investment
opportunities
NanoDimension Management Ltd has established two funds in which Reinet is an investor. The focus of each fund is to invest in and support the growth and commercialisation of nanotechnology. Areas of investment by the funds include: pharmaceuticals and drug delivery structures; optical and electronic switches; and thin film photo-chromatic coatings.

Aymeric Sallin, Founder of NanoDimension Management Ltd, commented:

'2015 was in line with the previous years: nanotechnology is on a steady, healthy growth trajectory.

It was an exciting year for the portfolio, with existing and new companies making significant progress on technology development and commercialisation. View will equip with its Dynamic Glass the new headquarters of major Silicon Valley companies. ARMO Therapeutics has enrolled almost three hundred patients in their Phase 1 clinical programs for five different cancers. Twist Bioscience is finalising its DNA foundry scale up and has already sold several months of its capacity for 2016.

We continue to believe that the convergence of biology, chemistry, and physics enables breakthrough technologies with broad applications across all industries. Portfolio companies like Emulate, Twist Bioscience, and Click Diagnostics have built products that sit at the intersection of the life and physical sciences.

We are seeing the convergence of industries, where major global companies are broadly expanding their scope. Companies like Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung are moving into healthcare; companies like Dow, DuPont, and Exxon are using biological tools to solve problems in the chemical and oil industries. This convergence of industries increases the number of potential buyers that should impact positively the exit valuations.'

At 31 March 2016, the estimated fair value of Reinet's investment in the two funds and a co-investment amounted to EUR 48 million (31 March 2015: EUR 56 million). The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data received from the fund manager as at 31 December 2015, together with an independent valuation of the co-investment. The decrease in estimated fair value reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Fountainhead Expert
Fund
Fountainhead Expert Fund ('Fountainhead') is a fund investing in a concentrated manner in global equities offering superior potential for capital appreciation and value realisation by benchmarking themselves to global inflation and striving for absolute real returns through time.

Andre Cillie, Managing Partner of Andre Cillie Capital Management (Pty) Limited, manager of Fountainhead, commented:

'2015 was a disappointing year for us from a return perspective. In fact the last two years have been very difficult for all value investors as the age of free money drove premiums of fashionable growth stocks over value stocks to extremes last seen in the late 90's. The underperformance of old economy or bricks and mortar companies has been specifically acute.

The last two years have been very painful as our view of US financials being by far the cheapest part of the market has been frustrated by a very dovish federal reserve. The banks are in better shape than ever, yet the market is pricing them as if the US is already in a deep recession, allocating the banks no credit for the tremendous transformation they have undertaken since the great recession.  Valuations of the big US financials are providing terrific value and we believe that return of capital via buybacks at a time when they trade at significant (>30%) discount to book value and near record discount to the overall market cannot come at a better time.'

At 31 March 2016, the estimated fair value of the investment was EUR 19 million based on the unaudited valuation at that date provided by the fund manager (31 March 2015: EUR 30 million). The decrease in estimated fair value is the result of decreases in the value of underlying listed investments and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro.

Further information on Fountainhead may be found at www.fountainheadpartners.co.za.


Other Fund 
Investments
This includes small, specialist funds investing in private equity businesses, start-up ventures and listed securities. These investments are valued at their estimated fair value of EUR 13 million at 31 March 2016 based on valuation statements received from the fund managers (31 March 2015: EUR 14 million). 

UNITED STATES LAND 
DEVELOPMENT AND 
MORTGAGES
Reinet has co-invested both directly and with partners to acquire interests in real estate development projects. The investments are located in Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North and South Carolina and Nevada. These include properties where infrastructure services have been laid but where the construction of properties has not yet commenced. Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt linked to such developments from financial institutions, usually at significant discounts to face value.

In addition, Reinet has invested in residential golf communities, owning the land for sale to future homeowners together with infrastructure assets. This latter investment is known as Arendale.

John Kunkel, Chief Executive Officer of Arendale Holdings Corporation, commented:

'Investments in this portfolio concentrate on two segments of the US residential markets: 1) Community housing for the populous; and, 2) high-end country club ""lifestyle” communities which includes club operations for various country clubs within the communities. Operating results have been mixed. On the one hand, real estate sales for the calendar year ended 2015 have increased 12% and club operations have posted 7% revenue gains from the prior year. Both are ahead of industry averages. On the other hand, however, asset values have reduced, primarily related to club related assets due to longer lead times to get clubs to a stable membership base.

Specific to the portfolio of properties managed, our communities managed are primarily located in the Southeastern US, which has in the past led the nation in housing starts. Secondly, the two segments of the population which have recently been experiencing the biggest increases in household creations, and thus new home purchases, are the millennial generation and the retiring generation.  Our community offerings cater primarily to both ends of the spectrum.  Thirdly, many of our communities are widely recognised as premier communities within their respective market segments.  This is important as we should outperform the competition in a continued housing recovery.'

During the year under review, Reinet purchased certain minority interests and repaid funding provided by a minority partner for the total amount of EUR 9 million.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 164 million (31 March 2015: EUR 207 million), of which EUR 2 million is attributable to minority partners (31 March 2015: EUR 8 million).

The current valuation is based on audited financial statements as at 31 December 2015 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2016. The decrease in the valuation reflects decreases in land values, changes in the expected rate of lot sales, changes in forecast management expenses and the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the year.

DIAMOND INTERESTS
Reinet has invested in two projects in South Africa. Firstly in an entity which extracts diamonds from the waste tailings of mining operations which began over a century ago.  The tailings are located at Jagersfontein in South Africa. Developments in terms of gemstone extraction technology since the mines were first excavated mean that there is now the potential to recover stones which were previously treated as waste. In addition, Reinet has an interest in a separate project, which has acquired rights to source diamonds on a previously unexploited site at Rooipoort near Kimberley in South Africa. Both entities are fully operational and continue to repay loans to Reinet.

Henk van Zuydam, Chief Financial Officer of both projects, commented as follows:

'Jagersfontein and Rooipoort achieved positive trading results during the past financial year. This is attributed to good production levels, effective cost management and the derived benefit of the depreciation of the South African rand against the US dollar. During the year the companies implemented various new technologies in the recovery of diamonds which has enhanced the companies' recovery capabilities and also increased efficiencies.

The benefits of the above were diluted by the softer world rough diamond pricing experienced during the course of the year due to the continued slowdown in the global economy. The general decline in rough prices notwithstanding, Jagersfontein and Rooipoort goods enjoyed strong demand at their tenders evidenced by continued high attendances which resulted in competitive bidding. From November 2015 there were tentative signs that rough diamond prices in the market were recovering, a trend that has continued into 2016.'

In total these projects are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 59 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 92 million) based on discounted cash flow projections. The decrease in estimated fair value reflects repayment of loans and interest in the year amounting to EUR 13 million along with the decrease in market prices of rough diamonds and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year, offset by a decrease in the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.

Reinet has borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in these projects and entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 550 million (31 March 2015: ZAR 715 million).

OTHER INVESTMENTS
The increase in other investments relates to two new investments in the year, the first is a venture in the digital music industry with an estimated fair value of EUR 25 million and the second, a 3D manufacturing initiative with an estimated fair value of EUR 22 million. In addition, as noted above, the remaining assets distributed from the Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. are included in this caption with an estimated fair value of EUR 10 million.

There were no significant changes in value during the year in respect of other investments either as a result of movements in the valuation of underlying investments, further amounts invested or returns of capital.


COMMITTED FUNDS 
Funding commitments are entered into in various currencies including sterling, US dollar and South African rand and are converted into euro using 31 March 2016 exchange rates.

The table below summarises Reinet's outstanding investment commitments at 31 March 2016.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Reinet holds cash on deposit principally in European banks.

Reinet's liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements, including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings, and can be summarised as follows:

Cash at bank                                                                       EUR 380 m
Undrawn borrowing facilities                                                       EUR 379 m
Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table above)                    ( EUR 348 m )
Cash required to meet ZAR borrowing obligations (refer to note below)            ( EUR  26 m )

Existing bank borrowings of EUR 391 million under the collar financing arrangements noted below will be settled either by the delivery of BAT shares pursuant to the put and call options in place, by the proceeds of the sale of BAT shares, or may be rolled over or replaced by other borrowings.

Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time.

The undrawn borrowing facilities comprise a facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch of GBP 150 million and a facility with Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. of GBP 150 million, in total GBP 300 million (EUR 379 million). At 31 March 2016, these facilities had not been drawn upon.

BANK BORROWINGS AND RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
BORROWINGS
In February 2012, in order to meet its ongoing commitments, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million, medium-term collar financing arrangement. At 31 March 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 380 million (31 March 2015: EUR 415 million).  The decrease in estimated fair value reflects the weakening of sterling against the euro, offset by a decrease in interest rates during the year. The collar financing arrangement involves the purchase by Reinet of put options and the sale by Reinet of call options over 13.7 million BAT shares. The remaining unpaid net option premium is payable over the period to 2017 and is carried as a liability at its estimated fair value of EUR 11 million as at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 25 million). Some 1 million BAT shares have also been pledged to guarantee the balance of the net option premium and a portion of the interest payments.

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 March 2016, the estimated fair value of the borrowing was EUR 26 million (31 March 2015: EUR 34 million); the decrease in estimated fair value is due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) – PUT AND CALL OPTIONS AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
Put and call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement noted above are carried at their respective estimated fair values at the balance sheet date. The net derivative liability is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 80 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 26 million). The increase in the value of the liability is due to the increase in the BAT share price of over GBP 6 in the year.

Reinet has entered into a forward exchange contract to sell ZAR 550 million (31 March 2015: ZAR 715 million). The derivative asset in respect of the forward exchange contract is carried at its estimated fair value of EUR 2 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: liability of EUR 6 million). The change in value reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro in the year.

OTHER LIABILITIES
MINORITY INTEREST, FEES PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, NET OF OTHER ASSETS
The minority interest liability amounts to EUR 15 million (31 March 2015: EUR 23 million) and is in respect of minority partners' share in the gains and losses not yet distributed to them arising from the fair value movement of investments in which they have interests.

Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 5 million in respect of the performance fee payable as at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: EUR 78 million), together with the half-yearly management fee payable of EUR 22 million (31 March 2015: EUR 18 million), a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 10 million (31 March 2015: EUR 24 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic and withholding and corporate taxes of EUR 18 million (31 March 2015: EUR 14 million) relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages. Accruals and other payables amount to some EUR 10 million (31 March 2015: EUR 4 million).

The performance fee and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

(1) The reversal of the unrealised gain on shares sold represents the unrealised gain as at 1 April 2015 on the 6.25 million BAT shares sold during the year ended 31 March 2016.

INCOME
Dividends received from BAT increased from EUR 133 million (GBP 107 million) during the year under review to EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million). The increase is due to the increase of GBP 0.05 in the dividend per BAT share and the strengthening of the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments. The dividends received from BAT represent the final 2014 dividend paid in May 2015, as well as the interim 2015 dividend paid in September 2015.

Interest income is earned on bank deposits and loans made to underlying investments.

Total realised gains on investments of EUR 251 million includes EUR 178 million in respect of the sale of 6.25 million BAT shares calculated by reference to the cost of the investment when the BAT shares were first carried at fair value when Reinet was established in 2008.  Other gains comprise EUR 75 million in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds and net realised losses of EUR 2 million in respect of other investments. Reinet's share of the Trilantic gains amounts to EUR 68 million with a further EUR 7 million being attributable to the minority partner.

Gains of EUR 1 million were realised on the settlement of the euro/South African rand foreign exchange contracts during the year.

Carried interest of EUR 6 million was attributable to Reinet in respect of investments realised by the Trilantic funds.

EXPENSES
The performance fee payable for the year ended 31 March 2016 amounts to EUR 5 million (31 March 2015: EUR 78 million). The performance fee is calculated as 10 per cent of the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return as defined in the Company's Prospectus, published on 10 October 2008 (the 'Prospectus'), including dividends paid, over the period since completion of the rights issue in December 2008 up to 31 March 2016, less the sum of all performance fees paid in respect of previous periods. 

The management fee for the year ended 31 March 2016 amounts to EUR 46 million (31 March 2015: EUR 39 million). Operating expenses of EUR 7 million include EUR 1 million in respect of charges from Reinet Investments Manager S.A. (the 'General Partner') and other expenses, including legal and other fees, which amounted to EUR 6 million.

Interest expense relates to sterling and South African rand denominated borrowings.

The net tax income of EUR 5 million includes corporate and withholding taxes payable in respect of gains realised on Trilantic investments, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax provision related to unrealised gains, expected distributions and accrued interest in respect of the Trilantic funds and other US investments.

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
The investment in 68.1 million BAT shares increased in value by EUR 234 million during the year under review. Of this, EUR 565 million was attributable to the increase in value of the underlying BAT shares in sterling terms offset by EUR 331 million due to the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year under review.

The unrealised fair value adjustment of EUR 253 million in respect of other investments includes an increase in the estimated fair value of the investment in Pension Corporation of EUR 13 million, a decrease in the estimated fair value of the Trilantic funds of EUR 77 million, decreases in the estimated fair value of the investment in United States land development and mortgages of EUR 78 million, decreases in the estimated fair value of the investment in Diamond interests of EUR 26 million together with decreases of EUR 85 million in respect of certain other investments. The above amounts include the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates due to the depreciation of other currencies against the euro in the year under review.

The estimated fair value of the collar financing derivative liability increased by EUR 54 million during the year, reflecting the increase in the price of the BAT shares underlying the put and call options. The estimated fair value of the forward exchange contracts increased by EUR 8 million, thereby changing from a liability at the beginning of the year to an asset at the end of the year, reflecting the weakening of the South African rand against the euro. In total, these items increased the derivative liabilities by EUR 46 million in the year under review.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates.  An unrealised gain of EUR 8 million arose in respect of the South African rand borrowing due to the weakening of the South African rand against the euro during the year. An unrealised gain of EUR 39 million arose in respect of the sterling borrowing. Of this, a gain of EUR 37 million is due to the weakening of the sterling/euro exchange rate during the year.

MINORITY INTEREST
The minority interest expense arises in respect of the minority partners' shares in the earnings of the Reinet entities which hold the Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages interests, respectively.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Investments totalling EUR 116 million were made during the year, including SPDR Gold shares, United States land development and mortgages, Trilantic, Milestone, Renshaw Bay Real Estate fund and new investments in the digital music industry and 3D manufacturing initiative. Amounts invested were partially offset by repayments in respect of loans and interest received from Jagersfontein and Rooipoort.

Proceeds from the sale of investments include EUR 307 million in respect of the BAT shares sold during the year, EUR 99 million realised through Trilantic, a distribution of EUR 40 million following the dissolution of the Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. and EUR 11 million on the sale of other investments. 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
A dividend of some EUR 31 million was paid to shareholders in September 2015 (September 2014: EUR 30 million).

Funding is received from minority partners in respect of investments made in Trilantic and United States land development and mortgages. The appropriate share of distributions received from the same investments are repaid to minority partners.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Dividends received from BAT increased by 12 per cent from EUR 133 million (GBP 107 million) to EUR 149 million (GBP 110 million) during the year under review. The increase is due to an increase of GBP 0.05 per share in the underlying dividends paid by BAT and a strengthening in the sterling/euro exchange rate at the time of the dividend payments. The dividends received from BAT represent the final 2014 dividend, paid in May 2015, as well as the interim 2015 dividend paid in September 2015.

Carried interest of EUR 6 million was received in respect of the investment in Trilantic.

Interest of EUR 10 million was paid in respect of the sterling loan and EUR 2 million in respect of the South African rand-denominated loan in the year.

The performance fee of EUR 78 million was paid in respect of the year ending 31 March 2015. A performance fee of EUR 5 million is payable in respect of the current year.

US tax payments of EUR 4 million were made in the year under review. This amount includes taxes withheld by Trilantic in respect of gains and carried interest received, together with estimated taxes paid on gains and income which will be taxable in the US.

Liquid funds increased by EUR 304 million over the year to EUR 380 million as the proceeds from the sale of investments and BAT dividends received exceeded amounts invested in new investments together with payment of the dividend, performance fee and operating expenses.

DIVIDEND
The Company relies on distributions from Reinet Fund as its principal source of income from which it may pay dividends.

A cash dividend of EUR 0.157 per share totalling some EUR 31 million was paid in September 2015, following approval at the annual general meeting on 25 August 2015.

The General Partner has proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.161 per share subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 30 August 2016.

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by the Company.

The Company has sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by and paid to holders of Reinet Depository Receipts ('DRs'). SARS has confirmed that any such dividends will be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends will be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 15 per cent in the hands of DR holders unless those holders are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of DRs will be required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax.

The dividend will be payable in accordance with the following schedule, subject to shareholder approval:

The last day to trade the Company's shares and the Company's DRs cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 6 September 2016. Both the Company's shares and the Company's DRs will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 7 September 2016. The record date for the Company's shares will be Thursday, 8 September 2016 and for the Company's DRs will be Friday, 9 September 2016.
 
The dividend on the Company's shares will be paid on Friday, 9 September 2016 and is payable in euros.

The dividend in respect of the Company's DRs will be paid on Friday, 16 September 2016. The DR dividend is payable in South African rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in euros to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to DR holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 25 May 2016 on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange news service.

SHARES IN ISSUE
The number of shares in issue remained unchanged during the period at 195 942 286. This figure includes 1 000 management shares held by the General Partner.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated audited financial statements at 31 March 2016, on which this announcement is based, have been approved by the Board of the General Partner on 17 May 2016 and are subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting to be held in August 2016.

As at 31 March 2016, the net asset value (‘NAV’) of the Fund amounted to EUR 5 221 million, a decrease of
EUR 140 million from 31 December 2015.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet
Investments S.C.A. at 31 March 2016. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet
Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including amounts payable to

All investments are held either directly or indirectly, by Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('Reinet Fund'). Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the 'Company') and Reinet Fund together with Reinet Fund's subsidiaries are referred to as 'Reinet'.

Full information on Reinet's investments may be found in the Reinet 2015 annual report which is available at www.reinet.com

Major items impacting the NAV during the quarter under review are described below.

Listed investments

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C. ('BAT')
The investment in BAT remains Reinet's single largest investment position and is kept under constant review, considering the company's performance, the industry outlook, cash flows from dividends, stock market performance, volatility and liquidity.

Reinet holds 74.3 million shares in BAT, representing 3.9 per cent of BAT's issued share capital. The value of the investment in BAT at 31 December 2015 was EUR 3 803 million (30 September 2015: EUR 3 664 million), being 71 per cent of Reinet's NAV. The BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange increased from GBP 36.43 at 30 September 2015 to GBP 37.71 at 31 December 2015. 

Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport.

Unlisted investments

PENSION CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED
The total capital invested to date is EUR 543 million, which constitutes Reinet's full capital commitment to Pension Corporation Group Limited. Reinet's equity holding is 43 per cent.

The investment is carried at an estimated fair value of EUR 941 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 815 million), taking into account the unaudited embedded value of Pension Corporation Group Limited at 30 September 2015 and valuation multiples drawn from industry data; both of which increased during the quarter. The embedded value increase reflects new business written and the impact of changes in inflation and interest rates. The increase in market multiples reflects the uplift in the UK insurance market in the quarter.

Further information in respect of Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS

TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS
Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P. ('Fund IV')
At 31 December 2015, Reinet and its partner have invested EUR 82 million (30 September 2015: EUR 83 million), net of capital repayments, in Trilantic general partnerships and management companies ('Trilantic Management') and Fund IV. Capital repayments will continue to be received in future, as Fund IV continues the process of realising investments.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 113 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 142 million). The investment in Fund IV is based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 30 September 2015 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios. The decrease in the valuation is due mainly to distributions of EUR 12 million in the period under review together with net decreases in the value of the remaining investments. Of the EUR 113 million carrying value, some EUR 102 million is attributable to Reinet, with the balance being attributable to its minority partner.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had remaining commitments of EUR 43 million to invest in Fund IV.

Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. ('Fund V')
At 31 December 2015, Reinet had invested EUR 39 million in Fund V and Fund V's general partner ('Fund V GP') (30 September 2015: EUR 28 million). The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 40 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 27 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management as at 30 September 2015. The increase in fair value is due to capital invested in the quarter.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had remaining commitments of EUR 56 million to invest in Fund V and Fund V GP.

Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. ('TEP')
At 31 December 2015, Reinet had invested EUR 6 million in TEP (30 September 2015: EUR 6 million). The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 5 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 5 million), based on unaudited valuation data as at 30 September 2015.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had remaining commitments of EUR 30 million to invest in TEP.

Further information on Trilantic is available at www.trilanticpartners.com.

Reinet has invested EUR 61 million to date (30 September 2015: EUR 52 million). The fair value at 31 December 2015 is EUR 64 million (30 September 2015: EUR 54 million) based on audited valuation data provided by Renshaw Bay at 30 September 2015 adjusted for amounts invested in the quarter.

Reinet is committed to invest a further EUR 75 million in the fund.

Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P.

Reinet had invested a total of EUR 55 million in the fund; in connection with the dissolution it received cash distributions amounting to EUR 38 million and a distribution of assets with an estimated fair value of EUR 7 million.

ASIAN PRIVATE EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO FUNDS
Milestone China Opportunities funds, investment holdings and management company participation

Milestone China Opportunities Fund III L.P. ('Milestone III')
At 31 December 2015, capital contributions of EUR 76 million, net of capital repayments, had been made to Milestone III (30 September 2015: EUR 74 million). This investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 63 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 50 million). The valuation is based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 30 September 2015, adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments in the underlying portfolio. The increase in fair value over the period under review is mainly the result of increases in value of underlying listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had remaining commitments to Milestone III of EUR 11 million.

Investment holdings
At 31 December 2015, capital contributions of EUR 39 million had been made in respect of this investment (30 September 2015: EUR 32 million).

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 51 million at 31 December 2015, based on unaudited valuation data at 30 September 2015, adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments in the underlying portfolio (30 September 2015: EUR 34 million). The increase in fair value is the result of capital contributions made in the quarter along with increases in the value of underlying listed investments and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had no remaining commitment in respect of this investment.

Further information on Milestone Capital and Milestone funds may be found at www.mcmchina.com.


Prescient China Balanced Fund ('Prescient China') and investment management company
The investment in Prescient China and its investment management company is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 48 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 41 million), based on unaudited valuation data provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2015. The increase in value during the quarter is due to increased values of the fund's underlying listed investments.

Further information on Prescient China may be found at www.prescient.co.za.

In respect of both the Milestone entities and Prescient China, listed securities are valued using the listed price as at 31 December 2015. Whilst the Chinese equity market showed a large increase in value in the quarter ended 31 December 2015, significant volatility remains and decreases in value have been noted in 2016 to date.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES
At 31 December 2015, Reinet had invested EUR 178 million in this investment (30 September 2015: EUR 166 million), of which EUR 8 million was invested in the current quarter. The further increase in amounts invested includes some EUR 4 million in respect of foreign exchange gains due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the quarter.

The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of EUR 200 million (30 September 2015: EUR 189 million) of which EUR 197 million is attributable to Reinet and EUR 3 million to its partners. 

The current valuation is based on independent valuations of underlying assets as at 30 June 2015 adjusted for cash receipts and payments in the period to 31 December 2015. The increase in the value for the current quarter reflects additional investments made and the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the quarter.

DIAMOND INTERESTS
Reinet has invested in two projects in South Africa.

In total these projects are carried at their estimated fair value of EUR 58 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 65 million). The current valuation is based on discounted cash flow analyses prepared by local management. The decrease in carrying value reflects loan repayments received in the quarter and the weakening of the South African rand against the euro.

At 31 December 2015, Reinet had remaining commitments of EUR 3 million to invest in these projects.

The exposure to the South African rand has been hedged through borrowings and forward exchange contracts.

OTHER INVESTMENTS
The increase in other investments relates mainly to the transfer of assets from the Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. following its dissolution in December 2015. The value of the assets received was EUR 7 million.

There were no significant changes in value during the period in respect of other investments either as a result of movements in the valuation of underlying investments, further amounts invested or returns of capital.

CASH AND LIQUID FUNDS
Cash and liquid funds at 31 December 2015 amounted to EUR 123 million (30 September 2015: EUR 128 million).

During the quarter under review Reinet invested some EUR 39 million in underlying investments, including EUR 12 million in the Trilantic investments, EUR 8 million in the Renshaw Bay entities, EUR 7 million in Milestone and EUR 8 million in United States land development and mortgages. Distributions from investments amounted to EUR 51 million, including EUR 38 million from the Renshaw Bay Structured Finance Opportunity L.P. and EUR 12 million from the Trilantic funds. Management fees of EUR 21 million accrued at 30 September 2015 were paid to Reinet Investment Advisor Limited (the 'Investment Advisor').

Reinet has in place borrowing facilities which will permit it to drawdown the equivalent of up to GBP 300 million in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitment. The borrowing facilities comprise a facility with Bank of America for GBP 150 million and a facility with Morgan Stanley of GBP 150 million. As at 31 December 2015, these facilities had not been drawn upon.

BANK BORROWINGS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
Borrowings
In February 2012, Reinet entered into a GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing arrangement. At 31 December 2015, the fair value of the borrowing was EUR 408 million (30 September 2015: EUR 407 million). The increase in fair value reflects the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the quarter. The collar financing arrangement involves the purchase by Reinet of put options and the sale by Reinet of call options over 13.7 million BAT shares. The remaining unpaid net option premium is payable over the period to 2017 and is carried as a liability at its fair value of EUR 15 million as at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 18 million).

Reinet has also borrowed ZAR 443 million to fund its investments in South African projects. At 31 December 2015, the fair value of the borrowing was EUR 26 million (30 September 2015: EUR 29 million). The decrease in fair value reflects the weakening of the South African rand against the euro.

Derivative assets / (liabilities) – put and call options and forward exchange contracts
Put and call options in respect of the GBP 300 million medium-term collar financing facility noted above are carried at their respective fair values at the balance sheet date. The net derivative liability is carried at its fair value of EUR 43 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 38 million).

Reinet has entered into forward exchange contracts to sell ZAR 550 million (30 September 2015: ZAR 650 million). The net derivative asset in respect of the forward exchange contracts is carried at its fair value of EUR 2 million at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015:  liability of EUR 1 million).

OTHER LIABILITIES
Fees payable and other liabilities, net of other assets
Fees payable and other liabilities comprise principally an accrual of EUR 11 million in respect of the management fee up to 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR 21 million) and a provision for deferred taxes of EUR 31 million (30 September 2015: EUR 34 million) relating to gains arising from the investments in Trilantic Capital Partners and withholding taxes relating to the investment in United States land development and mortgages.

No provision has been made in respect of a performance fee as at 31 December 2015 (30 September 2015: EUR nil) as the conditions required to pay a fee had not been met at that date.

The performance fee and management fee are payable to the Investment Advisor.

COMMITMENTS MADE
In 2011, Reinet committed to invest up to USD 10 million in Snow Phipps II, L.P. a US fund investing in the US middle-market private equity space. In the current quarter, Reinet made a commitment of USD 100 million (EUR 92 million) to Snow Phipps III, L.P. the successor fund to Snow Phipps II, L.P.
