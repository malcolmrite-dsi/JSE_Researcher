STANDARD BANK GROUP AND THE STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED
RATING ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTOR SERVICES

In accordance with paragraph 6.8 of the JSE Debt Listings
Requirements, noteholders are hereby advised that on 24 November
2020, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s) downgraded the long-term
issuer rating of the holding company, Standard Bank Group Limited
(“SBG”) from Ba2 to Ba3. The rating agency also downgraded The
Standard Bank of South Africa Limited’s (“SBSA”) long-term local and
foreign currency deposit ratings from Ba1 To Ba2 and affirmed the
NSR long-term bank deposit rating. The outlook remains negative.

Moody’s rating downgrade of SBG and SBSA follows their decision to
downgrade the ratings of the Government of South Africa on 20
November 2020, to Ba2 from Ba1 and maintain the negative outlook.

The downgrade by Moody’s, in itself, is not expected to have a
material impact on SBG’s and SBSA’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and
capital adequacy. The group remains well capitalised and liquid.

1 Themovement in the FCTR was primarily as a result of the depreciation of the Rand against the USD, GBP and
 certain African currencies.
Update on the group’s performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2020

The group remains committed to supporting our customers, employees and communities during this difficult time.
Our three phased approach - respond, recover and re-imagine – remains relevant and underpins our decision
making for the “now” and the “next”.

In 3Q20, lockdowns continued to be eased or lifted, and economic activity improved across the countries in which
we operate in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite these positive developments, we remain on high alert. Our business
continuity management programmes, including safety protocols, remain in place. Over 70% of our employees are
still working from home and many will continue to do so for the rest of the year.

From an economic perspective, we remain of the view that 2Q20 was a low point and expect an improvement in
subsequent quarters, particularly in South Africa. We continue to track in line with our previous macro-economic
expectations in South Africa, and slightly better in Africa Regions. In South Africa, our growth forecast remains
unchanged from those provided at our 2020 Interim results on 20 August 2020; real GDP is expected to contract
by 8.5% in 2020 and expand by 4.5% in 2021. Low global inflation (including low oil prices) and subdued local
demand will continue to help contain inflation in South Africa (CPI expected to average 3.3% in 2020 and 4.1% in
2021). While real GDP is also expected to contract on average across the countries in which we operate in sub-
Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), the contraction is expected to be much less severe than in South Africa.
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are expected to report real GDP growth in 2020. The timing and shape of the
recovery remains subject to disruptions caused by new waves of infection, both in Africa and in key trading
partners. In addition, country-specific risks in Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe remain
elevated.

Against this backdrop, the group continues to provide significant support to our retail, business and commercial,
and wholesale clients via a variety of measures. Pleasingly, as economies have opened, our clients have
required less support, and many have resumed their payments. All requests for additional relief and/or extensions
have been subject to appropriate client-specific risk assessments.

By 30 September 2020, the Personal & Business Banking South Africa (PBB SA) client relief portfolio had
declined from R107 billion as at 30 June 2020 to R61 billion. On the lapsed accounts (i.e. where the payment
holiday period granted had expired and the relief had not been extended) the average monthly instalment
payment rate was >95% for the secured portfolios (mortgages and VAF), >90% for the unsecured portfolios (card
and personal unsecured) and 100% for business lending. Of the extended portfolio (i.e. where the payment
holiday period granted had expired and the relief period had been extended), 83% thereof was secured.
Provision coverage on the remaining R61 billion client relief portfolio increased relative to 30 June 2020.

In PBB Africa Regions (PBB AR), the client relief portfolio declined from R11 billion as at 30 June 2020 to
R6 billion as at 30 September 2020. Of the balance outstanding c.56% is to business customers, >75% is
secured and >75% relates to exposures to clients in Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Uganda. The performance of
the lapsed book is better than the rest of the portfolio – 99% in stage 1 and 2. Provision coverage on the
remaining R6 billion client relief portfolio increased relative to 30 June 2020.

The table below provides the PBB SA and PBB AR client relief portfolios as at 30 June 2020 and 30 September
2020:

 PBB – client relief loans                                   South Africa, Rbn           Africa Regions, Rbn
 Outstanding as at 30 June 2020                                             107                            11
 As a % of total respective portfolios                                     18%                           12%

 Outstanding as at 30 September 2020                                          61                             6
 As a % of total respective portfolios                                      10%                             7%

In addition, as at 30 September 2020 the group had approved R10 billion of loans under the South African
Covid-19 loan guarantee scheme (up from R8.3 billion as at 30 June 2020).

Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) client exposures with restructured terms increased to R70 billion (from
R48 billion as at 30 June 2020). CIB continues to monitor certain sector- and client-specific risks closely; namely
Commercial Real Estate, Hospitality and Oil & Gas.

In 3Q20, PBB disbursements continued to recover from lows in April 2020. In South Africa, attractive house
prices and lower interest rates supported sales activity and in turn, mortgage disbursements in the quarter.
Period on period, growth in PBB’s unsecured portfolios continued to outpace that of the secured portfolios.
Growth of the PBB Africa Regions’ portfolio continued to outpace PBB South Africa. In CIB in 3Q20, lending to
corporates in South Africa slowed relative to 1H20, however lending growth in Africa Regions remained robust.
Customer deposit growth period on period remained robust.

The significant interest rate cuts year to date are an increasing drag on margins and net interest income (NII). In
South Africa, we do not expect any further interest rate cuts this year (after cumulative cuts of 300 basis points to
the end of July 2020). We expect a 25 basis point increase in 2021. In Africa Regions, inflation is broadly in
check and rates are expected to remain at similar levels through to the end of the year. Trading activities slowed
in 3Q20 but remained a key driver of non-interest revenue growth year to date. In South Africa, PBB account
turnover levels recovered to at or around pre-Covid levels (personal accounts slightly above and business
accounts slightly below). Larger businesses recovered faster than smaller businesses. Physical channel activity
levels (branch and ATM) improved but remained below pre-Covid levels, negatively impacting fees. In PBB Africa
Regions, ongoing customer acquisition supported fees.

Cost containment remains a focus. IT costs remained elevated as we continued to invest, particularly in digital
client capabilities. In light of the NII and activity-related fee pressures, we expect negative jaws for FY20.
Pre-provision operating profit growth was marginally negative period on period.

Credit trends to date are in line with our expectations. While initial indications are that collections have improved
in 3Q20 relative to 2Q20, retrenchment claims have also increased. The latter, combined with broader customer
stress, resulted in an increase in non-performing loans and additional impairment charges as balances
transferred from stage 1 or 2 to stage 3. There remains a risk that the environment deteriorates, and the portfolio
performance is worse than currently expected; for example, due to new waves of infection, subsequent
lockdowns and further job losses.

In 3Q20, Africa Regions’ performance continued to support group performance, offsetting ongoing strain in South
Africa. The West Region continues to perform particularly well. The scale and diversity of the group’s revenue
streams across client, product and geography remains a key advantage.

ICBC Standard Bank (ICBCS) continued to report a positive result year to date. Liberty’s performance remains
sensitive to market and Covid-related developments.

Group profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the nine months to 30 September 2020 was 52% lower than
the comparative period. Group headline earnings was 39% lower than in the comparative period. There were no
additional material headline adjustable items in 3Q20. The group’s net asset value has grown 5% year to date.

The group is well capitalised and liquid. In terms of funding, market pricing continued to improve in the quarter
and in late September, the group’s issue of R1.5 billion of Additional Tier 1 bonds was well supported and priced
at attractive levels. Based on current planning, the group expects to continue to have sufficient capital to pay
preference share dividends. The South African Reserve Bank’s guidance on ordinary dividends remains in place
at this stage.

In line with the group’s commitment to improve disclosures on climate-related matters, the group has published
its Interim TCFD report; it is available to download on the group’s ESG and Investor Relations websites.

The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 30 September 2020 will be released in November 2020.

Looking forward, the Covid-19 pandemic, together with global economic weakness, elevated uncertainty and
depressed sentiment, is expected to negatively impact employment, incomes and equality globally. Emerging
Markets, including sub-Saharan Africa, face high external debt and a dependency on sectors most exposed to
the pandemic. They risk being disproportionately impacted, particularly in terms of an increase in poverty and
inequality.

While impacted by turmoil in the global financial market, South Africa’s ultimate trajectory will be dependent on
the execution of the structural reforms required to support higher growth, job creation and government debt
stabilisation. Standard Bank, together with many others in the private sector, will continue to work with the
government and labour in support of positive, sustainable outcomes. The progress in terms of institutional reform
is pleasing.

As a large, purpose-driven African-focused financial institution, we recognise the important role we can play in
supporting the recovery of the markets in which we operate. In addition, the change in customer expectations,
combined with the acceleration of digital adoption, provide an opportunity to expand our offering and our impact.
Lastly, the group is indebted to our employees who continue to assist and advise our customers and support our
communities despite the challenges and threats. We thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and our
customers and other stakeholders for their ongoing support.

The financial information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update
is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
“Globally, 1H20 has been dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the distressing human and economic cost thereof. During this time, we have
remained steadfast in support of our clients, our employees and the communities in the countries we operate in.” - Sim Tshabalala, Group Chief Executive

Group results
Standard Bank Group’s (SBG or the group) results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (1H20) reflect that of a resilient, well diversified underlying
franchise, negatively impacted by a very difficult environment, particularly in South Africa. The group’s Africa Regions business and Corporate and
Investment Banking business, most notably Global Markets, delivered strong top line growth. The group’s strong capital and liquidity positions going into
this crisis, have allowed us to provide significant temporary relief to clients without constraining our ability to lend to existing and new clients or support
new projects.

The group’s banking operations’ earnings were supported by strong balance sheet growth, robust trading revenues and well contained costs. Positive jaws
of 100 bps supported pre-provision operating profit, which grew 4% period on period to R24.3 billion. Credit impairment charges increased to R11.3 billion,
2.7 times those reported in the prior period (1H19) and reflective of the tough environment and outlook. Consequently, banking operations reported
headline earnings of R7.7 billion, down 40% on 1H19, and a return on equity (ROE) of 9.5%.

Group headline earnings were R7.5 billion, a decline of 44% on 1H19, and ROE was 8.5%. The group’s capital position remained robust, with a common
equity tier 1 capital adequacy (CET1) ratio as at 30 June 2020 of 12.6%. Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders declined 71% to R3.8 billion. The
difference between headline earnings and profit attributable can be ascribed to a R1.4 billion post-tax gain on the sale of the 20% stake in Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (Argentina) S.A. and its affiliates (ICBCA), the associated R3.4 billion negative impact of the foreign currency translation
reserve (FCTR) release on sale and R1.9 billion related to the impairment of certain IT intangible assets. The gain on sale of the group's stake in ICBCA
and the reserve impact are both outside of headline earnings and therefore did not impact group headline earnings. The release of the FCTR balance to
earnings was a movement between reserves and therefore did not impact the net asset value of the group.

Operating environment
Covid-19 has led to the worst economic shock in living memory. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic and
countries responded with widespread lockdowns. Supply chains were disrupted, and demand declined. An oil price war and oversupply drove a swift and
significant decline in the oil price. Fear and uncertainty drove a precipitous fall in the markets and a liquidity squeeze in 1Q20. This was quickly followed by
extraordinary fiscal and monetary actions and fiscal stimulus (in particular, in developed markets) and a variety of regulatory actions. These bold actions,
combined with flattening infection curves, calmed markets somewhat and drove a recovery in 2Q20.

The considerable uncertainty in 1H20 drove an Emerging Market risk-off stance for foreign investors. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced record capital
outflows and financial conditions tightened. Trade and foreign exchange inflows dried up and oil-exporters were negatively impacted by the lower oil price.
Covid-19 related regulatory actions included wide-spread interest rate cuts, easing of capital and liquidity requirements and fee waivers and restrictions.
West Africa was impacted by the lower oil prices, East Africa, by lower trade and a halting of travel and the South and Central economies remained
closely coupled with South Africa.

In South Africa, the interrupted power supply extended the 4Q19 recession into 1Q20. Strict lockdowns brought the economy to a near-standstill.
Prospects of a modest economic recovery in 2020 were replaced with expectations for a large decline (Standard Bank Research: South Africa’s real GDP
is forecast to decline 8.5% in 2020 followed by a 4.5% recovery in 2021). The poor economic outlook and declining inflation trend paved the way for
cumulative interest rate cuts equating to 275 bps in the period. In addition, the South African government implemented a sizeable stimulus package to
support those most vulnerable. Whilst necessary, the additional spending poses a material risk to the public debt trajectory. Fiscal diligence and urgent
structural reforms are more important than ever.

Personal & Business Banking
PBB revenues declined 1% to R35.1 billion. Negative endowment, and related margin compression, more than offset the revenue increases related to
balance sheet growth. NIM declined 42 bps to 559 bps. NIR declined 5% as increased digital transactional volumes and modest annual price increases
were insufficient to offset the significant lockdown-related decline in physical channel volumes, turnover reductions, a drop in trade activity and regulatory
restrictions introduced on certain fees in Africa Regions. Credit impairment charges increased to R8.6 billion (1H19: R3.7 billion), 2.3 times 1H19 charges.
Lockdowns disrupted businesses and impacted client incomes and encouraged customers to transition to our digital channels leading to digital transaction
volumes increasing.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB revenues grew 11% to R21.4 billion. During this period of significant volatility and disruption, CIB continued to proactively engage with clients to
provide tailored funding, liquidity and risk management solutions. CIB’s capabilities and reach remains attractive to domestic clients and multi-national
corporates already operating, seeking to operate or seeking to expand on the continent. The business continued to benefit from diversification across
clients, sectors and regions. Africa Regions delivered a strong performance. Significant margin pressure offset strong balance sheet growth to deliver flat
NII. Cost growth was contained at 5%, delivering positive jaws of 639 bps and an improved cost-to-income ratio of 49.6%. Pre-provision operating profit
grew 19% period on period.

Central and other
This segment includes costs associated with corporate functions and the group’s treasury and capital requirements that have not been otherwise allocated
to the business units. The segment costs, including the R500 million (pre-tax) central provision amounted to R851 million (1H19: R593 million). We
continue to proactively manage the costs recorded in the centre.

Other banking interests
ICBC Standard Bank (ICBCS) recorded a profit of USD70 million in 1H20 (1H19: loss of USD130 million). The group’s 40% share of ICBCS’ earnings
equated to R508 million.

In August 2019, the group exercised its option to sell its 20% stake in ICBCA to the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The sale was completed
on 29 June 2020, post receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

Liberty
In 1H20, Liberty’s performance was negatively impacted by higher morbidity and mortality claims, new business strain and the creation of a R2.2 billion
post-tax pandemic provision to cover future costs related Covid-19 which are still expected to arise. The Shareholder Investment Portfolio performance
reflected negative investment market returns, particularly in respect of foreign and local equities. Liberty reported a headline loss of R2.3 billion (1H19:
earnings of R2.0 billion). After adjusting for treasury shares, the group’s share of the loss amounted to R0.7 billion (1H19: earnings of R0.9 billion).

Prospects
In the month of July, customer activity and business turnover levels continued to recover. While this should be supportive for NIR growth into 2H20,
ongoing uncertainty is expected to constrain balance sheet growth. Lower interest rates are expected to persist throughout 2H20, which will put pressure
on NII. Trading revenues are expected to be below 1H20 levels. PBB provision levels, while deemed sufficient, are sensitive to macro-economic
developments as well as client behaviour. Where appropriate, PBB has agreed to extend payment holidays and other relief measures. Client behaviour
post the expiry thereof will be key. Forecast risk remains high and should the outcome be worse than expected, additional provisions will be required.
While current CIB provision levels are deemed appropriate, CIB exposures, by their nature, are lumpy and additional provisions may be required if ratings
deteriorate further and/or individual clients experience difficulties. The Board will take into account the SARB’s guidance and group’s capital position and
the outlook before deciding whether to declare a final dividend. We are unable to provide revised medium-term targets at this time.

Covid-19 has already had a profound impact globally and there remains much uncertainty as to the ultimate human and economic toll. In addition,
US/China tensions remain a risk. In contrast, lockdowns will be rolled back, and economies will reopen. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting
global real GDP to contract by 4.9%, sub-Saharan Africa by 3.2% and South Africa by 8.0% in 2020, followed by a recovery of 5.4%, 3.4% and 3.5%
respectively, in 2021. Accordingly, we shift our focus to recovery. Leveraging the group’s strong capital position, we will continue to work with our
individual, business and corporate clients, in a responsible manner, to find suitable solutions to enable them to participate and support the much-needed
transition to the recovery phase.

The world changed fundamentally and, to some extent, permanently, in a matter of weeks. While the pandemic has created distress and anxiety for many
people, it has also created new opportunities, specifically the opportunity to accelerate change. As a group operating across the continent, with operations
and clients across the globe, we need to adapt to remain relevant. As we re-imagine the future, we remain of the view that our future-ready strategy
remains valid. However, we recognise the need to accelerate our digital delivery and, in parallel, drive operational efficiency. We remain committed to
delivering a positive societal, economic and environmental impact. Combined, this will ensure we remain relevant to our customers, attractive to our
employees and enable us to deliver value to all stakeholders. And, in doing so, we will also deliver on our purpose of driving Africa’s growth.

    The non-redeemable, non-cumulative, non-participating preference shares (SBPP) are entitled to a dividend of not less than 77% of the prime interest rate multiplied by the subscription price
    of R100 per share.

The above dates are subject to change. Any changes will be released on the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) and published in the South African
and Namibian press.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for both resident and non-resident preference shareholders.
Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to dividends tax that was introduced with effect
from 1 April 2012. South African resident preference shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20%
of the cash dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 2.60 cents per first
preference share and 266.400 cents per second preference share. Non-resident preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less
than 20% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
• 1 619 929 317 ordinary shares at a par value of 10 cents each
• 8 000 000 first preference shares at a par value of R1 each
• 52 982 248 second preference shares at a par value of 1 cent each and subscription price of R100.

The company’s tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

Additional operational update and trading statement update for the six-month period ended 30
June 2020

Operational update

Despite considerable effort, the pandemic appears to be gaining momentum in certain of the markets
in which the group operates on the continent, particularly in South Africa. Elsewhere in the world,
countries are battling with a second wave of infections. The path from here remains uncertain and this
continues to weigh on sentiment and demand.

Against this backdrop, Standard Bank recognises the importance of continuing to support our clients,
our staff and the communities in the markets in which the group operates.

In June 2020, the group continued to receive additional client relief requests, however the rate slowed
month-on-month. All requests remain subject to internal credit assessment processes. Total relief
provided by the group to clients increased from May to June. In addition, the group continued to
receive applications for funding under the South Africa Covid-19 SME Loan Guarantee Scheme.
Applications are assessed and funds disbursed in line with the scheme requirements. Standard Bank
welcomes the recent amendments to the scheme, in particular removing the business size threshold
and relaxing some of the restrictions imposed on businesses that participate.

As noted in the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) announcement on 1 June 2020,
disbursements and transaction activity levels were negatively impacted by the lockdowns, in particular
in April 2020. Activity levels did improve in May and June as lockdowns were eased, but in most
instances, remained below pre-lockdown levels.

On 29 June 2020, Standard Bank completed the sale of its 20% stake in ICBC Argentina (ICBCA) to
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited on the terms announced on SENS on 8 August
2019. The sale price was fixed in US Dollars (USD) and the carrying value of the investment was held
in Argentinean Peso (ARS). In the period between announcing the sale in August 2019 and
completion of the sale in June 2020, the South African Rand (ZAR) weakened relative to the USD and
the ARS weakened relative to the ZAR. As a result, the group’s gain on sale was higher than
previously estimated (R1.4 billion vs R0.6 billion) and the accumulated foreign currency translation
reserve (FCTR) debit balance was also higher than previously estimated (R3.4 billion vs R2.9 billion).
Under IFRS, the accumulated balance on the FCTR is required to be released to earnings upon
completion of the disposal.

The net impact of R2.0 billion negatively impacts earnings attributable to the group in the six-month
period ended 30 June 2020. The gain on sale and the FCTR impact are both outside of headline
earnings and therefore do not impact group headline earnings.
The release of the FCTR balance to earnings is a movement between reserves and therefore does
not impact the Net Asset Value of the group. The disposal will be marginally positive for the group’s
common equity tier 1 ratio.

With regards to Liberty Holdings Limited’s (Liberty) performance, please refer to Liberty’s
announcement released on SENS on 27 July 2020.

As at 30 June 2020, the group remained well capitalised and liquid.

Trading statement update

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, and as an update
to the trading statement published on 1 June 2020, shareholders are advised that Standard Bank is
satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists with regards to the group’s financial results for
1H20. The group’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 1H20 is expected to be between 30% and
50% lower than the reported HEPS for the six-month period ended 30 June 2019 (“comparative
period”), translating into a decrease from the comparative period’s HEPS of 837.4 cents per share to
a range of between 586.2 and 418.7 cents per share.

The group’s earnings per share (EPS) for 1H20, is expected to be between 60% and 80% lower than
the comparative period, translating into a decrease from the comparative period’s EPS of 827.0 cents
per share to a range of between 330.8 and 165.4 cents per share.

The difference between the HEPS and EPS ranges can be attributed to the accounting consequences
of the finalisation of the sale of ICBCA, as referenced above, and an impairment of certain IT
intangibles following an internal review. Additional information regarding the IT impairments will be
provided when the group reports interim results.

1H20 Results

Standard Bank will release interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 on 20 August 2020.
Details are available on the Standard Bank Group Investor Relations website -
https://reporting.standardbank.com/

The pandemic is proving to have a profound human and economic impact across the globe. We
would like to assure our customers and our staff that we are here to support them. We would like to
also thank all those in the broader Standard Bank community for their continued commitment to
servicing our customers and supporting one another.

Shareholders are advised that the information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed
or reported on by the group’s auditors.

Voluntary trading update and trading statement for the six month period ending 30 June 2020

Trading update

Shareholders are advised that the outlook for the twelve month period ending 31 December 2020
(FY20) continues to deteriorate. In sub-Saharan Africa, the human impact of the Covid-19 pandemic
is growing. Standard Bank recognises the need to “flatten the curve”. We will continue to prioritise the
safety and wellbeing of our employees and our customers, while also supporting community initiatives
in the countries in which we operate.

The group also recognises the significant impact the lockdowns have had, and continue to have, on
our clients. While the lockdowns in some of our markets started to ease or be lifted in early May,
South Africa’s lockdown has continued to constrain large parts of the economy. In Africa Regions, the
group’s African operations outside South Africa, the lockdown period has averaged 37 days. South
Africa has been under a relatively restrictive lockdown for 63 days. We welcome the SA
Government’s decision to transition to level 3 and open-up more of the economy.

While the economic data is likely to take some time to catch up, the toll of the lockdowns is starting to
emerge. By 28 May, the Personal and Business Banking division (PBB) had provided R92 billion in
relief to individuals, SMMEs and commercial clients in SA across 285 000 accounts and R11 billion to
predominantly commercial PBB clients in Africa Regions across 14 000 accounts. The Corporate &
Investment Banking division (CIB) had concluded restructures for eligible clients with risk exposures
amounting to approximately R30 billion. To date, the CIB requests have largely originated in SA.

From a Standard Bank perspective, the lockdowns negatively impacted sales, disbursements and
transaction activity levels. In South Africa, in April deeds offices and dealerships were closed which
halted mortgage disbursements and resulted in a more than 70% decline in VAF disbursements
compared to March. In addition, ATM and branch volumes were down 38% and 61% respectively.
While there has been an improvement in activity levels during the course of May, they remain below
those seen prior to the lockdown.

There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic and the
associated governmental responses will have on the economies in the markets in which the group
operates, and in turn, on the group. While we remain unable to provide guidance with regards to the
group’s performance for the year ending 31 December 2020, we wish to provide some high-level
commentary on the factors influencing the FY20 outlook.

Year to date, all the currencies across the 20 markets in which the group operates on the continent
have weakened relative to the USD. The South African Rand (ZAR), Zambian Kwacha and
Zimbabwean Dollar have weakened the most. In contrast, the countries in the group’s East Africa
Region have held up relatively well. While the ZAR is expected to strengthen by year end, it is likely to
be weaker on average relative to the USD and the Africa Regions currencies year on year. This will
support the earnings contribution from Africa Regions. Inflation has remained relatively subdued
despite currency weakness. There have been policy interest rate cuts in all but three markets, with
South Africa seeing the largest cumulative decline to date at 275 bps. In 2020, the economies in 12 of
our 20 Africa countries are expected to contract; South Africa, Botswana and Namibia are expected to
see the biggest declines. Our current expectation for South Africa is an 8.5% decline in real GDP in
2020, followed by a 6.5% recovery in 2021. The East Africa Region economies (Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda) are currently expected to avoid a contraction.

Loan growth in the first 4 months of 2020 (4M20) was robust. The combination of higher digital
disbursements, corporate facility drawdowns and a weaker ZAR led to strong double-digit growth
period on period. CIB grew faster than PBB. In PBB, unsecured lending grew faster than secured
lending. Loan growth is expected to slow from current levels. Low business and consumer confidence
levels are expected to continue to be a constraint on secured portfolio growth. While instalment relief
is likely to temporarily support portfolio levels, this is likely to be offset by lower new business
disbursements. Unsecured lending growth will be subject to individual affordability and business and
sector viability over the medium term. Deposit growth was also strong period on period, in particular
demand deposits, as corporates drew down on facilities to access liquidity and placed it back on
deposit. Deposit growth is also expected to slow.

Balance sheet growth will partially offset a meaningful decrease in net interest margin on the back of
higher funding costs and negative endowment following the significant policy interest rate cuts seen to
date. In South Africa, a 25 bps movement equates to an annualised R300 million net interest income
impact. The group’s current assumption is that there will be no further policy rate cuts in South Africa
in 2020. Non-interest income growth, while supported by trading income in 4M20, will depend on the
pace and magnitude of the recovery in 2H20. Containing operating expense growth remains a focus.
Where possible, cost levers will be pulled, but not at the expense of the resilience of our systems or
our ongoing digital customer journeys.

Credit impairment charges have the greatest potential for variability and will depend on the depth of
the recession and pace of the recovery. In the modelling of expected credit losses, IFRS 9 requires
the consideration of the current portfolio performance, comprising individual counterparty and portfolio
performance, and a forward-looking view. In determining the latter, one is required to apply judgement
and make a number of forward-looking assumptions. We note the guidance and clarification provided
by the Prudential Authority in Guidance Note 3/2020 and Guidance Note 6/2020 in this regard. Our
current scenario analysis indicates that the group’s credit loss ratio for FY20 will be above the group’s
through-the-cycle range of 70 bps to 100 bps and may exceed the peak recorded in the Global
Financial Crisis of 160 bps.

The group ceased accruing earnings from its 20% stake in ICBC Argentina post the decision to sell its
stake in August 2019. ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) incurred a significant single client loss in
FY19 which should not repeat in FY20. ICBCS’ ability to break even remains subject to better
integration with ICBC’s client base.

With regards to Liberty Holdings Limited’s (Liberty) performance, please refer to Liberty’s voluntary
operational update announcement released on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) on 14
May 2020 and the trading statement released on SENS on 29 May 2020.

On capital, funding and liquidity, the group supports the actions taken by the South African Reserve
Bank. As at 31 March 2020, the group’s common equity tier one ratio was 12.9% and liquidity
coverage ratio was 141.9%. As at 30 April 2020, the group remained well capitalised and
liquid. Based on our scenario analysis, the group’s capital ratios are expected to remain strong and
above required minimums. In line with the Prudential Authority’s guidance on dividends, the group is
not planning to declare an FY20 interim ordinary dividend.

If the pandemic-related impacts are deeper or more sustained than currently expected, or government
actions are not effective, the group’s results could vary meaningfully. The group is reviewing the
group’s medium-term financial targets and will provide an update as and when able to do so.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that Standard Bank’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower
than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (1H19 HEPS: 837.4 cents, 1H19 EPS:
827.0 cents). We will issue a further trading statement with more specific guidance ranges once there
is reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline relative to the comparable period.

Standard Bank’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be released on the
SENS on 20 August 2020.

The complexity and uncertainty surrounding the crisis has been stressful for our employees and we
thank them for their ongoing commitment. In a dynamic and broad crisis such as this, the depth of
skills and experience across the group has proven invaluable. In addition, the group is confident it has
the governance and risk management structures in place to ensure the appropriate and timely flow of
information required to support agile and effective decision-making. A large proportion of the group’s
employees across the continent, and in our international offices, continue to work productively from
home. This would not have been possible without our strategic partnerships and the systems
investments the group has made in recent years. Our digital customer channels have also proven
resilient.

While our immediate priorities remain employee, customer and community safety and support, we
also recognise the need to lift our heads and plan for the recovery phase and the opportunities a “new
normal” may bring. With our operational business continuity plans now well embedded, our focus is
increasingly moving towards growing the sustainable strength of our client franchise.

Authority has reduced Pillar 2A buffer requirements with effect from 6 April 2020. This will reduce the minimum capital requirement
to 10.5% from that date (approximately R7.3 billion reduction in total minimum regulatory capital requirements based on March
2020 results). There is currently no requirement for the countercyclical buffer add-on in South Africa or in other jurisdictions in
which the SBSA has significant exposures.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) on both a Standard Bank Group consolidated
as well as SBSA Solo entity level. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel
III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 30-calendar day liquidity profile,
by ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment.

Net Stable Funding Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 8/2017 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) on both a Standard Bank Group
consolidated as well as SBSA Solo entity level. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3
of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The objective of the Basel III Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is to promote funding stability
and resilience in the banking sector by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in
relation to the composition of assets and off-balance sheet activities.

1 The movement in the FCTR was primarily as a result of the depreciation of the Rand against the USD, GBP and
 certain African currencies.
2 Primarily   comprises the ordinary dividends declared in March 2020.
Update on the group’s operational performance for the three months ended 31 March 2020


In the three months to 31 March 2020 (“1Q20”), the operating environment in South Africa deteriorated and
consumer and business confidence declined further. In Africa Regions, lower oil prices threatened oil exporters
and declines in global demand, in particular from China, negatively impacted export-reliant economies. The
Covid-19 crisis escalated quickly in March 2020. By 31 March 2020, global asset values had declined materially,
emerging markets had seen large risk-off outflows and there were partial or full lockdowns across almost all of
the markets in which we operate.

The group quickly and successfully instituted its business continuity management plans, with a focus on ensuring
the safety of our employees and the continued service to our clients. These are now well embedded, and the
focus has turned to supporting those clients who are experiencing financial strain in these difficult times.
Accordingly, we support actions taken by the South African Reserve Bank, and others, to mitigate the economic
impact, reduce stress in the system and release capital to facilitate support to individuals and businesses.

Turning to the group’s banking performance in 1Q20. Net interest income growth was slow as fairly robust year-
on-year loan growth was offset by negative endowment and margin pressure. Non-interest revenue growth was
supported by an increase in trading revenue. In South Africa, sales activity and ATM, card and branch volumes
declined in late March as lockdowns and other restrictions were implemented. Operating expenses were well
managed and jaws were positive. Credit impairment charges for the period were significantly higher than in the
prior year. The increase was driven by deterioration in both the portfolio performance and the forward-looking
assumptions used in the modelling of expected credit losses.

IFRS 9 requires the group to consider forward-looking information in the calculation of expected credit losses.
Accordingly, the group has estimated an increase in economic stress caused by the crisis and, where
appropriate, incorporated that in the calculation of the group’s expected credit losses. It is worth noting that, by 31
March 2020, the Covid-19 related stress on individuals and businesses had, to a large extent, not emerged yet
and the provisions raised were based on our best estimate at the time.

Liberty Holdings Limited’s (“Liberty”) performance for the period was impacted by market movements, in
particular the Shareholder Investment Portfolio. Please refer to Liberty’s SENS announcement dated 21 April
2020. 1Q19 headline earnings included earnings from the group’s 20% stake in ICBC Argentina (“ICBCA”). The
group ceased equity accounting ICBCA earnings in September 2019 post the decision to sell the stake. The
group recorded a small loss associated with its 40% stake in ICBC Standard Bank PLC.

In 1Q20 earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders were 27% lower than in the comparative period. During
the period the headline earnings adjustable items were not material.

The group remains well capitalised and liquid. The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 31 March 2020 will be
released in May 2020.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

Ratings Announcement

Amendment to Standard Bank Group (“SBG”) and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited
(“SBSA”) credit ratings by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Ratings Agency (“Moody’s”)

Noteholders are hereby advised of the amendment by Fitch and Moody’s to SBG’s and SBSA’s credit
ratings effective on 31 March 2020.

Fitch:

    •    Fitch has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Ratings (VRs)
         of SBSA to ‘BB’ and ‘bb’, respectively. The Outlook on the IDRs is Negative.
    •    Fitch has taken similar rating actions on the Long-Term IDRs and VRs of SBG.
    •    National Long-Term Ratings and debt ratings (where applicable) have also been downgraded
         from AA (zaf) to AA-(zaf).
    •    The Outlook on the National Long-Term Ratings is revised to Negative from Stable.
    •    Fitch has increased the notching for Tier 2 issues of SBG to two notches from one from the
         respective VR and National Rating anchor ratings.
    •    Fitch has also widened the notching between the IDR and the long-term debt rating assigned
         to SBG’s and SBSA’s USD4 billion EMTN Programme to one from zero to reflect (under the
         new criteria) below-average recovery prospects because of thin Qualifying Junior Debt buffers.

The rating action by Fitch is driven by the expected negative impact from the coronavirus outbreak on
the bank's operating environment and key financial metrics, notwithstanding uncertainty as to the full
economic and financial market implications.

For commentary on the detailed ratings action taken on SBG and SBSA, together with the other South
African Banks, please refer to the Fitch press release on the below website:
https://www.fitchratings.com

Moody’s:

    •    SBSA's long-term foreign-currency and local-currency issuer ratings to Ba1 from Baa3. The
         outlook remains negative.
    •    SBG's long-term foreign-currency and local-currency issuer ratings to Ba2 from Ba1. The
         outlook remains negative.

The primary driver for Moody’s rating actions is the increasingly difficult operating environment for banks
in South Africa as reflected by the agency’s decision to lower South Africa's Macro Profile score from
'Moderate' to 'Moderate-' in addition to the weakening credit profile of the South African government
given banks' high sovereign exposure, mainly in the form of government debt securities held as part of
their prudential liquidity requirements, which links their credit profiles to that of the government.
A detailed commentary on the ratings action taken on SBG and SBSA, together with the other South
African      Banks      may        be        accesses      on     the       below       website:

Standard Bank announces COVID-19 financial relief measures for its small enterprise and
student customers in South Africa

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disruption it is expected to cause, The Standard Bank of
South Africa Limited (“SBSA” or the “bank”) has announced interim debt repayment relief measures to
help its small enterprise and student customers in South Africa manage their financial commitments.
These actions have been proactively deployed, consistent with measures implemented by financial
institutions in a number of other countries, to provide some relief to our customer base in anticipation
of the economic and cash flow constraints that are expected to arise due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Small enterprises

All SBSA small enterprise customers with turnover of less than R20 million, who have a business loan
with the bank and are in good standing with the bank at 31 March 2020, will automatically receive a
payment holiday from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Interest and fees will still accrue over the three
month period and will be capitalised to the loan. The terms of repayment will be automatically
extended to maintain the affordability of the facility once the payment holiday period expires.

This measure will not only assist our small business clients with managing their cash flows, but also
allow them to honour payments to their own employee base.

Students

All SBSA student customers still studying full time, who have a Standard Bank Student Loan and are
in good standing with the bank at 31 March 2020, will automatically receive a payment holiday from 1
April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Interest will be charged at 0% and fees will be zero for the three month
period. The terms of repayment will be automatically extended to maintain the affordability of the
facility once the payment holiday period expires.

As at 20 March 2020, SBSA’s qualifying, performing small enterprise portfolio equated to
approximately R12bn and student portfolio equated to approximately R1.5bn.

While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, it is difficult to estimate the likely negative impact
that it will have on Standard Bank’s financial performance. The group will continue to assess these
impacts and will provide appropriate disclosures when sufficient certainty exists.

The group remains well capitalised and liquid.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s
auditors.

STANDARD BANK GROUP RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT
for the year ended 31 December 2019

2019 results overview
""Standard Bank Group's results for the 2019 financial year are underpinned by the growth and resilience of
its core operations.""
- Sim Tshabalala, Group chief executive

Standard Bank Group's results for the 2019 financial year (FY19) are underpinned by the growth and resilience 
of its core operations. The constrained macroeconomic environment, particularly in South Africa, and ICBCS 
losses impacted the group's results.

The group's banking operations reported headline earnings up 5% on the prior year (FY18) to R27.2 billion
and a return on equity (ROE) of 18.1%. This result was driven by quality top line growth and continued positive
operating leverage. While Liberty contributed positively to group earnings growth, the group's other banking
interests were a drag. Group headline earnings were R28.2 billion, an increase of 1% on FY18, and ROE was
16.8%. The group's capital position remained strong, with a common equity tier 1 capital adequacy (CET1) ratio 
of 14.0%. A final dividend of 540 cents per share has been declared. Total dividends for the year were 2% higher
than the prior year.

Good balance sheet growth underpinned net interest income while non-interest revenue was supported by growth
in transaction volumes and trading revenues. Credit impairment charges increased of a low base in FY18. A
strong focus on cost containment continued throughout the year resulting in below inflation cost growth and
positive jaws of 113 basis points (bps).

Operating environment
In 2019, the US-China trade dispute, increase in geopolitical risks and weaker domestic demand across
multiple economies dampened global economic growth. Weaker demand suppressed inflation across local and
international markets which prompted central banks to reduce policy rates or adopt growth-supportive monetary 
policy stances.

Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth forecasts were revised downwards consecutively. Headwinds on the
external front, alongside the slow pace of reforms, severe weather-related shocks, as well as an increase in
security and political tensions in parts of the region, weighed on economic activity.

In South Africa, load-shedding undermined growth prospects, the pace of policy progress and reform was slow,
and Eskom's fiscal concerns remained unresolved. Business and consumer confidence levels remained low,
constraining spending and demand for credit. The economy shrank 1.4% in 4Q19 which resulted in a second recession 
in less than two years. Real GDP growth for the year was 0.2%.

Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings grew 6% to R16.5 billion, underpinned by continued balance sheet and customer
franchise growth. Net interest income increased 6% to R44.1 billion, supported by balance sheet growth. A 
favourable change in product mix and higher average rates in South Africa supported an increase in margin. This 
was largely offset by lower average interest rate across the Africa Regions portfolio and the impact of IFRS 16. 
This resulted in a net interest margin of 601 bps, 3 bps higher than in FY18. In South Africa, our customers 
continued to migrate to our digital platforms, in particular the SBG mobile app. SBG mobile app active users 
increased 55% to 2.0 million and the value of transactions executed via our mobile banking platform increased 
46% to R382 billion.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB 's headline earnings grew 5%, 7% in constant currency change (CCY), to R11.8 billion. The operating
environment remained challenging and market conditions, volatile and fluid. Against this difficult backdrop, 
CIB continued to deliver the innovative, bespoke solutions our clients need and have come to expect. As a business
with on-the-ground operations across 20 countries in Africa, and operations in five financial hubs outside of
Africa, it remains uniquely positioned to connect global multinational companies to the African markets and
African businesses to international markets. Strong growth in both average assets and liabilities in
Transactional Products and Services (TPS) and double-digit average asset growth in Investment Banking (IB) 
supported revenues. Underlying client revenues grew 7% driven by the Financial Institutions, Mining & Metals, 
Power & Infrastructure and Telecoms, Media & Technology sectors.

Other banking interests
Despite the tough operating conditions in Argentina, ICBC Argentina (ICBCA) continued its strong performance
in FY19. In August 2019, the group exercised its option to sell its 20% stake in ICBCA to ICBC. Headline
earnings from the group's 20% stake amounted to R583 million.

ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) recorded a disappointing set of results in FY19. The loss of USD248 million
consisted of a single client loss of USD198 million, USD30 million related to restructuring costs and USD20
million of operating losses related to the business operations. The latter was driven by lower revenues on fixed
income and currency trading due to subdued market sentiment. The group's 40% share of the losses equated to
R1.4 billion. ICBC and the group, as shareholders, have had robust conversations and made meaningful progress
with ICBCS management with regards to how best to put the business on a path to sustainable profitability. These
discussions resulted in a number of management actions in ICBCS, including significant headcount reductions
and a reduction by ICBCS of business lines and locations in FY19. Closer integration into and cooperation with
the ICBC group is an important element of the plan to achieve sustainable profit.

Liberty
Liberty is making progress towards re-building a competitive and sustainable business. While the focus on
new business volumes continues, normalised operating earnings improved 10% year on year. In FY19, the
Shareholder Investment Portfolio benefitted from improved investment market returns, particularly in respect of 
foreign and local equities. Liberty headline earnings grew 23% to R3.3 billion. The group's share of earnings 
amounted to R1.9 billion, up 16% on the prior year.

Prospects
Global economic growth is expected to remain slow and downside risks persist. These risks include, amongst
others, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, a rise in geopolitical and social unrest, and further
weather-related disasters. In contrast, subdued inflation and accommodative monetary policy should support 
financial conditions and, in turn, emerging market flows. Continued strong growth in East Africa and an ongoing 
moderate recovery in West Africa should favour sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth prospects. Conditions are 
expected to remain difficult in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. While the impact of COVID-19 on global growth remains
unknown, it is clear that a China slowdown and a disruption of Sino-Africa trade will negatively impact the 
trade balances of sub-Saharan African commodity exporters and be inflationary for importers.

In South Africa, while there were some positive governance and growth-related developments in 2019, there 
is still much more to be done. The constraints to growth and productivity are structural and the reforms
required are well understood. In the absence of tangible progress, we foresee sustained economic weakness, 
driven by insufficient electricity supply and low confidence.

The macro-economic outlook in the countries in which we operate is uncertain and the operating environment
is expected to remain challenging. Trading conditions are expected to remain difficult, regulatory-imposed
constraints and technological change are set to stay, and competition will continue to intensify. Our top priority
in 2020 is to increase our competitiveness by improving client experience through the seamless delivery of
relevant and personalised financial solutions to our clients in a secure manner via their channel of choice. We
will also continue to exercise tight cost discipline and seek to allocate resources efficiently and in support
of our strategy to build a future-ready Standard Bank Group. 

We are a purpose driven organisation: Africa's our home, we drive her growth. We recognise that the role we
play, as the gate-keeper and facilitator of financial flows into and across Africa, is much bigger than
profits alone. Our long-term sustainability is inextricably linked to the social and economic upliftment of the
people and societies in the countries in which we operate. Accordingly, we will continue to contribute positively
to Africa's social, economic and environmental development.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax
implications for both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore
encouraged to consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject
to dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and
preference shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 
20% of the cash dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will
receive a net amount of 432 cents per ordinary share, 2.60 cents per first preference share and 311.296 cents per
second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at
a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax
Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 619 709 548 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

1 The   movement in the FCTR was mainly due to the introduction of the RTGS dollar in Zimbabwe.
2 Primarily comprises the ordinary dividends declared in March and August 2019 and transactions with
 non-controlling shareholders.

Update on the group's performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2019

For the nine months to 30 September 2019, net interest income grew faster than non-interest revenue. Net
interest income was supported by higher average loan and deposit balances relative to the nine months to
30 September 2018. Income growth remained above operating expense growth resulting in positive jaws. Credit
impairment charges increased period on period on the back of loan book growth and charges in East Africa and
South Africa.

Banking activities headline earnings growth continues to outpace the group's headline earnings growth.

The major business lines of ICBC Standard Bank Plc ( ICBCS') continue to be negatively impacted by
deteriorating market conditions and lower than anticipated client flows. These factors have impacted the
business' ability to deliver appropriate returns on a standalone basis. The group has accordingly reviewed and
impaired the value of its 40% associate investment in ICBCS from USD383 million to USD220 million as at 30
September 2019. The impairment of R2.4 billion has been recognised in earnings attributable to ordinary
shareholders. As at 30 September 2019 ICBCS had sufficient capital to meet its regulatory requirements.
Standard Bank Group is engaging with ICBC and ICBCS to determine the best way forward for the business.

In the nine months to 30 September 2019, headline adjustable items, other than the ICBCS impairment, were not
significant. Adjusting for the ICBCS impairment, earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders were 2% higher
than recorded in the nine months to 30 September 2018.

The group's Basel III disclosure as at 30 September 2019 will be released in November 2019.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE EXERCISE OF THE PUT OPTION GRANTED TO THE
GROUP BY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA LIMITED OVER THE GROUP'S
RESIDUAL 20% SHAREHOLDING IN INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA
(ARGENTINA) S.A. AND ITS AFFILIATES (""THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION"")

1. Background and salient terms

  In November 2012, the group completed the disposal of a controlling
  interest in each of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
  (Argentina) S.A. (previously Standard Bank Argentina S.A.), ICBC
  Investments Argentina S.A. Sociedad Gerente de Fondos Comunes de
  Inversión (previously Standard Investments S.A. Sociedad Gerente de
  Fondos Comunes de Inversión) and Inversora Diagonal S.A. (collectively
  ""ICBCA"") to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited
  (""ICBC""). The group retained a 20% shareholding in ICBCA, held by
  Standard Bank Group's wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Bank London
  Holdings Limited.

  In the ICBCA shareholders' agreement, ICBC granted a put option to
  the group under which the group was given the right to sell all of
  its remaining shareholding in ICBCA to ICBC, by giving notice at any
  time between 1 December 2014 and 30 November 2019. The strike price
  of the put option is fixed at USD180.751 million (approximately
  R2.7 billion based on the exchange rate as at 6 August 2019).

  In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (""the JSE"")
  (""the Listings Requirements""), ICBC is considered a related party in
  relation to Standard Bank Group.

2. Background on ICBCA

  ICBCA is a leading universal banking operation in Argentina, offering
  a comprehensive range of banking and other financial services to its
  customers. ICBCA is highly profitable and well capitalised.

3. Rationale

  After the group's 2011 strategy refocus on the African continent, the
  group divested of control of ICBCA to ICBC in a transaction announced
  on 5 August 2011.

  ICBCA has performed strongly since the change of control from a
  financial perspective. However, Argentina remains off strategy for
  the group as a geography and there is little overlap in the client
  bases of Standard Bank Group and ICBCA.

  With the transition of control of ICBCA to ICBC an unqualified
  success, Standard Bank Group considers that an exit from its
  investment in ICBCA to realise capital for reinvestment into its
  African strategy is appropriate.

4. Other salient financial information

  Based on the unaudited financial information for the six months ended
  30 June 2019, prepared under IFRS:

  As at 30 June 2019, the group carried its associate shareholding in
  ICBCA at a net asset value (""NAV"") of R1 579 million with the
  investment contributing R432 million in profits attributable to the
  group reported as headline and IFRS earnings for the six-month period
  ended 30 June 2019.

  For indicative purposes, at 30 June 2019, the accumulated debit
  balance in relation to ICBCA to the group's Foreign Currency
  Translation Reserve (""FCTR"") was R2.9 billion.

  Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction, the group would be
  required to release the FCTR balance to earnings outside of headline
  earnings. This movement between reserves will not impact the NAV of
  the group.

  The difference between the disposal price of the investment in ICBCA,
  after applicable taxes, and the group's carrying value in ICBCA would
  be recognized as a gain outside of headline earnings.  Based on
  30 June 2019 IFRS values, this gain would be approximately
  R600 million.

5. Independent fairness opinion

  In terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements, the Proposed
  Transaction is categorised as a small related party transaction.

  Accordingly, the board of directors of Standard Bank Group (""Board"")
  is required to provide the JSE with written confirmation from an
  independent professional expert confirming that the terms of the
  Proposed Transaction are fair insofar as shareholders of Standard
  Bank Group (""Shareholders"") are concerned.

  In compliance with paragraph 10.7(b) of the Listings Requirements,
  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Johannesburg Branch (""J.P. Morgan"") was
  appointed by the Board as the independent professional expert and has
  furnished an opinion to the Board confirming that the terms of the
  Proposed Transaction are fair insofar as the Shareholders are
  concerned.

  The opinion of J.P. Morgan will lie for inspection at Standard Bank
  Group's   registered   office,  9th floor,   5   Simmonds   Street,
  Johannesburg, for a period of 28 days from the release of this
  announcement.

6. Exercise of the put   option, conditions   precedent   and timing   of
   completion

  The Board has resolved to exercise the put option and to authorise
  SBLH to give the requisite notice to ICBC.

  The Proposed Transaction is subject to conditions precedent customary
  to transactions of this nature, including regulatory approvals in
  China and Argentina.

  The completion date in respect of the Proposed Transaction is
  anticipated to be in the last quarter of 2019 or first half of 2020.

  The net proceeds of the Proposed Transaction will be received at the
  date of completion. The group would seek to reinvest such proceeds to
  support its African strategy.

1H19 results overview
""We strive to meet our clients' needs by seamlessly delivering holistic, relevant financial services
offerings through the channels of their choice.""
- Sim Tshabalala, Group chief executive

Standard Bank Group's African-focused strategy has delivered continued headline earnings growth, driven by
the strong underlying momentum in our core operations. For the period ended 30 June 2019 headline earnings 
were R13.4 billion, an increase of 6% on the prior period (1H18), and return on equity (ROE) was 16.2%. 
The group's capital position remained strong, with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 14.0%, which supported 
an interim dividend of 454 cents per share, an increase of 6% on the prior period.

Banking activities recorded strong growth in headline earnings, increasing 10% to R12.8 billion. ROE was
17.5% in line with the prior corresponding period. Strong balance sheet growth period on period supported net
interest income. Pressure on fees and continued customer migration to digital channels dampened non-interest
revenue  growth. Credit impairment charges increased from a low base in 1H18. Stringent cost management 
resulted in positive operating leverage, by growing revenue by 1.1% faster than cost.

After adjusting for currency impacts, in particular the weaker South African Rand, group headline earnings
grew 5% on a constant currency basis. On the back of continued strong earnings growth, Africa Regions' (AR)
contribution to banking headline earnings grew to 34% from 32% in 1H18. The top six contributors to AR's 
headline earnings were Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax
implications for both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore
encouraged to consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject
to dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and
preference shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 
20% of the cash dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will
receive a net amount of 363.20 cents per ordinary share, 2.60 cents per first preference share and 313.104 cents 
per second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at
a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax
Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 619 235 231 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) on both a SBG group consolidated as well as
SBSA Solo entity level. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity
accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 30 calendar day liquidity profile,
by ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment.

Net Stable Funding Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 8/2017 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) on both a SBG group consolidated as well

liquidity accord.

The objective of the Basel III Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is to promote funding stability
and resilience in the banking sector by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in
relation to the composition of assets and off-balance sheet activities.

Update on the group's performance for the three months to 31 March 2019

In the three months to 31 March 2019 (1Q19), the South African banking business performance continued to be
impacted by the difficult domestic operating environment. In contrast, the Africa Regions businesses, outside of
South Africa, recorded strong growth. Net interest income growth was supported by year-on-year loan growth.
Non-interest revenue growth was supported by an increase in trading revenue. Operating expenses were
elevated due to costs related to the branch closures. Credit impairment charges were higher than in the prior year
primarily due to the non-repeat of prior year releases in Africa Regions.

In 1Q19, earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders were 8% higher than in the comparative period. During
the period the headline earnings adjustable items were negligible. The group's Basel III disclosure as at 31 March
2019 will be released in May 2019.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

Standard Bank Group
Provisional results and dividend announcement for the year ended 31 December 2018

The Standard Bank Group Limited's (the group) condensed consolidated financial statements, for the year ended 
31 December 2018 (results) are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings 
Requirements for provisional reports, the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board, the South African Institute of 
Chartered Accountants' (SAICA) Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and 
Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the presentation requirements 
of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) (excluding paragraph 16 A(j) as permitted by the JSE Listings 
Requirements) and the requirements of the South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008 applicable to condensed 
financial statements. 

The group's results are prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost basis as
modified by the fair value accounting of certain assets and liabilities where required or permitted by IFRS. This report 
is presented in South African rand, which is the presentation currency of the group. All amounts are stated in millions 
of rand (Rm), unless indicated otherwise. 

While this report in itself is not audited, the consolidated annual financial statements from which the results below
have been derived were audited by KPMG Inc. and PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. 
That audit report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this report. 

Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditors'
engagement and, more specifically, the nature of the information that has been audited, they should obtain a copy of the
auditors' report together with the accompanying audited consolidated annual financial statements, both of which are available
for inspection at the company's registered office. The group's reporting suite, including the Standard Bank Group's
annual integrated report and annual financial statements will be made available during April 2019. Copies can be requested
from our registered office or downloaded from the company's website following the announcement in April 2019 on the
JSE's Stock Exchange News Service (SENS). 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements from which the
results have been derived are in terms of IFRS, including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which is effective for
the group from 1 January 2018. These accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the group's previous consolidated annual financial statements with the exception of changes referred 
to due to IFRS 9. 

The group has, as permitted by IFRS 9, elected not to restate its comparative financial statements. Therefore
comparability will not be achieved by the fact that the comparative financial information has been prepared on an IAS 39
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) basis. The group did, however, align certain disclosures within
these results to provide comparable data. The impact of adopting IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively with an adjustment
to the group's opening 1 January 2018 reserves. The application of IAS 39 for the group's 2017 financial year was
unaffected by the application of IFRS 9. Refer to below and the group's IFRS 9 transition report (transition report),
available at www.standardbank.com/reporting, for more details on IFRS 9.

The board of directors (the board) of the group take full responsibility for the preparation of this report. 
The preparation of the group's results was supervised by the group financial director, Arno Daehnke BSc, MSc, 
PhD, MBA, AMP.

The results were made publicly available on 7 March 2019.

This report contains pro forma financial information. Refer below for further detail. 

Investors are referred to www.standardbank.com/reporting where a detailed analysis of the group's financial results,
including an income statement and a statement of financial position for The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (SBSA),
can be found.

Shareholders are reminded that should they wish to make use of the group's electronic communication notification
system to receive all shareholder entitled communication electronically as opposed to delivery through physical mail and have
not already done so, this option can still be elected by advising the group's transfer secretaries at the following
email address ecomms@computershare.co.za or fax to +27 11 688 5248 or contact the call centre on +27 861 100 933. Other
related queries can be sent to electroniccommunication@standardbank.co.za.

Overview of financial results 
Group results
For the year ended 31 December 2018 (2018), Standard Bank Group delivered sustainable earnings growth and improved
returns. The group's performance was underpinned by the strength and breadth of our client franchise. Group headline
earnings grew 6% to R27.9 billion and ROE improved to 18.0% from 17.1% for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2017). 
The group's capital position remained robust, with a common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.5%. Accordingly, a final 
dividend of 540 cents per share has been declared, resulting in a total dividend of 970 cents per share, an increase 
of 7% on the prior year. 

Banking activities headline earnings grew 7% to R25.8 billion and ROE improved to 18.8% from 18.0% in 2017.
Non-interest revenue (NIR) continued to record strong growth, driven by retail banking. Net interest income (NII) 
growth was dampened, and credit impairment charges were lower, as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard. 

The 2018 group results were less impacted by currency movements than in prior years. On a constant currency basis,
group headline earnings grew 8%. Africa Regions' contribution to banking headline earnings grew to 31% from 28% 
in 2017. The top five contributors to Africa Regions' headline earnings were Angola, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria 
and Uganda.

Operating environment
Global economic growth plateaued at 3.7% as geopolitical tensions rose and risk sentiment deteriorated. Growth
trajectories de-coupled as fiscal stimulus in the US supported continued growth, whilst other advanced economies, 
in particular the Euro area, started to slow. Emerging market capital inflows reversed, which negatively impacted 
exchange rates and borrowing costs. 

Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa was 2.9%. In 1H18 inflation continued to ease, providing scope for interest 
rate cuts. By 2H18, heightened global risks resulted in a pause in monetary policy easing. Across our basket of 
currencies, exchange rates were relatively stable, other than in Angola where the Angolan Kwanza (AOA) devalued 
approximately 50% relative to the South African Rand (ZAR). 

The economic recovery in the West Africa region was supported by buoyant growth in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana and a
recovery in Nigeria. In Angola, as the impacts of the currency devaluation in early 2018 moderated, inflation stabilised. 

Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda all recorded real growth in excess of 5% in 2018. Private sector credit growth in Kenya
remained below pre-rate cap levels. Uganda enjoyed robust growth in domestic demand, public infrastructure investment,
agricultural productivity and a recovery in Foreign Direct Investment.

The countries neighbouring South Africa (SA) continued to feel the drag of SA's poor economic environment, in particular 
Lesotho, Namibia and eSwatini. In Mozambique, despite the declining rates cycle, the operating environment remained 
difficult and lending activity remained subdued. Zimbabwe's challenges escalated in 3Q18, including acute currency 
shortages and inflationary pressures which drove weakened business confidence.

Growth in the SA economy was weaker than expected at 0.7%. The poor macro environment, slow policy progress and higher
taxes weighed on consumer and business confidence and, in turn, demand for credit. A 25 basis point (bps) interest rate
cut in March, on the back of broadly favourable conditions, was later reversed in November as the US fiscal tightening,
oil price and exchange rate outlook were considered a threat to the South African Reserve Bank's inflation targeting.
The ZAR was relatively strong against the major currencies in 1H18, but this reversed in 2H18.

IFRS 9-related accounting impact
Following the transition to IFRS 9, Standard Bank Group is required to suspend interest earlier which resulted in a
R553 million reduction in NII and credit impairment charges in Personal & Business Banking South Africa (PBB SA). In
addition, following a clarification from the IFRS Interpretations Committee in December 2018, the group is required to
recognise previously unrecognised interest earned on loans which cured out of Stage 3 (otherwise referred to as released
interest in suspense (IIS) on cured assets) as a reduction in credit impairment charges. Prior to 2018, IIS on cured assets
was accounted for as interest income. The reclassification amounted to R1 169 million in 2018, of which R1 064 million
related to PBB and R105 million related to Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB). The commentary below includes reference
to the impact of these changes on net interest income, total income and credit impairment charges, as well as some of 
the group's key ratios, namely net interest margin, credit loss ratio, cost-to-income ratio and jaws. There was no 
impact on 2018 headline earnings.

The adjusted figures and ratios are collectively referred to as ""Non-IFRS Financial Information"" and

Revenue
Group revenue grew 3% and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited's (SBSA) revenue was flat. Adjusting for the IFRS
9-related accounting impact, group revenue grew 4% and SBSA, 2%. Africa Regions grew revenue 6%, 12% on a constant
currency basis, reflective of the better economic environment and the underlying momentum in the franchise. 

NII decreased 1% as margins declined 16 bps to 458 bps and average interest-earning assets grew 2.5% year on year.
IFRS 9-related accounting impact accounted for 13 bps of the 16 bps decline. The impact of competitive pricing and demand
for higher yielding deposit products in SA and negative endowment in Africa Regions was largely offset by strong growth
in current and savings accounts (CASA) and a mix benefit as unsecured lending grew faster than asset-backed lending. 

Non-interest revenue grew 7% supported by broad-based growth across all three underlying categories, namely net fee
and commission revenue up 6%, trading revenue up 4% and other revenue up 11%.

In line with our customers' increasing preference for convenient digital channels over traditional channels,
electronic banking fee revenue increased 11% whilst revenue from account transaction fees increased at a slower rate 
of 2%. In SA, the business saw strong digital volume growth across Instant Money, the SBG mobile app and value-added 
services as well as card-based transactions. Digital adoption also continued to gain traction in Africa Regions, in 
particular, in Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Knowledge-based fees grew 3%, following CIB's participation in several 
landmark transactions, coupled with increased client activity in the Energy and Infrastructure sectors. 

Equities provided an uplift in trading revenue, whilst the fixed income and currencies desks struggled against a high
base in 2017. Other revenue was boosted by better bancassurance-related earnings and CIB's portion of ICBC Standard Bank
Plc's (ICBCS) aluminium recovery which equated to R151 million. In line with IFRS 9, interest income on certain debt
instruments is now recorded in other gains and losses on financial instruments. 

Credit impairment charges
Credit impairment charges were R6.5 billion, 31% lower than the prior year, and the group credit loss ratio declined
to 56 bps (2017: 87 bps). Adjusting for the IFRS 9-related accounting impact, the group credit loss ratio would have 
been 71 bps. 

After adjusting for the IFRS 9-related accounting impact, PBB SA's credit loss ratio decreased year on year, largely
driven by higher post write-off recoveries, operational enhancements in customer credit ratings and continued
improvements in collection processes. PBB Africa Regions also reflected improvements driven by improved risk 
performance, enhanced collection strategies and a lower provisioning requirement on highly collateralised 
non-performing loans.

CIB's impairment charges declined 35% on the prior year and the credit loss ratio to customers declined to 20 bps
(2017: 44 bps). Stage 3 credit impairment charges increased in SA, reflective of the difficult macro environment, 
but decreased in Africa Regions, driven by a recovery of a prior year impairment in Nigeria and improved credit 
risk management. CIB remains cautious on the outlook for the construction sector in SA and the consumer sectors 
in East Africa and SA. 

Operating expenses
Operating expenses growth of 5% should be considered relative to inflation in the underlying markets in which we
operate, as well as the level of investment required to support our businesses' growth. In 2018 we closed our core 
banking replacement programme, delivered a variety of digital enhancements and completed various regulatory, risk 
and compliance improvements. The group cost-to-income ratio for the year was 57% and after adjusting for 
IFRS 9-related accounting impact to revenue, it was 56%. SBSA costs grew 3%, down from 7% in 1H18.

Staff costs were up 7% driven by a combination of annual salary increases, separation costs relating to the IT
restructure and key hires. Net headcount declined ~900 people on the back of a combination of natural attrition, 
digital efficiencies and management actions. 

Ongoing prudent discretionary spend is reflected in other operating expenses growth of 4%. Tight control of IT
expenses, in particular in 2H18, resulted in year-on-year growth of 5%. The increase in professional fees is 
attributable to specific projects related to customer experience in PBB and CIB as well as regulatory changes.

Loans and advances 
Gross loans and advances to customers grew 10% year on year, of which PBB's advances to customers grew 7% and CIB's,
13%. In line with underlying macros and strategy, Africa Regions recorded strong year-on-year loan portfolio growth of
31%. In SA, PBB disbursements grew across most products with particularly strong growth recorded by vehicle and asset
finance (VAF) and personal unsecured lending. 

Within PBB, the mortgage lending portfolio grew 4% driven by consistent quarter-on-quarter increases in disbursements,
an increase in home loan registration values and a marginal slow-down in prepayments. The VAF lending portfolio grew
10%, driven by growth in SA, as the franchise turnaround started to gain traction. Personal unsecured lending and 
business lending both grew 14%. PBB Africa Regions loans to customers grew 22%.

Within CIB, Investment Banking (IB) grew 8%. IB originated over R167 billion of loans in the year across the Oil & Gas, 
Industrials, Consumer, Mining and Power & Infrastructure sectors, up from approximately R130 billion in the prior
year. This is reflective of CIB's broad client franchise and ongoing commitment to partnering their clients in their
investment and expansion on the continent. The Africa Regions IB portfolio grew 28%, whilst South Africa IB grew a 
respectable 7% in a very slow environment. ZAR weakness in December 2018 inflated year-end balances. Corporate 
overdrafts and trade finance facilities, reflected under Transactional products and services, grew 52% year on 
year but 15% on average. CIB funding provided to corporates through commercial paper issuances, qualifying as 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), is reflected as financial investments on the balance sheet. Underlying growth 
in CIB gross loans and advances to customers, including HQLA, was 15%. Loans to banks declined as liquidity 
raised in 2H17 was repaid.

Funding and liquidity
The group's liquidity position remained strong and within approved risk appetite and tolerance limits. The group's
fourth quarter average Basel III liquidity coverage ratio amounted to 117%, exceeding the minimum phased-in regulatory
requirement of 90%. The group maintained its net stable funding ratio in excess of the 100% regulatory requirement.

During 2018 the group raised R28.3 billion of longer term funding through a combination of negotiable certificates of
deposit, senior debt and syndicated loans and R5.0 billion of Basel III compliant Tier II capital. The group will
continue to monitor opportunities to issue senior unsecured and/or Tier II subordinated debt in the domestic and/or
international markets, in order to optimise the group's capital and funding position.

Deposits from customers grew R88.6 billion, equivalent to 8%, year on year, supported by 10% growth in PBB retail-priced
deposits. Africa Regions recorded CASA inflows in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Growth in customers drove 
increased deposits held in our offshore operations in the Isle of Man and Jersey.

CIB's deposits and current accounts from customers grew 5% on the back of strong growth in call and current accounts,
growing 19% and 20% respectively. The increase in deposits was driven by new clients in South Africa and across our
Africa Regions franchise as well as increases in deposits from existing clients. 

Capital management
The group maintained strong capital adequacy ratios, with a CET1 ratio of 13.5% (2017: 13.5%) and a total capital
adequacy ratio of 16.0% (2017: 16.0%). The group manages its capital levels to support business growth, maintain 
depositor and creditor confidence and create value for shareholders whilst ensuring regulatory compliance. 

IFRS 9 became effective on 1 January 2018. The fully-loaded day one impact of implementing IFRS 9 was a 70 bps
reduction in the group's CET1 ratio. After adjusting for the three year phase-in provision, the impact was reduced 
from 70 bps to 18 bps.

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings grew 10% to R15.5 billion, underpinned by customer and balance sheet growth, higher
transaction volumes and lower credit impairment charges. The impact of negative endowment, due to lower average 
rates in Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and SA, was offset by the benefit of stronger growth in higher margin lending 
products, combined with deposit growth outstripping loan growth. PBB jaws were negative 265 bps, however after 
adjusting for the IFRS 9-related accounting impact, jaws reduced to negative 26 bps. ROE improved to 21.9% from 
20.0% in 2017. 

Against a difficult macro and increasingly competitive environment, PBB SA delivered headline earnings of R13.7 billion, 
up 3%. Underlying revenue benefited from higher disbursements and better cross-sell following the embedding of all
banking products into the frontline. PBB SA NII declined 1% and credit impairment charges were 28% lower, leading to a
lower credit loss ratio of 83 bps (2017: 119 bps). After adjusting for IFRS 9-related accounting impact, the NII growth 
was 4%, credit impairment charges were 3% lower and the credit loss ratio was 112 bps. The favourable performance is
attributed to improved collection strategies, higher post write-off recoveries and operational credit rating enhancements.
This is partially offset by growth in stage 3 in mortgage loans, VAF and business lending given a protracted legal
environment and business strain resulting from economic conditions.  

Operating expenses were 6% higher as the franchise continued to invest in embedding the new operating model, improving
the customer experience, staff re-skilling and upskilling and digitisation initiatives. The benefits of these
investments are reflected in improving customer and employee NPS scores, a decline in the number of complaints and 
an acceleration in disbursements over the year. 

Our customers continued to migrate to our digital platforms apace, in particular, the SBG mobile app. Digital
transaction volumes increased 26%, whilst face-to-face volumes declined 13%. SBG mobile app users increased 30% to 
1.3 million, mobile transaction values increased, 44% to 262 billion and transaction volumes increased, 50% to 
958 million (over 2.5 million a day). Instant Money, our money transfer platform, also continued to gain traction; 
unique users increased 10% to 1.7 million. Our customers' preference for digital channels is unequivocal. In order 
to deliver the always-on, always-secure offering they expect, we have to leverage the strategic IT assets we have, 
accelerate our product development and rollout and digitise our execution processes. This will require a reallocation 
of resources from our physical to our digital channels and a concomitant reconfiguration of our branch infrastructure.

PBB Africa Regions headline earnings grew more than threefold from R183 million in 2017 to R817 million in 2018.

The businesses in Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia grew market shares in both assets and deposits. Loans to
customers increased 22% and deposits from customers grew 21%. The group's market leading digital solutions assisted in
driving customer growth. The number of active customers grew 11%. Transaction volumes increased 27% driven by digital
transaction volumes which increased 34%, whilst branch transactions declined 12%. A growing customer base, combined 
with strong take up of mobile banking, resulted in a 90% increase in mobile banking transaction volumes year on year 
(2018: 52 million transactions).

Despite negative endowment, as rates fell in Malawi, Mozambique and Nigeria, net interest income grew 5% on the back
of strong balance sheet growth, in particular CASA, and margin expansion. Non-interest revenue grew 13%, underpinned by
an increase in the account base, higher transaction volumes, strong trade finance flows and growth in fees from our
pension fund business in Nigeria. PBB Africa Regions contributed almost half of the Africa Regions legal entities' total
income. The credit loss ratio decreased to 138 bps from 247 bps in the prior year, reflective of improved book quality 
and improved collections as well as non-repeat of higher prior year charges in Nigeria and Malawi. Operating expenses 
grew 5%, delivering positive jaws of 336 bps and a decline in the cost-to-income ratio to 79% (2017: 82%).

Wealth International grew headline earnings 60% supported by growth in client deposit balances to GBP5.1 billion, 
increased client activity and endowment benefit.  

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB's headline earnings of R11.2 billion were down 2% on the prior year, and up 1% on a constant currency basis.
Revenue from strong operational client activity in Africa Regions was offset by lower trading and capital markets related
revenue linked to subdued market conditions. Declining interest rates in Africa Regions and competitive pricing in SA
negatively impacted margins. Disciplined cost management constrained cost growth to 5% but was not sufficient to avoid 
negative jaws of 414 bps. Recognising the need to improve efficiency levels, CIB has initiated structural changes to 
change the cost base going forward. The credit loss ratio to customers declined to 20 bps due to a combination of 
improved performance and recoveries. Sovereign and financial institution ratings downgrades in early 2018 resulted 
in a higher capital demand, which negatively impacted return on risk weighted assets and ROE (2018: 19.3%). 

CIB continued to grow and diversify its client base driving year-on-year client revenue growth of 8%. Client segments
underpinning growth were multinationals and large domestic corporates and key sectors included Financial Institutions,
Industrials and Power & Infrastructure. Africa Regions' performance was underpinned by strong revenue growth in Angola,
Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 

Investment banking's performance was underpinned by strong balance sheet growth, including corporate debt issuances
and foreign currency loans to SA and African multinationals. Average loans increased 9% and margins were flat. Energy 
and Infrastructure transactions supported NIR. Credit impairment charges were lower year on year due to better portfolio
performance and a recovery from a previously impaired exposure in Nigeria.

Transactional products and services continued to grow its Africa Regions client base and deposit base. Declining rates
impacted NII whilst increases in trade and transaction activity supported NIR. 

Global markets' revenue was adversely impacted by negative emerging market sentiment and lower flows. CIB's
on-the-ground presence and deep local knowledge enables it to identify opportunities and trade even in dislocated markets.

Central and other
This segment includes costs associated with corporate functions, as well as the group's treasury and capital
requirements, and central hedging activities. In 2018, the segment recorded a loss of R878 million, 28% less than the 
prior year. The primary driver of the higher loss in 2017 was the elimination, in terms of IFRS, of gains on SBK shares 
held by the group to facilitate client trading activities, which did not recur in 2018.

Other banking interests
Other banking interests recorded headline earnings of R418 million. ICBCS recorded growth in its underlying franchise
revenue and a recovery of US$38 million relating to the aluminium previously written off. This was unfortunately offset
by the trading business performance which was negatively impacted by declining global emerging market risk appetite and
reduced flows, resulting in ICBCS recording a loss of US$14.9 million for the year. The group's 40% share thereof
equated to R74 million. ICBCS's ability to deliver sustainable profits is dependent on its ability to continue to 
integrate into, and leverage, ICBC's extensive client base. ICBCS did not require additional capital in 2018 on the 
back of lower than expected RWA growth. ICBCS's business plan indicates the need for a capital injection of 
approximately US$200 million in the next 12 to 18 months, subject to RWA growth. The group's share thereof would 
be US$80 million.

ICBC Argentina delivered a strong performance despite the dislocation experienced in the domestic market. The headline
earnings contribution from the group's 20% stake in ICBC Argentina increased 19% to R492 million. Adjusting for the
significant devaluation of the Argentinian peso, earnings were up 95% on a constant currency basis year on year. 

During 2019, we will continue to work with our strategic partners at ICBC to develop a lasting solution for these
businesses. 

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group's 56% investment in Liberty, adjusted for SBK
shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders which are deemed to be treasury shares in the group's
consolidated accounts.

Liberty's operating earnings were up 42% on the prior year, driven by strong performances in Individual Arrangements
and STANLIB. As is to be expected, given the negative trend in asset prices during the year, Liberty's shareholder
investment portfolio was impacted by volatile market conditions resulting in lower market returns. We will continue 
to support Liberty as it executes its remedial and recovery plan and by continuing to deepen the collaboration between 
our businesses. Liberty's IFRS headline earnings, after the adjustments for the impact of the BEE preference share 
income and the Liberty Two Degrees listed Real Estate Investment Trust accounting mismatch, declined to R2.6 billion 
from R3.3 billion in the prior year. Investors are referred to the full Liberty announcement dated 28 February 2019 
for further detail.

Headline earnings attributable to the Standard Bank Group, adjusted by R129 million for the impact of deemed treasury
shares, were R1.6 billion, 11% higher than in the prior year.

Prospects
Global growth is expected to weaken slightly in 2019 to 3.5% as the slowdown in momentum seen in 2H18 continues into
2019. With risks to the downside, economic conditions will remain challenging and volatile in 2019. Subdued demand will
impact global trade, industrial production and could drive commodity and oil prices lower. 

Whilst not immune from global risks, prospects for sub-Saharan Africa overall are good with growth expected to
accelerate from 2.9% in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019. Over a third of the countries in the region are expected to grow above 5%. 

With elections set for May 2019, South Africa is expected to be a tale of two halves. Subdued growth is anticipated 
in 1H19 as political and policy uncertainty continues to undermine confidence and delay investment and growth. An
acceleration in 2H19 and into 2020, driven by corporate investment, whilst expected, will be dependent on the rate of policy
progress, structural reform, broader economic stimulus and job creation. A return of stable electricity supply is critical.
Assuming some progress and no further downgrades by rating agencies, we expect inflation to remain within the target
range and interest rates to remain at current levels in 2019. This should support an uptick in growth to 1.3% for the
year.

There is no doubt that in the years ahead the financial services industry, the competitive and regulatory environment
and our customers' and employees' expectations will continue to change. Across the group, we are making the changes
necessary to best position the franchise to deliver to all our stakeholders. We are focused on transforming our customer 
and employee experience and improving our productivity to deliver a ""future-ready"" group. In 2019, we will build on the
franchise momentum from 2018, continue to simplify, rationalise and digitise and seek ways to accelerate our delivery. 

We remain committed to our medium-term targets of delivering sustainable earnings growth and an ROE in our 18%-20%
target range. Finally, in delivering on our purpose of driving Africa's growth, we will continue to support faster, 
more inclusive and more sustainable growth and human development in South Africa and across the continent we are proud 
to call home.

Stakeholders should note that any forward-looking information in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported
on by the group's external auditors.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to
dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference shareholders
that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20% of the cash dividend, and this
amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 432 cents per
ordinary share, 2.6 cents per first preference share and 312.176 cents per second preference share. Non-resident ordinary 
and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of
residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 514 218 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

1 The group has, as permitted by IFRS 9, elected not to restate its comparative financial statements. 
  Therefore comparability will not be achieved by the fact that the comparative financial information 
  has been prepared on an IAS 39 basis. The group has, however, aligned its categories for loans and 
  advances disclosed in 2017 to those disclosed for 2018. This did not result in a restatement to the 
  group's statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017.

1 The group recognised losses in respect of certain commodity reverse repurchase agreements with third parties prior

  net of costs, relating to claims for those recognised losses prior to the date of conclusion of the transaction. 
  Settlement of these amounts will occur based on audited information on pre-agreed anniversaries of the completion 
  of the transaction and the full and final settlement of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 
  31 December 2018, a balance of USD 24 million (R345 million) is receivable from ICBC in respect of this arrangement

Other reportable items 
Additional Tier 1 capital
The group did not issue Basel III compliant AT1 capital bonds that qualify as Tier 1 capital during the period 
(2017: R3.5 billion nominal value). During the period, coupons to the value of R447 million (2017: R229 million)
were paid to AT1 capital bond holders. Current tax of R125 million (2017: R64 million) relating to the AT1 capital 
bonds was recognised directly in equity resulting in an aggregate net equity impact of R322 million 
(2017: R165 million). The AT1 capital bonds have been recognised within other equity instruments in the statement 
of financial position.

Capital management
The group manages its capital levels to support business, growth, maintain depositor and creditors' confidence, create
value for its shareholders and ensure regulatory compliance. The main regulatory requirements to be complied with are
those specified in the Banks Act No.94 of 1990 and related regulations, which are aligned with Basel III. Regulatory
capital adequacy is measured through the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital adequacy.

The group has elected the three year phase-in as outlined in the SARB's Directive 5/2017. This phase-in results in the
IFRS 9 impact being amortised on a straight-line basis, from 25% in 2018 to reach 100% by 2021. The group's capital
adequacy ratios based on a phased-in and fully loaded basis are shown in the table below:

Equity securities
During the period, the group allotted 1 729 572 shares (2017: 2 877 827 shares) in terms of the group's share
incentive schemes and repurchased 2 483 523 shares (2017: 2 030 824 shares).

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the period was 25 310 447 shares (2017: 16 213 766
shares). These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured entities (SEs) relating to the
group's Tutuwa initiative (refer to the related party balances and transactions note for more detail) since those SEs 
hold the voting rights on such shares and are accordingly not treasury shares as defined by the JSE Listings 
Requirements.

Legal proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other proceedings. 
Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. Nevertheless,
based on management's knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting with legal counsel, management believes
that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being 'likely to succeed and material' or
'unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. The group is also the defendant in some legal cases for which
the group is fully indemnified by external third parties, none of which are individually material. Management is
accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings currently pending against the group should not have a material adverse 
effect on the group's consolidated financial position and the directors are satisfied that the group has adequate 
insurance programmes and, where required in terms of IFRS for claims that are probable, provisions in place to meet 
claims that may succeed.
 
Competition Commission - trading of foreign currency 
On 15 February 2017 South Africa's Competition Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal against
18 institutions, including one against The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (""SBSA"") and two against a former
subsidiary of the Standard Bank Group, Standard New York Securities Inc (""SNYS""), in which it alleges unlawful collusion
between those institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. Standard Bank Group has, with the help of external counsel, conducted
its own internal investigations and found no evidence that supports the complaints. Both SBSA and SNYS have, together
with 12 of the other respondents, applied for dismissal of the complaint referral on various legal grounds. These
applications were heard in July 2018 and judgement has been reserved. The allegations against SBSA are confined to USD/ZAR
trading activities within SBSA and do not relate to the conduct of the group more broadly.

Indemnities granted following disposal of SB Plc 
Under the terms of the disposal of SB Plc on 1 February 2015, the group provided ICBC with certain indemnities to be
paid in cash to ICBC or, at ICBC's direction, to any SB Plc (now ICBCS) group company, a sum equal to the amount of
losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising from certain circumstances. Where an indemnity payment is required to be 
made by the group to the ICBCS group, such payment would be grossed up from ICBC's shareholding at the time in ICBCS
to 100%. These payments may, inter alia, arise as a result of an enforcement action, the cause of which occurred prior 
to the date of disposal. Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or governmental authorities to enforce 
the relevant laws in any jurisdiction. While there have been no material claims relating to these indemnification 
provisions, the indemnities provided are uncapped and of unlimited duration as they reflect that the pre-completion 
regulatory risks attaching to the disposed-of business remain with the group post completion. Any claims that may arise 
for SNYS with respect to the Competition Commission matter are likely to fall within the scope of this indemnity as the 
alleged conduct, which is the subject of the referral, is alleged to have taken place prior to the disposal of SB Plc. 

Subordinated debt
During the period, the group issued R5.0 billion (2017: Rnil) Basel lll compliant bonds that qualified as Tier 2 capital.
The capital notes are perpetual, non-cumulative with an issuer call option after a minimum period of five years and one 
day, and on every coupon payment date thereafter. The payment dates are quarterly with the first call date being 
13 February 2023.

R3.5 billion (2017: R3.0 billion) Basel III compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were redeemed during the
year. 

R0.1 billion (2017: R0.3 billion) of Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were issued during the
year and R0.1 billion (2017: R0.2 billion) was redeemed in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Basel III
framework.
 
The terms of the Basel III compliant Tier 2 capital bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the
write-off, in whole or in part, on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (the SARB) that a write-off without
which the issuer would have become non-viable is necessary, or a decision to make a public sector injection of capital or
equivalent support, without which the issuer would have become non-viable.
 
During the period, the group issued subordinated debt that qualifies as regulatory insurance capital R1.0 billion
(2017: R2.0 billion) and R1.0 billion (2017: R1.0 billion) was redeemed.

Transactions with non-controlling interests primarily comprise of:

Stanbic Africa Holdings Limited
During the period, Stanbic Africa Holdings Limited (SAHL), a wholly owned subsidiary of SBG, increased its shareholdings 
in its listed Nigerian and Kenyan subsidiaries through acquisitions of additional shares from non-controlling interests 
(NCI). Increases in the group's interest in a subsidiary, when the group already has control, are accounted for as
transactions with equity holders of the group. The difference between the purchase consideration and the group's
proportionate share of the subsidiary's additional net asset value acquired is accounted for directly in equity.

Nigeria
In Nigeria, SAHL's shareholding in Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC (SIBTC) increased by 12% from 53% to 65% through an
announced off market trade on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and further on market share purchases for a total cash
consideration of R2 567 million. 

The group recognised a net decrease in NCI of R950 million and a decrease in retained earnings and equity attributable
to owners of the group of R1 617 million because of changes in the group's ownership interest in SIBTC.

Kenya
In Kenya, SAHL's shareholding in Stanbic Holdings Plc (SH Plc) increased by 9% from 60% to 69% following a two-stage
tender offer and further on market share purchases for a total cash consideration of R485 million. 

The group recognised a decrease in NCI of R514 million and an increase in retained earnings and equity attributable to
owners of the group of R29 million because of changes in the group's ownership interest in SH Plc.

Liberty Group Limited
During the period, Liberty Group Limited's (Liberty) shareholding in Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) decreased by 4% from 
63% to 59% for a total consideration of R301 million. Liberty recognised an increase in NCI of R249 million and an 
increase in retained earnings and equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of R52 million because of changes in 
Liberty's ownership interest in L2D.

Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe functional currency
In 2009, Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe (SBZ) concluded that the United States Dollar (USD) was its functional currency in terms of
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (IAS 21). However, an acute shortage of USD in Zimbabwe resulted 
in an increase in electronic balances through the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) as well as the issuance of bond 
notes which were exchangeable for USD at an official rate of 1:1. In October 2018, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) 
instructed banks to separate bank accounts into FCA Nostro (USD balances) and FCA RTGS (RTGS balances). This created clarity 
that within Zimbabwe both USD and RTGS were legal tender and that these different currencies were not interchangeable, even 
though the official exchange rate was 1:1. As a result, SBZ concluded that its functional currency changed from USD to RTGS 
on 1 October 2018 because the majority of SBZ's transactions were conducted in RTGS. SBZ was prohibited from trading at any 
exchange rate other than the official rate and all exchange transactions undertaken by SBZ in 2018 occurred at the official 
rate of 1:1. The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee discussed the determination of an exchange rate 
when there is a long-term lack of exchangeability and concluded that the closing rate at which items should be translated is 
the rate to which an entity would have access at the end of the reporting period through a legal exchange mechanism. The only 
legal exchange mechanism that SBZ had access to in the financial period since the change in functional currency was the 
official exchange mechanism. This led to SBZ concluding that the appropriate exchange rate to use at the date of the change 
in functional currency and subsequent to the change in functional currency up until the end of the current reporting period 
is the official rate of 1:1.

Post-balance sheet event
During February 2019, RBZ announced that RTGS dollars will replace USD as the new base currency of the country. 
A new foreign interbank market was also established and this interbank market will complement the existing official
foreign exchange mechanism with the RBZ. The establishment of this interbank market has created an additional legal 
exchange mechanism whereby the bank is able to trade RTGS dollars. Whilst the RBZ has not yet indicated which exchange 
mechanism can be utilised for dividend repatriation, the 2.5 RTGS:USD exchange rate which has emerged from this interbank 
exchange market at the end of February 2019 can be utilised to estimate the financial impact. The group has estimated a 
decrease of R746 million on the foreign currency translation reserve, relating to this development by applying the 
2.5 RTGS:USD exchange rate to the 31 December 2018 SBZ balance sheet position.

IFRS 16 Leases
This standard will replace the IAS 17 Leases as well as the related interpretations and sets out the principles for
the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, being the lessee
(customer) and the lessor (supplier). The core principle of this standard is that the lessee and lessor should recognise 
all rights and obligations arising from leasing arrangements on balance sheet. The most significant change pertaining to 
the accounting treatment for operating leases is from the lessees' perspective. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of
leases as either operating or finance leases as required by IAS 17 and introduces a single lessee accounting model,
where a right of use (ROU) asset together with a liability for the future payments is to be recognised for all leases with
a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. The group has elected to apply IFRS 16
retrospectively without restating comparative periods, which will continue to be presented in terms of IAS 17, with a
transition adjustment as at 1 January 2019. The single lessee accounting model, which comprises IFRS 16's most material 
impact for the group, is expected to result in an increase of approximately R5 billion in total assets, 
R4.73 billion in total liabilities and an increase in reserves of approximately R250 million. 

Accounting policy elections
Adoption of new and amended standards effective for the current financial period 
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except for the adoption of the
following standards and amendments effective for the current period:
- IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (amendment) (IFRS 4), the amendment to applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4
  introduced two approaches: an overlay approach and a deferral approach. The amended standard will provide all companies
  that issue insurance contracts the option to recognise in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the
  volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard is issued; and provide
  companies whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9
  until 2021. The entities that defer the application of IFRS 9 will continue to apply the existing financial instruments
  standard IAS 39. The amendments to IFRS 4 supplement existing options in the standard that can already be used to address
  the temporary volatility. The group did not apply the optional temporary exemption of applying IFRS 9 until 2021.
- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), with effect from 1 January 2018, replaces the existing
  revenue standards and the related interpretations. The standard sets out the requirements for recognising revenue that
  applies to all contracts with customers (except for contracts that are within the scope of the standards on leases, insurance
  contracts or financial instruments). The core principle of the standard is that revenue recognised reflects the
  consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services to the
  customer. The standard incorporates a five step analysis to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. The
  group adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 and, as permitted by IFRS 15, did not restate its comparative financial results.
  The standard does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, and therefore does not impact the majority
  of the group's revenue. 
- IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration provides guidance on how to determine the date of
  the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset,
  expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the
  payment or receipt of advance consideration in a foreign currency. 
  
The above mentioned standards and interpretation to the IFRS standards, adopted on 1 January 2018, did not effect the
group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and did not impact the group's results upon transition or
the group's accounting policies.

- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2018, replaced IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduced new requirements
  which included an ECL impairment model and new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets,
  refer below for more detail.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
Background
With effect from 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduced new requirements which included an ECL
impairment model and new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets as follows: 

ECL impairment         IFRS 9's ECL impairment model's requirements represented the most material IFRS 9 transition impact
requirements           for the group.

                       The ECL model applies to financial assets measured at either amortised cost or at fair value through
                       comprehensive income (FVOCI), loan commitments when there is a present commitment to extend credit
                       (unless these are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)) and financial guarantees.

                       ECL is, at a minimum, required to be measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to the lower of
                       12-month or full lifetime ECL (where the lifetime is less than 12 months) of the financial asset. A loss 
                       allowance for full lifetime ECL is required for a financial asset if the credit risk of that financial 
                       instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. 
  
Classification and     IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on the basis of the entity's business 
measurement            model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.

                       The accounting for financial assets differs in various other areas to existing requirements such as embedded
                       derivatives and the recognition of fair value adjustments in OCI.

                       All changes in the fair value of financial liabilities that are designated at FVTPL due to changes in own 
                       credit risk are required to be recognised within OCI.

Adoption of IFRS 9
The group retrospectively adopted IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 with an adjustment to the group's opening 1 January 2018
reserves and, as permitted by IFRS 9, did not restate its comparative financial results. Accordingly, the group's
previously reported financial results up to 31 December 2017 are presented in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 
and for 2018, and future reporting periods, are presented in terms of IFRS 9. However, the group has elected to continue 
to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The group prepared a IFRS 9 transition report on which a reasonable
assurance audit opinion, included in the report, was provided by the group's external auditors that outlined the impact of
the transition to IFRS 9. For further information, regarding the transition impact, refer to the transition report,
available at www.standardbank.com/reporting.

IFRS 9's ECL requirements 
The most material IFRS 9 transition impact for the group is that of IFRS 9's new ECL requirements which results in the
earlier recognition of credit impairment provisions primarily as a result of the drivers outlined in the table below.
This impact was solely as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 and is not as a result of changes in the credit quality of
the group's loan exposures.

12-month ECL for          IFRS 9 contains a minimum 12-month ECL for exposures for which there has not been a significant increase 
performing loans          in credit risk (SICR), whereas IAS 39 required credit impairments to be recognised only following the    
(stage 1)                 identification of objective evidence of impairment.

Significant increase in   A lifetime ECL is recognised for all exposures for which there has been a SICR, being a material change  
credit risk (SICR)        in the probability of default, since origination.
(stage 2)

Off-balance sheet         IFRS 9's scope includes off-balance sheet exposures, such as unutilised loan commitments, guarantees and
exposures                 letters of credit.

Lifetime model work       In terms of determining ECL for stage 1 and 2 exposures where there is a probability of default, the        
out requirement           potential loss from a lifetime perspective is considered, which would include the probability of     
                          recovery post default and subsequent re-default.

                          For stage 3 exposures, being exposures that are either in default or where default is imminent, this
                          would include consideration of cures and subsequent re-default.

Forward looking           IFRS 9 requires an adjustment for forward looking economic expectations in the determination of SICR
economic expectations     and in the measurement of the ECL.

1 The change in the retained earnings relates to IFRS 9's classification and measurement and ECL changes 
  and the reversal of the statutory credit risk reserve (SCRR) as explained further below.
2 In addition to the R6 637 million impact on the group's reserves, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, 
  a debit of R948 million to the group's SCRR and a corresponding credit to the group's retained earnings 
  has been recognised. The SCRR has historically been maintained by means of an appropriation of retained 
  earnings to a non-distributable reserve, being the SCRR, by the group's operations in the Africa Regions 
  as a result of country regulators requiring a higher credit impairment provision than that as determined 
  in accordance with IAS 39. Given that IFRS 9 typically results in an impairment provision that is 
  equivalent to or greater than that as required by the Africa Regions' regulators, a transfer from the 
  SCRR back to retained earnings is required on transition to IFRS 9. The transfer has only been reflected 
  with respect to those countries whose regulators that, at the date of this transition report, had approved 
  such releases. This transfer has no impact on the group's net asset value, total reserves or capital ratios.
3 Of the R593 million in the group's available-for-sale reserve as at 31 December 2017, R582 million has 
  been reclassified on the adoption of IFRS 9 to the FVOCI category and R11 million relates to gains and 
  losses on instruments that were classified as available-for-sale and are now classified as either FVTPL 
  or at amortised cost.                                                                           
4 The change relates to the non-controlling interests' share of the IFRS 9 impact post tax relating to 
  IFRS 9's classification and measurement and ECL changes.

IFRS 9 accounting policies
Interest in suspense
In addition to the above identified changes between IAS 39 and IFRS 9, interest in suspense (refers to contractual
interest which accrues on financial assets which are classified as non-performing) is presented as follows:

IAS 39 accounting treatment
Up to 31 December 2017, IAS 18 Revenue required interest income to be recognised only when it was probable that the
economic benefits associated with a transaction would flow to the entity. The group, in line with these requirements,
suspended the recognition of contractual interest income on all exposures where it was determined that future economic
benefits were not probable. The accounting presentation policy for this suspended contractual interest was to present 
the balance sheet interest in suspense account as part of the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (i.e. gross 
carrying amount net of interest in suspense). In addition, upon the curing of the non-performing financial asset, the 
group elected an accounting presentation policy to recognise this suspended contractual interest (previously unrecognised
interest) within the net the interest income line within the income statement. This policy was elected on the basis that 
the presentation best represented the nature of the amount in terms of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1).

IFRS 9 accounting treatment
IFRS 9 requires that interest income for financial assets classified as Stage 3 be calculated on the net carrying
amount (after deducting credit impairments), which will result in a portion of contractual interest being suspended. 
IFRS 9 requires that this suspended contractual interest be presented as part of the financial assets' gross carrying 
amount. The group has applied this requirement by presenting balance sheet suspended contractual interest together 
within credit impairment. Hence suspended contractual interest does not impact the net carrying amount of the financial 
asset as presented on the statement of financial position. However, this change in presentation has resulted in an 
increased gross carrying amount of financial asset and increased credit impairments when compared to IAS 39. 

The group has presented previously unrecognised interest earned on curing of a financial asset out of Stage 3 within
credit impairment. This presentation is consistent with the IFRIC clarification issued in December 2018.

Restatements

Change in accounting policy
Expenses incurred with respect to the group's customer loyalty programme (UCount) have historically been recorded as
part of operating expenses in the income statement. During the year, the group amended its accounting policy for these
expenses to rather be presented as part of net fee and commission revenue (within non-interest revenue). This policy
aligns with the group's policy for other expenses that are presented within net fee and commission revenue. The impact 
of the change in the accounting policy on the group's financial results is as follows:

                                                                             2017

Restatement of statement of cash flows
During 2018 a comprehensive review of the group's long-term insurance business model was undertaken due 
to various regulatory changes including the new regulatory capital regime effective 1 July 2018 and the 
enterprise risk management framework. The above review supported a change in key judgement relating to 
the appropriateness of all cash flows relating to investment portfolios backing policyholder liabilities 
and supporting regulatory and group risk adjusted minimum capital levels. Management are of the opinion 
that these should be reflected as cash flows from operating activities rather than as previously reflected 
as cash flows from investing activities. This provides more relevant information as it more accurately

Other information

Pro forma financial and constant currency information
The pro forma financial information and pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results 
is the responsibility of the group's directors. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information 
may not be a fair reflection of the group's results of operation. The pro forma financial information and 
pro forma constant currency information contained in this announcement have been reviewed by the group's 
external auditors and their unmodified limited assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE 3420 is available 
for inspection at the company's registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00. 

IFRS 9-related accounting impact
In compliance with IFRS 9, the group is required to suspend interest earlier which resulted in a R553 million
reduction in net interest income and credit impairment charges. In addition, following a clarification from the 
IFRS Interpretations Committee in December 2018, the group is required to recognise previously unrecognised 
interest earned on loans which cured out of Stage 3 (otherwise referred to as released IIS on cured assets) as 
a reduction in credit impairment charges. Prior to 2018, IIS on cured assets was accounted for as interest income. 
The reclassification from interest income to credit impairment charges amounted to R1 169 million in 2018. The table 
below shows the impact of these changes on net interest income, total income and credit impairment charges as well 
as some of the group's key ratios, namely credit loss ratio, cost-to-income ratio and jaws. The adjusted figures and 
ratios are collectively referred to as ""Non-IFRS Financial Information"" and is pro forma financial information for 
purposes of the JSE Listings Requirements. There was no impact on 2018 headline earnings. The directors are 
responsible for compiling the Non-IFRS Financial Information on the basis of the applicable criteria specified in 
the JSE Listings Requirements, including JSE Guidance Letter: Presentation of pro forma financial information dated 
4 March 2010.

Pro forma constant currency financial information
The pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results is the responsibility of the group's directors.
The pro forma constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on
the group's results and may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes in equity, results of operations
or cash flows. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the comparative financial year's results for the
year ended 31 December 2017 have been adjusted for the difference between the current and prior period's average exchange
rates (determined as the average of the daily exchange rates). The measurement has been performed for each of the
group's material currencies. 

The following average exchange rates were used in the determination of the pro forma constant currency information 
and were calculated using the average of the average monthly exchange rates (determined on the last day of each of 
the 12 months in the period).

Liquidity coverage ratio disclosure
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the group and SBSA Solo entity on a
quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 30 calendar day liquidity profile,
by ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment. The minimum regulatory requirement for 2018 is 90%
and will increase by a further 10% on 1 January 2019 to reach the full 100% requirement.

Update on the group’s performance for the nine months to 30 September 2018

For the nine months to 30 September 2018, the South African banking business performance reflected the
difficult domestic operating environment. In contrast, the Africa Regions businesses outside of South Africa
recorded strong growth. Net interest income, although supported by slightly stronger asset growth in the three
months to 30 September 2018, grew slower than non-interest revenue. Operating expense growth remained
above income growth resulting in negative jaws. Credit impairment charges continued to be well managed, with a
strong performance in Africa Regions partially offset by additional charges in South Africa.

In the nine months to 30 September 2018, banking activities headline earnings grew slightly faster than group
earnings and headline adjustable items were not significant. Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders were
4% higher than recorded in the nine months to 30 September 2017.

The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 30 September 2018 will be released in November 2018.

With the exception of the reasonable assurance report issued by the group’s external auditors on the IFRS 9
transition adjustment, the information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational
performance update is based has not been reviewed nor reported on by the group's external auditors.

Central Bank of Nigeria investigation regarding client remittances by Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC relating
to MTN Nigeria Communications Limited and Cautionary Announcement


Standard Bank Group has been advised by its Nigerian banking subsidiary, Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC
(“Stanbic IBTC Bank” or “the Bank”), that the Bank received a letter on 29 August 2018 from the
Central Bank of Nigeria (“CBN”) informing it that penalties have been imposed on Stanbic IBTC Bank
by the CBN pursuant to a review of transactions relating to the remittance of foreign exchange on
the basis of certain “irregular” Certificates of Capital Importation (“CCI’s”) issued to MTN Nigeria
Communications Limited, between 2007 and 2015.

Stanbic IBTC Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group’s 64.8% owned Nigerian Stock Exchange
listed subsidiary, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC.

The CBN has advised Stanbic IBTC Bank in this letter that it will be subject to a penalty of
NGN 1.885 billion (approximately ZAR 75 million / USD 5.2 million) for violations of the laws and
regulations of Nigeria pertaining to foreign exchange transactions in that country.

The CBN has further advised the Bank in this letter that it requires that a sum of approximately
USD 2.632 billion, being funds repatriated by Stanbic IBTC Bank on clients’ behalf, should be
refunded to the CBN, on the grounds that the relevant CCI’s were “illegally issued”. Stanbic IBTC
Bank was not a beneficiary of any of the remittances made on behalf of clients and denies any
imputation of malfeasance.

The Bank intends to engage with the CBN in relation to the issues it has raised.

Clients of the Bank are assured that the above does not impact on their ability to continue to
conduct their various business and corporate transactions with Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC or any of
its subsidiaries, including the Bank.

The final impact of this regulatory intervention is accordingly being determined but may have a
material effect on the price of the Group’s securities. Accordingly, shareholders of Standard Bank
Group are advised to exercise caution when dealing in their securities, until further details regarding
this regulatory intervention are able to be announced.

Unaudited condensed consolidated interim results and dividend announcement 
for the six months ended 30 June 2018


The Standard Bank Group Limited's (the group) condensed consolidated interim results, including the statement of
financial position, income statement, statement of other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and 
statement of cash flows, for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (results) are prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements, the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board, the South African Institute of 
Chartered Accountants' (SAICA) Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial 
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the presentation requirements of IAS 34 Interim 
Financial Reporting (IAS 34) (excluding paragraph 16 A(j) as permitted by the JSE Listing Requirements) and the 
requirements of the South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008 applicable to condensed financial statements. 

The group's results are prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost basis as
modified by the fair value accounting of certain assets and liabilities where required or permitted by IFRS. This report 
is presented in South African rand, which is the presentation currency of the group. All amounts are stated in millions 
of rand (Rm), unless indicated otherwise. 1H18 refers to the first half year results for 2018. 1H17 refers to the first
half year results for 2017. FY17 refers to the full year results for 2017. Change % reflects 1H18 change on 1H17. All
amounts relate to the group's results, unless otherwise specified.

The 1H18 results, including comparatives for 1H17, where applicable, have not been audited or independently reviewed
by the group's external auditors. The group's FY17 financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying
audited consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, unless otherwise specified. Refer
to the restatements section for restatements to financial information disclosed for 1H17 and FY17 as applicable. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim results are in
terms of IFRS, including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which is effective for the group from 1 January 2018.
These accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the group's previous
consolidated annual financial statements with the exception of changes referred to in the accounting policy elections
section. 

The group has, as permitted by IFRS 9, elected not to restate its comparative financial statements. Therefore 
comparability will not be achieved by the fact that the comparative financial information has been prepared on an 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) basis. The group did however align certain
disclosures within these results to provide comparable data. The impact of adopting IFRS 9 has been applied 
retrospectively with an adjustment to the group's opening 1 January 2018 reserves. The application of IAS 39 for the 
group's 2017 financial year was unaffected by the application of IFRS 9. Refer to the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
section and the group's IFRS 9 transition report (transition report), available at www.standardbank.com/reporting, 
for more details on IFRS 9.

The board of directors (the board) of the group take full responsibility for the preparation of this report. 
The preparation of the group's results was supervised by the group financial director, Arno Daehnke BSc, MSc, 
PhD, MBA, AMP.

The results were made publicly available on 16 August 2018.

This report contains pro forma constant currency financial information. Refer to the pro forma constant currency
financial information section for further detail. 

In terms of the JSE's Listings Requirements, the group no longer posts a physical copy of this announcement to its
shareholders. Investors are referred to www.standardbank.com/reporting where a detailed analysis of the group's 
financial results, including an income statement and a statement of financial position for The Standard Bank of 
South Africa Limited (SBSA), can be found. 

Shareholders are reminded that should they wish to make use of the group's electronic communication notification
system to receive all shareholder entitled communication electronically as opposed to delivery through physical mail 
and have not already done so, this option can still be elected by advising the group's transfer secretaries at the

Overview of financial results 
Group results
For the period ended 30 June 2018 (1H18) group delivered headline earnings of R12.7 billion, up 5% on the prior period
(1H17), and return on equity improved to 16.8% from 16.1% in 1H17. The group's capital position remained strong, with a
common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.8%. Accordingly, an interim dividend of 430 cents per share has been declared,
an increase of 8% on the prior period. 

Banking activities headline earnings grew 6% to R11.7 billion driven by strong growth in non-interest revenue (NIR)
and lower credit impairment charges, in Africa Regions in particular. Banking activities ROE improved to 17.5% from 
16.8% in 1H17. 

The stronger South African Rand, on average, adversely impacted the group's reported results. On a constant currency
basis, group headline earnings increased by 8% boosted by Africa Regions which grew earnings by 32%. Africa Regions'
contribution to banking headline earnings increased to 32% from 29% in 1H17. The top five contributors to Africa 
Regions' headline earnings were Angola, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. 

Operating environment
Global growth has been less synchronised than previously expected. Key drivers were escalating trade tensions, rising
oil prices and higher US yields. Global risk aversion led to increased volatility and emerging market (EM) currency
pressures. 

In many of the sub-Saharan African countries in which we operate, inflation continued to ease, interest rates declined
and exchange rates were relatively stable. One exception was Angola, where the managed devaluation of the currency
resulted in a 23% decline in average AOA/USD period on period. 

In South Africa (SA), on average, the Rand was stronger, rates lower and inflation surprised on the downside. Consumer
and business confidence improved but have not necessarily translated into higher spending or fixed investment. The VAT
increase, tax bracket creep and higher fuel prices have all negatively impacted discretionary spending capacity. 

IFRS 9 became effective on 1 January 2018 and the group provided a transition report with its first quarter results
for 2018. The day one impact of implementing IFRS 9's expected credit loss impairment requirements included a 31% 
increase in balance sheet impairments from R22.4 billion to R29.4 billion, a R6.6 billion decline in group reserves 
and a 70 bps decline in the group's CET1 ratio on a fully loaded basis. The CET1 impact will be phased in over 
three years.

Revenue
Banking activities achieved revenue growth of 4%, with strong NIR growth dampened by slower net interest income (NII). 

NII was broadly flat driven by low loan growth and declining net interest margin (NIM). NIM declined from 460 bps to
450 bps as the impact of declines in interest rates in SA and various African countries and pressure on pricing was
partially offset by retail deposits growing faster than wholesale, the Africa Regions' portfolio growing faster than 
SA  and lower funding costs. In addition, the impact of the earlier suspension of interest in accordance with IFRS 9 
was negative 4 bps on NIM and approximately R280 million on NII. On a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the impact 
of interest in suspense (IIS), NII would have grown 2% compared to reported growth of 1%.

NIR was up 8% on 1H17, with the largest component, net fee and commission revenue, up 6%. Trading revenue recovered to
grow at 12% and other revenue by 9%.

Growth in net fee and commission revenue was the result of volume-driven increases in card-based commissions,
electronic banking fees and foreign currency service fees. Customers are increasingly adopting and transacting on our 
digital platforms as well as our non-cash, digital products, e.g. Instant Money and SnapScan. Strong growth in revenue 
was dampened by higher card merchant fees and UCount reward programme costs. 

Reported trading revenue grew 12%, while trading revenue on a constant currency basis grew 17%. On a constant currency
basis fixed income and currency trading revenue grew 8%, driven by strong client activity. Equities revenue increased
by R475 million, of which approximately 50% was trade related and 50% relates to the elimination, in terms of IFRS, of
the impact of Standard Bank shares held by the group to facilitate client trading activities.

Credit impairment charges
Credit impairment charges were 22% lower than in the prior period, which combined with low growth in loans led to a
group credit loss ratio of 70 bps, down from 96 bps in 1H17. In Personal & Business Banking (PBB), impairment charges
declined 14% largely due to the earlier suspension of interest in accordance with IFRS 9 in SA and lower charges in
Africa Regions. In SA, excluding the impact of IFRS 9, the credit charge would have been broadly flat period on period.
Corporate & Investment Banking's (CIB) impairment charges declined 70%, driven by Africa Regions recoveries. CIB charges 
are likely to normalise in the second half of 2018 (2H18).

Operating expenses
Operating expenses grew 6% period on period. The cost-to-income ratio for the period was 57.1%, an increase on 56.1%
in the prior period.

Staff costs were up 6%, driven by annual salary increases and higher deferred incentive charges (linked to the higher
Standard Bank share price). Headcount declined overall, with decreases in PBB and CIB partially offset by additional
heads in IT, Compliance, Marketing and Risk Management functions. 

Other operating expenses increased by 5%. IT costs increased 13% on the back of higher licensing fees, infrastructure
spend and security costs. IT amortisation only grew 3% period on period; this is expected to accelerate in 2H18 as key
projects completed in 1H18 start to be amortised. Tight cost control across various operational areas, for example
premises, communication and stationary, provided the group with scope to invest in our core customer value proposition. 
During the period the group incurred additional spend in SA on professional fees related to the PBB customer journey 
project and on marketing to build on brand awareness both in SA and across Africa Regions. Both projects started in 
the second half of 2017 and therefore the impact is expected to be less marked over the full year. 

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers grew 4% period on period, of which PBB's advances to customers grew 6% and CIB's
by 1%. 

Within PBB, mortgage lending grew 3%. In SA, new applications received were down 4% reflective of the low level of
activity in the SA housing market. Despite the subdued environment, PBB SA's new business disbursements totalled 
R19.1 billion in the period. Vehicle and asset finance (VAF) lending grew 5%, driven primarily by strong new business 
volumes in SA. A 31% increase in new accounts, albeit at lower average values, led to a 22% increase in disbursements 
to R18.4 billion. The increases are a validation of the investments made in people, processes and structures to deliver 
a better customer experience. Credit card balances outstanding increased by 4% as customers utilised limits and 
transacted more. Other personal unsecured lending grew by 4%. Business lending grew by 16%, with PBB Africa Regions 
showing particularly strong growth at 21% on a constant currency basis. 

In CIB loans and advances supporting client activities showed growth in both Investment Banking of 6% and
Transactional Products and Services of 12%. The overall growth rate of customer loans is masked by reduced short-term 
lending balances in Global Markets where surplus liquidity is placed mostly with non-bank financial institutions. 
Increased client lending requirements during the period therefore led to a switch in our utilisation of liquidity 
from Global Markets placements to client lending in Investment Banking and Transactional Products and Services.

Funding and liquidity
The group's liquidity position remained strong with a second quarter average Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
of 121.3%, exceeding the minimum phased-in Basel III LCR requirement of 90%. The group's net stable funding ratio was
123.1% in excess of the minimum Basel III requirement of 100%.

The group successfully increased its longer term funding during 1H18, raising R13.9 billion through a combination of
negotiable certificates of deposit, senior debt and syndicated loans. 

Deposits and debt funding from customers grew 4% period on period. The group's retail deposits from PBB customers
increased 9%. In South Africa, retail-priced deposits grew 9%, in Africa Regions 16% and in International 12%. 
CIB's SA deposits declined 2%, whilst in Africa Regions customer deposits grew by 5% (9% in constant currency).

Capital management
The group allocates available capital pursuant to our strategic objectives and subject to appropriate return hurdles.
In 1H18 the group completed the acquisition of an additional 11% in Stanbic IBTC Holdings in Nigeria, increasing the
group's shareholding to 64% and negatively impacting the group CET1 ratio by approximately 20 bps. In early July 2018, 
the group completed the acquisition of an additional 8% in Stanbic Holdings in Kenya, increasing the group's shareholding 
to 68%. The impact of the transaction in Kenya on group CET1 in 2H18 will be negligible. Including the impact of the
Nigeria transaction, the group maintained strong capital adequacy ratios. On an IFRS 9 phased-in basis, the CET1 ratio 
was 13.8% (1H17: 13.7%) and the total capital adequacy ratio was 16.2% (1H17: 16.2%).

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings of R6.6 billion were 8% higher than the prior year, driven by customer-led growth in income,
responsible cost management and lower credit impairment charges, most notably in Africa Regions. An ROE of 19.4% was
achieved, a marked improvement on the 17.8% recorded in the prior period.

PBB SA delivered a resilient performance in a sluggish operating environment, with headline earnings of R6.0 billion
up 5%. PBB SA's focus remains on delivering a consistently excellent customer experience, seamlessly across all touch
points, with products relevant to their individual needs. This has necessitated continued investment in upskilling and
empowering our customer facing staff and radically redesigning and digitising processes. Ensuring the safety of customers'
assets in a digital era is also an integral part of the overall customer experience, and investments made in digital
fraud prevention yielded a pleasing 81% reduction in the number of digital fraud cases reported. Together, these investments
have resulted in an overall increase in customer satisfaction scores and the number of active customers was maintained
from FY17 at 8.1 million customers. This was supported by particularly pleasing growth in the larger middle market
segment. Customers continued to indicate their preference for digital, rather than physical channels, with the number 
of active mobile banking users growing by 7%, and the number of transactions performed on this channel growing strongly 
by 58%. 

Total income grew by 4%, supported by increases in target customer segments. Despite increased spending on marketing
campaigns and projects to develop solutions, which better service our customers, operating expense growth was contained
at 6%. Credit impairment charges declined by 8% leading to a lower credit loss ratio of 122 bps (1H17: 137 bps). This 
was mainly attributable to IFRS 9 as discussed previously.

PBB Africa Regions was impacted by the stronger Rand on average in 1H18 compared to 1H17. To reflect the underlying
trends in this business, the commentary that follows refers to the constant currency growth rates of PBB Africa Regions.

Headline earnings from PBB Africa Regions improved to R201 million from R91 million in the prior period. Gross
customer loans expanded 15%, particularly in personal unsecured and business lending, and deposits from customers grew 
15%, with pleasing balance growth of 18% in current and savings accounts. PBB Africa Regions' result was underpinned by 
customer acquisition in key markets, with a focus on delivering digital solutions, and strong trade-related revenue in the
Business Banking segment. In 1H18 the total number of active customers grew 4% to 5 million customers, driven by strong
growth in Kenya, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Mobile and internet banking are available in all 14
countries in which PBB operates in Africa Regions. The number of transactions performed by customers on digital platforms
far outstripped the number performed in physical channels. Approximately 24 million transactions were performed on mobile
banking, up from approximately 11 million in 1H17. On the other hand, transactions performed in physical channels
declined by 8%.

NII grew 9%, benefiting from balance growth and improved pricing, despite the negative endowment impact of lower
average interest rates in Nigeria, Mozambique, Malawi and Uganda. NIR grew 19%, driven by higher transactional volumes 
and the increase in the account base, coupled with strong trade-related revenue growth. PBB Africa Regions contributes
approximately 47% of the Africa Regions legal entities' total income. The credit loss ratio decreased to 145 bps from 
264 bps in the prior year, driven predominantly by lower charges in Nigeria and Malawi. Assets under management in the 
Wealth business in Nigeria grew over the period, and we continued to focus on diversifying and growing the wealth 
business in Africa Regions, specifically the short-term and long-term brokerage businesses.

Wealth International grew headline earnings by 31%. USD, GBP and EUR denominated customer deposit balances in our
operations in the Isle of Man and Jersey grew to GBP5.1 billion (1H17: GBP4.9 billion). Margins expanded following 
interest rate increases in the US and UK. 

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB's headline earnings of R5.7 billion were up 8% on the prior period, and 13% on a constant currency basis. CIB's
strategic focus on developing proactive client partnerships that deliver relevant solutions, across sectors, regions and
products, to drive Africa's growth delivers diverse revenue streams and supports the sustainability of the franchise.
Client revenues grew 9% (14% on a constant currency basis), demonstrating a strong and diversified franchise. CIB recorded
strong performances from multinational corporates and large domestic clients in the Financial Institutions, Industrials
and Consumer sectors, with an encouraging turn around in the Power & Infrastructure, Oil & Gas and Mining & Metals
sectors. Reported revenue growth was slower at 4%, mainly as a result of the non-recurrence of trading revenues associated
with the revaluation of the Nigeria Naira in the prior year. While cost growth was relatively well contained at 5%, when
combined with low revenue growth it resulted in negative jaws of 1.5%. The credit loss ratio to customers improved
materially to 3 bps due to recoveries of previously impaired loans. CIB delivered an ROE of 20.7%, slightly lower than 
the 21.3% recorded in 1H17.

Due to the impact of currency on CIB's results, the commentary that follows refers to the constant currency growth
rates. Revenues in the CIB SA franchise grew by 8%, and in the Africa Regions franchise by 10%. The West Africa franchise
grew revenues by more than 29%, reflecting growth in client deposits and transactional accounts. South & Central Africa
continued to be a steady performer, delivering revenue growth of 9%. Following focused attention on client acquisition in
East Africa, this region delivered strong revenue growth of 17%.

Transactional Products and Services delivered a subdued set of results, with headline earnings down 2% on the prior
period. Revenue growth of 6% was muted, dampened by margin compression in Nigeria and Angola. Credit impairments 
increased significantly following the recognition of impairments in the Construction sector in South Africa, to 
take account of economic strain. 

Global Markets delivered a stronger performance compared to 1H17, growing headline earnings by 8% to R2.1 billion.
Equity and forex trading volumes in South Africa were low. However, fixed income trading improved as a result of lower
interest rates and improved market sentiment. The more flexible forex regime in Nigeria continued to assist forex flows 
in Nigeria, and the managed devaluation of the Kwanza benefited forex trading in Angola.

Investment Banking revenues were up 9%, reflecting fees earned on a number of landmark transactions and client
activity in the Energy and Infrastructure sectors. Competition for high quality clients continued to place pressure on 
pricing and led to margin compression. As a result, NII was lower than the prior period. Credit impairments improved
significantly following the recovery of previously impaired loans in the Africa Regions, despite recognising impairments 
to take account of stress in the Consumer sector in South Africa.

Central and other 
This segment includes costs associated with corporate functions, as well as the group's treasury and capital
requirements and central hedging activities. Capital not allocated to the business units is held at the centre and a 
return is generated on that capital. The day one IFRS 9 reserve adjustment resulted in a R6.6 billion decline in that 
capital and a concomitant decline in the returns earned on that capital. In 1H18, the segment recorded a loss of 
R676 million. Excluding the IFRS 9 impact, the loss would have been R516 million.

Other banking interests
Other banking interests recorded headline earnings of R132 million, lower than the R212 million recorded in 1H17. 
The decline was driven by a disappointing performance in ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS). 

ICBCS's revenue was negatively impacted by lower client flows and margins, which when combined with its fixed cost
base, resulted in a loss for the period. The group's 40% share thereof equated to a loss of R70 million. ICBCS will 
require additional capital to grow its balance sheet and become profitable on a sustainable basis. The group's 40% 
contribution will equate to approximately $84 million and is expected to be provided in late 2018 or early 2019. 

The headline earnings contribution from the group's 20% stake in ICBC Argentina grew 23% to R202 million, off a low
base in 1H17. The Peso devaluation diluted a particularly strong local currency performance. On a constant currency basis,
earnings were up 74%. 

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group's 55.6% investment in Liberty, adjusted for
SBK shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders which are deemed to be treasury shares in the 
group's consolidated accounts.

Liberty's normalised headline earnings for the period improved by 5% to R1.3 billion, supported by higher earnings
from SA retail insurance and asset management. Liberty's IFRS headline earnings, after the adjustments for the impact 
of the BEE preference share income and the Liberty Two Degrees listed Real Estate Investment Trust accounting mismatch,
declined 1% to R1.5 billion. Investors are referred to the full Liberty announcement dated 2 August 2018 for further 
detail. 

Headline earnings attributable to the group, adjusted up by R12 million for the impact of the deemed treasury shares,
were R857 million, 3% lower than in 1H17.

Prospects
Whilst the global growth outlook for 2018 and 2019 is unchanged at 3.9%, the underlying growth is expected to be less
even. Relative to expectations earlier in the year, the International Monetary Fund is expecting the US to grow slightly
faster and UK, Europe and EM slightly slower. The broadly supportive EM capital inflows seen in recent periods could
reverse if US monetary tightening is faster than expected. This would negatively impact EM currencies and capital markets.

Sub-Saharan Africa's recovery is expected to continue on the back of higher commodity prices. Growth is estimated to
increase from 2.8% in 2017 to 3.4% in 2018 and rise further to 3.8% in 2019. Within our portfolio, we expect the macros
in the West region to continue to improve, supported by higher average oil prices and the East region to continue to
deliver GDP growth of 5 to 6%. More specifically, Kenya's credit growth could experience a recovery if the regulatory 
caps and floors, imposed in 2016, are amended or lifted. The South & Central region performance will be impacted by 
SA growth in 2H18.

In South Africa, while consumer confidence has improved, delays in resolving key policy issues remain an obstacle to 
business confidence, fixed investment and growth. Inflation is expected to remain inside the 3% to 6% target range, 
supporting a flat interest rate outlook for the rest of the year. The group has appetite to grow lending judiciously 
in South Africa. There is no doubt competitive pressures will continue to increase, however, we will fiercely protect 
our existing customer franchise and grow by partnering with third parties to build new, innovative offerings and 
revenue streams. 

Our strategy is unchanged and actions being taken are positioning us to deliver contextually-relevant offerings to our
customers, to compete effectively against both incumbents and new entrants and to grow our franchise in partnership
with our clients, employees and business partners, in a sustainable way.

With revenue pressures expected to continue, operating expenses will be a focus area for 2H18 to ensure better full
year jaws. More broadly, we will continue to balance growth, resilience and returns to deliver on our medium-term

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to
dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference 
shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20% of the cash 
dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount 
of 344 cents per ordinary share, 2.60 cents per first preference share and 309.144 cents per second preference share. 
Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 20% depending 
on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country 
of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 059 594 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

1 The group has, as permitted by IFRS 9, elected not to restate its comparative financial statements. Therefore
  comparability will not be achieved by the fact that the comparative financial information has been prepared on an 
  IAS 39 basis. The group has, however, aligned its categories for loans and advances disclosed in FY17 to those 
  disclosed for 1H18. This did not result in a restatement to the group's statement of financial position as at 
  31 December 2017.

(FY17: R3.5 billion nominal value). During the period, coupons to the value of R222 million (FY17: R229 million) 
were paid to AT1 capital bond holders. Current tax of R62 million (FY17: R64 million) relating to the AT1 capital 
bonds was recognised directly in equity resulting in an aggregate net equity impact of R160 million 
(FY17: R165 million). The AT1 capital bonds have been recognised within other equity instruments in the 
statement of financial position.

Capital management
The group manages its capital levels to support business, growth, maintain depositor and creditors' confidence, create
value for its shareholders and ensure regulatory compliance. The main regulatory requirements to be complied with are
those specified in the Banks Act No.94 of 1990 and related regulations, which are aligned with Basel III. Regulatory
capital adequacy is measured through the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital adequacy.

The group has elected the three year phase-in as outlined in the SARB's Directive 5/2017. This phase-in results in the
IFRS 9 impact being amortised on a straight-line basis, from 25% in 2018 to reach 100% by 2021. The group's capital
adequacy ratios based on a phased-in and fully loaded basis are shown in the table below:

Equity securities
During the period, the group allotted 1 124 399 shares (FY17: 2 877 827 shares) in terms of the group's share
incentive schemes and repurchased 2 332 974 shares (FY17: 2 030 824 shares).

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the period was 18 646 358 shares (FY17: 16 213 766
shares). These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured entities (SEs) relating to 
the group's Tutuwa initiative (refer to the related party balances and transactions note for more detail) since 
those SEs hold the voting rights on such shares and are accordingly not treasury shares as defined by the JSE 
Listings Requirements.

Legal proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other
proceedings. Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. 
Nevertheless, based on management's knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting with legal counsel, 
management believes that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being 'likely to 
succeed and material' or 'unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. The group is also the defendant in 
some legal cases for which the group is fully indemnified by external third parties, none of which are individually 
material. Management is accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings currently pending against the group should 
not have a material adverse effect on the group's consolidated financial position and the directors are satisfied 
that the group has adequate insurance programmes and, where required in terms of IFRS for claims that are probable, 
provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed.

Competition Commission - trading of foreign currency 
On 15 February 2017 South Africa's Competition Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal against
18 institutions, including one against SBSA and two against a former subsidiary of the group, Standard New York
Securities Inc. (SNYS), in which it alleges unlawful collusion between those institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. 
The group has, with the help of external counsel, conducted its own internal investigations and found no evidence 
that supports the complaints. Both SBSA and SNYS have, together with 12 of the other respondents, applied to the 
Competition Tribunal for dismissal of the complaint referral on various legal grounds. Judgement in these 
applications has been reserved. In separate proceedings SBSA has applied to the Competition Appeal Court for an 
order that the Competition Commission's decision to lodge its complaint against SBSA be reviewed and set aside 
on the conditional ground that it was irrational. The allegations against SBSA are confined to USD/ZAR trading 
activities within SBSA and do not relate to the conduct of the group more broadly.

Indemnities granted following disposal of Standard Bank Plc 
Under the terms of the disposal of SB Plc on 1 February 2015, the group provided ICBC with certain indemnities to be
paid in cash to ICBC or, at ICBC's direction, to any SB Plc (now ICBCS) group company, a sum equal to the amount of
losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising from certain circumstances. Where an indemnity payment is required to be 
made by the group to the ICBCS group, such payment would be grossed up from ICBC's shareholding at the time in ICBCS 
to 100%. These payments may, inter alia, arise as a result of an enforcement action, the cause of which occurred 
prior to the date of disposal. Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or governmental authorities 
to enforce the relevant laws in any jurisdiction. While there have been no material claims relating to these 
indemnification provisions, the indemnities provided are uncapped and of unlimited duration as they reflect that 
the pre-completion regulatory risks attaching to the disposed-of business remain with the group post completion. 
The indemnification provisions covered the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) that ICBCS entered into with the 
United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (SFO) (as more fully set out in the announcement made to shareholders via the 
JSE's SENS on 30 November 2015). In terms of the DPA, prosecution has been suspended and will be withdrawn in 
November 2018 provided that ICBCS has complied with its obligations under the DPA. Any claims that may arise 
for SNYS with respect to the Competition Commission matter are also likely to fall within the scope of this 
indemnity as the alleged conduct, which is the subject of the referral, is alleged to have taken place prior 
to the disposal of SB Plc.

Subordinated debt
During the period, the group issued R3.0 billion (FY17: Rnil) Basel lll compliant bonds that qualified as Tier 2
capital.The capital notes are perpetual, non-cumulative with an issuer call option after a minimum period of five 
years and one day, and on every coupon payment date thereafter. The payment dates are quarterly with the first call 
date being 13 February 2023.

R3.5 billion (FY17: R3.0 billion) Basel III compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were redeemed during the
year. 

R0.1 billion (FY17: R0.3 billion) of Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were issued during the
year and R0.1 billion (FY17: R0.2 billion) was redeemed in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Basel III
framework. 

The terms of the Basel III compliant Tier 2 capital bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the
write-off, in whole or in part, on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (the SARB) that a write-off 
without which the issuer would have become non-viable is necessary, or a decision to make a public sector injection 
of capital or equivalent support, without which the issuer would have become non-viable. 

During the period, the group did not issue subordinated debt that qualifies as regulatory insurance capital 
(FY17: R2.0 billion) and R1.0 billion (FY17: R1.0 billion) was redeemed.

Stanbic Africa Holdings Limited 
In June 2018, Stanbic Africa Holdings Limited (SAHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBG, increased its shareholdings in
its listed Nigerian and Kenyan subsidiaries through acquisitions of additional shares from non-controlling interests
(NCI). Increases in the group's interest in a subsidiary, when the group already has control, are accounted for as
transactions with equity holders of the group. The difference between the purchase consideration and the group's 
proportionate share of the subsidiary's additional net asset value acquired is accounted for directly in equity.

Nigeria
In Nigeria, SAHL's shareholding in Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC (SIBTC) increased by 11.3% from 53.1% to 64.4% through 
an announced off market trade on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for a total consideration of R2 354 million. The group
recognised a decrease in NCI of R902 million and a decrease in retained earnings and equity attributable to ordinary
shareholders of R1 452 million because of changes in the group's ownership interest in SIBTC.

Kenya
In Kenya, SAHL's shareholding in Stanbic Holdings Plc (SH Plc) increased by 5.9% from 60.0% to 65.9% for a total
consideration of R307 million following the first close of a two-stage tender offer. The group recognised a decrease 
in NCI of R348 million and an increase in retained earnings and equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of 
R40 million because of changes in the group's ownership interest in SH Plc.

In July 2018, the second and final close of the tender offer saw a further increase in SAHL's shareholding in SH Plc
by 2.1% to 68.0%. The second close does not impact the group results for the period ended 30 June 2018 as it occurred
after that date.

Liberty Group Limited
During the period, Liberty Group Limited's (Liberty) shareholding in Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) decreased by
5.2% from 63.1% to 57.9% for a total consideration of R370 million. Liberty recognised an increase in NCI of 
R465 million and a decrease in retained earnings and equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of R95 million 
because of changes in Liberty's ownership interest in L2D. 

Accounting policy elections
Adoption of new and amended standards effective for the current financial period 
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except for the adoption of the
following standards and amendments effective for the current period:
- IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (amendment) (IFRS 4), the amendment to applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with 
  IFRS 4 introduced two approaches: an overlay approach and a deferral approach. The amended standard will provide 
  all companies that issue insurance contracts the option to recognise in other comprehensive income, rather than 
  profit or loss, the volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard 
  is issued; and provide companies whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance an optional temporary 
  exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 2021. The entities that defer the application of IFRS 9 will continue to apply 
  the existing financial instruments standard IAS 39. The amendments to IFRS 4 supplement existing options in the 
  standard that can already be used to address the temporary volatility.
- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), with effect from 1 January 2018, replaces the existing 
  revenue standards and the related interpretations. The standard sets out the requirements for recognising revenue 
  that applies to all contracts with customers (except for contracts that are within the scope of the standards on 
  leases, insurance contracts or financial instruments). The core principle of the standard is that revenue recognised 
  reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods 
  or services to the customer. The standard incorporates a five step analysis to determine the amount and timing of 
  revenue recognition. The group adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 and, as permitted by IFRS 15, did not restate its 
  comparative financial results. The standard does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, and 
  therefore does not impact the majority of the group's revenue. 
- IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration provides guidance on how to determine the date of 
  the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, 
  expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising 
  from the payment or receipt of advance consideration in a foreign currency. 

The above mentioned standards and interpretation to the IFRS standards, adopted on 1 January 2018, did not effect the 
group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and did not impact the group's results upon transition 
or the group's accounting policies.
- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2018, replaced IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduced new requirements 
  which included an ECL impairment model and new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial 
  assets, refer to the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments section for more detail.

IFRS 9, adopted on 1 January 2018, impacted the group's results upon transition and materially impacted the group's
accounting policies, refer to the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments section for more detail.


IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
Background
With effect from 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduced new requirements which included an ECL
impairment model and new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets as follows:  

ECL impairment          IFRS 9's ECL impairment model's requirements represented the most material IFRS 9 
requirements            transition impact for the group.
                        The ECL model applies to financial assets measured at either amortised cost or at 
                        fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), loan commitments when there 
                        is a present commitment to extend credit (unless these are measured at fair value 
                        through profit or loss (FVTPL)) and financial guarantees.
                        ECL is, at a minimum, required to be measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal 
                        to the lower of 12-month or full lifetime ECL (where the lifetime is less than 12 months) 
                        of the financial asset. A loss allowance for full lifetime ECL is required for a financial 
                        asset if the credit risk of that financial instrument has increased significantly since 
                        initial recognition.    
                        
Classification          IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on the basis of the 
and measurement         entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
                        characteristics of the financial assets.
                        The accounting for financial assets differs in various other areas to existing requirements 
                        such as embedded derivatives and the recognition of fair value adjustments in OCI.
                        All changes in the fair value of financial liabilities that are designated at FVTPL due to 
                        changes in own credit risk are required to be recognised within OCI.

Adoption of IFRS 9
The group retrospectively adopted IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 with an adjustment to the group's opening 1 January 2018
reserves and, as permitted by IFRS 9, did not restate its comparative financial results. Accordingly, the group's
previously reported financial results up to 31 December 2017 are presented in accordance with the requirements of 
IAS 39 and for 2018, and future reporting periods, are presented in terms of IFRS 9. However, the group has elected 
to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The group prepared a IFRS 9 transition report on 
which a reasonable assurance audit opinion, included in the report, was provided by the group's external auditors 
that outlined the impact of the transition to IFRS 9. For further information, regarding the transition impact, 
refer to the transition report, available at www.standardbank.com/reporting.

IFRS 9's ECL requirements 
The most material IFRS 9 transition impact for the group is that of IFRS 9's new ECL requirements which results in the
earlier recognition of credit impairment provisions primarily as a result of the drivers outlined below. This impact 
was solely as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 and is not as a result of changes in the credit quality of the 
group's loan exposures.

12-month ECL for        IFRS 9 contains a minimum 12-month ECL for exposures for which there has not been a 
performing loans        significant increase in credit risk (SICR), whereas IAS 39 required credit impairments to 
(stage 1)               be recognised only following the identification of objective evidence of impairment.    

Significant increase    A lifetime ECL is recognised for all exposures for which there has been a SICR, being a material 
in credit risk (SICR)   change in the probability of default, since origination.
(stage 2)

Off-balance sheet       IFRS 9's scope includes off-balance sheet exposures, such as unutilised loan commitments, 
exposures               guarantees and letters of credit.

Lifetime model          In terms of determining ECL for stage 1 and 2 exposures where there is a probability of 
work out requirement    default, the potential loss from a lifetime perspective is considered, which would include 
                        the probability of recovery post default and subsequent re-default.                
                        For stage 3 exposures, being exposures that are either in default or where default is imminent, 
                        this would include consideration of cures and subsequent re-default.

Forward looking         IFRS 9 requires an adjustment for forward looking economic expectations in the determination 
economic expectations   of SICR and in the measurement of the ECL.

1 The change in the retained earnings relates to IFRS 9's classification and measurement and ECL changes and 
  the reversal of the statutory credit risk reserve (SCRR) as explained further below.
2 In addition to the R6 637 million impact on the group's reserves, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, 
  a debit of R948 million to the group's SCRR and a corresponding credit to the group's retained earnings has 
  been recognised. The SCRR has historically been maintained by means of an appropriation of retained earnings 
  to a non-distributable reserve, being the SCRR, by the group's operations in the Africa Regions as a result 
  of country regulators requiring a higher credit impairment provision than that as determined in accordance 
  with IAS 39. Given that IFRS 9 typically results in an impairment provision that is equivalent to or greater 
  than that as required by the Africa Regions' regulators, a transfer from the SCRR back to retained earnings 
  is required on transition to IFRS 9. The transfer has only been reflected with respect to those countries 
  whose regulators that, at the date of this transition report, had approved such releases. This transfer has 
  no impact on the group's net asset value, total reserves or capital ratios.
3 Of the R593 million in the group's available-for-sale reserve as at 31 December 2017, R582 million has been
  reclassified on the adoption of IFRS 9 to the FVOCI category and R11 million relates to gains and losses on 
  instruments that were classified as available-for-sale and are now classified as either FVTPL or at amortised 
  cost.
4 The change relates to the non-controlling interests' share of the IFRS 9 impact post tax relating to IFRS 9's
  classification and measurement and ECL changes.

IFRS 9 accounting policies
Financial instruments
Initial measurement - financial instruments
All financial instruments are measured initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction 
costs and fees, except for those financial instruments that are subsequently measured at fair value through 
profit or loss where such transaction costs and fees are immediately recognised in profit or loss. Financial 
instruments are recognised (derecognised) on the date the group commits to purchase (sell) the instruments 
(trade date accounting).

Financial assets
Nature
Amortised cost             A debt instrument that meets both of the following conditions (other than those 
                           designated at fair value through profit or loss):
                           - Held within a business model whose objective is to hold the debt instrument 
                             (financial asset) in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
                           - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to 
                             cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
                             amount outstanding.  
 
                           This assessment includes determining the objective of holding the asset and whether 
                           the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the 
                           contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are not considered 
                           de minimis and are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the financial asset 
                           is classified as fair value through profit or loss - default.      
Fair value                 Includes:
through OCI                - A debt instrument that meets both of the following conditions (other than those 
                             designated at fair value through profit or loss):
                             - Held within a business model in which the debt instrument (financial asset) is 
                               managed to both collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets; and
                             - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to 
                               cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
                               amount outstanding.
                             This assessment includes determining the objective of holding the asset and whether 
                             the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the 
                             contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are not considered 
                             de minimis and are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the financial asset 
                             is classified as fair value through profit or loss - default.     
                           - Equity financial assets which are not held for trading and are irrevocably elected 
                             (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to be presented at fair value through OCI.
Held for trading           Those financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
                           (including all derivative financial assets) and those that form part of a portfolio of 
                           identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is 
                           evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking.
                           Included are commodities that are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in 
                           the near future or generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker-trader margin.
Designated at fair value   Financial assets are designated to be measured at fair value to eliminate or significantly
through profit or loss     reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Fair value through profit  Financial assets that are not classified into one of the above mentioned financial asset
or loss - default          categories.

Subsequent measurement
Subsequent to initial measurement, financial assets are classified in their respective categories and measured at
either amortised cost or fair value as follows:
Amortised cost             Amortised cost using the effective interest method with interest recognised in interest 
                           income, less any expected credit impairment losses which are recognised as part of 
                           credit impairment charges.
                           Directly attributable transaction costs and fees received are capitalised and amortised 
                           through interest income as part of the effective interest rate.
Fair value through         Debt instrument: Fair value, with gains and losses recognised directly in the fair value 
OCI                        through OCI reserve. When a debt financial asset is disposed of, the cumulative fair value 
                           adjustments, previously recognised in OCI, are reclassified to the other gains and losses 
                           on financial instruments within non-interest revenue. 
  
                           Interest income on a debt financial asset is recognised in interest income in terms of the 
                           effective interest rate method. Dividends received are recognised in interest income 
                           within profit or loss.
                           
                           Equity instrument: Fair value, with gains and losses recognised directly in the fair value 
                           through OCI reserve. When equity financial assets are disposed of, the cumulative fair value 
                           adjustments in OCI are reclassified within reserves to retained income. 
                           
                           Dividends received on equity instruments are recognised in other revenue within non-interest 
                           income.
Held for trading           Fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including interest 
                           and dividends) recognised in trading revenue.
Designated at fair         Fair value gains and losses (including interest and dividends) on the financial asset are 
value through profit       recognised in the income statement as part of other gains and losses on financial instruments 
or loss                    within non-interest revenue.
Fair value through         Fair value gains and losses (including interest and dividends) on the financial asset are
profit or loss             recognised in the income statement as part of other gains and losses on financial instruments   
- default                  within non-interest revenue.

Impairment
ECL is recognised on debt financial assets classified as at either amortised cost or fair value through OCI, financial
guarantee contracts that are not designated at fair value through profit or loss as well as loan commitments that are
neither measured at fair value through profit or loss nor are used to provide a loan at a below market interest rate.

The measurement basis of the ECL of a financial asset includes assessing whether there has been a SICR at the
reporting date which includes forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting 
date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The measurement basis of the ECL,
which is set out in the table that follows, is measured as the unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined
by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and forward-looking information.
Stage 1                    A 12-month ECL is calculated for financial assets which are neither credit-impaired on
                           origination nor for which there has been a SICR.                          
Stage 2                    A lifetime ECL allowance is calculated for financial assets that are assessed to
                           have displayed a SICR since origination and are not considered low credit risk. 
Stage 3 (credit            A lifetime ECL is calculated for financial assets that are assessed to be credit impaired.     
impaired assets)           The following criteria are used in determining whether the financial asset is impaired: 
                           - default
                           - significant financial difficulty of borrower and/or modification
                           - probability of bankruptcy or financial reorganisation
                           - disappearance of an active market due to financial difficulties.

The key components of the impairment methodology are described as follows:
Significant increase       At each reporting date the group assesses whether the credit risk of its exposures
in credit risk             has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in 
                           the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset.
                           Credit risk of exposures which are overdue for more than 30 days are also considered 
                           to have increased significantly.
Low credit risk            Exposures are generally considered to have a low credit risk where there is a low risk 
                           of default, the exposure has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
                           obligations and adverse changes in economic and business conditions may not necessarily 
                           reduce the exposure's ability to fulfil its contractual obligations.
Default                    The group's definition of default has been aligned to its internal credit risk 
                           management definitions and approaches. A financial asset is considered to be in 
                           default when there is objective evidence of impairment. The following criteria are 
                           used in determining whether there is objective evidence of impairment for financial 
                           assets or groups of financial assets:                                                      
                           - significant financial difficulty of borrower and/or modification (i.e. known cash 
                             flow difficulties experienced by the borrower)
                           - a breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in interest and/or principal 
                             payments
                           - disappearance of active market due to financial difficulties
                           - it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
                             reorganisation
                           - where the group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial 
                             difficulty, grants the borrower a concession that the group would not otherwise 
                             consider.   

                           Exposures which are overdue for more than 90 days are also considered to be in default.

Forward-looking            Forward-looking information is incorporated into the group's impairment methodology    
information                calculations and in the group's assessment of SICR. The group includes all forward 
                           looking information which is reasonable and available without undue cost or effort. 
                           The information will typically include expected macro-economic conditions and factors 
                           that are expected to impact portfolios or individual counterparty exposures. 
Write-off                  Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

Financial liabilities
Nature
Held-for-trading           Those financial liabilities incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing in 
                           the near term (including all derivative financial liabilities) and those that form part 
                           of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for 
                           which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking.    
Designated at              Financial liabilities are designated to be measured at fair value in the following
fair value through         instances:
profit or loss             - to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise 
                             arise where the financial liabilities are managed and their performance evaluated 
                             and reported on a fair value basis
                           - where the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives that

Subsequent measurement
Subsequent to initial measurement, financial liabilities are classified in their respective categories and 
measured at either amortised cost or fair value as follows:
Held-for-trading           Fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including 
                           interest and dividends) recognised in trading revenue.
Designated at              Fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including 
fair value through         interest and dividends but excluding fair value gains and losses attributable to 
profit or loss             own credit risk) are recognised in the other gains and losses on financial 
                           instruments as part of non-interest revenue.    
                           Fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are 
                           recognised within OCI, unless this would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch 
                           in which case the own credit risk changes are recognised within trading revenue.
Amortised cost             Amortised cost using the effective interest method recognised in interest expense.

Derecognition and modification of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are derecognised in the following instances:

Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the group (issuer) to make specified 
payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make 
payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally equal to 
the premium received, and then amortised over the life of the financial guarantee. Financial guarantee 
contracts (that are not designated at fair value through profit or loss) are subsequently measured at 
the higher of the:
- ECL calculated for the financial guarantee
- unamortised premium.

DESCRIPTION                RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Net interest income        Interest income and expense (with the exception of borrowing costs that are 
                           capitalised on qualifying assets, that is assets that necessarily take a substantial 
                           period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale and which are not measured 
                           at fair value) are recognised in net interest income using the effective interest 
                           method for all interest-bearing financial instruments. In terms of the effective interest 
                           method, interest is recognised at a rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
                           payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, where 
                           appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or 
                           financial liability. Direct incremental transaction costs incurred and origination fees 
                           received, including loan commitment fees, as a result of bringing margin-yielding assets 
                           or liabilities into the statement of financial position, are capitalised to the carrying 
                           amount of financial instruments that are not at fair value through profit or loss and 
                           amortised as interest income or expense over the life of the asset or liability as part 
                           of the effective interest rate.  
                           
                           Where the estimates of payments or receipts on financial assets or financial liabilities 
                           are subsequently revised, the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability 
                           is adjusted to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is 
                           calculated by computing the present value of the adjusted cash flows at the financial asset 
                           or financial liability's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment to the carrying 
                           value is recognised in net interest income.     
                           
                           When a financial asset is classified as specifically impaired (before 1 January 2018) or 
                           as Stage 3 impaired (after 1 January 2018), interest income is calculated on the impaired 
                           value (gross carrying amount less specific impairment) based on the original effective 
                           interest rate. The contractual interest income on the gross exposure is suspended and is 
                           only recognised in interest income when the financial asset is no longer specifically 
                           impaired (before 1 January 2018) or is reclassified out of Stage 3 (after 1 January 2018).  
                           
                           Before the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the following additional amounts were 
                           recognised in net interest income:
                           - Fair value gains and losses on debt financial assets that were designated at fair 
                             value through profit or loss
                           - The gain or loss on the derecognition of a financial asset classified as 
                             available-for-sale
                           - Gains and losses arising from the derecognition of financial assets and financial 
                             liabilities classified as at amortised cost
                           - Fair value gains and losses on financial liabilities (including changes as a result 
                             of own credit risk) that were designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Net fee and                Fee and commission revenue, including transactional fees, account servicing fees,
commission revenue         investment management fees, sales commissions and placement fees are recognised as 
                           the related services are performed. Loan commitment fees for loans that are not expected 
                           to be drawn down are recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.
                           
                           Loan syndication fees, where the group does not participate in the syndication or 
                           participates at the same effective interest rate for comparable risk as other 
                           participants, are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed. 
                           Syndication fees that do not meet these criteria are capitalised as origination fees 
                           and amortised to the income statement as interest income. The fair value of issued 
                           financial guarantee contracts on initial recognition is amortised as income over the 
                           term of the contract.
                           
                           Fee and commission expenses, included in net fee and commission revenue, are mainly 
                           transaction and service fees relating to financial instruments, which are expensed as 
                           the services are received. Expenditure is presented as fee and commission expenses 
                           where the expenditure is linked to the production of fee and commission revenue.
Trading revenue            Trading revenue comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of 
                           trading assets and liabilities, together with related interest income, expense and 
                           dividends.
Customer loyalty           The group's banking activities operate a customer loyalty programme in terms of    
programmes                 which it undertakes to provide goods and services to certain customers. The reward 
                           credits are accounted for as a separately identifiable component of the fee and 
                           commission income transactions of which they form a part. The consideration allocated 
                           to the reward credits is measured at the fair value of the reward credit and is 
                           recognised over the period in which the customer utilises the reward credits. Expenses 
                           relating to the provision of the reward credits are recognised in fee and commission 
                           expenses as and when they are incurred. 
Dividend income            Dividends are recognised in interest income (other revenue) for debt (equity instruments) 
                           when the right to receipt is established. Scrip dividends are recognised as dividends 
                           received where the dividend declaration allows for a cash alternative.
Insurance premium          Insurance premium revenue includes life insurance premiums, health insurance premiums
revenue                    and short-term insurance premiums.

                           mainly rental income from properties, interest, hotel operations' sales and dividends. 
                           Dividends are recognised when the right to receive payment is established and interest 
                           income is recognised using the effective interest method.
                           
                           Hotel operation sales comprise the fair value of the sale of accommodation, food and 
                           beverage, other guest facilities and rentals received. Revenue is shown net of VAT, 
                           returns, rebates and discounts.

                           accrual basis and comprises the cash value of commission and fees earned when premiums 
                           or fees are payable directly to the group and comprises the cash value of commission 
                           earned when premiums are payable directly to the underwriters.

Offsetting
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted by IFRS, or for gains and losses arising from 
a group of similar transactions.

Interest in suspense
In addition to the above identified changes between IAS 39 and IFRS 9, interest in suspense (refers to 
contractual interest which accrues on financial assets which are classified as non-performing) is presented 
as follows:

IAS 39 accounting treatment
Up to 31 December 2017, IAS 18 Revenue required interest income to be recognised only when it was probable 
that the economic benefits associated with a transaction would flow to the entity. The group, in line with these 
requirements, suspended the recognition of contractual interest income on all exposures where it was determined 
that future economic benefits were not probable. The accounting presentation policy for this suspended contractual 
interest was to present the balance sheet interest in suspense account as part of the gross carrying amount of 
the financial asset (i.e. gross carrying amount net of interest in suspense). In addition, upon the curing of the 
non-performing financial asset, the group elected an accounting presentation policy to recognise this suspended 
contractual interest (previously unrecognised interest) within net interest income line within the income statement. 
This policy was elected on the basis that the presentation best represented the nature of the amount in terms of 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1).

IFRS 9 accounting treatment
IFRS 9 requires that interest income for financial assets classified as Stage 3 be calculated on the net carrying
amount (after deducting credit impairments), which will result in a portion of contractual interest being suspended. 
IFRS 9 requires that this suspended contractual interest be presented as part of the financial assets' gross 
carrying amount. The group has applied this requirement by presenting balance sheet suspended contractual interest 
as a separate reconciling item when calculating the financial assets' net carrying amount. Hence suspended 
contractual interest does not impact the net carrying amount of the financial asset as presented on the statement 
of financial position. However, this change in presentation has resulted in an increased gross carrying amount 
of financial assets when compared to IAS 39. 

The group has elected to present previously unrecognised interest earned on curing of a financial asset out of 
Stage 3 within net interest income. This presentation is consistent with the group's treatment under IAS 39 and 
was elected on the basis that the presentation best represented the nature of the amount in terms of IAS 1. 
During the six months ended 30 June 2018, R545 million of unrecognised interest earned was recognised within 
net interest income.

Restatements

All restatements noted below are unaudited. 

Correction of prior period error
Consistent with the restatement to the group's statement of financial position at 31 December 2016 as 
reported in the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, the group determined 
that certain derivative intercompany positions held between the group's banking activities and the group's 
investment management and life insurance activities were erroneously eliminated on a net basis as opposed to 
a Ogross basis. The group has restated its previously reported condensed consolidated statement of financial 
position to incorporate the correct elimination of these intercompany derivative positions.

The restatement did not impact the group's net exposure on derivatives, nor did it affect the group's 
reserves. The change to the group's condensed consolidated statement of financial position is reflected in 
the table that follows:
                                                           1H17

- financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Change in accounting policy
Expenses incurred with respect to the group's customer loyalty programme (Ucount) have historically 
been recorded as part of operating expenses in the income statement. During the year, the group amended 
its accounting policy for these expenses to rather be presented as part of net fee and commission revenue 
(within non-interest revenue). This policy aligns with the group's policy for other expenses that are 
presented within net fee and commission revenue. The impact of the change in the accounting policy on the 
group's financial results is as follows:
                                           1H17                                       FY17

Other information

Pro forma constant currency financial information
The pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results is the responsibility of the group's directors.
The pro forma constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on
the group's results and may not fairly present the group's results of operations. In determining the change in constant
currency terms, the comparative financial reporting period's results have been adjusted for the difference between the
current and prior period's average exchange rates (determined as the average of the daily exchange rates). The
measurement has been performed for each of the group's material currencies. The pro forma constant currency financial 
information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors. 

The following average exchange rates were used in the determination of the pro forma constant currency information 
and were calculated using the average of the average monthly exchange rates (determined on the last day of each of 
the six months in the period).

Liquidity coverage ratio disclosure

In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the group and SBSA Solo entity on a
quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 1-month liquidity profile, by
ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment. The minimum regulatory requirement for 2018 is 90%
and will increase by a further 10% on 1 January 2019 to reach the full 100% requirement.

Update on the group’s performance for the three months ended 31 March 2018 (1Q18)

In South Africa, the slight improvement in business and consumer confidence has not yet translated into stronger
asset growth. In Africa Regions, the positive momentum in the retail customer franchise continued. Good growth
in non-interest revenue, underpinned by higher trading revenues, was partially offset by slow net interest income
growth, on the back of slow asset growth and declining interest rates. A relatively benign credit environment
continued to provide support to banking earnings. Earnings from banking activities and other banking interests
grew period on period. Group earnings were dampened by the strength of the Rand relative to the USD and
Argentine Peso and weakness in key African currencies during 1Q18 relative to 1Q17.

The earnings attributable to the group from its 55.5% shareholding in Liberty Holdings Limited (Liberty) are
adjusted for the Standard Bank Group shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders which are
deemed to be treasury shares in the group’s consolidated accounts. The increase in the Standard Bank Group
share price between 31 December 2017 and 31 March 2018 had a negative impact on the earnings attributable
to the group from Liberty in the period. This was in contrast to a small positive impact in the comparable period.
Liberty is due to publish its operational update for the three months ended 31 March 2018 on 18 May 2018.

During the period the headline earnings adjustable items were negligible.

The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 31 March 2017 will be released on 22 May 2018.

With the exception of the reasonable assurance report issued by the group’s external auditors on the IFRS 9
transition adjustment, the information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational
performance update is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

Overview of financial results
Group results
Standard Bank Group's financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2017 was strong. The group delivered a 14%
growth in headline earnings to R26.3 billion and ROE improved to 17.1% from 15.3% in 2016. The group's capital position
remained robust, with a common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.5%. Accordingly, a final dividend of 510 cents per share
has been declared, resulting in a total dividend of 910 cents per share, an increase of 17% on the prior year. 

Banking revenue growth remained subdued, credit impairment charges were broadly flat and costs were well managed to
deliver positive jaws of 1.0%. Banking activities headline earnings grew 10% to R24.3 billion and ROE improved to 18.0%
from 16.8% in 2016. Group headline earnings growth was boosted by an improved contribution from ICBC Standard Bank Plc
(ICBCS) and Liberty.

Although less marked than in the first half of the year, currency movements continued to adversely impact the group's
reported results, reducing group and banking headline earnings growth by four percentage points year on year. On a
constant currency basis, group headline earnings grew by 18%. Despite the dilution impact from a strengthening Rand, Africa
Regions still increased its contribution to banking headline earnings to 28% from 26% in 2016, and contributed positively
to group headline earnings per share growth and ROE. The top five contributors to Africa Regions' headline earnings
were Angola, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda.

Operating environment
Global macroeconomic conditions were positive during 2017, supporting increased trade volumes and underpinning global
growth of 3.7% for the year. A benign inflation environment and low wage growth across most advanced economies resulted
in slower than expected monetary policy tightening. Continued capital flows to emerging markets supported emerging
market funding costs and currencies.

Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa rebounded from 1.4% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, underpinned by improving commodity
prices and trade. Across many of our key countries inflation began to ease, stemming interest rate hikes and, in certain
countries, provided scope for rate cuts in the second half of the year. Although exchange rates largely stabilised in
the second half, many were weaker year on year against the strengthening Rand.

The recovery in the West Africa region was supported by higher oil prices and production volumes, together with higher
business and consumer confidence levels. Foreign currency liquidity constraints in Nigeria eased, following the
introduction of the NAFEX rate in the second quarter of the year.

East Africa started to emerge from the drought conditions. In Kenya specifically, higher food price inflation,
political uncertainty as a result of the disputed electoral process, and the impact of the regulatory caps and floors
introduced in September 2016, resulted in a slow-down in economic activity and credit growth.

The South & Central Africa region was supported by improved commodity prices, however those surrounding South Africa
continued to feel the effects of low South African demand. In Mozambique, some sectors of the economy improved during
2017, mainly on account of higher coal prices. Monetary policy tightening helped rebalance the foreign exchange market 
and resulted in the Metical appreciating in the second half of the year, but was 16% weaker on average against the Rand
compared to 2016. Inflation declined, despite a large increase in fuel prices.

Growth in South Africa remained weak at 1.3%, continuing its deviation from the global trend. During the year, consumer 
and business confidence remained low as a result of the poor macro environment and heightened political and policy
uncertainties. This was exacerbated by successive downgrades by the three credit rating agencies. As a consequence, demand
for credit remained lacklustre, moderating from the already subdued levels in 2016. Despite local sentiment, South Africa 
emerged from a technical recession in the second quarter and inflation re-entered the 3 - 6% target range, providing
scope for a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut in July. The Rand, although volatile, was on average stronger against
the major currencies, as well as those of our key countries in Africa Regions.

Revenue
Our banking activities achieved revenue growth of 3%. This growth rate was 9% in constant currency, which is a testament 
to our solid client franchises.

Net interest income (NII) increased 6%, assisted by margin expansion of 26 bps to 474 bps. Average interest earning
assets were flat on the prior year. The yield on the client lending book expanded mainly as a result of higher average
interest rates in Angola, Mozambique and Nigeria, partly offset by an increase in the yield on the client funding portfolio
in these countries. In South Africa, the combination of an improved yield on the mortgage lending portfolio and enhanced 
risk-based pricing of new loans in the personal unsecured and business lending portfolios also provided a benefit. A small 
positive endowment impact on capital and transactional balances in Africa Regions was achieved.

Non-interest revenue was flat on 2016, with the largest component, net fee and commission revenue, remaining at the
same level as the prior year. Trading revenue declined 2% and other revenue grew by 7%.

On a constant currency basis, net fee and commission revenue grew 7%. This was the result of healthy volume-based
increases in both card-based commissions and electronic banking fees as well as higher documentation and administration
fees. Our Africa Regions showed strong growth of 20%.

Trading revenue grew 8% in constant currency off the back of a strong performance in Africa Regions, which contributed
45% of the group's trading revenues. Fixed income and currencies (FIC) trading revenue grew 15% in constant currency,
with strong growth in fixed income driven by increased client activity. Foreign exchange trading was impacted by liquidity 
shortages and regulatory constraints in some key markets in Africa Regions. Equity trading revenue experienced lower trading 
volumes, and was negatively impacted by the elimination, in terms of IFRS, of gains on SBK shares held by the group to 
facilitate client trading activities, following a significantly higher SBK share price and long client positions.

Credit impairment charges
Credit impairment charges of R9.4 billion were 1% lower than the prior year, while gross average loans and advances
fell by 2%. This resulted in the group credit loss ratio remaining flat at 86 bps.

In Personal & Business Banking (PBB), impairment charges declined 3% year on year, mainly as a result of a lower
portfolio impairment charge. This was driven by a decline in early arrears from continued improvements in early stage
collections and payment methods. Impairment charges for vehicle and asset finance (VAF) and mortgage loans in South Africa
declined as the quality of the books continued to improve, with a concomitant decline in credit loss ratios for these
portfolios. Higher specific impairment charges were raised mainly against business lending, both in South Africa, following
the migration of a few larger exposures to NPLs, as well as in Africa Regions, driven predominantly by increased charges
in Nigeria, following an accelerated write-off of NPLs, and a single counterparty write-off in Malawi. Overall, coverage
levels were maintained.

Corporate & Investment Banking's (CIB) impairment charges rose 1% on the prior year. Combined with a flat gross
average customer loan book, the credit loss ratio to customers was 44 bps (2016: 44 bps). Specific impairment provision
adequacy increased from 56% in the prior year to 60%, to account for stress in the Power & Infrastructure and Oil & Gas
sectors in Kenya and Nigeria. A decline in portfolio impairments in Africa Regions from elevated levels recorded in the prior
year was largely offset by an increase in South Africa.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses grew 2% year on year, and in constant currency were up 8%. This reflects inflationary growth in
South Africa of 5%, while in Africa Regions, costs were up 18% in constant currency due to higher inflation and continued
investment. The cost-to-income ratio for the year was 55.7%, an improvement on the 56.3% in the prior year.

Staff costs were up 8% in constant currency. Following a year of disciplined focus on headcount, the overall staff
complement remained at a similar level to 2016, declining 1% in South Africa with a marginal increase in Africa Regions to
support business growth.

Other operating expenses grew 9% on a constant currency basis despite an 18% higher amortisation charge relating to IT
intangible assets. After many years of double digit growth, the total IT function spend was well contained, growing 5%
in Rand. A higher marketing cost was incurred, mainly for the ""What's your next"" and Shyft campaigns in South Africa.
The growth rate was assisted by the non-recurrence of an operational loss of R300 million in the prior year related to the
Japan fraud incident. 

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers grew by 1% year on year, of which PBB's advances to customers grew by 3% and
CIB's declined by 2%. 

Within PBB, mortgage lending grew 3%. New business disbursements of R42.4 billion were made in South Africa during the
year despite the number of registrations falling 14% compared to 2016. During the year, PBB continued to write the
largest proportion of new mortgage business in South Africa and maintained its leading market share at the end of 2017. 
VAF lending showed a modest 1% growth, as new business disbursements only slightly exceeded the run off in this book in
South Africa, while the book in Africa Regions contracted. Credit card balances rose 3% while other personal unsecured
lending fell by 2%. Business lending grew by 7%, with PBB Africa Regions showing good growth on a constant currency basis.
In CIB, term loans extended to clients to support their growth ambitions grew by a muted 2%, as new business was
offset by maturities and early repayments by clients. Loans granted under resale agreements, used primarily for liquidity
management purposes, declined as other high quality liquid assets increased to meet higher regulatory liquidity
requirements.

Funding and liquidity
The group's liquidity position remained strong and within approved risk appetite and tolerance limits. The group's
fourth quarter average Basel III LCR amounted to 135%, exceeding the minimum phased-in Basel III LCR requirement of 80%.
The group successfully achieved compliance with the minimum Basel III net stable funding ratio requirements with effect 
1 January 2018.

Despite the downgrades of the SA sovereign credit ratings during the year, the market cost of liquidity widened only
marginally. A number of key debt capital market and term loan funding transactions were executed, taking advantage of
pockets of relatively well-priced liquidity as investor appetite for capital markets' issuances remained robust. The group
successfully increased its longer term funding during 2017, raising R32.4 billion through a combination of senior debt
and syndicated loans. An additional R24.6 billion was raised through negotiable certificates of deposit with tenors in
excess of 12 months.

Deposits from customers grew 5% year on year. The group's most stable source of funding, retail deposits from PBB
customers, increased 6% in Rand and 9% in constant currency. The bank maintained its leading retail deposit market share in
South Africa, growing retail-priced deposits by 8%, and continued to grow its franchise in Africa Regions, where
retail-priced deposits grew 4% (15% in constant currency). The group's offshore operations in the Isle of Man and Jersey
continue to be an important source of USD and GBP funding, growing 4% in Rand and 6% on a constant currency basis. CIB's focus
on transactional banking clients assisted growth in current accounts and cash management deposits of 2% in Rand and 5%
in constant currency.

Capital management
The group maintained strong capital adequacy ratios, with a CET1 ratio of 13.5% (2016: 13.9%) and a total capital
adequacy ratio of 16.0% (2016: 16.6%). In line with the group's objective to optimise its capital stack, SBG successfully
executed two Basel III compliant Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bond issues in March and September 2017, raising R3.5 billion,
the proceeds of which have been invested in The Standard Bank of South Africa (SBSA).

In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the finalised Basel III reforms, which aim to
reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets and improve the comparability of banks' capital ratios. The
regulations will be implemented on 1 January 2022 with a transitional arrangement for phasing in the aggregate output floor
until 2027. Going forward we will plan and manage the business with the new requirements and deadlines in mind.
 
IFRS 9 became effective on 1 January 2018. The group will provide a transition report with its first quarter results
for 2018. The day one impact of implementing IFRS 9's expected credit loss impairment requirements, which comprise the
most material impact, is expected to reduce the group's CET 1 ratio by approximately 70 bps, which will be phased in over
three years. We expect an increase of approximately R8.7 billion in balance sheet impairments; an increase of 32% on IAS
39's balance sheet impairments (including interest in suspense).

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings of R14.0 billion were 10% higher than the prior year, driven by growth in pre-provision
operating profit and lower credit impairment charges as a result of improved collections strategies. An ROE of 20.0% was
achieved, an improvement on the 18.8% recorded in the prior year. 

PBB in South Africa delivered a strong performance with headline earnings of R13.2 billion up 11%. Total income grew
by 6%, supported by good volume-based increases in target customer segments. Operating expenses were 6% higher, despite
incurring an extra R289 million amortisation charge on strategic IT investments such as core banking, and increased
spending on marketing campaigns. PBB SA delivered positive jaws of 0.4%. Credit impairment charges declined by 4% leading 
to a lower credit loss ratio of 119 bps (2016: 129 bps). An improved performance in both secured and personal unsecured
lending (including card debtors) was partially offset by a higher impairment charge for business lending. Impairment
charges for mortgages were R355 million lower than the prior year. This was driven by an improvement across the mortgage
portfolio in South Africa, particularly in the older vintages. Within South Africa, mortgages written post 2008, which have 
a lower average credit loss ratio and better margin, now represent approximately 70% of the book (2016: 64%).

As our journey to digitise the group and deliver an always-on experience to customers continues to progress, PBB SA's
staff complement declined by 1%, while the total square meterage of the branch network declined by a further 3% to 375
000 square metres. This footprint has been reduced by more than 15% since 2010, without a material change in the number
of branches. PBB SA now has almost 2.2 million unique customers actively using digital channels as their preference, with
more of these choosing to use our mobile banking offering than internet banking. Mobile banking transactions processed
were 32% higher than in 2016. By contrast, teller and enquiry volumes in branches declined by 14% and 13% respectively.

Results from PBB Africa Regions and Wealth International were impacted by the strengthening Rand on average in 2017
compared to 2016. To reflect the underlying trends in these businesses, the commentary that follows refers to the constant
currency changes of PBB Africa Regions and Wealth International.

Headline earnings from PBB Africa Regions improved by 9% to R202 million. Customer loans expanded by 11%, mainly in
Kenya and Namibia, and deposits from customers grew by 15%, with particularly pleasing growth in Nigeria, Kenya and
Uganda. PBB Africa Regions' result was underpinned by customer acquisition in key markets, with a focus on delivering 
digital solutions. The number of active customers grew by more than 20% in Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia. 
Customers in PBB Africa Regions performed more than 27 million transactions on mobile banking, up from approximately 
10 million in 2016.

Net interest income grew by 9%, benefiting from balance growth, and the positive endowment impact of higher average
interest rates in Mozambique and Nigeria. Non-interest revenue grew by 13%, underpinned by higher transaction volumes 
and an increase in the account base. PBB Africa Regions comprises almost half of the Africa Regions legal entities' 
total income. The credit loss ratio increased to 253 bps from 228 bps in the prior year, driven predominantly by 
increased charges in Nigeria and Malawi. Excluding these, the credit loss ratio for PBB Africa Regions declined to 
152 bps.

Wealth International grew headline earnings by 32%, supported by growth in USD, GBP and EUR denominated client deposit
balances to GBP5.1 billion (2016: GBP4.8 billion) in our operations in the Isle of Man and Jersey during the year and
margin expansion following interest rate increases in the US and UK.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB's headline earnings of R11.5 billion were up 11% on the prior year, and 17% on a constant currency basis. Continued 
cost discipline and improvements in productivity and efficiency metrics resulted in positive jaws of 4.6%. The credit
loss ratio to customers of 44 bps was within CIB's target range of 40 to 60 bps. Higher headline earnings, together with
disciplined capital utilisation, delivered an ROE of 22.2%, an improvement from 19.5% in 2016.
 
Due to the impact of currency on CIB's results, the commentary that follows refers to the constant currency changes.
CIB delivered strong revenue growth of 13%, with sectoral, geographic and product diversity supporting the performance.
This reflects our focus on strengthening our capabilities and improving co-ordination to better serve our clients across
Africa. CIB recorded strong performances from multinational corporates and large domestic clients in the Financial
Institutions, Industrials, Telecoms & Media and Oil & Gas sectors. Revenues in the CIB SA franchise were up 4%. The West
Africa franchise delivered a resounding turn around, with revenues up by more than 30%. South & Central Africa continued 
to be a steady performer, delivering revenue growth of 13%. Following focused attention on East Africa, this region
delivered strong revenue growth of 14%.

Transactional Products and Services (TPS) was the outstanding performer, with headline earnings up 32%. TPS plays a
core role across the wider CIB franchise, being critical to the wholesale client franchise across the African continent.
Revenues grew by 18%, with NII well ahead of the prior year. Africa Regions delivered a strong performance, underpinned
by increased client activity, good deposit growth and supported by the positive endowment effect from higher interest
rates. Continued investment in key electronic platform capability resulted in a higher amortisation charge. Credit
impairment charges declined from elevated levels in the prior year.

Global Markets delivered a resilient performance, growing headline earnings by 13% to R4.6 billion. In South Africa,
foreign exchange and equities trading slowed, with equities impacted by the low market volatility experienced in most
global markets. Liquidity shortages and regulatory constraints negatively impacted trading activity in Africa Regions,
particularly in Angola and Mozambique. The introduction of the new, more flexible forex regime in Nigeria assisted forex
flows in the second half.

Investment Banking revenues were up 6%, reflecting fees earned on a number of landmark transactions and client activity 
in both debt and equity capital markets. Loans in the Investment Banking portfolio grew a subdued 4% on average and 2%
on year-end balances. Competition for high quality clients caused margin compression. As a result, NII remained at a
similar level to the prior year. Credit impairments increased as a result of a small number of impairments in stressed
sectors in the Africa Regions, as well as higher portfolio provisions following the downgrade of the South African
sovereign risk.

Central and other 
This segment includes costs associated with corporate functions, as well as the group's treasury and capital requirements, 
and central hedging activities. In 2017, the segment recorded a loss of R1 246 million, 24% higher than the prior year. 
The primary driver of the increased loss was the elimination, in terms of IFRS, of gains on SBK shares referred to
earlier.

Other banking interests
Other banking interests recorded headline earnings of R567 million, compared to a loss of R8 million in 2016.

The group's 40% stake in ICBCS contributed R152 million, a significant improvement on the R591 million loss recorded
in the prior year. The FIC and equities businesses delivered a strong result and higher commodity prices assisted the
commodities business. Of the R152 million contribution, approximately R100 million relates to a UK consortium tax relief
credit. Adjusted for this, ICBCS effectively broke even at an operational level in the second half of the year.

ICBC Argentina delivered growth in revenues on an improving macro-economic environment, particularly in the second
half, to report earnings after tax that were marginally lower than 2016. The headline earnings contribution from the
group's 20% stake in ICBC Argentina declined 29% to R415 million off a high base set in 2016. On a constant currency basis,
earnings were down 11%.

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group's 55.5% investment in Liberty, adjusted for
SBK shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders which are deemed to be treasury shares in the group's
consolidated accounts.

Liberty's normalised headline earnings for the year improved by 8% to R2.7 billion, supported by improving SA retail
insurance earnings and higher returns from investment markets. Liberty's capital position remains strong. Liberty's IFRS
headline earnings, after the adjustments for the impact of the BEE preference share income and the Liberty Two Degrees
listed Real Estate Investment Trust accounting mismatch, rose to R3.3 billion from R2.2 billion in the prior year.
Investors are referred to the full Liberty announcement dated 2 March 2018 for further detail.

Headline earnings attributable to the Standard Bank Group, adjusted by R369 million for the impact of the deemed
treasury shares, were R1.4 billion, 50% higher than in the prior year.

Prospects
The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised, with recent momentum in advanced economies
expected to continue. China's growth is expected to remain robust. Although upside inflationary pressures are emerging,
particularly in the US, monetary policies in the advanced economies are expected to maintain a moderate pace of tightening,
which should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets. From a 22-year low in 2016, growth in sub-Saharan Africa
is expected to accelerate to 3.3% in 2018, supported by a world-wide economic upswing, and slightly rising commodity
prices. In general, economic prospects across our network of countries are expected to improve, providing a favourable
backdrop for our business. 
 
We are also optimistic about the prospects in our home market of South Africa. We believe that the positive steps
taken already by the ruling party subsequent to its leadership conference will improve business and consumer confidence.
This positive sentiment, as well as pent-up demand, should begin to reflect in key economic indicators.

In the face of fast-growing competition from established banks and new competitors, we have a relentless focus on
three immediate priorities - to transform into a client-centred, digitally enabled, and integrated universal financial
services organisation.

We are in the final stages of our core banking journey and, by the end of the first quarter of 2018, 93% of our transactional 
accounts in South Africa will have been migrated onto our core banking platform. With this modernised platform in place, we 
will increasingly focus on front-end solutions and innovations, the benefit of which will be experienced directly by our 
customers. 

We support faster, more inclusive and more sustainable economic growth and human development in South Africa and throughout

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to dividends 
tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference shareholders that 
are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20% of the cash dividend, and this amount 
will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 408 cents per ordinary share, 
2.6 cents per first preference share and 319.136 cents per second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference 
shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of residence and the 
applicability of any double tax treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the day before declaration, is as follows:
- 1 619 268 169 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and its registration number is 1969/017128/06.

Services
The group entered into certain transitional service level arrangements with ICBCS in order to manage the 
orderly separation of ICBCS from the group post the sale of 60% of Standard Bank Plc (SB Plc) (now ICBCS). 
In terms of these arrangements, services are delivered to and received from ICBCS for the account of each 
respective party. As at 31 December 2017 the expense recognised by the group in respect of these arrangements 
amounted to R277 million (2016: R202 million).

Tax consortium relief
The UK's tax legislation creates UK tax groups that allow for consortium relief in terms of which UK tax losses
arising in one eligible consortium company are offset against UK tax profits arising in the same tax year in other 
eligible consortium companies. ICBCS, the group's UK subsidiary Standard Advisory London Limited (SALL) and ICBC's 
UK subsidiary ICBC (London) Plc are eligible companies of the same consortium group, and are therefore able to take 
advantage of the consortium relief rules. During 2015 and 2016, ICBCS made taxable losses, whilst SALL and ICBC 
(London) Plc made taxable profits. As such ICBCS, SALL and ICBC (London) Plc agreed to offset ICBCS's taxable 
losses against SALL and ICBC (London) Plc's taxable profits. During the year ICBCS recognised a tax credit of 
USD19.4 million for consortium relief, of which an amount of USD7.1 million was payable by SALL to ICBCS in 2018.

1 The group recognised losses in respect of certain commodity reverse repurchase agreements with third parties 
prior to 1 February 2015, being the date of conclusion of the sale and purchase agreement, relating to SB Plc 
(now ICBCS) with ICBC. As a consequence of the sale and purchase agreement, the group holds the right to recover 
from ICBC 60% of insurance and other recoveries, net of costs, relating to claims for those recognised losses 
prior to the date of conclusion of the transaction. Settlement of these amounts will occur based on audited 
information on pre-agreed anniversaries of the completion of the transaction and the full and final settlement 
of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 31 December 2017, a balance of USD50 million (R611 million) 
is receivable from ICBC in respect of this arrangement (2016: USD48 million; R656 million).

control (as defined by IFRS) over these mutual funds, it accounts for these mutual funds as subsidiaries. Where 
the group has assessed that it does not have control over these mutual funds, but has significant influence, it 
accounts for them as associates.

Offsetting and other similar arrangements
Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements
IFRS requires a financial asset and a financial liability to be offset and the net amount presented in the 
statement of financial position when, and only when, the group has a current legally enforceable right to 
set off recognised amounts, as well as the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously. There are no instances where the group has a current legally enforceable 
right to offset without the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.

The following table sets out the impact of offset, as well as the required disclosures of financial assets 
and financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, 
irrespective of whether they have been offset in accordance with IFRS. It should be noted that the information 
below is not intended to represent the group's actual credit exposure nor will it agree to that presented in 
the statement of financial position.

1 Gross amounts are disclosed for recognised financial assets and financial liabilities that are either offset in 
  the statement of financial position or are subject to a master netting arrangement or a similar agreement, 
  irrespective of whether the offsetting criteria is met.
2 Gross amounts of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities that qualify for offset in accordance with 
  the criteria per IFRS.
3 Related amounts not offset in the statement of financial position that are subject to a master netting arrangement 
  or similar agreement. This could include financial collateral (whether recognised or unrecognised) and cash 
  collateral.
4 In most cases, the group is allowed to sell or repledge collateral received.
5 The most material amounts offset in the statement of financial position pertain to cash management accounts. 
  The cash management accounts allow holding companies (or central treasury functions) to manage the cash flows 
  of a group by linking the current accounts of multiple legal entities within a group. It allows for cash balances 
  of the different legal entities to be offset against each other to arrive at a net balance for the whole group. 
  In addition, all repurchase agreements (for financial liabilities) and reverse repurchase agreements (for 
  financial assets), subject to master netting arrangement (or similar agreement), have been included.
6 In most instances, the counterparty may not sell or repledge collateral pledged by the group.

Other reportable items
Additional Tier 1 capital
During the year the group issued its debut Basel III compliant AT1 capital bond that qualifies as Tier 1 capital
amounting R3.5 billion nominal value. The proceeds of the bond issuance have been invested in SBSA on the same 
terms and conditions as those applicable to the AT1 notes issued by SBG. The capital notes are perpetual, 
non-cumulative with an issuer call option after a minimum period of five years and one day and on every 
coupon payment date thereafter. During 2017, coupons to the value of R229 million were paid to AT1 capital bond 
holders. Current tax of R64 million relating to the AT1 capital bonds was recognised directly in equity resulting 
in an aggregate net equity impact of R165 million.

The terms of the Basel III compliant AT1 capital bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the
write-off, in whole or in part, on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (the SARB) that a 
write-off without which the issuer would have become non-viable is necessary, or a decision to make a public 
sector injection of capital or equivalent support, without which the issuer would have become non-viable. 

The AT1 capital bonds have been recognised within other equity instruments in the statement of financial position.

Equity securities
During the year, 2 877 827 (2016: 2 646 456) ordinary shares were issued in terms of the group's equity 
compensation plans, notably the equity growth scheme (EGS) and group share incentive scheme (GSIS). Surplus 
capital was used to purchase 2 030 824 (2016: 2 477 472) ordinary shares to counteract the dilutive impact 
of the shares issued under the equity compensation plans. Effective from 2017, the group no longer issues 
EGS and GSIS awards. The last awards for the GSIS were issued in 2011 and for the EGS, the last award was 
made in 2016. Awards are now provided in terms of the group's other share schemes, notably the deferred 
bonus scheme and the share appreciation rights plan, both of which are settled by the group to employees 
with shares that the group purchases from the open market, and the cash-settled deferred bonus scheme, 
which is settled in cash. At the end of the year, the group would need to issue 6 159 744 (2016: 5 306 247) 
SBG ordinary shares to settle the outstanding GSIS options and EGS rights that were awarded to participants 
in previous years. The shares issued to date for the EGS and GSIS together with the expected number of shares 
to settle the outstanding options and rights as a percentage of the total number of shares in issue is 2.2% 
(2016: 2.0%).

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the year was 16 213 766 shares (2016: 16 086 916
shares). These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured entities (SEs) relating to 
the group's Tutuwa initiative (refer to the related party transaction note for more detail) since those SEs hold 
the voting rights on such shares and are accordingly not treasury shares as defined by the JSE Listings Requirements.

Foreign currency translation reserve
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the group's FCTR decreased by R4.9 billion (2016: decrease of R11.4 billion).
This decrease was partly attributable to the weakening of the US dollar (10%), Nigerian naira (21%), and Argentine 
peso (23%) against the South African rand which resulted in an FCTR loss of R1.2 billion, R1.0 billion and 
R0.5 billion respectively. 

IFRS 9 financial instruments (IFRS 9)
Background
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
(IAS 39) from 1 January 2018. 

IFRS 9 consists of the following key areas which represent changes from that of IAS 39:
- Revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and consequential changes in 
  the classification and measurement of financial liabilities, mainly relating to the recognition of changes in 
  fair value due to changes in own credit risk on fair value designated financial liabilities in OCI as opposed 
  to the income statement
- An expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model 
- Revised requirements and simplifications for hedge accounting

Comparative financial results and elections
The group has elected not to restate its comparative financial statements. Accordingly, the difference between 
the previous IAS 39 and new IFRS 9 carrying values will be recognised in the group's opening retained earnings 
as at 1 January 2018. 

The group's date of adoption of the IFRS 9 revised hedge accounting requirements will be based on further IFRS
developments with respect to the IASB's macro hedge accounting project or on the group deeming it opportune to 
adopt the revised requirements. The group has elected to continue with IAS 39's hedge accounting requirements, 
but will implement IFRS 9's revised hedge accounting disclosures.

Impact - qualitative assessment
The ECL impairment requirements, which comprise IFRS 9's most material impact for the group is expected to result 
in an increase of approximately R8.7 billion in balance sheet impairments; an increase of 32% on IAS 39 balance 
sheet impairments (including interest in suspense). Whilst IFRS 9's classification and measurement requirements 
are expected to have a negligible net impact on the group's reserves as at 1 January 2018, there were instances 
in which the measurement of certain financial assets and liabilities changed from amortised cost to fair value 
or vice versa due to the business model implementation within underlying business portfolios. 

The following table outlines the key drivers of the estimated impact:
IFRS 9 DRIVER                           REASON                                                                         
Minimum of a 12-month expected          The existing emergence period is between three to six months for PBB exposures 
credit loss for performing              and 12 months for CIB exposures. The change to a 12-month expected loss        
exposures                               requirement will result in an increase in impairments for PBB.                 
                                                                                                                       
Lifetime credit losses for              IFRS 9 requires a lifetime loss to be recognised for exposures for which       
exposures that exhibit a significant    there has been a significant increase in credit risk. This requirement will    
increase in credit risk                 affect both PBB and CIB.                                                               

ECL held for unutilised client          The IFRS 9 requirement for impairments for unutilised client facilities and      
exposures and guarantees                guarantees results in additional balance sheet impairments for both PBB and CIB.                            

Longer outlook period for               Measurement of ECL over a longer time horizon results in the potential for  
exposures that are expected             higher loss outcomes which has a greater impact for PBB than CIB.              
to default                                                                                                          

Forward looking economic                The inclusion of forward-looking economic information is expected to       
expectations for ECL                    increase the level of provisions as a result of the nature and timing of both 
                                        current and forecasted economic assumptions as at 1 January 2018.        

Tax implications
Within South Africa, National Treasury released a Taxation Laws Amendment Bill which contained requirements for the
deductibility of impairments in accordance with IFRS 9 being a 25% allowance for impairment provisions for all performing
exposures that have not demonstrated a significant increase in credit risk (stage 1), a 40% allowance for performing
exposures that have demonstrated a significant increase in credit risk (stage 2) and an 85% allowance for impairment
provisions for exposures that are in default (stage 3). The change in the timing of the deductibility of the impairments 
for tax purposes will result in a higher deferred tax asset balance which will have a negative impact on the group's 
capital ratios.

Capital implications
IFRS 9 (including the related tax consequences) will have consequential impacts on the group's regulatory capital
adequacy. The expected increase in impairment provisions, together with the increase in the group's deferred tax asset
carrying value and changes in the level of the threshold deduction for investments in financial entities, will reduce
qualifying CET1 capital. This reduction in qualifying CET1 capital will, however, be partially offset by the release 
of the existing deduction against qualifying CET1 for the excess of regulatory expected losses over the IAS 39 
impairments (R2.1 billion). IFRS 9's ECL requirements are expected to reduce the group's CET 1 ratio by 
approximately 70 bps and will be phased in over three years.

Project governance
The group structured its IFRS 9 implementation project in such a way as to effectively enable the delivery of 
the IFRS 9 requirements across the group. The IFRS 9 implementation project board provided strategic direction 
to the project, monitored the project's progress, and identified required interventions and project interdependencies 
with other group initiatives. In addition, an overall project steering committee and Africa Regions' country steering 
committees were established. In order to ensure appropriate oversight, the IFRS 9 project board reported on its 
activities, status and outcomes to the group audit committee.

Communication of transition impact
The group will, together with its Q1:2018 SENS announcement regarding the group's quarterly statement of changes in
equity, release a transition report which will outline the impact of the transition to IFRS 9 on the group's 
financial results.

Legal proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other
proceedings. Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. 
Nevertheless, based on management's knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting with legal counsel, 
management believes that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being 'likely to 
succeed and material' or 'unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. The group is also the defendant 
in some legal cases for which the group is fully indemnified by external third parties, none of which are 
individually material. Management is accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings currently pending against 
the group should not have a material adverse effect on the group's consolidated financial position and the 
directors are satisfied that the group has adequate insurance programmes and, where required in terms of IFRS 
for claims that are probable, provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed. 

Competition Commission - trading of foreign currency 
In April 2015, the South African Competition Commission announced that it had initiated a complaint against Standard
New York Securities Inc. (SNYS) and 21 other institutions concerning possible contravention of the Competition Act in
relation to USD/ZAR trading between 2007 and 2013. No mention was made of SBSA. On 15 February 2017 the Competition
Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal against 18 institutions, including one against SBSA 
and two against SNYS, in which it alleges unlawful collusion between those institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. 
The group only learned of the complaints at this time. The group has conducted its own internal investigations and 
found no evidence that supports the complaint. Both SBSA and SNYS have, together with 12 of the other respondents, 
applied for dismissal of the complaint referral on various legal grounds. These applications are due to be heard 
in July 2018. The group considers these allegations in an extremely serious light and remains committed to 
maintaining the highest levels of control and compliance with all relevant regulations. The allegations, 
against SBSA, are confined to USD/ZAR trading activities within SBSA and do not relate to the conduct of 
the group more broadly. 

Indemnities granted following disposal of Standard Bank Plc 
Under the terms of the disposal of SB Plc on 1 February 2015, the group provided ICBC with certain indemnities to be
paid in cash to ICBC or, at ICBC's direction, to any SB Plc (now ICBCS) group company, a sum equal to the amount of
losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising from certain circumstances. Where an indemnity payment is required to 
be made by the group to the ICBCS group, such payment would be grossed up from ICBC's shareholding at the time in 
ICBCS to 100%. These payments may, inter alia, arise as a result of an enforcement action, the cause of which 
occurred prior to the date of disposal. Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or governmental 
authorities to enforce the relevant laws in any jurisdiction. While there have been no material claims relating 
to these indemnification provisions during 2017, the indemnities provided are uncapped and of unlimited duration 
as they reflect that the pre-completion regulatory risks attaching to the disposed-of business remain with the 
group post completion. The indemnification provisions covered the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) that ICBCS 
entered into with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (SFO) (as more fully set out in the announcement made to 
shareholders via the JSE's SENS on 30 November 2015). In terms of the DPA, prosecution has been suspended and will 
be withdrawn after three years provided that ICBCS has complied with its obligations under the DPA. Any claims that 
may arise for SNYS with respect to the Competition Commission matter are also likely to fall within the scope of this 
indemnity as the alleged conduct, which is the subject of the referral, is alleged to have taken place prior to the 
disposal of SB Plc.

Subordinated debt
During the year, the group did not issue Basel III compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments (2016: issued 
R2.7 billion). However, on 7 February 2018 the group issued R3.0 billion Basel III compliant bonds that qualified 
as Tier 2 capital. The capital notes are perpetual, non-cumulative with an issuer call option after a minimum period 
of five years and one day, and on every coupon payment date thereafter. The payment dates are quarterly with the 
first call date being 13 February 2023.

R3.0 billion (2016: R3.2 billion) Basel III compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were redeemed during 
the year.

R0.3 billion (2016: Rnil) of Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were issued during the year 
and R0.2 billion was redeemed in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Basel III framework. 

The terms of the Basel III compliant Tier 2 capital bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the
write-off, in whole or in part, on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (the SARB) that a write-off 
without which the issuer would have become non-viable is necessary, or a decision to make a public sector injection 
of capital or equivalent support, without which the issuer would have become non-viable. 

During the year, the group issued R2.0 billion subordinated debt that qualifies as regulatory insurance capital and
R1.0 billion was redeemed.

Accounting policy elections and restatement
Adoption of new and amended standards effective for the current financial period
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except for the adoption of the
following amendments effective for the current period:
- Annual improvements 2014 - 2016 clarification to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
  (IFRS 12): amendment clarifies that an entity is not required to disclose summarised financial information 
  for a subsidiary, joint venture or associate when classified (or included in a disposal group that is classified) 
  as held for sale in terms of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS 5).

Early adoption of revised standards:
- Amendment to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (IFRS 2): the amendments
  eliminates diversity in practice in three main areas namely, (1) effects of vesting conditions on the measurement 
  of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction; (2) classification of a share-based payment transaction with net 
  settlement features for withholding tax obligations and (3) accounting where a modification to the terms and 
  conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled. 
- Annual improvements 2014 - 2016 clarification to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
  Standards (IFRS 1) and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28). The clarification to IAS 28 
  clarifies that an entity may make an election separately for each associate or joint venture, that is a venture 
  capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance 
  funds, at initial recognition to measure that associate or joint venture at either at fair value through profit 
  or loss in accordance with IAS 39 or the equity method in accordance with IAS 28.
- Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property (IAS 40): amendments clarify the requirements on transfers to, or from, 
  investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use. A change in use occurs when the property meets, 
  or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.

The above mentioned amendments to the IFRS standards, adopted on 1 January 2017, did not have any effect on the
group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and had no material impact on the group's accounting 
policies. 

Correction of prior period error
The group determined that certain intercompany derivative positions held between the group's banking activities and 
the group's investment management and life insurance activities were erroneously eliminated on a net basis as opposed 
to a gross basis. The group has restated its statement of financial position's previously reported financial 
information to incorporate the correct elimination of these intercompany derivative positions. The restatement 
did not impact the group's net exposure to derivatives, nor did it affect the group's reserves. The change to 
the group's statement of financial position is reflected in the table that follows:

Other information
Pro forma constant currency financial information

The pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results is the responsibility of the group's directors.
The pro forma constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates 
on the group's results and may not fairly present the group's results of operations. In determining the change in 
constant currency terms, the comparative financial year's results for the period ended 31 December 2016 have been 
adjusted for the difference between the current and prior period's average exchange rates (determined as the average 
of the daily exchange rates). The measurement has been performed for each of the group's material currencies. 

The pro forma constant currency financial information contained in this announcement has been reviewed by the 
group's external auditors and their unmodified reasonable assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE 3420 is 
available for inspection at the company's registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00.

The following average exchange rates were used in the determination of the pro forma constant currency information 
and were calculated using the average of the average monthly exchange rates (determined on the last day of each 
of the 12 months in the year).

CHANGE TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE: PERSONAL AND BUSINESS BANKING GROUP

After 10 very successful years leading the Standard Bank Group’s Personal and Business Bank (PBB),
Peter Schlebusch has decided to step down as Chief Executive: PBB Group. Peter will be taking a four-
month sabbatical starting in April, and we will announce his new role on his return from this well-
deserved break.

Subject to receiving the necessary approvals from the South African Reserve Bank, Zweli Manyathi has
been appointed to succeed Peter as Chief Executive: PBB Group.

Sim Tshabalala, Group Chief Executive, Standard Bank, says, ‘Peter put an enormous amount of time,
effort and energy into building the great business that PBB has become.

‘Peter has been equally dedicated and successful in leading the Group’s modernisation as it becomes
a digital financial services organisation. I am immensely grateful to Peter for his unwavering
commitment to the Standard Bank Group.’

‘We are fortunate that Peter has built a very strong team in PBB. We therefore had no reason to look
for his successor beyond the Group and Zweli Manyathi emerged as the best candidate to succeed
Peter as Chief Executive: PBB Group.’

Zweli Manyathi, 56, holds a B Com (Honours) in Financial Management and has attended the
Professional Development Programme (New York) and the Senior Executive Programmes of both Wits
Business School and Harvard Business School.

Zweli has had a 33-year career in the financial services industry to date, joining Standard Bank in 2009.
Until his appointment as Chief Executive: Personal and Business Banking, he served as Chief Executive,
PBB for Africa Regions (the Group’s Personal and Business Bank in Africa beyond South Africa). During
his tenure in this role, Zweli greatly strengthened our PBB client franchise and grew client revenues
substantially. As a member of PBB’s Executive Committee, the Group Management Committee and –
from now on – the Group Executive Committee, Zweli has been and remains central to the design and
execution of the Standard Bank Group’s strategy.

APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE: THE STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED


Standard Bank Group is pleased to announce the appointment of Lungisa Fuzile as Chief Executive of
The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (“SBSA”) with effect from 15 January 2018. Lungisa Fuzile
takes over from Sim Tshabalala who has served as Chief Executive of SBSA from June 2008 to date.

This appointment follows the recent changes to the Group’s executive structure, which resulted in the
disbanding of the joint group chief executive construct. The leadership of SBSA was a component of
Sim’s responsibilities when he served as the joint-group chief executive. This appointment removes
the dual role for Sim, which had become both unsustainable and inappropriate.

Lungisa Fuzile will be accountable to the board of SBSA, with a matrix reporting line to the Group Chief
Executive, Sim Tshabalala. Lungisa enjoyed a 20-year career in public service, culminating in his role
as Director-General at the National Treasury from May 2011 until May 2017.

The Group looks forward to welcoming Lungisa to Standard Bank.

Liquidity coverage ratio disclosure

In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the group and the bank on a quarterly
basis. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 1 month liquidity profile, by
ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment. The minimum regulatory requirement for 2017 is 80%
and will increase by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.

previous quarter ended 30 September 2017 for SBSA including SBSA Isle of Man branch,

based on the average of the month-end values at 31 July 2017, 31 August 2017 and 30

1   The decrease in the FCTR is primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar

Update on the group’s performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2017

The trends seen in the group’s banking activities in the three months to 30 September 2017 were similar to those
reported in the six months to 30 June 2017. Whilst revenues remained under pressure, good cost control
delivered better operational efficiency. Banking activities’ results were supported by a continued benign credit
performance. The relative rand strength continued to dampen reported earnings. Other banking interests
contributed positively to the group’s performance and earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders grew 16%
period-on-period. During the period the headline earnings adjustable items were not significant and as a result
the group’s headline earnings growth was in line with the growth in earnings attributable to Standard Bank Group
ordinary shareholders.

The group’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio remained in excess of our internal target range of 11.0% – 12.5%.
The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 30 September 2017 will be released in November 2017.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

STANDARD BANK ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ROLE CHANGES

Following a carefully planned management succession process Standard Bank Group
announces changes to its current joint-group chief executive structure. The board is satisfied
that the structure, which was necessary in 2013, has met and in many respects exceeded
expectations. Accordingly, Ben Kruger steps down from the role of joint-group chief executive
with immediate effect. He remains an executive director of the company, reporting to the group
chief executive.

Sim Tshabalala continues in the role of group chief executive of Standard Bank Group and
chief executive of The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited.

“The board expresses appreciation to both Ben and Sim, who have successfully led the
process of refreshing the group’s strategy and managed complex challenges which faced the
group in several jurisdictions, while delivering respectable returns to our shareholders. The
resounding success of the joint-group chief executive structure is testament to the group’s
culture and values which include working in teams, respecting each other and upholding the
highest levels of integrity. Good momentum has been achieved in the implementation of the
group’s refreshed strategy,” said Group Chairman Thulani Gcabashe.

The board appreciates Ben’s selfless leadership and is pleased that he remains part of the
leadership team going forward.

Ben’s new role will include: Contributing to the governance of the group as a member of the
group board; contributing to the leadership, management and governance of Africa Regions;
guiding the continued digitisation of the group; deepening and broadening the group’s
relationship with its strategic partner ICBC; helping with the management of the Group’s risks;
and maintaining and building key client relationships.

Overview of financial results 
Group results
Standard Bank Group’s (SBG or the group) results for the period ended 30 June 2017 were robust, underpinned by our
universal client offering, geographic diversity and increasingly digital capabilities. Headline earnings per share 
(HEPS) grew by 11% to 756 cents supporting an interim dividend per share of 400 cents, up 18% period on period. 
Group credit impairments and operating costs were well managed, resulting in an overall decline in the credit loss 
ratio from 105bps to 96bps and positive jaws of 1.0%. Group return on equity (ROE) improved from 14.4% to 16.1%. 
As at 30 June 2017, the group’s capital position remained strong with a common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.7% 
(1H16: 13.2%). 

Currency movements adversely impacted the group’s reported results, reducing group headline earnings by 7% period on
period. On a constant currency (CCY) basis, group headline earnings grew by 19%, supported by Africa Regions which grew
by 46%. Despite the dilution impact from ZAR strength, Africa Regions still increased its contribution to banking
headline earnings to 29% and contributed positively to group HEPS growth and ROE. The top five contributors to Africa 
Regions’ headline earnings were Angola, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda, which together represent c.60% of the Africa
Regions’ headline earnings. Against a backdrop of adverse macro-economic developments, policy uncertainty and rating agency
downgrades The Standard Bank of South Africa’s (SBSA) asset and income growth were constrained. Despite these headwinds,
SBSA demonstrated its resilience and grew its headline earnings 18% on the back of good cost management and muted credit
impairment charges.

Operating environment
In 1H17, global growth prospects firmed, supported by post-election optimism in the US and better than expected growth
in Europe and China. More specifically, China grew 6.9% in 2Q17, matching the robust momentum seen in 1Q17. Despite
better momentum, the stubbornly low inflation levels in key developed markets and slower than expected rate hikes provided
support to emerging market (EM) flows. EM markets, including South Africa, have benefited from the EM risk-on trade,
providing broad support to funding costs and currencies. This is best illustrated by the fact that despite entering a
technical recession in 1Q17 and being downgraded by three rating agencies during the period, SA funding costs remained
broadly flat and the ZAR strengthened on average against the major currencies period on period. The ZAR also appreciated
relative to all our key African Regions’ currencies over the same period; most notably the NGN, GHS and MZN. 

The challenges facing South Africa, namely low growth, high unemployment and high levels of inequality, are well
ventilated. During the period, despite business confidence levels remaining low overall, certain parts of the economy did
grow. The moderate recovery in commodity prices provided some support to miners. As the drought abated in certain parts of
the country, it provided much needed respite to parts of the agricultural sector. Consumers had an opportunity to catch
their breath as rates remained flat and inflation trended downwards. Inflation re-entered the South African Reserve
Bank’s (SARB) 3% - 6% target range in April and remained in the range for the rest of the period. Underlying credit growth
remained lacklustre, supported by low single digit real corporate growth whilst household credit continued to contract,
albeit at a slower rate. 

Across the 19 African countries in which we operate outside of South Africa, the dynamics continue to be diverse. In
the oil-export reliant countries on the west coast, such as Nigeria and Angola, prospects improved as oil recovered from
lows in 1H16. In contrast, foreign currency liquidity constraints continued for most of the period, depressing market
activity. East Africa suffered the effects of a drought. In Kenya specifically, the combination of the drought, the
effects of the regulatory caps and floors introduced in September 2016 and pre-election anxiety resulted in a slowdown in
credit growth. Mozambique’s currency, although weaker than in 1H16, stabilised in 1H17. 

The combination of higher rates, higher cash balances on the back of foreign currency liquidity constraints, flight to
quality and improved macros provided support for the Africa Regions’ performance. 

Revenue
Total income declined by 1% period on period to R49 336 million, driven primarily by weaker non-interest revenue 
(NIR) which decreased 7%. Net interest income (NII) increased 4% underpinned by net interest margin (NIM) expansion. 
NIM expanded 22bps to 394bps driven by higher average rates, loan pricing and funding margin. Total income grew by 
8% in CCY, supported by 11% growth in NII and 4% growth in NIR. 

NIR was impacted negatively by trading revenue which declined 19% in ZAR and 8% in CCY. Relatively lower volatility in
SA and in various Africa Regions’ markets reduced the opportunity to generate revenue. Despite recording strong growth
in Africa Regions (up 23% in CCY) and 4% growth in SBSA, group net fee and commission income declined 2% period on
period due to currency headwinds. Other revenue was broadly flat. 

Credit impairment charges
Declines in early arrears and non-performing loans (NPL) underpinned the decline in credit impairment charges period
on period, while coverage levels remained broadly flat overall. The credit loss ratio decreased marginally from 105bps to
96bps. In Personal & Business Banking (PBB), declines in early arrears, and portfolio provisions, were driven by continued 
improvements in collections, including early interventions. PBB’s specific impairment charges increased across card,
personal unsecured and business lending. Business lending charges increased following the migration of a few larger
exposures to NPLs in the period. Improvements in mortgages, as poorer vintages continue to roll-off, and vehicle and asset
finance (VAF), as the quality of the book improved, resulted in declines in the credit loss ratios for those portfolios.
Corporate & Investment Banking’s (CIB) impairment charges declined from elevated levels in the prior period, in particular, 
Africa Regions’ portfolio impairments. CIB SA’s portfolio impairment charges increased period on period. Coverage ratios 
increased across card debtors, personal unsecured and business lending as well as CIB portfolios in the current period. 

Operating expenses
Operating expenses declined 2% period on period driven by tight control on headcount, focus on discretionary spend and
favourable currency tailwinds. On a CCY basis, operating costs grew by 7%. Despite the challenging revenue environment,
the group managed to deliver positive jaws, in ZAR and CCY, in line with our strategic focus to reduce the
cost-to-income ratio. The cost-to-income ratio declined from 56.8% to 56.3%. 

In 1H16 the group recorded an operational loss of R300 million related to a fraud incident in Japan which did not
recur in 1H17. IT function spend decreased 3% in ZAR, as the R261 million increase in IT amortisation charge was more 
than offset by decreases in other IT spend. Certain USD licensing and maintenance costs were also lower once translated 
into ZAR.

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers grew 1% period on period, supported by PBB which grew by 3% to R598 billion
while CIB declined by 3% to R359 billion. On a CCY basis, Africa Regions’ PBB grew 7% and CIB declined 5%. As at 
30 June 2017, Africa Regions represented c.9% of the PBB portfolio and c.12% of the CIB portfolio. Although the PBB 
SA portfolio recorded low single digit growth overall, business lending grew 15% period on period in line with our 
strategic focus to grow in this business. On average, mortgage and VAF disbursements in SA amounted to more than 
R5.7 billion a month. CIB loans recorded a decline of 3% in ZAR and 1% in CCY basis, as trends seen in 2H16 
continued into 1H17. 

Capital, funding and liquidity
The group remains well capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 13.7% (1H16: 13.2%) and a total capital adequacy ratio of
16.2% (1H16: 15.9%). The group’s capital position remains strong and in excess of the group’s target ranges. In line 
with the group’s objective to optimise its capital stack, SBG successfully executed its inaugural Basel III compliant
Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bond issue in March 2017, raising R1.7 billion. The group will issue further AT1 subject to 
pricing and market conditions. The group continues to monitor a number of developments locally and internationally 
which could negatively impact the group’s capital ratios, most pertinent of which are IFRS 9 and the finalisation 
of the Basel III reforms. The IFRS 9 impact will be moderated by the removal of the capital deduction relating to 
the existing shortfall of credit provisions to expected losses, which amounted to R2.0 billion as at 30 June 2017. 

Deposits and current accounts from customers increased 4% period on period, and 8% in CCY. Retail-priced deposits
increased 6% in ZAR and 12% in CCY. The group remains focused on sourcing stable deposits from a diverse range of 
sources. The group’s established, on-the-ground franchises across our African footprint provide locally sourced 
deposits complemented by the USD and GBP funding raised through the group’s offshore operations in Isle of Man 
and Jersey. 

During the period, the group’s liquidity position remained strong and within approved risk appetite and tolerance
limits. Market cost of liquidity widened marginally during the period. As at 30 June 2017 the group’s quarterly average
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) amounted to 116%, exceeding the minimum phased-in Basel III LCR requirement of 80%.
The group is appropriately positioned to meet the minimum Basel III net stable funding ratio requirements on 1 January
2018.

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB’s headline earnings grew 11% to R6.1 billion and ROE improved from 16.5% to 17.7%. On a CCY basis, headline
earnings grew 15%. Credit impairments were flat on the back of improved collection strategies. PBB headcount 
declined 1% driven by PBB SA. PBB continues to grow the client base in its target segments, namely prestige 
and private banking as well as business banking. 

PBB SA’s earnings grew by 13% to R5.7 billion. Total income grew 6% supported by target customer growth and product
yield. Operating expenses grew 5%, delivering positive jaws. In line with our clear focus on client experience, staff are
being re-skilled, branch formats revised and rationalised and digital capabilities enhanced. Headcount, branch numbers
as well as branch size, all recorded declines in the period. Credit impairments declined 6% period on period. Ongoing
improvements in the mortgage and VAF performance were partially offset by a reduction in post write-off recoveries and a
deterioration in card and business lending. Wealth recorded an improvement in the product mix and pricing in the brokerage
and underwriting business as well as good asset growth. Wealth income was impacted by losses associated with the storm
and fire events in the Western Cape.

Results outside SA were impacted by relative currency depreciation. To better reflect the underlying trends, the
commentary below refers to movements in the PBB Africa Regions and PBB International businesses on a constant currency 
basis, unless indicated otherwise. 

PBB Africa Regions continues to gain momentum. Customer loans and deposits grew by 7% and 12% respectively, supporting
income growth of 11%. This growth was underpinned by a combination of an expanding active customer base in targeted
countries and an increasing adoption of digital banking. Active PBB customers increased by more than 10% in each of the
following countries: Kenya, Nigeria, Botswana, Mozambique and Tanzania. NII was supported by positive endowment in Nigeria
and Mozambique on cash management, savings and investment portfolios. Regulatory changes in Swaziland, Zimbabwe and
Malawi impacted fees. In 1H17 the credit loss ratio increased by c.44bps to 264bps, driven predominantly by increased
charges in Nigeria following an accelerated write-off of NPLs. Measured in ZAR, PBB Africa Regions earnings were 
materially impacted by the depreciation of the NGN period on period. 

PBB International’s headline earnings grew 41% supported by an 18% increase in the deposit base in GBP, margin
expansion and growth in the trust business. 

Collaboration with Liberty has been enhanced, with a focus on improving alignment of product development and sales
initiatives. Opportunities to better leverage the respective customer bases both in SA and in Africa Regions continue 
to be pursued.

Digital adoption continued to gain traction. PBB SA recorded close on 500 million mobile transactions, up 55% relative
to the prior period while ATM and teller volumes were down 5% and 15% respectively. Africa Regions recorded 100 million
digital transactions, up 47% period on period.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB’s headline earnings grew 10% to R5.3 billion and ROE improved from 17.8% to 21.4%. On a CCY basis, headline
earnings grew 19% supported by strong revenue growth, better credit performance and tight management of costs. 
CIB recorded targeted asset growth in the Consumer, Financial Institutions and Real Estate sectors. Due to the 
impact of currency, all growth percentages reported hereafter are on a CCY basis. 

NII grew 18% supported by higher customer deposits, an improved mix towards current accounts as well as positive
endowment. Fees increased 18% following improvements in client activity across the debt and equity capital markets 
business. Trading revenue declined by 5% due to a combination of compressed margins and lower volumes as a result of 
low market volatility. Total income grew 10% to R17.4 billion underpinned by CIB’s diversified and sustainable 
franchise, reflecting the successful deepening of client relationships. Tightly managed headcount and discretionary 
spend assisted in containing  cost growth. Operating costs increased 3%, delivering positive jaws of 7% and a lower 
cost-to-income ratio of 52.2%. 

The credit loss ratio to customers declined from 71bps in the prior period to 45bps, as prior period impairments on
specific names in SA, Nigeria and Ghana were not repeated. 

Global markets headline earnings declined 6% to R2.0 billion. Income growth was subdued at 2% due to lower client
activity and reduced market volatility across various countries, including SA. Liquidity shortages and regulatory
constraints impacted trading revenues in Nigeria, Mozambique and Uganda.

Transactional products and services headline earnings grew 67% to R1.9 billion. Total income was 20% higher than the
prior period due to continued good deposit growth and positive endowment underpinned by new clients gained. Impairment
charges declined from elevated levels in the prior year. Costs were well contained.

Investment banking headline earnings increased 18% to R1.4 billion. Total income increased 10%, mainly as a result of
strong fee and commission income growth from certain landmark deals concluded in the period. Despite a subdued macro
environment, loans and advances grew, supporting NII growth. The quality of the book improved, which was reflected in 
lower margins and NII growth. Impairment charges declined and cost discipline delivered positive jaws for the period.

Central and other 
This segment includes costs associated with corporate activities and servicing the group capital requirements, namely
the preference shares. The net headline loss for the period was broadly in line with the prior period. 

Other banking interests
Headline earnings from other banking interests increased from R2 million in 1H16 to R212 million in 1H17. The headline
earnings contribution from the group’s 40% stake in ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) amounted to R48 million, a significant 
improvement on the R356 million loss recorded in the prior period. The headline earnings contribution from the group’s 
20% stake in ICBC Argentina declined 54% from R358 million to R164 million on the back of lower trading revenue, a weaker 
macro-economic environment in Argentina, higher impairments and a weaker Argentinian Peso. 

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group’s 56% investment in Liberty, adjusted for the
group’s shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders and treated as treasury shares in the group’s
consolidated accounts. Liberty’s normalised headline earnings for the period decreased 30% to R1.3 billion, driven, in
particular, by continued pressure in new business margins affecting Individual Arrangements and the performance of
STANLIB. Liberty’s IFRS headline earnings, post the impact of BEE preference shares and the Liberty Two Degrees listed 
Real Estate Investment Trust accounting mismatch, was 15% lower at R1.5 billion. Shareholders are referred to the full 
Liberty announcement dated 4 August 2017 for further detail. The impact of Liberty’s deemed treasury shares period on 
period amounted to R139 million. Liberty’s IFRS headline earnings attributable to the group, adjusted for the impact 
of Liberty’s deemed treasury shares, was R882 million, down slightly from the R886 million recorded in the prior period.

Prospects
Looking ahead, stronger global growth and firmer commodity prices should provide some support in 2H17. In July, the
IMF reaffirmed its outlook for global growth of 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. Global trade is expected to grow faster.
The EM trajectory is also favourable underpinned by supportive policy in China as well as broader infrastructure spend in
Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, the macro environment is expected to continue to improve and interest rates to trend down
as inflation moderates. The IMF expects sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP growth to recover in 2017 and 2018, from a low of 1.3%
in 2016 to 2.7% and 3.5% respectively. More specifically, the GDP growth across our Africa Regions franchises is expected
to accelerate to 3.3% in West, 3.9% in South and Central and 5.9% in East in 2018. Nigeria’s economy is expected to
recover from a 1.6% contraction in 2016 to positive growth of 0.8% in 2017 and accelerate to 1.9% in 2018. In terms of
South Africa’s outlook, the expectations of a recovery in 2017 have moderated and the current SARB forecast is for 0.5%
growth for the year. The threat of further rating agency downgrades remains. Declining interest rates, in SA and in some 
of the countries in our Africa Regions, will be a headwind in 2H17.

In the period, we have successfully embedded the five value drivers of client focus, employee engagement, risk and
conduct, financial outcomes and social, economic and environmental (SEE) impact in the businesses. They underpin our
decisions and drive the group’s shared value outcomes.

Across our CIB franchise, we remain committed to partnering our clients on their growth journeys and delivering
exceptional client experiences. We bank clients, not economies, and will continue to seek out pockets of growth. In August
2017, we opened our doors in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the biggest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, providing our clients with on-the-ground CIB capabilities
and access to the broader WAEMU region. In Africa Regions, we continue to develop our PBB franchises in a consciously
systematic manner; banking the employees, suppliers and customers of our corporate clients. Our strategy of banking the
ecosystems surrounding our clients continues to gain traction. 

We will continue to invest in our digital capabilities and the re-skilling of our employees, with the primary
objective of improving the client experience. We recognise that we are not where we want to be in terms of customer 
satisfaction and are making changes to ensure that we improve this going forward. Our core banking replacement journey 
in SA and Africa Regions remains on track to close by the end of the year. Although it has been a long and costly exercise, 
we remain of the opinion that it provides us with the resilient platform required to compete in a digital world. Our 
innovation initiatives extend across analytics, robotics, cyber security and blockchain. We will continue to seek 
opportunities to successfully collaborate with FinTechs and support relevant IT skills development initiatives.

In a complex business environment, we rely on the people across our network to navigate the challenges each business
faces and make appropriate decisions in line with strategic priorities. Doing the right business the right way remains a
priority. We take swift action against those who are proved to be at odds with this. Regulatory change, both locally and
internationally, has continued apace and appears unlikely to slow. We continue to engage with policymakers and regulators 
across our footprint to broker appropriately balanced outcomes. In South Africa specifically, we will continue to actively 
engage in the debates around the banking sector’s role in promoting transformation and inclusive growth, and on
specific issues such as the importance of the SARB’s mandate and independence.

As underpinned by our purpose of driving Africa’s growth, our view is that a financial institution’s role in society
is broader than providing superior returns to shareholders. In terms of our SEE impact, we have a responsibility to
facilitate growth in the markets in which we operate, improve financial literacy and access, and develop local markets 
in a responsible and sustainable way. 

We remain committed to our medium term targets of delivering through-the-cycle HEPS growth and ROE within our target
range of 15% - 18%. We are focused on the levers available to deliver on our targets, including positive jaws, efficient
capital management and improving returns from PBB Africa Regions.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to
dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference 
shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20% of the cash 
dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount 
of 320 cents per ordinary share, 2,6 cents per first preference share and 320,744 cents per second preference share. 
Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 20% depending 
on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country 
of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 211 936 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

transaction and the full and final settlement of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 30 June 2017, a balance 
of USD48 million (R629 million) (FY16: USD48 million; R656 million) is receivable from ICBC in respect of this arrangement.

Offsetting and other similar arrangements
Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements
IFRS requires a financial asset and a financial liability to be offset and the net amount presented in the 
statement of financial position when, and only when, the group has a current legally enforceable right to set 
off recognised amounts, as well as the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. There are no instances where the group has a current legally enforceable right 
to offset without the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.

The following table sets out the impact of offset, as well as the required disclosures of financial assets and
financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, 
irrespective of whether they have been offset in accordance with IFRS. It should be noted that the information 
below is not intended to represent the group's actual credit exposure nor will it agree to that presented in 
the statement of financial position.

1 Gross amounts are disclosed for recognised financial assets and financial liabilities that are either offset in the statement 
  of financial position or are subject to a master netting arrangement or a similar agreement, irrespective of whether the 
  offsetting criteria is met.                                                                                                               
2 Gross amounts of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities that qualify for offset in accordance with the criteria 
  per IFRS.
3 Related amounts not offset in the statement of financial position that are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar 
  agreement, including financial collateral (whether recognised or unrecognised) and cash collateral.                   
4 In most cases the group is allowed to sell or repledge collateral received.                                                  
5 The most material amounts offset in the statement of financial position pertain to cash management accounts. The cash management 
  accounts allow holding companies (or central treasury functions) to manage the cash flows of a group by linking the current 
  accounts of multiple legal entities within a group of companies. It allows for cash balances of the different legal entities 
  to be offset against each other to arrive at a net balance for the whole group. In addition, it should be noted that all 
  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, subject to a master netting arrangement (or similar agreement), 
  have been included.                                                                                                               
6 In most instances, the counterparty may not sell or repledge collateral pledged by the group.

but that are subject to either a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

Other reportable items 
Equity securities
During the period, the group allotted 1 239 731 shares (FY16: 2 646 456 shares) in terms of the group's share
incentive schemes and repurchased 1 448 961 shares (FY16: 2 477 472 shares).

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the period was 9 713 295 shares (FY16: 16 086 916
shares). These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured entities (SEs) relating to the
group's Tutuwa initiative (refer to the related party transaction note for more detail) since those SEs hold the voting
rights on such shares and are accordingly not treasury shares as defined by the JSE Listings Requirements.

Foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR)
During the six months ended 30 June 2017 the group's share of FCTR decreased by R1.9 billion (1H16: decrease of 
R7.1 billion). This decrease was partly attributable to the weakening of the Nigerian naira (22%), US dollar (4%), 
and Kenyan shilling (5%) against the South African rand which resulted in an FCTR loss of R833 million, R540 million 
and R220 million respectively.

Included in the FCTR loss of R833 million for the period relating to the Nigerian naira was a loss of R698 million as
a result of the establishment of the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Fixing (NAFEX) by the Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) in April 2017. The CBN introduced the NAFEX to improve foreign exchange liquidity.

IFRS 9 financial instruments (IFRS 9)
Background
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39), the existing standard dealing with the accounting
treatment for financial instruments will be replaced by IFRS 9 for the group's 2018 financial year. The following areas
represent the major changes from that of IAS 39:
- Revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and consequential changes in the
  classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
- Recognition of changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk on fair value designated financial
  liabilities in OCI as opposed to the income statement.
- Revised requirements and simplifications for hedge accounting.
- An expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model.

Comparative financial results and elections
The group has elected not to restate comparative financial results in line with the IFRS 9 transitional requirements.
The difference between the previous (IAS 39) and new (IFRS 9) carrying values (including any tax impact) will be
recognised in the group's opening retained earnings on 1 January 2018. 

The group's date of adoption of the IFRS 9 revised hedge accounting requirements will be based on further IFRS
developments with respect to the IASB's macro hedge accounting project or on the group deeming it opportune to 
adopt the revised requirements. In the interim the group will continue to utilise the accounting policy choice 
to continue hedge accounting in terms of IAS 39.

Parallel run
From January 2017, the group commenced a process by which the group's IFRS 9 results are computed alongside that 
of the existing IAS 39 financial results (referred to as the group's parallel run). This parallel run aims to:
- Provide results that will be utilised to finalise and, where applicable, update impairment methodologies.
- Refine and approve the ECL impairment and business models for the classification and measurement of financial
  assets. 
- Assist in the audit of the group's transition to IFRS 9. 

Impact - qualitative assessment
The impact of the IFRS 9 revised classification and measurement requirements for financial assets is not expected 
to be material. This conclusion is however dependent on the nature of and carrying value of financial assets in 
place on 1 January 2018.  

The IFRS 9 ECL impairment model requirements are expected to increase the level of balance sheet impairments that 
are currently held in terms of IAS 39. The impact of the IFRS 9 ECL requirements can only be reliably determined 
on the date of transition to IFRS 9. This impact is primarily dependent on the finalisation of the group's impairment
methodologies, conclusion of audit procedures by the group's external auditors as well as the credit quality and 
extent of the group's exposures and determination of forward-looking economic expectations at that date. 

The following table summarises IFRS 9's key drivers as compared to that of IAS 39:

IFRS 9 driver                             Reason                                                                        
Stage one                                 PBB's existing emergence period is between three to six months and for CIB                
(12-month                                 is 12 months. The change to a 12 month expected loss requirement is expected

Stage two                                 IFRS 9 will require a lifetime loss to be recognised for items for which     
(lifetime expected loss                   there has been a deterioration in credit risk. It is expected that this

Off-balance sheet exposures               The IFRS 9 requirement for impairments for off-balance sheet facilities  
                                          results in the requirement for additional balance sheet impairments for  
                                          both PBB and CIB.                                                   
Forward-looking information               The inclusion of forward-looking economic information is expected to 
                                          increase the transition adjustment on adoption of IFRS 9, but will depend 
                                          on the economic outlook at that date.                            

Tax implications
Within South Africa, National Treasury recently released the draft Taxation Laws Amendment Bill which contained
requirements for the deductibility of impairments in accordance with IFRS 9. National Treasury has proposed an 85% 
allowance for impairment provisions for defaulted exposures and a 25% allowance for impairment provisions for all 
other exposures. It is expected that this legislation will result in an increase in the deferred tax asset carrying 
value for the group and a consequential further deduction of both CET1 and Tier 1 capital for the group. 

Capital implications
IFRS 9 (including the related tax consequences) will affect the group's regulatory capital requirements. The expected
increase in impairment provisions, along with the increase in the group's deferred tax asset carrying value, will 
reduce CET1 capital. This reduction in CET1 capital will, however, be partially reduced by the release of the existing 
CET1 deduction for the excess of regulatory expected losses over IFRS impairments (currently cR2 billion). The Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has provided country regulators with national discretion to consider 
transitional phase-in provisions for the capital impact of IFRS 9. The SARB is considering the BCBS's proposals for 
possible adoption in South Africa.

Communication of transition impact
The group will, together with our 1Q18 SENS announcement regarding the group's statement of changes in equity, release
a transitional report which will outline the impact of the transition to IFRS 9 on the group's financial results.

Legal proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other
proceedings. Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. 
Nevertheless, based on management's knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting with legal counsel, 
management believes that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being 'likely to 
succeed and material' or 'unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. The group is also the defendant in 
some legal cases for which the group is fully indemnified by external third parties, none of which are individually 
material. Management is accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings currently pending against the group should 
not have a material adverse effect on the group's consolidated financial position and the directors are satisfied 
that the group has adequate insurance programmes and, where required in terms of IFRS for claims that are probable, 
provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed.

Competition Commission - trading of foreign currency 
In April 2015, the South African Competition Commission announced that it had initiated a complaint against Standard
New York Securities Inc. (SNYS) and 21 other institutions concerning possible contravention of the Competition Act in
relation to USD/ZAR trading between 2007 and 2013. No mention was made of SBSA. On 15 February 2017 the Competition
Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal against 18 institutions, including one against SBSA and 
two against SNYS, in which it alleges unlawful collusion between those institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. The group 
only learned of the complaints at this time. SBSA has made an application to the Competition Tribunal for an order directing
the Competition Commission to deliver a copy of the documents and other evidence that it relied upon when deciding to
refer its complaint to the Tribunal, the application being necessary due to the Competition Commission's failure to comply
with the applicable rules in this regard. Both SBSA and SNYS have, together with 12 of the other respondents, applied
for dismissal of the complaint referral on various legal grounds. A date for the hearing of those applications has yet to
be set. The group considers these allegations in an extremely serious light and remains committed to maintaining the
highest levels of control and compliance with all relevant regulations. The allegations, against SBSA, are confined to
USD/ZAR trading activities within SBSA and do not relate to the conduct of the group more broadly. 

Indemnities granted following disposal of SB Plc 
Under the terms of the disposal of SB Plc on 1 February 2015, the group provided ICBC with certain indemnities to be
paid in cash to ICBC or, at ICBC's direction, to any SB Plc (now ICBCS) group company, a sum equal to the amount of
losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising from certain circumstances. Where an indemnity payment is required to be made 
by the group to the ICBCS group, such payment would be grossed up from ICBC's shareholding at the time in ICBCS to 100%.
These payments may, inter alia, arise as a result of an enforcement action, the cause of which occurred prior to the date
of disposal. Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or governmental authorities to enforce the relevant
laws in any jurisdiction. While there have been no material claims relating to these indemnification provisions during
2017, the indemnities provided are uncapped and of unlimited duration as they reflect that the pre-completion regulatory
risks attaching to the disposed-of business remain with the group post completion. The indemnification provisions
covered the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) that ICBCS entered into with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (SFO)
(as more fully set out in the announcement made to shareholders via the JSE's SENS on 30 November 2015). In terms of the
DPA, prosecution has been suspended and will be withdrawn after three years provided that ICBCS has complied with its
obligations under the DPA. Any claims that may arise for SNYS with respect to the Competition Commission matter are also
likely to fall within the scope of this indemnity as the conduct, which is the subject of the referral, pre-dates SB
Plc's acquisition of SNYS as part of the disposal of SB Plc.

Subordinated debt instruments
During the period, the group did not issue (FY16: R2.7 billion) Basel III compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt
instruments. R0.3 billion (FY16: Rnil) of Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments were issued during the 
period in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Basel III framework. The group redeemed R1.4 billion (FY16: R3.2 billion)
Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt instruments during the period.

The group issued its debut Basel III compliant AT1 capital bond that qualifies as Tier 1 capital on 30 March 2017
amounting to R1.7 billion. The capital notes are perpetual, non-cumulative with an issuer call option after a minimum 
period of five years and one day and on every coupon payment date thereafter. 

The terms of the Basel III compliant AT1 capital bond and Tier 2 bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides
for the write-off, in whole or in part, on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (the SARB) that a
write-off without which the issuer would have become non-viable is necessary, or a decision to make a public sector 
injection of capital or equivalent support, without which the issuer would have become non-viable.   

All of the above-mentioned subordinated debt instruments have been recognised within the subordinated debt in the
statement of financial position with the exception of the AT1 capital bonds that have been recognised within other 
equity instruments in the statement of financial position. 

Accounting policy elections and restatement
Adoption of amended standards effective for the current financial period
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except as required in terms 
of the adoption of the following amendments effective for the current period:
- Annual improvements 2014 - 2016 clarification to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. 
  Early adoption of revised standards:
- Amendment to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
- Annual improvements 2014 - 2016 clarification to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
  Standards (IFRS 1) and  IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
- Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property.

The abovementioned amendments to the IFRS standards, adopted on 1 January 2017, did not have any effect on the 
group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and had no material impact on the group's 
accounting policies. 

Change in presentation policy for policyholders' assets and liabilities
For the year ended 31 December 2016, a change in presentation was adopted to disclose portfolio level negative
policyholders' liabilities as policyholders' assets. In addition, to provide more relevant and useful information 
to the user, reinsurance liabilities were also excluded from policyholders' liabilities and is now included in 
provisions and other liabilities. 

The financial impact of this change on the results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is as follows:

  liabilities and are now included within the provisions and other liabilities line item.                                                                 

Other information
Pro forma constant currency financial information
The pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results is the responsibility of the group's directors.
The pro forma constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on
the group's results and may not fairly present the group's results of operations. In determining the change in constant
currency terms, the comparative financial reporting period's results have been adjusted for the difference between the
current and prior period's average exchange rates (determined as the average of the daily exchange rates). The
measurement has been performed for each of the group's material currencies. The pro forma constant currency financial 
information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors. 

The following average exchange rates were used in the determination of the pro forma constant currency information and
were calculated using the average of the average monthly exchange rates (determined on the last day of each of the 
six months in the period).

Amendment to Standard Bank Group and The Standard Bank of South
Africa credit ratings

In accordance with paragraph 4.26 of the JSE Listings
Requirements, noteholders are hereby advised of the amendment to
SBG and SBSA’s credit rating effective on 12 June 2017.

Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s” or “the agency”) has
downgraded the Long-Term local and foreign currency deposit
ratings of SBSA to Baa3 from Baa2, and the Short-Term local and
foreign currency deposit ratings to P-3 from P-2. The agency
also downgraded the Long-Term local and foreign currency Issuer
Ratings of SBG to Ba1 from Baa3. The Long-Term and Short-Term
National Scale Ratings of SBSA were affirmed as P-1.za and
Aa1.za respectively. A negative outlook was assigned.

This rating action concludes the review initiated on 4 April
2017 on the five largest South African banks and follows the
weakening of the South African government’s credit profile, as
captured by Moody’s lowering of the Long-Term Issuer Ratings of
the South African sovereign rating to Baa3 from Baa2 on 9 June
2017.

In view of the correlation between sovereign and bank credit
risk, SBSA’s ratings are constrained by the rating of the South
African government. As is its standard practice, Moody’s
positions SBG’s Issuer Rating one notch lower than the deposit
ratings of SBSA, reflecting the structural subordination of
SBG’s creditors to those of SBSA.


Moody's expects SBSA’s financial fundamentals to largely remain
robust, despite the weak economic environment exerting some
pressure on its earnings and testing the resilient performance
it has demonstrated in recent years. Moody's expects SBSA will
maintain healthy capital levels.


For commentary on the detailed ratings action taken on SBG and
SBSA, together with the other South African Banks, please refer
to the Moody’s press release on their website:

STANDARD BANK ANNOUNCES SENIOR LEADERSHIP CHANGES

Standard Bank Group today announced senior leadership changes to its Corporate &
Investment Banking (CIB) division. Following the appointment of David Munro as Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of Liberty, Kenny Fihla, the current Deputy Chief Executive and Head
of Client Coverage CIB, has been appointed as Chief Executive CIB, with immediate effect.
Mr Fihla has been a key player in driving CIB’s growth and in managing key corporate clients
across the continent and major financial centres around the globe. He has demonstrated his
ability to consistently drive performance in his various leadership roles with CIB and his
experience equips him well as he takes on his new position. Mr Fihla was previously the Chief
Executive of Business Against Crime from 2003 to 2006 and prior to that held various
leadership positions within the public sector.

Sim Tshabalala, Chief Executive of the Standard Bank Group says, “These appointments
demonstrate Standard Bank’s deep pool of expertise and our ability to integrate and optimise
the deployment of our key talent.”

Thabo Dloti, the current CEO of Liberty, is leaving Liberty following a difference of opinion with
the Board on the immediate focus of the company at a time when the organisation is facing
tough operational and environmental challenges.

Mr Dloti believes that given this environment, alignment among key stakeholders is imperative
to ensure the effective execution of the strategy required to drive the company forward. This
alignment, coupled with the ability to act decisively, is in the best interests of the company and
hence Mr Dloti is stepping aside.

“Given Liberty’s importance as an institution to the Standard Bank Group, our ongoing priority
is to enable the company to achieve its growth by focusing on a short-term recovery plan and
a longer-term strategy to reinforce its competitiveness. Liberty remains a fundamentally sound
business and Standard Bank is confident of Liberty’s long-term profitability, competitiveness
and sustainability,” says Mr Tshabalala.

Mr Tshabalala expressed his appreciation for the role David has played at CIB and wished
David, Kenny and their respective teams’ success going forward.

            In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of the Banks
            Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum disclosure on the liquidity
            coverage ratio (LCR) of the group and the bank on a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance
            with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

            The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 30 calendar day liquidity profile, by
            ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential outflows in a
            stressed environment. The minimum regulatory requirement for 2017 is 80% and will increase by
            10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.

[1]   The decrease in the FCTR is primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar

Update on the group’s performance for the three months ended 31 March 2017 (1Q17)

Further to requests from investors, the group has decided to provide some context to the earnings attributable to
ordinary shareholders provided in the statement of changes in equity above. In the three months ended 31 March
2017, the group’s banking operations performance was underpinned by a benign credit performance and well
managed costs resulting in low double digit earnings growth. The group’s earnings attributable to ordinary
shareholders grew 16% period-on-period. Although robust, this growth was dampened by the strength of the
Rand relative to the USD, GBP and key African currencies (namely NGN, MZN and KES) during 1Q17. During
the period the headline adjustable items were negligible and as a result the group’s headline earnings growth for
the period was in line with growth in earnings attributable to Standard Bank Group ordinary shareholders.

Balance sheet

Subdued credit demand in South Africa combined with tighter risk appetite across the Africa Regions translated
into muted year to date growth in gross loans and advances across all categories. Retail priced deposits were
broadly flat on levels recorded at 31 December 2016.

Operating performance

Net interest margin (NIM) widened slightly in 1Q17 relative to the 3.83% recorded in the 2016 year, assisted by
positive endowment in South Africa and certain African markets most notably Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique.
NIM expansion and muted loan growth supported the low single digit increase in net interest income period-on-
period.

Non-interest revenue declined year-on-year off a high base in 1Q16. 1Q16’s performance was buoyed by strong
trading revenues on the back of exceptional market volatility and currency dislocation in certain African markets.
In 1Q17 lower volatility impacted trading revenues.

Impairment charges declined year-on-year, supported by ongoing strong performance of the mortgage book as
well as a decline in Corporate and Investment Banking provisions from a high base in 1Q16, in particular in the
Africa Regions. Continued focus on costs, in particular discretionary spend, delivered positive jaws and a
moderate decline in the cost-to-income ratio relative to the 56.3% reported for the 2016 year.

Liberty is due to publish its operational update for the three months to 31 March 2017 on 19 May 2017.

Capital

The group’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio remained in excess of our internal target range of 11.0% – 12.5%.
In late March 2017 the group successfully executed its inaugural additional tier 1 capital issuance, raising
R1.7bn. The notes are Basel III compliant perpetual instruments with permanent write-off features and add
approximately 20bps to the group’s tier 1 capital ratio. The group’s 1Q17 Basel III disclosure will be released on
24 May 2017.

Downgrade

Given recent political developments in South Africa and sovereign downgrades to sub-investment grade, it is
deemed necessary to highlight that the group remains very liquid, appropriately funded and well capitalised.
Although these developments are disappointing, the group remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting our
clients and delivering value to all of our stakeholders. Importantly, this includes continuing to work with
government, business and labour in the promotion of inclusive growth in South Africa.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

SBG and SBSA’s credit rating effective on 11 April 2017.


Following the lowering by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch” or “the
agency”) of South Africa’s sovereign Long-Term Foreign and Local
Currency IDRs to BB+ from BBB-, which were assigned on 7 April
2017, the agency yesterday downgraded a number of South Africa’s
largest banks, as their ratings are constrained by the sovereign
rating.


Consequently, Fitch has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default
Ratings (IDRs) of SBG and SBSA to BB+ from BBB-. The Short-Term
IDRs have been downgraded to B from F3. The outlook is stable.
At the same time, the long-term and short-term national ratings
of SBG and SBSA were affirmed as F1+(ZAF) and AA(ZAF)
respectively, with a stable outlook.

Fitch has noted the banks as having strong franchises, sound
management and governance and solid financial metrics.
For commentary on the detailed ratings action taken on SBG and
SBSA, together with the other South African Banks, please refer
to the Fitch press release on their website:
https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1022036

Overview of financial results 
Group results
Group headline earnings and headline earnings per share increased by 4% to R23 009 million and 1 440 cents
respectively. At year end, the group's capital position was in excess of the upper-end of the group's target 
range, which supported our decision to increase the dividend payout ratio to 54.2%. A final dividend of 
440 cents per share has been declared bringing the total dividend for the year to 780 cents per share, 
representing an increase of 16% on 2015.

We were particularly pleased that our banking activities (which exclude our investments in Liberty Holdings, 
ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) and ICBC Argentina) headline earnings grew by 9% to R22 062 million. This 
translates into an ROE of 16.8%, an improvement from a level of 16.3% in the previous year. Group ROE, impacted 
by Liberty's performance, was 15.3%, down from 15.6% in 2015.

Despite the elevated levels of macro, political and policy uncertainty experienced in many of the markets in 
which the group operates, we continued to grow our businesses both in South Africa and in our Africa Regions 
franchise, which in the 2016 financial year contributed 30% to the group's total income and 25% to the group's 
headline earnings. 

In the prior year, group earnings were positively impacted by certain items which were non-recurring in nature. 
More specifically, 2015 earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders included R2.8 billion of earnings that 
were non-recurring, of which R1.6 billion were excluded from headline earnings.

Operating environment
2016 was a tumultuous year. Globally, two key events stole the limelight - the UK's ""Brexit"" vote and the US 
election. The ambiguity in the run-up to these events as well as the contrarian outcomes drove uncertainty and 
volatility. Overall, global growth is expected to have been in line with the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) 
expectations, at 3.1% for the year. This growth was supported by a stronger than expected trend in advanced 
economies, driven primarily by better than expected outcomes in the US and UK, while emerging markets growth 
plateaued. During the year, China's policy stimulus continued and growth stabilised, providing some support to 
commodity prices, whilst OPEC's decision to trim output helped to lift oil prices. In December 2016, the US 
Federal Reserve Bank raised rates by 25bps and, more importantly, provided a strong indication that it was the 
start of further increases to come, cementing views around the strength of the US economy.
 
Although sub-Saharan African growth is expected to have fallen to 1.6% (2015: 3.4%), the regional and country specific
dynamics drove divergent outcomes. Widespread drought in east, central and southern Africa continued, which placed
strain on food supply and drove inflation. Oil-export reliant countries remained constrained on the back of low prices,
exacerbated in the case of Nigeria by supply interruptions. Many countries tightened monetary policy in an attempt to
control inflation. In addition, specific issues and policy decisions, such as the Mozambique IMF review, illiquid currency
markets in Angola and Nigeria, Kenya rate caps and floors, and geo-political issues, including elections and political
unrest, impacted specific countries. Despite these headwinds, the more diversified oil-importing east African countries
continued to offer better macro prospects, attract investment and outperform.
 
In South Africa, the threat of a sovereign downgrade by rating agencies to sub-investment grade persisted throughout
the year. This in turn negatively impacted the already weak business and consumer confidence and further delayed much
needed domestic investment and job creation opportunities. Idiosyncratic politically driven actions added to uncertainty
and heightened international investor caution. Inflationary pressures brought about by the drought and the weak exchange
rate placed additional pressure on already constrained consumers. Demand for credit was weaker year-on-year and displayed
a decelerating trend over the year, with household demand broadly flat. Overall GDP growth for 2016 is expected to have
been 0.4%, a marginal improvement on the 0% forecast at the start of the year. In certain sectors, such as manufacturing, 
agriculture and mining, growth oscillated between expansion and contraction over the year, while other sectors, such as 
finance, real estate and business services and personal services, continued to report growth quarter-on-quarter despite 
the difficult conditions. In 2H16, on the back of positive global sentiment, firmer commodity prices and some recovery 
in the currency, South Africa's economic outlook improved. This momentum, combined with the fiscal rectitude shown by
the Treasury, the fortitude shown by our key institutions, and the progress made on certain of the other areas of concern 
raised by the rating agencies, aided the country in maintaining an investment grade rating. There remains a broad
recognition that there is still considerable work to be done, not only to avoid a downgrade in June 2017, but more
importantly, to deliver the inclusive growth required to tackle poverty and unemployment and transform the economy into 
one in which everyone can share in its benefits.
 
The commentary which follows refers to the group's banking activities. Other banking interests and Liberty's results
are discussed separately.

Revenue
Total income grew by 10% in 2016, supported by strong growth in net interest income (NII). NII increased by 15% on the
back of stronger margins, up 31bps to 383bps. The margin expansion drivers noted in 1H16 continued into 2H16, namely a
positive endowment impact of higher average interest rates and improved loan pricing and funding margin.

Non-interest revenue (NIR) grew by 3%, supported by net fees and commission revenues and CIB trading revenue, which
both grew by 8%. Other revenue was 23% lower than in the prior year due to the non-recurrence of certain gains on real
estate investment related disposals and investment portfolio revaluations.

Credit impairment charges
Overall total credit impairment charges were largely flat and the total credit loss ratio (CLR) of 86bps was in line
with the 87bps recorded in the prior year. In South Africa, the CLR declined on the back of lower impairments in
mortgages and vehicle and asset finance, as the performance of those portfolios continued to improve, combined with 
the non-recurrence of large corporate impairments. In contrast, the Africa Regions CLR deteriorated primarily as a 
result of increased impairments in Nigeria and Mozambique. The group's coverage and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios 
remained broadly in line with prior years.
 
CIB's credit impairment charges increased from R1 279 million to R1 603 million and its CLR to customers increased
from 39bps to 44bps, driven by higher provisions in the Africa Regions portfolio, in particular Nigeria. CIB's NPLs
declined, reflective of a combination of write-offs, successful restructurings and the impact of currency translation. 
PBB's CLR reduced marginally from 127bps to 125bps, driven predominantly by a decline in mortgage-related impairment 
charges year-on-year, reflective of the good performance of the book and collection-related actions taken. Vehicle 
and asset finance impairments declined by 11%, whilst business and commercial lending impairments were 41% higher, 
primarily within the Africa Regions. Overall personal unsecured impairments rose, reflective of constrained consumer 
affordability.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 9% year-on-year and the group's cost-to-income ratio improved from 56.5% to 56.3%.
Staff costs increased by 11% while other operating expenses increased by 8%. Growth in staff costs was driven by 
salary increases, the impact of the conversion of temporary staff to permanent employment and increases in headcount 
in the Africa Regions. On the back of a conscious focus on costs, the business was able to absorb the R300 million 
loss related to a fraud incident in Japan in May and the R496 million increase in capitalised software related 
amortisation, as well as the adverse translation impact of a weaker ZAR exchange rate in 1H16. Continued focus on 
IT cost saving initiatives helped contain growth in IT-related costs to 2% over the year. Despite inflationary 
pressures, the group was able to deliver positive JAWs of 30bps.

The currency-related headwinds experienced in 1H16 on the back of a weak ZAR largely reversed in 2H16 on the back 
of a combination of ZAR strength and weakness in various African currencies. On a constant currency basis, the group
recorded positive JAWs of 60bps.

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers grew by 1% year-on-year, and 4% on a constant currency basis. PBB loans to customers 
grew 2% year-on-year, underpinned by a 3% growth in residential mortgages and partially offset by a 1% decline in business 
lending and a 5% decline in personal unsecured lending on the back of tighter risk appetite. The CIB portfolio declined 1% 
year-on-year; but would have reflected growth of 3% on a constant currency basis. Corporate loans contracted 4%. The CIB 
South Africa portfolio continued to grow, but the Africa Regions portfolio recorded a decline year-on-year, exacerbated by
 currency weakness in our key markets.
 
Capital, funding and liquidity
The group remains well capitalised with common equity tier I ratio at 13.9% (2015: 12.9%) and total capital adequacy
at 16.6% (2015: 15.7%). The group's capital position remains strong and in excess of capital requirements as prescribed
by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the group's own target ranges. In January 2017, post receipt of the necessary 
approvals required, ICBC and the group injected additional regulatory capital into ICBCS, with the group's pro rata portion 
amounting to USD106 million. Given that the injection was made in January 2017 the impact thereof is not included in the 
group's capital position as at 31 December 2016.

Deposits and current accounts from customers increased 4% year-on-year, and 12% on a constant currency basis. Retail-priced 
deposits declined 1% whilst wholesale-priced funding grew by 7%. On a constant currency basis, retail-priced deposits 
increased by 11% and wholesale-priced funding increased by 12%.
 
The group's liquidity position remained strong and within approved risk appetite and tolerance limits. As at 31 December 2016, 
the group's total contingent liquidity amounted to R335.9 billion (2015: R312.7 billion), and remains adequate to meet all 
internal stress testing, prudential and regulatory requirements. As at 31 December 2016 the group's quarterly average Basel III 
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) amounted to 117.1%, exceeding the 70% minimum phased-in Basel III LCR requirement. From January 
2018, the group will be required to comply with the Basel III net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The group supports the amended 
framework issued by the SARB in August 2016, whereby funding received from financial corporates, excluding banks, maturing 
within six months receives an available stable funding factor of 35%. The group, together with the local banking industry, 
continues to engage, through the Banking Association South Africa (BASA), with the SARB on the remaining items requiring 
clarification and to explore market-based solutions to ensure that the NSFR framework aligns to local industry conditions 
and requirements.

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings grew by 12% to R12 630 million. Strong NII growth of 14% and NIR growth of 8% translated into
total income growth of 11% to R67 480 million. Credit impairment charges were 3% higher than in 2015. Operating expenses
increased by 11%, of which the Japan fraud incident, the increase in permanent employees to comply with legislation,
and higher information technology systems related amortisation contributed 2% to the operating expenses growth. PBB's ROE
increased to 18.7% from 18.2%. PBB South Africa's headline earnings rose by 11% to R11 769 million, PBB International
increased by 21% to R558 million and the PBB Africa Regions headline earnings increased by 66% to R303 million. On a
constant currency basis, total income and operating expenses both grew by 12%.

Transactional products headline earnings grew by 5% to R3 500 million, net of the operational risk losses associated
with the Japan fraud incident. Total income increased by 12% driven by a steady growth in balances, a positive endowment
impact and higher transactional volumes.

Mortgage lending headline earnings grew by 20% to R2 964 million. Total income grew 10% driven by underlying growth 
in new registrations and a slight decrease in prepayments. The roll-off of older lower-margin vintages written in the
period 2006 to 2008 assisted portfolio margins. Credit impairments fell 9% and the CLR declined from 66bps to 58bps on 
the back of the continued roll-off of the older vintages combined with optimised collection strategies.
 
Vehicle and asset finance headline earnings grew by 38% to R421 million. Total income increased by 12% supported by
both portfolio growth and improved margins. Credit impairments were lower on the back of improved collections and asset
disposal processes. Good book growth and lower impairments led to a decrease in the CLR from 150bps to 124bps.

Card products headline earnings grew by 4% to R1 550 million, slightly dampened by higher impairments. Total income
growth slowed to 5% on the back of muted balance growth, interchange reform related headwinds and account attrition.
Ongoing consumer strain associated with the worsening macro-economic environment was reflected in the slight increase 
in NPLs, with the CLR increasing from 462bps in the prior year to 470bps.

Lending products headline earnings grew by 21% to R1 720 million. Total income increased by 14%, resulting from growth
in revolving credit plans and term loans, and better pricing. Lending products' CLR increased from 169bps to 184bps in
line with the constrained macro-economic environment.

Wealth (including bancassurance) headline earnings grew by 9% to R2 475 million. Total income increased by 12%, driven
by growth in deposit balances and increased client activity in Wealth International as well as growth in assets under
management in the Nigeria pension business. Actions taken to improve the claims experience have improved insurance
returns and underwriting profits. 

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB's headline earnings grew by 16% to R10 558 million. Total income grew by 12% to R35 249 million, with client
revenue growing by 10%, indicative of the resilience of our strong, diversified CIB client franchise. Our focus on
multinational corporates is paying dividends and revenue from these customers contributed more than half our total 
revenues. Partnering with local corporates in their respective markets has resulted in a strong performance across 
our franchise with revenue from local corporates within the South African franchise growing by 18%. NII increased 
25%, reflecting the successes of the liability-led model complemented by targeted credit growth within selected 
sectors such as consumer, industrials and real estate. The CLR to customers of 44bps, although up on the prior year 
ratio of 39bps, is within risk appetite and in line with expectations. Diligent cost management delivered cost growth 
of 7% and strong positive JAWs of 5%. CIB's continued disciplined approach to capital allocation resulted in ROE 
improving to 20.0% from 18.0% in the prior year.

Global markets headline earnings growth was robust at 23% to R4 655 million. Total income increased by 13%, supported
by continued client activity across all our regions despite the market volatility and dislocations in some currency
markets.

Transactional products and services headline earnings grew by 17% to R3 073 million. Total income was 19% higher than
the prior year due to the positive endowment impact and a strong performance from our investor services business.
Impairment charges increased >100%, driven primarily by the Africa Regions where we saw the most stress. Cost growth was
well contained at 10%, translating into positive JAWs of 9%.

Investment banking headline earnings increased 15% to R3 098 million. Total income increased 6% year-on-year, impairment 
charges declined 6% and good cost discipline resulted in flat cost growth, delivering positive JAWs of 6% for the year.

Real estate and principal investment management (PIM) recorded a headline earnings loss of R268 million, reflective of
the associated business' wind-down costs. 

Central & other 
In the current year, the segment recorded a R1 126 million headline earnings loss, attributable to group hedging
activities and costs of servicing group capital requirements. In the prior year, the central & other segment included 
a R515 million gain related to the cash flow hedge release on disposal of the group's operations in Brazil and the 
controlling interest in Standard Bank Plc. Excluding this amount, and other one-off items in 2015, prior year headline 
earnings would have been a R1 181 million loss.
 
Other banking interests
Headline earnings loss from the group's other banking interests improved to a net loss of R8 million, from R569 million 
in the prior year. The headline earnings contribution from the group's 20% interest in ICBC Argentina declined 3%
year-on-year to R583 million on the back of a weaker Argentinian Peso (on a constant currency basis ICBC Argentina headline
earnings increased by 37%). The equity-accounted headline earnings loss from the group's interest in ICBCS more than
halved in 2016 to R591 million from R1 294 million in 2015 (excluding one-offs related to the insurance recovery linked 
to the aluminium fraud in China and the deferred prosecution agreement fine agreed with the UK's Serious Fraud Office). 

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group's 55% investment in Liberty, adjusted 
for the group's shares held by Liberty for the benefit of Liberty policyholders and treated as treasury shares 
in the group's consolidated accounts. Liberty's normalised headline earnings for the year decreased by 39% to 
R2 527 million, affected by lower returns from investment markets and a challenging consumer environment. 
Liberty's IFRS headline earnings, post the impact of the BEE preference shares and the Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) 
listed Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) accounting mismatch, decreased by 46% to R2 207 million. Shareholders 
are referred to the full Liberty announcement dated 24 February 2017 for further detail. Liberty's IFRS headline 
earnings attributable to the group, adjusted for the impact of the Liberty deemed treasury shares, decreased by 
61% to R955 million.
 
Prospects
The economic growth momentum that built towards the end of 2016, driven by China and the US, has continued into the
start of 2017. The IMF is forecasting an uptick in global growth from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.4% and 3.6% in 2017 and 2018
respectively. Global trade activity should pick up on the back of policy stimulus and a gradual normalisation of large
economies, such as Brazil and Russia. However, uncertainty surrounding US policy direction under the new administration,
Brexit negotiations and the broader European macro outlook may pose downside risks to global growth prospects.
 
Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP growth is expected to be 2.8%, buoyed by global trade, resource demand and improved economic
prospects generally. Rains in late 2016 and early 2017 bode well for the agriculture sectors in the countries previously
afflicted by the drought. Commodity exporters will welcome higher prices. Nigeria is expected to return to positive
growth, post a contraction of 1.5% in 2016, subject to oil supply and foreign exchange restrictions being eased. South
Africa's forecast growth at 1.5% is an improvement, but remains subject to idiosyncratic event risk, such as rating agency
and political decision points during the year. Lastly, the SARB has indicated that it expects rates to remain on hold,
subject to inflation and exchange rate developments, which is likely to continue to constrain household consumptions and
fixed investment.

With these dynamics in mind, we look to our clients, to the challenges and opportunities they may face, and seek ways
to partner with them on their journeys in 2017 and beyond. As we focus on delivering market-leading client experiences,
we continue to invest in our client-facing digital capabilities to enable our clients to transact independently and
safely anytime anywhere. We recognise and value the trust that our clients place in us and remain vigilant in our efforts 
to protect our clients' resources and data. Accordingly, we continue to monitor developments and potential threats, engage
with industry bodies and invest in our defences to enhance our resilience.

The businesses we operate are complex and we rely on our people across our network to navigate the challenges each
business faces and make appropriate decisions in line with strategic priorities and our values. To this end, we 
continue to invest and equip our people with the skills required, empower them to make decisions, hold them accountable 
and celebrate their successes. Furthermore, we are seeking opportunities to use technology to leverage our data to inform
decisions, deliver client specific solutions and drive process efficiency and productivity gains.

With regards to Liberty, we are working closely with its board and management and are supportive of their efforts to
address their shorter term challenges relating to sales, the competitiveness of Liberty's product suite and ongoing cost
management.

In April 2015 the South African Competition Commission announced that it had initiated a complaint against Standard
New York Securities Inc. (SNYS) and 21 other institutions concerning possible contravention of the Competition Act in
relation to USD/ZAR trading between 2007 and 2013. No mention was made of The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (SBSA).
On 15 February 2017 the Competition Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal against 18 institutions, 
including SBSA and SNYS, in which it alleges unlawful collusion between those institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. We only 
learned of the SBSA-related complaints at this time and are engaging with the Competition Commission to better understand the 
basis for the complaints and the appropriate response. We consider these allegations in an extremely serious light and remain 
committed to maintaining the highest levels of control and compliance with all relevant regulations. The allegations are 
confined to USD/ZAR trading activities within SBSA and do not relate to the conduct of the group more broadly.

As we look to the year ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to doing the right business the right way. In 
this context, we continue to embed a culture of responsible business practices. We remain committed to delivering
through-the-cycle headline earnings growth and ROE within our target range of 15% - 18% over the medium term. In 
order to do so, we recognise the need to balance prudent capital management with appropriate return-based resource 
allocation and leverage.
 
Lastly, we wish to highlight that banks play an important role in society which is broader than creating shareholder
value. We seek to create value for all our stakeholders - clients, employees, shareholders, government and communities
alike. In doing so, we continue to contribute meaningfully to the social, economic and environmental prosperity and
wellbeing in the markets in which we operate.

The above dates are subject to change. Any changes will be released on the SENS and published in the South African and
Namibian press.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to dividends 
tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference shareholders
that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20% of the cash dividend, and this
amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 352 cents per
ordinary share, 2,6 cents per first preference share and 326.056 cents per second preference share. Non-resident ordinary 
and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of
residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 421 166 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

The group entered into certain transitional service level arrangements with ICBCS in order to manage the orderly
separation of ICBCS from the group post the sale of 60% of SB Plc to ICBC. In terms of these arrangements, services 
are delivered to and received from ICBCS for the account of each respective party.

Balances and transactions with ICBC
The following significant balances were entered into between the group and ICBC, a 20.1% shareholder of the group.

1 The group recognised losses in respect of certain commodity reverse repurchase agreements with third parties prior
  to the date of conclusion of the disposal of a controlling interest in SB Plc to ICBC. As a consequence of the 
  disposal of SB Plc, the group holds the right to 60% of insurance and other recoveries, net of costs, relating to 
  claims for those recognised losses prior to the date of conclusion of the transaction. Settlement of these amounts 
  will occur based on audited information on pre-agreed anniversaries of the completion of the transaction and the 
  full and final settlement of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 31 December 2016, a balance of 
  R656 million (2015: R619 million) is receivable from ICBC in respect of this arrangement. In 2015 an amount of 
  R595 million was recognised as part of the group's results from the discontinued operation in respect of this right.

Offsetting and other similar arrangements
Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements
IFRS requires a financial asset and a financial liability to be offset and the net amount presented in the 
statement of financial position when, and only when, the group has a current legally enforceable right to set 
off recognised amounts, as well as the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. There are no instances where the group has a current legally enforceable right 
to offset without the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.

The following table sets out the impact of offset, as well as the required disclosures where financial assets 
and financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, 
irrespective of whether they have been offset in accordance with IFRS. It should be noted that the information 
below is not intended to represent the group's actual credit exposure nor will it agree to that presented in 
the statement of financial position.

1 Gross amounts are disclosed for recognised financial assets and financial liabilities that are either offset 
  in the statement of financial position or are subject to a master netting arrangement or a similar agreement, 
  irrespective of whether the offsetting criteria is met.
2 Gross amounts of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities that qualify for offset in accordance 
  with the criteria per IFRS.
3 Related amounts not offset in the statement of financial position that are subject to a master netting 
  arrangement or similar agreement, including financial collateral (whether recognised or unrecognised) and 
  cash collateral. 
4 In most cases the group is allowed to sell or repledge collateral received.
5 The most material amounts offset in the statement of financial position pertain to cash management accounts. 
  The cash management accounts allow holding companies (or central treasury functions) to manage the cash flows 
  of a group by linking the current accounts of multiple legal entities within a group of companies. It allows 
  for cash balances of the different legal entities to be offset against each other to arrive at a net balance 
  for the whole group. In addition, it should be noted that all repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase 
  agreements, subject to a master netting arrangement (or similar agreement), have been included.
6 In most instances, the counterparty may not sell or repledge collateral pledged by the group.
7 The 2015 previously reported amounts were erroneously duplicated in this disclosure. Consequently, the 
  amounts presented at 31 December 2015 have been restated. The restatement improves the comparability of the
  financial information and did not affect the group's statement of financial position. 

The table below sets out the nature of the agreements and the rights relating to items which do not qualify 
for offset but that are subject to either a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

Other reportable items and post balance sheet event
Foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR)
During the year ended 31 December 2016 the group's share of FCTR decreased by R11.4 billion (2015: increase 
of R2.9 billion). This decrease was partly attributable to the weakening of the Nigerian naira (79%), 
Mozambican metical (69%), and British Pound (35%) against the South African rand which resulted in an FCTR 
loss of R3.6 billion, R1.4 billion and R1.7 billion respectively. 

Impairment of Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC (SIBTC Holdings) (Nigeria)
The group's goodwill materially comprises of goodwill relating to the group's investment in SIBTC Holdings which 
is denominated in Nigerian naira (NGN). The group, in terms of IFRS, reviewed its investment in Nigeria for 
impairment due to the weakening of the NGN which resulted in impairment to the group's investment in SIBTC Holdings 
of R482 million (2015: R333 million).

Japan fraud
As announced by the group on 23 May 2016 on SENS, the group's South African banking operations were the victim of 
a sophisticated, coordinated fraud incident that involved the withdrawal of cash using a number of fictitious 
cards at various ATMs in Japan. There was no financial loss to the group's customers. Swift action was taken to 
contain the matter and the gross loss (prior to any potential recoveries) is R300 million. The internal 
investigation has been concluded and remediation is underway to strengthen current controls.

Liberty Two Degrees
Liberty Group Limited holds and invests, on behalf of policyholders and shareholders, investments in properties 
in a ring-fenced on balance sheet asset portfolio, Liberty Property Portfolio (LPP). L2D, a REIT, was listed on 
the JSE on 6 December 2016, raising R3.8 billion. L2D provided a solution to address the group's policyholder's 
requirement to trade in and out of Liberty's property exposure thereby creating flexibility and liquidity. 

In terms of the transaction, Liberty sold undivided shares in each individual property that were held in the 
LPP to L2D. Liberty is currently the most significant investor in L2D, with a 67% economic interest as at 
31 December 2016. At both a Liberty and group level, L2D is required to be consolidated. As a result of 
consolidating L2D, the group continues to recognise the fair value of L2D's underlying assets. As the group's 
policyholder liabilities are now linked to L2D's units, the policyholder liability valuation is calculated 
as the aggregate unit value of L2D rather than the fair value of its underlying assets. On 31 December 2016 
L2D traded at a premium to its net asset value which resulted in a negative headline earnings impact of 
R167 million (post tax and non-controlling shareholders stake) at a group level.

Equity securities
During the year, the group allotted 2 646 456 shares (2015: 3 813 706 shares) in terms of the group's share 
incentive schemes and repurchased 2 477 472 shares (2015: 3 923 373 shares).

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the period was 16 086 916 shares 
(2015: 11 084 016 shares). These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured 
entities (SEs) relating to the group's Tutuwa initiative (refer to the related party transaction note for 
more detail) since those SEs hold the voting rights on such shares and are accordingly not treasury shares 
as defined by the JSE Listings Requirements.

Subordinated debt
During the period the group issued R2.7 billion (2015: R4 billion) and redeemed R3.2 billion (2015: R3.1 billion)
subordinated debt instruments.

The terms of the issued bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the write-off in whole or 
in part on the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (SARB) that a write off, or a public sector 
injection of capital or equivalent support is necessary, without which the issuer would have become non-viable.

SIBTC Holdings financial statements
SIBTC Holdings advised its shareholders through The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on 24 March 2016 that, due 
to the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria's (FRC) allegations surrounding material misstatements of its 
2013 and 2014 financial statements and the associated legal proceedings, it would be unable to complete its 
2015 audit and issue its 2015 annual report before 31 March 2016. 

In November 2016 SIBTC Holdings reached a settlement agreement with the FRC and the National Office 
for Technology Acquisition and Promotion. This agreement entailed the FRC removing any restriction on the 
external auditors from issuing their opinion on the financial statements of the entities within the SIBTC 
group and a mutual modification of SIBTC Holdings' legal applications to the court. The FRC has approved 
all financial statements prepared by the SIBTC group and the audited 2015 SIBTC Holdings financial statements
were released to the market on 21 December 2016. 

Legal proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other
proceedings. Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal 
proceedings. Nevertheless, based on management's knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting 
with legal counsel, management believes that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently 
assessed as being ‘likely to succeed and material' or, ‘unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. 
The group is also the defendant in some legal cases for which the group is fully indemnified by external third 
parties, none of which are individually material. Management is accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings 
currently pending against the group should not have a material adverse effect on the group's consolidated financial 
position and the directors are satisfied that the group has adequate insurance programmes and, where required in 
terms of IFRS for claims that are probable, provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed.

Competition Commission - trading of foreign currency
In April 2015 the South African Competition Commission announced that it had initiated a complaint against 
SNYS and 21 other institutions concerning possible contravention of the Competition Act in relation to 
USD/ZAR trading between 2007 and 2013. No mention was made of The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited 
(SBSA). On 15 February 2017 the Competition Commission lodged five complaints with the Competition Tribunal 
against 18 institutions, including SBSA and SNYS, in which it alleges unlawful collusion between those 
institutions in the trading of USD/ZAR. The group only learned of the complaints at this time and is 
engaging with the Competition Commission to better understand the basis for the complaints and the 
appropriate response. The group considers these allegations in an extremely serious light and remain 
committed to maintaining the highest levels of control and compliance with all relevant regulations. 
The allegations are confined to USD/ZAR trading activities within SBSA and do not relate to the 
conduct of the group more broadly.  

Indemnities granted following disposal of SB Plc
Under the terms of the disposal of SB Plc on 1 February 2015, the group provided ICBC with certain 
indemnities to be paid in cash to ICBC or, at ICBC's direction, to any SB Plc (now ICBCS) group company, 
a sum equal to the amount of losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising from certain circumstances. 
Where an indemnity payment is required to be made by the group to the ICBCS group, such payment would be 
grossed up from ICBC's shareholding at the time in ICBCS to 100%. These payments may, inter alia, arise 
as a result of an enforcement action, the cause of which occurred prior to the date of disposal. 
Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or governmental authorities to enforce the 
relevant laws in any jurisdiction. Whilst there have been no material claims relating to these 
indemnification provisions during 2016, the indemnities provided are uncapped and of unlimited duration 
as they reflect that the pre-completion regulatory risks attaching to the disposed-of business remain 
with the group post completion. The indemnification provisions covered the Deferred Prosecution 
Agreement (DPA) that ICBCS entered into with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (SFO) (as more fully
set out in the announcement made to shareholders via the JSE's SENS on 30 November 2015). In terms of 
the DPA, prosecution has been suspended and will be withdrawn after three years provided that ICBCS has 
complied with its obligations under the DPA. Any claims that may arise for SNYS with respect to the 
Competition Commission matter are also likely to fall within the scope of this indemnity as the conduct, 
which is the subject of the referral, pre-dates the disposal of SB Plc.

Post balance sheet event
ICBCS capital injection
On 13 January 2017, Standard Bank London Holdings Limited (SBLH), a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard 
Bank Group Limited and ICBC jointly and pro rata to their shareholdings in ICBCS injected additional 
regulatory capital in the form of ordinary equity into ICBCS. SBLH's pro rata portion of this capital 
injection amounted to US$106 million (ZAR1.44 billion).  

This capital was provided in terms of the obligations of ICBC and SBLH under the shareholders' agreement of 
ICBCS pursuant to increasing regulatory capital requirements relating to ICBCS and was provided after the 
receipt by both of ICBCS' shareholders of the requisite approvals for such capital to be provided.

Accounting policy elections and restatements
Basis of preparation
The group's consolidated and company's separate annual financial statements (annual financial statements) are prepared
in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, its interpretations adopted by the IASB, the South African Institute of
Chartered Accountants (SAICA) Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and financial
pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the presentation requirements of IAS 34, the JSE
Listings Requirements, and the South African Companies Act. The annual financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis except for the following material items in the statement of financial position:
- available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or
  loss, investment property, liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements and interests in mutual 
  funds, policyholder investment contract liabilities and third-party financial liabilities arising on the 
  consolidation of mutual funds that are measured at fair value
- policyholder insurance contract liabilities and related reinsurance assets that are measured in terms of the
  Financial Soundness Valuation (FSV) basis 
- post-employment benefit obligations that are measured in terms of the projected unit credit method.

  The following principal accounting policy elections in terms of IFRS have been made:
- purchases and sales of financial assets under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the 
  time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned are recognised and 
  derecognised using trade date accounting
- cumulative gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) in terms of a cash flow hedge
  relationship are transferred from OCI and included in the initial measurement of the non-financial asset or 
  liability 
- commodities acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future or generating a profit from
  fluctuation in price or broker-traders' margin are measured at fair value less cost to sell 
- mutual fund investments held by investment-linked insurance funds, that do not meet the definition of a 
  subsidiary, are designated on initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss 
- intangible assets and property and equipment are accounted for at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
  impairment 
- intercompany transactions between the group's continuing and discontinued operation are not eliminated but 
  presented as part of the group's respective continuing and discontinued operation's results 
- the portfolio exception to measure the fair value of certain groups of financial assets and financial 
  liabilities on a net basis 
- investments in associates and joint ventures are initially measured at cost and subsequently accounted for 
  using the equity method in the separate financial statements. 

Functional and presentation currency
The annual financial statements are presented in South African rand, which is the functional and presentation 
currency of the group and the company. All amounts are stated in millions of rand (Rm), unless indicated 
otherwise.

Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except as required in 
terms of the adoption of the following:

Adoption of new and amended standards and circular effective for the current financial period
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except as required in terms 
of the adoption of the following amendments effective for the current period:
- IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11):  amendments which specify the appropriate accounting treatment for
  acquisitions of interests in joint operations in which the activities of the joint operation constitute 
  a business
- SAICA Headline Earnings circular (Circular 2/2015): changes relate largely to amendments made to IFRS 
  since 2013, and specifically IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
- IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27): amendment which allows entities preparing separate financial
  statements to utilise the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
  associates. 

  Early adoption of revised standards:
- Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash flows (IAS 7): amendments require entities to provide disclosures that 
  enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities
- Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12): amendments clarify various accounting requirements with respect 
  to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.

The abovementioned amendments to the IFRS standards and circular, adopted on 1 January 2016, did not have any 
effect on the group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and had no material impact on the 
group's accounting policies.

Change in presentation policy for policyholders' assets and liabilities
Reinsurance liabilities were previously included within the aggregate policyholder liabilities for insurance 
contracts. To provide more relevant and useful information, these reinsurance liabilities have now been 
included within the group's provisions and other liabilities. These reinsurance liabilities have been disclosed 
separately as this class of liabilities represents the effect of management's risk mitigation action on 
policyholder contracts.

In addition, certain individual pure risk contracts, where the present value of expected future inflows 
exceeded the present value of expected future outflows at a portfolio level, were previously included as 
negative liability amounts (policyholder assets) within the aggregate policyholder liabilities for insurance 
contracts. A change in presentation was adopted for the year ended 31 December 2016 to disclose portfolio 
level negative policyholder liabilities as policyholder assets.

The group is of the opinion that the change in presentation policy will provide more reliable and 
meaningful information. The change brings the treatment of insurance contracts in line with the 
reporting requirements expected under the new accounting standard on insurance contracts.

The financial impact of this change is:

Liquidity coverage ratio disclosure

In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), minimum disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio
(LCR) of the group and the bank is required on a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in
accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 1 month liquidity profile, by
ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment. The minimum regulatory requirement for 2016 is 70%
and will increase by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.

    The decrease in the FCTR is primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Rand against both the US Dollar
    (R13.74/USD at 30 September 2016 from R15.50/USD at 31 December 2015) and other African currencies,

    Shareholders are reminded that retained earnings for the comparable period to 30 September 2015 included
    once-off items of approximately R2.8 billion which were excluded from headline earnings. The majority of these
    related to the disposal of a 60% controlling interest in Standard Bank Plc (SB Plc) in February 2015 and
    primarily comprised the release of the group’s FCTR relating to SB Plc’s net asset value less the recognition of
    the remaining unrecognised loss on the disposal.

Overview of financial results
Group results
Shareholders are reminded that the group has reverted to IFRS as its primary reporting basis in 2016. Unless otherwise
specified, all figures and movements referred to below are prepared on an IFRS basis. In addition, from the 2016
financial reporting period the group’s primary segments comprise the group’s banking activities, which consist of Personal 
and Business Banking (PBB), Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) and Central and other. The group’s banking activities 
together with the group’s other banking interests and Liberty Holdings Limited, represent the group’s total operations. 
The group’sinterest in ICBC Argentina, previously included in Central and other, and ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS), previously
included in CIB’s results, now comprise the group’s other banking interests and represent the group’s associate interests 
in previously consolidated entities that are held in terms of strategic partnerships with the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC). CIB and Central and other previously reported results have accordingly been restated to exclude the
equity accounted earnings relating to these entities. 

Group headline earnings and headline earnings per share increased by 5% to R10 861 million and 680 cents respectively.
An interim dividend of 340 cents per share has been declared, representing a 12% increase on 1H15 and 2.0x dividend
cover. Headline earnings growth of 5% combined with 9% growth in average equity resulted in a decline in group ROE from
15.1% for 1H15 to 14.4% for 1H16. Banking activities recorded an ROE of 15.2% for 1H16.

During 1H16 the group continued to reap the benefits of ongoing growth in its businesses both in South Africa and in
the rest of Africa franchise. Rest of Africa legal entities contributed 31% to banking activities’ total income, relative
to 29% in the prior period, and 27% to the banking activities’ headline earnings, from 28% in the prior period.
 
The 1H15 headline earnings included the financial impact of a partial recovery in respect of insurance claims relating
to an external fraud on aluminium held in the Qingdao port in China, a write-down of the residual aluminium exposure in
China and cash flow hedge releases relating to the disposal of the group’s interest in Standard Bank Plc (SB Plc) and
Brazil, which together totalled R1,2 billion. Furthermore, in the prior period, group earnings attributable to ordinary
shareholders included R2,8 billion of non-recurring net disposal gains (excluded from headline earnings) relating mainly
to the release from the group’s foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) on disposal of its controlling interest in 
SB Plc which did not recur in 1H16. 

The commentary which follows refers to the group’s banking activities. Other banking interests and Liberty’s results
are discussed separately.

Operating environment
The global growth outlook going into 2016 was cautiously positive, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting 
an improvement in global growth to 3.4% relative to the 3.1% recorded in 2015. The risks highlighted focused on China’s 
demand and the speed of its economic re-balancing, sustained low commodity prices and uncertainty leading to overall
weak global demand. In the first quarter, output growth across key markets, other than the US, was better than expected
and the oil markets improved from January lows on the back of a decline in supply, broadly supporting the outlook.
Subsequently, however, the risks highlighted at the beginning of the year have started to materialise, increasing volatility
and uncertainty. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the associated lack of clarity has only served to
exacerbate this. Further US monetary tightening, although widely expected at the beginning of the year, has not materialised
and accommodative monetary policy in Europe has continued.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, oil and other commodity export-reliant countries continue to feel the impact of lower prices on 
the back of excess supply and subdued China demand. More specifically, oil exporters continue to experience strain as the 
oil price stubbornly remains below production cost levels, placing pressure on those countries’ foreign currency reserves 
and local currencies. The pace of structural reform, which is required to promote diversification and much needed economic 
growth, has been slow. In addition, the prolonged and widespread drought brought by El Niño has affected a number of African
countries, in particular across east, south and central parts of the region. Net oil importing countries have benefited from 
the lower oil prices to moderate the inflationary pressures brought by the drought.

In South Africa (SA), the mining and agriculture sector headwinds associated with low commodity prices and the
persistent drought continued to place pressure on the economy into 2016. Whilst the relative currency weakness provided a 
boost to trade and manufacturing, it was insufficient to offset the headwinds, resulting in GDP contraction year-on-year 
in 1Q16. For most of the period under review, the country operated under the threat of a downgrade of its sovereign rating
to sub-investment grade by ratings agencies. Higher rates and above target inflation throughout the period placed
additional strain on consumers, manifesting in lower confidence levels and a contraction of consumer credit. The rand
strengthened through the period from the low levels of late January 2016. The overall macro deterioration, although marked 
and prolonged, has been more gradual than that experienced in the 2008/2009 crisis, enabling businesses and consumers to
better prepare and adjust.

Revenue 
Total income grew by 15% in 1H16, with net interest income (NII) increasing by 18% on the back of stronger margins, up
23bps to 372bps. The key drivers of the margin expansion were a positive endowment impact, improved PBB loan pricing,
and a favourable mix impact.

Non-interest revenue (NIR) grew 12% supported by a growing contribution from the rest of Africa. Net fees and commissions 
grew by 13% while trading revenue increased by 21% on the back of good growth in fixed income and currencies (FIC)
trading, and equities trading, up 19%, and 61% respectively. Other revenue was 21% lower than in the prior period due to
the non-recurrence of certain gains on the disposal of real estate investments and fair value gains within the
investment portfolio recorded in the prior period.

Credit impairment charges
Total credit impairment charges were 16% higher than the prior period, due primarily to increased credit impairment
charges in CIB and to a lesser extent PBB in the rest of Africa. The total credit loss ratio increased from 99bps in the
prior period to 105bps. CIB’s credit loss ratio increased from 25bps to 49bps and its credit impairment charges increased
from R591 million to R1 298 million, in particular on the back of increases in non-performing loans (NPLs) in the oil &
gas and power & infrastructure sectors.

PBB’s credit loss ratio decreased from 148bps to 141bps, driven by a decline in mortgage related impairment charges
period-on-period on the back of sustained good performance of the book as well as better collections. Impairments in
commercial and business lending declined while card debtors and vehicle and asset finance (VAF) impairments were 10% and 
16% higher respectively. Overall personal unsecured impairments rose, reflective of the difficult macro environment in SA 
as well as in a number of other countries in which the group operates.

Operating expenses
The group’s cost-to-income ratio improved from 57.3% to 56.8% despite operating expenses increasing by 14% over the
prior period. Staff costs increased by 16% while other operating expenses increased by 12%. Growth in staff costs was
driven by overnight salary increases, the full six month impact of the conversion of temporary staff to permanent employment
which began on 1 April 2015 and increases in headcount to support business growth, innovation and digital banking, and
wealth and investment initiatives. Other operating expenses include a R300 million loss related to the Japan fraud,
increased amortisation of capitalised software and higher premises costs.

The weakness of the rand over the period contributed to 4% of the growth in income and expenses. On a constant
currency basis, total income grew by 11% and operating expenses grew by 10%, resulting in positive JAWs of 1%.

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers grew by 8% from 1H15 to 1H16. CIB loans to customers continued to grow faster
than PBB, at 15% and 5% respectively. Residential mortgages recorded growth of 4% relative to 1H15 on the back of an
increase in new business registrations. Moderate growth of 2% in card debtors and 3% in personal loans was supplemented 
by good growth in business and vehicle and asset finance lending, which grew by 6% and 8% respectively.

Capital, funding and liquidity
The group remains appropriately capitalised with capital levels marginally higher than those at year-end. The group’s
common equity tier I ratio as at 30 June 2016 was 13.2% (FY15: 13.1%) and tier I ratio was 13.6% (FY15: 13.3%). The
group’s capital position remains strong and more than sufficient to meet the capital requirements as prescribed by
regulatory authorities across markets in which the group has a presence.

Deposits and current accounts from customers increased by 7%, compared to the prior period, with retail priced deposits 
growing at 9%, outpacing wholesale priced deposits from customers, which grew at 6%. Retail priced deposits were 4% lower 
on 30 June 2016 than on 31 December 2015, adversely impacted by the strengthening of the rand against the USD and several 
African currencies, most notably the naira. Adjusted for the currency impact, retail priced deposits actually grew slightly 
period on period.
 
The group maintained its strong liquidity position within approved risk appetite and tolerance limits. Total contingent 
liquidity amounted to R329,3 billion as at 30 June 2016 (1H15: R300,6 billion), and remains adequate to meet all internal 
stress testing, prudential and regulatory requirements. As at 30 June 2016 the group’s quarterly average Basel III
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) amounted to 104.8%, exceeding the 70% minimum phased-in Basel III LCR requirement. The
group, together with the local banking industry, continues to engage, through the Banking Association South Africa (BASA),
with the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to ensure that the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) framework aligns to local
industry conditions and requirements.

Overview of business unit performance
Personal & Business Banking
PBB’s headline earnings grew 14% to R5 492 million. Strong NII growth of 18% and NIR growth of 14% translated into
total income growth of 16%. Credit impairment charges were 3% higher than in 1H15 while operating expenses increased by
17%, affected by the impact of the increase in permanent employees for the full period, the R300 million Japan fraud, and
higher information technology systems amortisation. PBB’s ROE increased from 16.1% to 16.4%. PBB SA’s earnings rose by
10% to R5,0 billion, PBB Outside Africa increased 48% to R313 million and PBB Rest of Africa increased by R105 million to
R158 million. On a constant currency basis, total income grew by 13% and operating expenses grew by 14%.

Transactional products headline earnings increased 10% relative to the prior period to R1 375 million, despite the
operational risk losses associated with the Japan fraud which dampened earnings. Total income increased by 15% driven by
positive endowment and balance sheet growth, partly offset by lower interchange revenue. 

Mortgage lending headline earnings grew by 17% relative to the prior period to R1 225 million. Total income grew 10%
driven by underlying growth in new business and improved pricing. Credit impairments fell 13% and the credit loss ratio
declined from 80bps to 67bps on the back of good performance of the book and better collections. 

Card products headline earnings grew 15% to R785 million, supported by strong growth in the rest of Africa. Card products 
recorded total income growth of 17% on the back of strong NII and NIR despite the headwinds brought about by interchange 
reform. Increasing consumer strain was reflected in the increase in NPLs and credit loss ratio which increased from 463bps 
to 495bps.
 
VAF headline earnings increased 1% to R165 million. SA VAF headline earnings grew 10%; however, this was largely
offset by losses in the rest of Africa where the VAF product is still in a developmental phase. Total income growth was
strong at 16% on the back of a growing book and improving portfolio yield in SA, despite pressure from increased competition
and sharply declining new passenger vehicle sales in SA. The credit loss ratio increased from 141bps to 150bps
reflecting an uptick in NPLs.

Lending products headline earnings grew 13% to R581 million, supported by total income growth of 16%. Advances growth
was driven by growth in revolving credit plans with muted growth across the other portfolios. Lending products’ credit
loss ratio declined from 216bps to 202bps.

Bancassurance and wealth earnings grew 16% to R1 361 million. Total income improved by 25% as a result of margin
earned on increasing loan and deposit balances, higher revenues associated with the bancassurance arrangement with Liberty
and insurance returns.
 
Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB’s headline earnings grew 13% to R4 983 million. Total income grew 17% to R17 717 million with a strong contribution 
from the rest of Africa franchise. NII increased 26%, reflecting the successes of the liability-led model complemented
by targeted credit growth within selected sectors. The tough macro-economic environment impacted customers, in particular 
in the oil-reliant West Africa region, requiring increased credit impairment charges resulting in a credit loss ratio
of 49bps (1H15: 25bps). Continued investment in building client capabilities and capacity, coupled with the currency
impact, drove cost growth to 14% and positive JAWs of 3%. CIB ROE improved to 18.2% from a restated 17.7% for the first
six months of 2015.

Global markets recorded excellent headline earnings growth of 26% to R2 590 million during the period with income
growth of 21% on the back of robust client activity across all regions and the ability to take advantage of market
volatility and dislocation. Strong income growth supported positive operating leverage.
 
Transactional products and services headline earnings were down 5% to R1 327 million. Total income was 21% higher due
to good deposit growth, positive endowment impact of rate increases in SA and a strong performance from our investor
services business. Strong top-line growth was dented somewhat by an increase in impairment charges off a low base, related
primarily to exposures in the rest of Africa portfolio. Continued investment in building the capacity of the business to
support franchise growth, with a particular focus on IT systems, contributed to cost growth of 22%.

Investment banking headline earnings increased 14% to R1 146 million despite large increases in impairment charges.
Strong NII growth, driven by a combination of moderate growth in loans and advances and margin expansion, was partially
offset by a decline in NIR, as difficult market conditions dampened confidence and delayed the closing of transactions.
Sustained low commodity prices and continued macro deterioration have led to higher impairment charges, particularly in
natural resources linked sectors. Costs were well contained resulting in positive JAWs of 6% for the period.

Real estate investments and principal investment management (PIM) recorded a headline loss of R80 million, largely
attributed to the costs associated with the business’ wind down.
 
Central and other
In the prior period, the Central and other segment included a R515 million gain related to the cash flow hedge releases 
on the disposal of the group’s operations in Brazil and the 60% interest in SB Plc. Excluding this amount, headline
earnings would have been a R516 million loss. By comparison, in the current period, the segment recorded a R502 million
loss.

Other banking interests 
Headline earnings from the group’s other banking interests fell from R208 million to R2 million. The headline earnings
contribution from the group’s 20% interest in ICBC Argentina grew 52% to R358 million as this operation continued to
trade profitably despite the devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2015. In the first half of 2015, the group equity
accounted its investment in ICBCS from 1 February and reported an equity accounted loss of R28 million. This loss
included the group’s share of a partial recovery in respect of aluminium fraud related insurance claims of R347 million,
offsetting an operating loss for the five months of R375 million. For the current six-month period, the equity accounted
loss was R356 million, reflecting the continued difficult operating environment for revenue generation but some improvement
in cost control.

Liberty 
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group’s 55% investment in Liberty. Bancassurance
results are included in PBB. Liberty’s BEE normalised headline earnings for the six months to June 2016 decreased by 9% to
R1 821 million, of which the IFRS headline earnings attributable to the group was R886 million. Operating earnings were
down by 15% whilst earnings from the shareholder investment portfolio grew by 4%. The fall in operating earnings was as
a result of declines in individual and group arrangements as well as asset management which were partly offset by gains
in LibFin Markets and a reduction in central and other. Liberty’s capital position remains strong despite weaker sales
and earnings in the six months to June 2016.

Prospects
The latest IMF forecasts expect global GDP growth of 3.1% for 2016, down from 3.4% at the beginning of the year.
Although the impact of “Brexit” is expected to be most felt in the United Kingdom and European economies, prolonged
uncertainty regarding the outcome of the separation negotiations could result in downside risk to this forecast. Despite the
economic headwinds, the IMF expects emerging and developing markets to grow at 4.1%, far outstripping the advanced economies
at 1.8%.
 
Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP is expected to grow at 1.6% with South Africa trending towards zero growth and a contraction
in Nigeria. East and South & Central regions are expected to continue to fare better than the oil exporting countries in
West Africa. Ahead of South Africa’s next ratings review in December 2016, considerable effort is being spent by
government, business and labour to find ways to promote growth, employment and greater inclusion. We are cognisant of the
constraints under which our customers are currently operating. Despite increasing our credit provisions to reflect this, the
group remains well capitalised and in a position to continue to invest and grow in our targeted sectors and countries.

We continue to monitor developments in the banking sector and financial markets to ensure that we remain appropriately
equipped to deliver on our vision to be the leading financial services organisation in, for and across Africa. We are
focused on delivering effective solutions tailored to our customers’ needs and continue to invest in our franchise, our
products and our people. We are committed to delivering through-the-cycle earnings growth and ROE within our target range
of 15% - 18% over the medium term. This includes a heightened focus on optimising resource allocations across the
group, coupled with tighter management of capital supply, and a diligent focus on costs.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to dividends 
tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference shareholders that 
are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 15% of the cash dividend, and this amount
will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 289 cents per ordinary share, 
2,7625 cents per first preference share and 336,7105 cents per second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference 
shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less than 15% depending on their country of residence and the 
applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 175 588 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company’s tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

Legal proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other
proceedings. Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. 
Nevertheless, based on management's knowledge from investigation analyses and after consulting with legal counsel, 
management believes that there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being 'likely to  
succeed and material' or 'unlikely to succeed but material should they succeed'. The group is also the defendant 
in some legal cases for which the group is fully indemnified by external third parties, none of which are 
individually material. 

Management is accordingly satisfied that the legal proceedings currently pending against the group should not have a
material adverse effect on the group's consolidated financial position and the directors are satisfied that the group has
adequate insurance programmes and provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed.

Private equity associates and joint ventures
The following table provides disclosure of those private equity associates and joint ventures that are equity
accounted in terms of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and have been ring-fenced in terms of the 
requirements of Circular 2/2015 Headline Earnings, issued by the SAICA at the request of the JSE. On the disposal of 
these associates and joint ventures held by the group's private equity division, the gain or loss on the disposal 
will be included in headline earnings.

Equity securities
During the period, the group allotted 1 309 717 shares (FY15: 3 813 706 shares) in terms of the group's share
incentive schemes and repurchased 1 386 311 shares (FY15: 3 923 373 shares). 

The total equity securities held as treasury shares at the end of the period was 16 798 218 shares (FY15: 11 084 016 shares). 
These treasury shares exclude group shares that are held by certain structured entities (SEs) relating to the group's Tutuwa 
initiative (refer to the related party note for more detail) since those SEs hold the voting rights on such shares and are 
accordingly not treasury shares as defined by the JSE Listings Requirements.

Subordinated debt
During the period the group issued R1.7 billion (FY15: R4 billion) and redeemed Rnil (FY15: R3.1 billion) subordinated
debt instruments.

The terms of the issued bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the write-off in whole or in part on
the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (SARB) that a write off, or a public sector injection of capital or
equivalent support is necessary, without which the issuer would have become non-viable.

Japan card fraud incident 
As announced by the group on 23 May 2016 on SENS, the group's South African banking operations were the victim of a
sophisticated, coordinated fraud incident which involved the withdrawal of cash using a small number of fictitious cards
at various ATMs in Japan. Standard Bank was the target of the fraud and there has been no financial loss for its
customers. Swift action was taken to contain the matter and the gross loss (prior to any potential recoveries) is estimated 
at R300 million. This loss has been recognised in operating expenses within the group's banking activities. 

Investigations into the cause of the fraud are at an advanced stage. The group is proactively taking steps to prevent
any potential reoccurrence of such an incident.

Foreign currency translation reserve
During the six months ended 30 June 2016 the group's FCTR decreased by R7.1 billion. This decrease was partly 
attributable to the weakening of the Nigerian naira (51%) and Mozambicanmetical (40%) against the South African rand 
which resulted in an FCTR loss of R2.6 billion and R1 billion respectively relating to the group's investments in Stanbic 
IBTC Holdings PLC (SIBTC Holdings) and Standard Bank S.A.R.L, Mozambique(Mozambique). Post 30 June 2016, the Nigerian naira 
and the Mozambican metical continued to depreciate which may result in a further decrease of the group's FCTR in the second 
half of 2016 should such depreciation be sustained. 

The group's goodwill materially comprises of goodwill relating to the group's investment in SIBTC Holdings which is
denominated in Nigerian naira. While the group will, in terms of IFRS, continue to review its investment in Nigeria for
impairment, the weakening of the Nigerian naira did not result in any impairment to the group's investment in SIBTC
Holdings at 30 June 2016. Similarly, the weaker Mozambican metical did not result in any impairment to the group's 
investment in Mozambique at 30 June 2016. 

SIBTC Holdings financial statements
SIBTC Holdings advised its shareholders through The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on 24 March 2016 that, due to the
Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria's (FRC) allegations surrounding material misstatements of its 2013 and 2014
financial statements (as referred to in the group's SENS announcements dated 30 October 2015 and 4 November 2015) and the
associated legal proceedings, it would be unable to complete its 2015 audit and issue its 2015 annual report before 
31 March 2016. Whilst SIBTC Holdings noted that it intended to finalise its audited financial statements on or before 
31 May 2016, this was unable to be achieved. On 27 May 2016, a revised announcement was released through the NSE to 
shareholders informing them of this fact as well as stating that the FRC informed KPMG, SIBTC Holding's external auditors, 
that it would sanction KPMG if, pending the outcome of litigation about the FRC's allegations on SIBTC Holdings' financial 
statements, it issued an audit opinion in respect of the financial statements of SIBTC Holdings or any of its subsidiaries. 
SIBTC Holdings and the group's management continues to explore all available avenues to resolve this matter with the FRC, 
including through litigation in the courts of Nigeria.

The results of SIBTC Holdings will continue to be included in the group's consolidated results but will not be
individually identifiable or disclosed separately. These developments have not had any material impact on the group's results
for the six months ended  30 June 2016.

1 The group recognised losses in respect of certain commodity reverse repurchase agreements with third parties 
  prior to the date of conclusion of the sale and purchase agreement relating to SB Plc with ICBC. As a 
  consequence of the sale and purchase agreement the group holds the right to 60% of insurance and other recoveries, 
  net of costs, relating to claims for those recognised losses prior to the date of conclusion of the transaction. 
  Settlement of these amounts will occur based on audited information on pre-agreed anniversaries of the completion 
  of the transaction and the full and final settlement of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 30 June 2016, 
  a balance of R562 million (FY15: R619 million) is receivable from ICBC in respect of this arrangement. An amount 
  of R40 million (1H15: R539 million) was recognised in the income statement for the period in respect of this right.                          

Other related party transactions
Acquisition of investment from an interest in associate 
As at 30 June 2016, Liberty held an investment in the South Africa Infrastructure Fund Trust (SAIF), which was
accounted for as an interest in associate measured at fair value through profit or loss. SAIF has commenced a process to
realise its assets. Through this process Liberty, on 4 July 2016, purchased a share in Trans African Concessions (TRAC)
Proprietary Limited from SAIF for an amount of R1.5 billion. This purchase is part of an agreed arrangement with several
partners that will facilitate the establishment of a STANLIB managed infrastructure fund holding various non-controlling
interests in toll road concessions. This fund is likely to be accounted for as a mutual fund subsidiary of both Liberty 
and the group. 

Proposed sale of hotels businesses to The Cullinan Hotel Proprietary Ltd (Cullinan)
Liberty has entered into a sale of business agreement with Cullinan to dispose of interests in two investment
properties and the accompanying hotel businesses for an aggregate cash consideration of R310 million. The group through 
Liberty, has a 40% interest in Cullinan, which is accounted for as an associate measured at fair value through profit 
or loss. There will not be significant financial impact to the group's results or statement of financial position 
arising from this disposal.

Offsetting and other similar arrangements
Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements
IFRS requires a financial asset and a financial liability to be offset and the net amount presented in the statement
of financial position when, and only when, the group has a current legally enforceable right to set off recognised
amounts, as well as the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
There are no instances where the group has a current legally enforceable right to offset without the intention to settle
on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, irrespective of
whether they have been offset in accordance with IFRS. There are no items measured on different measurement bases within
the line items in the tables below.

1 Gross amounts are disclosed for recognised financial assets and financial liabilities that are either offset in the statement 
  of financial position or are subject to a master netting arrangement or a similar agreement, irrespective of whether the 
  offsetting criteria is met.                                                                                                       
2 Gross amounts of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities that qualify for offset in accordance with the criteria 
  per IFRS.                                                                                                       
3 Related amounts not offset in the statement of financial position that are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar 
  agreement, including financial collateral (whether recognised or unrecognised) and cash collateral. In most cases the group is 
  allowed to sell or repledge collateral received.                                                                                                       
4 Related amounts not offset in the statement of financial position that are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar 
  agreement, including financial collateral (whether recognised or unrecognised) and cash collateral. In most instances, the 
  counterparty may not sell or repledge collateral pledged by the group.                                                                            
5 The most material amounts offset in the statement of financial position pertain to cash management accounts. The cash management 
  accounts allow holding companies (or central treasury functions) to manage the cash flows of a group by linking the current 
  accounts of multiple legal entities within a group of companies. It allows for cash balances of the different legal entities 
  to be offset against each other to arrive at a net balance for the whole group. In addition, it should be noted that all 
  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, subject to a master netting arrangement (or similar agreement), 
  have been included.                                                                                                       
6 A reassessment of financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements resulted in a restatement of amounts presented 
  at December 2015. The restatement improves the comparability of the financial information and did not affect the group's 
  statement of financial position.

Accounting policies and restatements 
Basis of preparation
The group's results are prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost basis as
modified by the fair value accounting of certain assets and liabilities where required or permitted by IFRS.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the results
have been derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
the group's previous consolidated audited annual financial statements, except for changes as required by the mandatory 
and early adoption of new and revised IFRS and circular, as set out below.

Adoption of new and amended standards and circular effective for the current financial year
The accounting policies are consistent with those reported in the previous year except as required in terms of the
adoption of the following amendments effective for the current period:
- Amendment to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11) 
- SAICA Headline Earnings circular (Circular 2/2015) 
- IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27): amendment which allows entities preparing separate financial
  statements to utilise the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. 
  The standard will be applied retrospectively.

Early adoption of revised standards:
- Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flow (IAS 7)
- Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12)

The above mentioned amendments to the IFRS standards and circular, adopted on 1 January 2016, did not have any effect
on the group's previously reported financial results or disclosures and had no material impact on the group's accounting
policies. However, the group has elected to change the accounting policy for investments in associates and joint ventures 
only to both Standard Bank Group Limited and The Standard Bank of South Africa's separate financial statements as a result 
of the IAS 27 amendment from the cost method to the equity accounting method. The amendment has been applied retrospectively. 

The amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1) which was early adopted at the 31 December 2015
reporting period, resulted in the following changes to the group's 30 June 2016 interim report:
- Changes to the ordering of line items in the financial statements, notably in the statement of financial position to
better reflect liquidity
- The application of materiality to items in the income statement, together with the development of a revised income
statement format, resulted in changes to the income statement's previously reported results as set out in the following
table:

Pro forma constant currency financial information
The pro forma constant currency information disclosed in these results is the responsibility of the group's directors.
The pro forma constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on
the group's results and may not fairly present the group's results of operations. In determining the change in constant
currency terms, the comparative financial reporting period's results have been adjusted for the difference between the
current and prior period's average exchange rates (determined as the average of the daily exchange rates). The
measurement has been performed for each of the group's material currencies. The pro forma constant currency financial information
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

The following average exchange rates were used in the determination of the pro forma constant currency information.

Update on the group's performance for the four months to 30 April 2016 and capital
adequacy, leverage ratio and liquidity coverage ratio disclosure at 31 March 2016

1. Update on the group's performance for the four months to 30 April 2016

   At the annual general meeting to be held later today, group chief executives Sim
   Tshabalala and Ben Kruger will refer to this update regarding the group's performance
   for the first four months of 2016 in comparison with the equivalent period for 2015.

   Banking activities

   The economic conditions in South Africa, and across a number of the African countries in
   which the group operates, remain challenging. Despite this, group income growth has
   been good, supported by strong growth in net interest income. As expected, the group
   has seen some strain in the associated credit environments resulting in an increase in
   the group’s credit impairment charges. Expense growth was higher than income growth,
   exacerbated by the weaker rand, but remains within internal expectations. Management
   remains focused on delivering return on equity in the medium term target range of 15%
   to 18%.

   Liberty Holdings Limited (“Liberty”)

   Shareholders are referred to the Liberty operational update on 19 May 2016 wherein,
   referring to the first quarter of 2016, the following comments were included:


   “The performance of the group for the three months to 31 March 2016 continues to
   reflect the trends observed in the final quarter of 2015. Increasing pressure on consumer
   disposable income, volatile investment markets and lower economic growth have
   impacted both net customer cash flows and indexed new business. Returns on the
   shareholder investment portfolio were behind benchmark for 2016 but remain well ahead
   of the three year cumulative benchmark. Assets under management amounted to R671
   billion (31 December 2015: R668 billion).”
   As noted in the group’s Annual Integrated Report, published on 25 April 2016, the lock-in
   period for the group’s Black Economic Empowerment initiative ended on the 31
   December 2014, the remaining participants’ interest has a negligible impact on the
   group’s International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) results and the group will
   revert to IFRS as its primary reporting basis in 2016.

2. Basel III capital adequacy, leverage and liquidity coverage ratio disclosure as at 31
   March 2016

   In terms of the requirements under Regulation 43(1)(e)(iii) of the regulations relating to
   banks and Directive 4/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of the Banks Act (Act No. 94
   of 1990), minimum disclosure on the capital adequacy of the group and its leverage ratio
   is required on a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel
   III accord.

Liquidity coverage ratio disclosure

In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act (Act No. 94 of 1990), minimum disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
of the group and the bank is required on a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance
with Pillar 3 of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 1 month liquidity profile, by
ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment. The minimum phase-in LCR requirement for 2016 at
70% on 1 January 2016 and will increase by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING FRAUD INCIDENT

The South African banking operations of Standard Bank Group have been
the victim of a sophisticated, coordinated fraud incident. This
involved the withdrawal of cash using a small number of fictitious
cards at various ATMs in Japan. The target of the fraud has been
Standard Bank and there has been no financial loss for customers.

Standard Bank has taken swift action to contain the matter and the
gross loss to the bank is estimated at R300m. This is prior to any
potential recoveries that may serve to reduce the loss.

The relevant authorities have been alerted.

Investigations are at a sensitive stage and further information will
be provided as appropriate.

Overview of financial results 

Group results
Group headline earnings and headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 27% to R22 002 million and 1 359 cents
respectively. Net asset value per share increased by 9% and group return on equity (ROE) increased to 15.3% from 
12.9% in FY14. A total dividend of 674 cents per share has been declared, a 13% increase on FY14.

During the period covered by the results, the group completed the disposal of its controlling interest in Standard
Bank Plc (SB Plc) on 1 February 2015 (the disposal), which was classified as a discontinued operation up to the date 
of the transaction's completion. Subsequent to the transaction SB Plc was renamed ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) and the
group's remaining 40% interest has been included as an associate, with equity accounted results included in the group's
continuing operations from the disposal date.  As a result of the disposal, earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders
include R2,8 billion of net disposal gains which have been excluded from headline earnings, primarily consisting of
releases to the income statement from the group's foreign currency translation reserve. 

Headline earnings for the year reported within the group's discontinued operation include the effects of a write-down
of the residual aluminium exposure in China; a partial recovery in respect of insurance claims relating to the external
fraud in the Qingdao port in China; and cash flow hedge releases relating to the disposal. The loss from the
discontinued operation within headline earnings amounts to R90 million. Headline earnings from operations excluding the
discontinued operation (continuing operations) increased by 5% to R22 092 million. The commentary which follows refers 
to the group's continuing banking operations. Liberty Holding Limited's (Liberty) results are discussed separately.

Operating environment
In 2015 global economic growth remained moderate at 3.1% with growth in emerging market and developing economies
expected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to have declined for the fifth consecutive year. A modest recovery 
has continued in advanced economies with a gradual monetary tightening in the United States (US) as several other major 
advanced economy central banks continue to ease monetary policy. Market concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy 
have affected other economies through weaker commodity prices, diminishing confidence, and increasing volatility in 
financial markets. Manufacturing activity and trade remained weak globally, not only due to developments in China, but 
also because of subdued global demand and investment more broadly. 

Sub-Saharan Africa economic growth is estimated to have reduced sharply to 3.5% in 2015 from 5.0% in 2014 as lower
commodity prices impacted net exports and placed pressure on economic activity even as lower oil prices eased energy 
import costs. While economic activity remains more robust than in many other developing regions of the world, the strong
growth momentum evident in the region in recent years has dissipated, particularly within oil-exporting countries.

2015 economic growth forecasts for South Africa were marked down progressively during the year as the full impact of
commodity price deflation, and weakening business and consumer confidence limited demand. Although there was notable
stabilisation of electricity supply in the second half of 2015, unfolding drought conditions, higher interest rates and
policy uncertainty subdued investment and cyclical consumption; economic growth is expected to have been 1.3% in 2015 
from 1.5% in 2014. A sharply weaker exchange rate in response to investment portfolio outflows and a continued current 
account deficit accompanied broad acceleration in market volatility towards the end of the year, exacerbated by market 
concerns related to the unexpected removal of South Africa's minister of finance in December.

Revenue
Total income increased by 8% in FY15, with net interest income (NII) growing by 9% primarily due to a 17% increase in
average interest-earning assets, driven mainly by growth in higher quality but lower-yielding Corporate & Investment
Banking (CIB) assets. Margin compression of 30 basis points resulted mainly from significantly higher growth in CIB 
assets relative to Personal & Business Banking (PBB) assets. Higher funding costs and the requirement to hold higher 
levels of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) were largely offset by higher average South African interest rates.

Non-interest revenue (NIR) grew 8% due to good growth in trading and other income. Fees and commissions were 3% higher
than in FY14 as knowledge-based fees and commissions declined by 9% due to weaker corporate activity conditions in the
rest of Africa and a high base in FY14. Trading revenue increased by 20% due mainly to good growth in fixed income and
currency trading which was up 15%, as well as a good performance from equities trading, up 51%.

Other revenue growth of 10% benefited from fair value gains and profit on disposal of equity investments, partly
offset by the non-recurrence of gains from property disposals and lower rentals received.

Credit impairments
Total credit impairments were 4% higher than in FY14 and the credit loss ratio declined to 0.87% from 1.00%. Credit
impairments in CIB increased to R1 279 million from R804 million in the prior period with its credit loss ratio 
rising to 0.24% from 0.22%.

In PBB, credit impairments were 5% lower than in the prior year and its credit loss ratio improved to 1.27% from
1.41%. Impairments in mortgage lending declined by R327 million while those in the vehicle and asset finance business 
were largely unchanged as lower impairments in South Africa were offset by higher provisioning required in the rest of 
Africa portfolio. Personal lending impairments declined by R83 million due mainly to lower charges required for access 
loans, while card debtors' impairments were 23% higher reflecting a higher level of stress across the portfolio. 
Business lending impairments fell by R270 million due to the non-recurrence of a few larger account impairments in 
2014, offset partially by higher charges required in the agriculture sector. Impairments in PBB's rest of Africa 
operations increased by 22% and the credit loss ratio increased to 2.02% from 1.83% in FY14.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by 10% over the prior year and the group's cost-to-income ratio increased to 56.7% from
55.0%. Staff expenses increased by 12% while other operating expenses increased by 8%. Growth in staff expenses was
affected by the conversion of approximately 4 400 people from temporary to permanent staff, mainly in South Africa. 
Other operating expenses were affected by higher IT expenses related to core banking systems taken into production, 
including increased amortisation of capitalised software assets.

Loans and advances
Gross loans and advances to customers increased by 15% in FY15. PBB balances with customers grew by 6%, and CIB
balances grew by 29% including a higher level of loans granted under resale. Residential mortgages grew by 3%, and 
vehicle and asset finance reached 11% growth in a softer overall market. Card debtors grew by a moderate 4% with 
personal loans 3% higher than FY14 reflecting tighter monetary conditions in South Africa. Business and corporate 
loans showed higher levels of growth at 18% and 22% respectively. 

Capital, funding and liquidity
The group maintains appropriate levels of capital with tier I and total capital levels at 13.3% (FY14: 12.9%) and
15.7% (FY14: 15.5%) respectively. The group remains well placed to meet the higher regulatory requirements across 
markets in which the group operates.

Deposits and current accounts from customers increased by 10% with 20% growth in retail priced deposits significantly
higher than the  5% growth in wholesale priced deposits from customers. Good growth in retail priced deposits in the
rest of Africa and outside Africa was aided by significant rand depreciation over the year.

The group maintained its liquidity positions within the approved risk appetite and tolerance limits. The average group
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) during the final quarter of 2015 was 93.7%. The group continues to evaluate
the funding impact of the Basel III net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Areas of national discretion pertaining to the 
NSFR are expected to be finalised by the South African Reserve Bank during the course of 2016.

Personal & Business Banking
PBB's FY15 headline earnings of R11 232 million increased by 15% compared with FY14. NII grew by 11% and moderate
growth of 7% in NIR resulted in total income growth of 9%. Credit impairment charges were 5% lower than in FY14 and
operating expenses, which were affected by the conversion of temporary employees to permanent employees during the year,
increased by 10%. PBB's ROE was maintained at 18.1%. PBB South Africa earnings increased by 13% while PBB rest of Africa
earnings improved to R192 million from R104 million in FY14. Good growth of 51% in PBB outside Africa earnings, which 
amounted to R461 million, was achieved and assisted further by rand depreciation during the year.

Transactional products total income increased by 11% assisted by higher average domestic interest rates and balance
sheet growth driven by higher cash management, savings and investment portfolio balances, offset partially by reduced
interchange rates on debit cards in South Africa. Earnings of R3 204 million were 9% higher than in the prior period.

Mortgage lending headline earnings increased by 25% to R2 450 million. Total income growth of 8% reflected the effect
of higher average balances and continued improved average pricing relative to funding costs. Credit impairments fell 
by 13% and the credit loss ratio declined to 66bps from 79bps due to improved collection capabilities. Non-performing 
loans increased by 6% mainly as a result of the required regulatory change in the treatment of restructured loans.

The improvement in vehicle and asset finance profitability continued during the year as headline earnings of 
R306 million were 79% higher than in FY14. Total income growth of 7% in a challenging market was supplemented by 
an improvement in the credit loss ratio to 1.50% from 1.55%. New business quality continued to improve, assisted 
by the positive impact of investment in online dealer origination capabilities.

Card products increased headline earnings by 9% to R1 535 million during the year. Higher domestic yields and
increased activity in the rest of Africa largely offset lower average interchange fees to lift total income by 12%. 
Higher average interest rates and a slowing domestic economy have affected contractual repayments by customers and 
credit impairments grew by 23% with the credit loss ratio rising to 4.83% from 4.08% in the prior year.

Lending products improved headline earnings by 14% to R1 442 million. Total income growth of 3% benefited from good
growth in business lending balances offset by lower growth in personal products lending. Credit impairments were 10% 
lower than in the previous year with the credit loss ratio declining to 1.68% from 2.05% in FY14.

Bancassurance and wealth increased headline earnings by 11% to R2 295 million. Total income improved by 12% due to 
an increase in the client asset base, good growth in assets under management in Nigeria and the Offshore group as 
well as a better short-term insurance underwriting performance.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB increased headline earnings by 59% to R7 923 million, resulting in a ROE of 14.3% from 10.2%. The business
delivered respectable revenue growth of 7% in the context of significant market volatility. Continued investment in 
major online programmes resulted in costs growing by 10%. Impairments increased by 59%, reflective of increased strain
experienced in the oil & gas and mining & metals sectors. Earnings were materially impacted by the 40% associate share 
in the loss incurred by ICBCS for the 11 months ended December 2015, amounting to R1 173 million, which also included 
40% of the fine paid in respect of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement agreed with the Serious Fraud Office in the 
United Kingdom. 

The headline earnings loss within the discontinued operation, being the outside Africa global markets business,
amounted to R104 million from a loss of R3 745 million in FY14, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the fair value 
adjustment on repo positions relating to aluminium financing in China. A partial recovery in respect of insurance claims 
relating to this matter received during the year was largely offset by final balance sheet adjustments relating to the 
disposal of the discontinued operation and SB Plc's January 2015 operating loss.

Transactional products and services grew headline earnings by 4% to R2 662 million.  Total income increased by 8% on
good cash management deposit growth, offset by reduced investor services demand in Nigeria as its investment environment
deteriorated. Expenses were adversely affected by higher staff costs in the rest of Africa to support increased systems
investment and franchise growth.

Global markets recorded headline earnings growth of 19% to R3 889 million in FY15. Income growth of 12% benefited from
higher client volumes in fixed income trading, good risk positioning on the back of client facilitation in equity
derivatives as well as improved commodities trading. Expenses were well controlled during the year resulting in positive
operational leverage.

Investment banking headline earnings increased by 1% to R2 598 million as total income increased by 6% following a
good debt origination performance in 2H15. Depressed commodity prices and deteriorating economic conditions in
resource-focused countries in the rest of Africa required higher impairment charges particularly related to exposures 
in the oil & gas and power & infrastructure sectors. 

Real estate and principal investment management (PIM) recorded headline earnings of R51 million from R312 million in
FY14 as property disposals and fair value gains within the property investment portfolio income did not recur. The PIM
portfolio continues to be gradually wound down.

Liberty
The financial results reported are the consolidated results of the group's 54% investment in Liberty.
Bancassurance results are included in PBB. Liberty BEE normalised headline earnings of R4 128 million were 4% higher,
representing 7% growth in operating earnings and a 2% decrease in earnings from the LibFin Investments - Shareholder
Investment Portfolio (SIP). The growth in operating earnings was supported by strong performances from Individual
Arrangements, Liberty Corporate, a division of Group Arrangements, and LibFin Markets. The SIP gross performance of 
9.6% (2014: 10.3%) was substantially ahead of benchmark, supported by overweight exposure to foreign assets. 
The BEE normalised return on equity at 19.5% (2014: 20.4%) reflects ongoing efficient capital management. 

The life operations benefited from continued positive operating variances against modelled expectations which
supported good cash generation in 2015. Net customer cash inflows were substantially higher at R15,2 billion 
(2014: R4,2 billion) due to significantly improved Stanlib asset management cash flows. This included external 
inflows of R8,4 billion (2014: outflows of R7,3 billion) into the asset management operations. Total assets under 
management increased to R668 billion (2014: R633 billion), reflecting net external customer inflows and relatively 
low incremental growth from investment market returns.

Prospects
Global growth is projected by the IMF to accelerate to 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017 although the pickup in global
activity is projected to be more gradual than previously anticipated, especially in developing economies. In advanced
economies, a modest and uneven recovery is expected to continue. Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the 
downside influenced strongly by a broad-based slowdown in emerging market economies, China's rebalancing, lower 
commodity prices, and the gradual exit from accommodative monetary conditions in the United States.

Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to experience a gradual pickup in economic growth, but at rates that
are lower than those seen over the past decade. This mainly reflects the continued adjustment to lower commodity prices
and higher borrowing costs, which are affecting some of the region's largest economies, as well as a number of smaller
commodity exporters. In South Africa, the growth outlook for 2016 has slipped to below 1% due mainly to the effect of
the drought and tighter financial conditions and  the risk of further economic growth disappointment remains elevated. 

The year ahead is likely to provide a demanding operating environment in which consumers and businesses will have to
adapt to higher interest rates and the full effect of currency weakness. The group's strategic market positioning,
well-capitalised and liquid balance sheet, and committed employees are able to withstand uncertain macro developments 
and volatile markets for the sustained benefit of our customers. Our medium-term ROE target of between 15% and 18% 
remains intact. The group's ROE performance will however be affected by factors such as economic growth in South Africa 
and the rest of Africa, and the retention of a South African investment grade sovereign credit rating. As such, we are 
working closely with the authorities to promote a stable, growth-friendly domestic environment.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for
both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to
consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to
dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and preference 
shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 15% of the cash 
dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net 
amount of 315,35000 cents per ordinary share, 2,76250 cents per first preference share and 314,29600 cents per 
second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a 
rate of less than 15% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty 
between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 618 252 182 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06. 

Normalised results
With effect from 2004, the group's IFRS results have been normalised to reflect the group's view of the economic 
and legal substance of the following arrangements (normalised results)1:
- Preference share funding provided by the group for the group's Tutuwa transaction is deducted from equity as a
  negative empowerment reserve and reduces the shares in issue in terms of IFRS.
- Group company shares held for the benefit of Liberty policyholders result in a reduction of the number of shares in
  issue and the exclusion of fair value adjustments and dividends on these shares. The IFRS requirement causes an
  accounting mismatch between income from investments and changes in policyholders' liabilities.
- The group also enters into transactions on its own shares to facilitate client trading activities. As part of its
  normal trading operations, a group subsidiary offers to its clients trading positions over listed shares, including 
  its own shares. To hedge the risk on these trades, the group buys (sells short) its own shares in the market. Although 
  the share exposure on the group's own shares is deducted/(added) from/(to) equity and the related fair value movements 
  are reversed in the income statement, the client trading position and fair value movements are not eliminated, resulting 
  in an accounting mismatch. The shares purchased (sold short) also reduce (increase) the number of shares in issue.

A common element in these transactions relates to shares in issue which are deemed by IFRS to be treasury shares.
Consequently, the net value of the shares is recognised in equity and the number of shares used for per share calculation
purposes is materially lower than the economic substance, resulting in inflated per share ratios. The normalisation
adjustments reinstate the shares as issued, recognise the related transaction in the statement of financial position as 
an asset or liability (as appropriate) and recognise the changes in the value of the related transaction (together with
dividend income) in the income statement.

The normalised results reflect the basis on which management manages the group and is consistent with that reported in
the group's segmental report, where the normalised adjustments have been made within Liberty, and central and other.
The results of the other business units are unaffected.

The group's normalised statement of financial position and income statement have been presented hereafter.

The lock-in period for the group's Tutuwa transaction ended on 31 December 2014, allowing participants to trade in the
group shares in the scheme. For further information, refer to below.

Pro-forma financial information
The following pro-forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors. Because of its nature,
the pro-forma financial information may not be a fair reflection of the group's results of operation. The pro-forma
financial information contained in this announcement has been reviewed by the group's external auditors and their 
unmodified review report is available for inspection at the company's registered office.

Group's continuing operations' results including 40% retained interest in ICBCS
On 1 February 2015, the group completed the disposal of its controlling interest in SB Plc and thereafter reports 
its retained 40% interest in ICBCS within the group's continuing operations' results. In the group's 2014 results, 
and for the current year up to the date of disposal, SB Plc's net headline earnings/(loss) were included in the 
group's income statement as a discontinued operation.

Since the group retains a 40% interest in the discontinued operation following the date of disposal, and in order to
illustrate the group's future continuing operation's base, the group has disclosed a pro-forma continuing operations'
result to include 40% of the discontinued operation's headline earnings result as follows:

Legal proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved in litigation, lawsuits and other proceedings. While
recognising the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings, management believes, 
based upon current knowledge and after consulting with legal counsel, that the legal proceedings currently pending 
against it should not have a material adverse effect on the group’s consolidated financial position. The directors 
are satisfied, based on present information and the assessed probability of claims eventuating, that the group has 
adequate insurance programmes and provisions in place to meet such claims.

Private equity associates and joint ventures
The following table provides disclosure of those private equity associates and joint ventures that are equity
accounted in terms of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and have been ring-fenced in terms of the 
requirements of Circular 2/2013 Headline Earnings, issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA)
at the request of the JSE. On the disposal of these associates and joint ventures held by the group’s private equity 
division, the gain or loss on the disposal will be included in headline earnings.

Equity securities
During the period, the group allotted 3 813 706 shares (2014: 4 879 268 shares) in terms of the group’s share incentive 
schemes and repurchased 3 923 373 shares (2014: 4 361 547 shares). The total equity securities held as treasury shares
at the end of the period was 11 084 016 shares (2014: 12 807 677 shares).

Subordinated debt
During the period the group issued R4 billion (2014: R4,4 billion) and redeemed R3,1 billion (2014: R2,4 billion)
subordinated debt instruments.

The terms of the issued bonds include a regulatory requirement which provides for the write-off in whole or in part on
the earlier of a decision by the relevant regulator (SARB) that a write off, or a public sector injection of capital or
equivalent support is necessary, without which the issuer would have become non-viable.

Disposal of subsidiaries
During the period the group disposed of the following material subsidiaries:

Brazil
In April 2015, the group completed the disposal of Banco Standard de Investimentos S.A., the group’s Brazilian-licensed 
banking subsidiary, to Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, a listed Mexican banking group. The final disposal proceeds amounted to 
R581 million. The net gain on the disposal of R262 million (of which R111 million is included in headline earnings) has been
included in the group’s income statement as part of its continuing operation’s results.

Standard Bank Plc
The group disposed of 60% of SB Plc to ICBC on 1 February 2015. SB Plc was, subsequent to the transaction, renamed to
ICBCS. The final cash proceeds on this 60% disposal, which was based on a discount to the 31 January 2015 net asset
value (this net asset value was impacted by the valuation of certain aluminium claims as disclosed below), amounted to
USD675 million (R7 828 million).  The final tranche of payment in this respect was made, in terms of the transaction
agreements, in early July 2015. SB Plc’s financial results, together with the net gain on disposal, have been reported as
part of the group’s discontinued operation’s results up to the date of completion of the transaction.
 
ICBC has a five-year call option to purchase a further 20% of the outstanding shares of SB Plc, exercisable from 
1 February 2017. Contingent upon ICBC exercising its call option and from six months after such exercise, the group has a
five-year option to require ICBC to acquire its residual shareholding for cash.

The group retained a 40% interest in SB Plc (subsequently renamed ICBCS), with this interest being recognised as
investment in an associate from 1 February 2015. The associate was recognised at an initial value of USD450 million 
(R5 219 million) on this date. This value was determined to be the fair value based on the terms of the disposal transaction. The
results from the group’s remaining 40% interest in ICBCS have been included, with effect from 1 February 2015, in the
group’s continuing operation’s results.

As part of the disposal of SB Plc, the group provided ICBC with certain indemnities to be paid in cash to ICBC or, at
ICBC’s direction, to any SB Plc group company, a sum equal to the amount of losses suffered or incurred by ICBC arising
from certain circumstances. Where an indemnity payment is required to be made by the group to SB Plc, such payment would
be grossed up from ICBC’s shareholding at the time in SB Plc to 100%. Such payments may arise as a result of the
ownership, conduct or operation of all or any part of the businesses that have, in terms of the transaction agreements, been
transferred from SB Plc to the group prior to disposal (excluded business) or from an enforcement action, the cause of
which occurred prior to the completion date of 1 February 2015. Enforcement actions include actions taken by regulatory or
governmental authorities to enforce the relevant laws in any jurisdiction. The indemnities provided are uncapped and of
unlimited duration as they reflect that the risks of ownership and conduct of the excluded business, and pre-completion
regulatory risks attaching to the GMOA business, remain with the group post completion.

Deferred prosecution agreement
As explained in the announcement made to shareholders via SENS on 30 November 2015, the group’s former subsidiary, SB
Plc (now ICBCS), entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (SFO)
with the approval of the President of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales. 

The DPA relates to allegations that SB Plc failed to prevent two executives of Stanbic Bank Tanzania Limited (Stanbic)
from engaging a local partner with the intent that the engagement would induce Tanzanian Government representatives
into acting partially in awarding a capital raising mandate to SB Plc and Stanbic. SB Plc self-reported this suspicious
transaction to the SFO in 2013. In terms of the DPA, prosecution has been suspended and will be withdrawn after three years
provided that SB Plc has complied with its obligations under the DPA. In the same announcement, it was confirmed that
SB Plc had reached a settlement agreement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in relation to
allegations of negligence relating to the same matter.  

The total cost relating to the DPA and the SEC settlement, including penalties, compensation payments and legal costs,
amounted to USD40.3 million (R562 million). As noted in terms of the completion of the disposal by the group of a controlling
interest in SB Plc to ICBC, the group indemnified ICBC against costs of this nature. USD16.1 million (R226 million) of the total 
cost has been recognised within the group’s continuing operations through the equity accounted earnings of its 40% interest 
in ICBCS and USD24.2 million (R336 million) has been included in the group’s discontinued operation’s results. 

Black economic empowerment (BEE) transactions
In 2004, the group entered into a series of transactions whereby investments were made in cumulative redeemable
preference shares issued by BEE entities. The group’s banking operations’ BEE initiative is referred to as Tutuwa and
Liberty’s is referred to as Lexshell. A key feature of these BEE initiatives is that all participants were subject to a 10-year
lock-in restriction which expired on 31 December 2014.

To the extent that the Tutuwa participants accessed their underlying equity value and to the extent that those equity
shares are financed by the group, a proportionate amount of the group’s negative empowerment reserve is released through
the payment of the underlying debt owing on the preference shares by the participants. From January 2015 to December
2015, R1,3 billion was released from the group's negative empowerment reserve.

Aluminium reverse repurchase agreement
During the year, a settlement agreement was concluded with the majority of the group’s third-party insurers in respect
of the losses suffered as a consequence of the fraud in Qingdao port relating to certain aluminium reverse repurchase
agreements, and an amount of approximately USD70,5 million was received by ICBCS with respect to this settlement.
Pursuant to the amendments to the disposal agreement with ICBC in relation to ICBCS, the group enjoys the full economic benefit
of this subsequent recovery.

Efforts continue through a number of avenues to recover amounts owing from the remaining third-party insurer and to
pursue other recovery mechanisms from other counterparties, and to access metal stocks held by the authorities in China.

Related party transactions
Tutuwa-related parties
Tutuwa participants were allowed to access their underlying equity value post the expiry of the lock-in period on 
31 December 2014.

As reported on SENS on 16 February 2015, key management personnel sold 324 001 of the group’s ordinary shares out of the Tutuwa
structure in order to settle employees' tax, associated funding and transaction costs arising from the expiry of the lock-in 
period. In addition key management personnel sold a further 11 112 shares on the 25 March 2015.

order to manage the orderly separation of ICBCS from the group post the sale of 60% thereof. In terms of these arrangements, 
services are delivered to and received from ICBCS for the account of each respective party under formal service level agreements. 
Revenue and expenses recognised in respect of these arrangements amounted to R402 million and R58 million respectively as at

1 The group recognised losses in respect of certain commodity reverse repurchase 
  agreements (repos) with third parties prior to the completion of the disposal 
  of SB Plc to ICBC. As a consequence of the amendments made to the sale and 
  purchase agreement relating to the repos, the group has a right to 60% of any 
  related insurance and other recoveries, net of costs, relating to these repos 
  from ICBC. Settlement of these amounts will occur based on audited information 
  on pre-agreed anniversaries of the completion of the transaction and also on the 
  full and final settlement of all claims in respect of losses incurred. As at 
  31 December 2015 a balance of USD40 million (R619 million) is receivable from 
  ICBC in respect of this arrangement. An amount of R595 million was recognised as 
  part of the group’s results from the discontinued operations.

  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, subject to a master netting arrangement (or similar agreement), 
  have been included.

Trading statement in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015

Standard Bank Group will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2015 (“the results”)
on Thursday, 3 March 2016.

The group has established that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that these results will differ,
as set out below, from those reported for the year ended 31 December 2014 (“the comparable
period”).

In considering the improvement in earnings reflected below, shareholders are reminded that
headline earnings in the comparable period included the impact of losses incurred in the outside
Africa discontinued operation of R3.7 billion, which losses have reduced meaningfully in 2015.
Furthermore, there are gains recorded outside of headline earnings in 2015 related to the disposal
of the abovementioned discontinued operation, which gains were not present in the comparable
period. These gains were explained in detail in the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE (“SENS”)
announcement of the group’s interim results to 30 June 2015, dated 14 August 2015. We further
draw attention to the SENS announcement dated 30 November 2015 regarding settlement
agreements reached by Standard Bank Plc (now known as ICBC Standard Bank Plc) with certain
authorities.

The final effect of all these items on the results will be fully explained in the group’s results
announcement on 3 March 2016, which shareholders should consider in order to gain a full
appreciation of the group’s financial performance.

The expected range of earnings for the year ended 31 December 2015 as compared to the group’s
earnings as reported for the comparable period is set out below on both an International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and a normalised basis. The “normalised” earnings measures are
presented in accordance with the definition as set out on pages 70 to 72 of the group’s 2014 annual
integrated report.

The group’s earnings for the year ended 31 December 2015 are expected to exceed the relevant
earnings for the comparable period by:

    -   between 25% and 35% in the case of both IFRS earnings per share (EPS) (both undiluted and
        fully diluted) and of IFRS headline EPS (HEPS) (both undiluted and fully diluted);
    -   between 25% and 35% in the case of both undiluted and fully diluted normalised EPS; and
    -   between 20% and 30% in the case of both undiluted and fully diluted normalised HEPS.

The tables below set out the minimum and maximum expected values for these earnings measures
for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to the actual values for the comparable period, on
an IFRS and a normalised basis.

Further announcement regarding Standard Bank Plc (“SBPlc”) Deferred Prosecution
Agreement

Further to the Group’s announcement of 26 November 2015, shareholders are advised that Standard
Bank Group's former subsidiary, Standard Bank Plc, now known as ICBC Standard Bank Plc
(“SBPlc”), has, following its self-reporting in 2013 of a suspicious transaction, today entered into a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”), with
the approval of The President of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales,
The Right Honourable Sir Brian Leveson.

A DPA is a voluntary agreement through which a prosecutor agrees to suspend a prosecution in
exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements. The proceedings will be
discontinued once the term of the DPA has expired, providing that the requirements of the DPA have
been fulfilled. This DPA relates to allegations that SBPlc failed, contrary to section 7 of the UK Bribery
Act 2010, to prevent two executives of Stanbic Bank Tanzania Limited (“Stanbic”) from engaging a
local partner with the intent that the engagement would induce Tanzanian government
representatives into acting partially in awarding a capital raising mandate to SBPlc and Stanbic.

Standard Bank Group and SBPlc self-disclosed the issue to the SFO in April 2013 within days of it
coming to their attention, and assisted the SFO in full in its investigations. The Group and SBPlc
commissioned the international law firm, Jones Day, to conduct an unrestricted, comprehensive
investigation and reported the resulting findings in full to the SFO. The SFO has acknowledged that
SBPlc has fully cooperated with the SFO's investigations from the earliest possible date by facilitating
access to people and records and providing timely responses to requests for information. Stanbic in
turn ensured that the events were fully disclosed to the relevant authorities in Tanzania and has
cooperated fully with all investigations.

The Group and its subsidiaries take the risk of corruption very seriously and deeply regret that this
issue arose on a transaction with which they were involved. The SFO has not made any allegations
that anyone within SBPlc knew of the intentions of the two Stanbic employees. The Group is confident
that the circumstances giving rise to the DPA were an isolated incident relating to one transaction to
which the Group and its subsidiaries have responded appropriately. None of the entities has
previously been investigated or charged for bribery or corruption and nor have they been the subject
of any other criminal investigation by the SFO.

Under the terms of the DPA, the prosecution will be suspended and then withdrawn after three years
provided that SBPlc has complied with its obligations under the DPA. SBPlc has agreed to pay a
penalty of US$16.8million, which includes a one third reduction for the self-disclosure and co-
operation. SBPlc will also pay US$7.05 million in compensation to the Government of Tanzania and
US$8.9 million to refund profits related to the transaction and expenses related to the investigation.
Accordingly, aggregate payments to be made by SBPlc under the DPA will amount to approximately
US$32.8 million. The Group has also provided additional training to its people and is committed to the
highest business standards in all of the markets in which it operates, including meeting its obligations
to prevent bribery.

On the basis of the prompt self-disclosures made to the relevant authorities, the cooperation shown
by the Group, SBPlc and Stanbic throughout the investigation, and the terms of today's resolution with
the SFO, the United States Department of Justice has confirmed that it has closed its related inquiry
into the transaction.
In a related but independent development, SBPlc has also agreed with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to resolve a claim that SBPlc acted negligently and did not
disclose to US investors the involvement of the local partner in this capital-raising mandate, under the
terms of which an agreed penalty of US$4.2 million will be paid to the SEC.

On 1 February 2015 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (“ICBC”) acquired a 60%
majority shareholding in SBPlc resulting in the name change to ICBC Standard Bank Plc. ICBC had
no direct interest in SBPlc at the time the relevant events took place, and ICBC had no involvement in
this incident in any way.

Under the terms of the completed transaction in terms of which the Group sold 60% of SBPlc’s
ordinary shares in issue to ICBC, Standard Bank Group indemnified ICBC against the cost of such
resolutions and will accordingly bear the cost of such resolutions.
