NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Argentina Operations

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti has taken the decision to voluntary
suspend operations at its Cerro Vanguardia mine for 10 days due to the detection of COVID-19 cases
among the workforce.

Local health and labour authorities are being engaged and a full sanitisation process of the site will
commence. Essential activities will continue for the duration of the voluntary suspension.

Operations at Cerro Vanguardia are expected to resume on 20 November 2020, however, movements
to and from the site will be restricted to essential personnel only, until 30 November 2020. The
production impact of this precautionary stoppage is estimated to be 8,000oz.

The balance of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate as normal, employing a suite of
measures to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

The health and safety of employees and host communities remains a priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and is committed to working with and supporting
the Argentinian government, particularly in the Santa Cruz province, to combat the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak and remains
in close contact with authorities in each country, with our employees and with our key suppliers and
other business partners, to help ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may
occur.

For additional information on AngloGold Ashanti’s response to COVID-19, please refer to our website.

prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project

statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory
environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or
epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of
such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti, Barrick Conclude Morila Sale to Firefinch

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti Limited and Barrick Gold Corporation
today concluded the sale of their interest in Morila Limited, which owns 80% of the Morila gold mine in
Mali, to Firefinch Limited (previously named Mali Lithium Limited) for $28.8 million cash. The state of
Mali continues to hold the remaining 20%.

The net proceeds to AngloGold Ashanti’s account will be $3.6 million taking into consideration
shareholder loans and intercompany payables.

Firefinch will seek to extend Morila’s life by accessing satellite resources and adapting the mine’s
infrastructure. The company will employ all of Morila’s workforce, providing ongoing benefit to the mine’s
local stakeholders. The mine had been scheduled for closure in 2021.

The sale of Morila is aligned to AngloGold Ashanti’s strategic objective of streamlining its portfolio to
focus its capital allocation on assets with longer life and lower costs.

Since it went into production in October 2000, Morila produced 6.9 million ounces of gold and paid more
than $2.5 billion to stakeholders in the form of dividends and taxes. Morila, which was operated by
Barrick Gold, transitioned to a stockpile treatment operation in 2009 and began processing tailings in
2013.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Q3 2020 Free Cash Flow Rises 290%; Doubles Dividend Payout Ratio

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti delivered a near fourfold
increase in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2020, driving its Adjusted net debt to its
lowest level in almost a decade and supporting the decision to double its dividend payout
ratio.

The Company will pay shareholders 20% of its free cash flow before accounting for capital
expenditure in growth projects, up from 10% previously. The Company will also double the
frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.
“We’ll continue to enforce capital and cost discipline to deliver strong cash flows in this
elevated gold price environment,” said Christine Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s Interim Chief
Executive Officer. “Doubling our dividend payout ratio demonstrates confidence in our ability
to both improve direct returns to shareholders and to self-fund our growth projects and
sustaining capital requirements.”

Free cash flow rose to $339m for the quarter ended 30 September 2020, a 290% increase
from the $87m generated in the comparable quarter of last year, helped as a result of lower
costs from continuing operations, lower capital expenditure and a 30% higher gold price
received. This figure excludes the $200m of proceeds received for the sale of its South
African operating assets on 30 September 2020. Cash inflow from operating activities was up
56% to $551m from $354m in the same period last year.

AngloGold Ashanti has streamlined its portfolio, having completed the sale of its operating
assets in South Africa and progressing the sales processes in Mali, while prioritising
reinvestment in its portfolio to increase reserves, extend mine lives and improve operating
flexibility. The Obuasi Redevelopment Project, financed from internal cash flows, continued its
ramp-up during the third quarter of 2020, delivering a 52% quarter-on-quarter increase in
output, taking total pre-production output to approximately 100,000oz.

Adjusted net debt almost halved year-on-year to $875m at the end of September 2020, while
adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (“Adjusted EBITDA”)
rose 72% over the same period to $803m, from $468m in the third quarter of 2019. The ratio of
Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA fell to 0.36 times, its lowest level since 2011. The
Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet with an Adjusted net debt
to Adjusted EBITDA target ratio of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Operating Performance

Production in the three months ended 30 September 2020 was 837,000oz at a total cash cost
of $801/oz, compared to 825,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz in the same period in 2019.
The solid production result was underpinned by strong performances at most sites, with
standout performances at Sunrise Dam in Australia and AGA Mineração in Brazil.

All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) were $1,044/oz in the third quarter of 2020, compared to
$1,031/oz in the third quarter of 2019. This largely reflected higher cash costs. COVID-19
related impacts resulted in AISC being approximately $51/oz higher in the third quarter of 2020
due to approximately $22m COVID-19 related costs incurred ($33/oz) and approximately
18,000oz lost production at the South African operations ($18/oz).

Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends are calculated, more than
doubled to $361m during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $177m in the third quarter of
2019. This free cash flow figure does not reflect a portion of the cash flows from Kibali, which
remains in the joint venture bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The
Company’s attributable share of the outstanding cash balance that has not yet been repatriated
from the DRC grew by $66m in the third quarter of 2020 to $359m. Barrick Gold Corporation,
the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding
remittance of this cash balance.

The sale transaction with respect to the South Africa mines was completed on 30 September
2020, resulting in Harmony Gold taking full ownership of the assets and associated liabilities
from 1 October 2020 and making the cash payment of $200m. Closing of the sale transaction
of the Morila Gold Mine in Mali to Mali Lithium is conditional on, among others, Mali Lithium
securing acquisition finance and that the deal be acknowledged without objection by the
Government of Mali. On 28 October 2020, we were advised that Mali Lithium had secured the
required acquisition finance and that this condition has been satisfied. Closing of the transaction
is anticipated to take place soon.

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD Corporation and
Allied Gold Corp) remain committed to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent and completion
of the transaction. Notwithstanding political instability, all parties are actively working to achieve
a solution and closing as soon as possible.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued
reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 September 2020
was 0.36 times compared with 1.06 times as at 30 September 2019. This is the lowest point for
this ratio since 2011, reflecting disciplined reduction in debt and robust cash generation from
the business.
Safety

Regrettably, AngloGold Ashanti had one fatality for the quarter ended 30 September 2020. Our
safe production strategy continues at all operations, with a focus on intensifying our employees'
focus on safety practices in all workplaces in an effort to continue AngloGold Ashanti's
sustainable safety improvement.

All operations remain on high alert with respect to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and
we are actively dealing with both the operational challenges and psychological effects
associated with the virus as well as related protective measures, including lockdown
arrangements.

Guidance*

On 21 September 2020, the Company reinstated its annual guidance given improved operating
certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of its
South African assets, which occurred at the end of September 2020.

For 2020, the group is expected to produce between 3.030Moz and 3.100Moz, including nine
months of production from the South African producing assets, or between 2.800Moz and
2.860Moz on a continuing operations basis. AISC is expected to be between $1,060/oz and
$1,120/oz, including contributions from the South African assets to the end of September 2020,
or between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz on a continuing operations basis. Total capital expenditure
is expected to be between $890m and $950m, including the South African assets to 30
September 2020, or between $850m and $905m on a continuing operations basis.

(Assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of ZAR16.66/$ (South African Rand);
A$1.45/$ (Australian Dollar); and BRL5.12/$ (Brazilian Real); AP70.00/$ (Argentinian Peso);
with Brent crude oil at $44/bbl on average for the year).
* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further changes to asset
portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have
material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Measures taken at our operations together with our business continuity plans aim to enable our operations to deliver in
line with our production targets; we however remain mindful that the Covid-19 pandemic, its impacts on communities and economies, and the
actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation
may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December
2019 and the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s Prospectus Supplement dated 28 September 2020, each filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

table on page 1.

The South Africa assets sale was completed on 30 September 2020 resulting in Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited taking full ownership of the
assets and associated liabilities from 1 October 2020. As such, AngloGold Ashanti's results for periods subsequent to 1 October 2020 will no longer
include the South African assets. Results from our Mali operations, including Morila and Sadiola, which are in limited operations and under separate sales
processes, are no longer included in our production and ""Non-GAAP"" cost metrics.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW

During the third quarter of 2020, AngloGold Ashanti made strong progress executing on all aspects of its strategy, despite the continuing
global spread of COVID-19. Delivery on key objectives continued through the recent leadership change, with meaningful delivery on key
objectives to improve the foundation of the business, including:

  -   Sale of the South African portfolio to Harmony Gold completed on 30 September 2020 and $200m proceeds received                   
  -   Guidance reinstated, providing greater certainty on annual production, costs and capital expenditure                             
  -   Obuasi Phase 1 has been completed, while the project remains within budget and Phase 2 construction on track for completion 
      towards the end of the first quarter of 2021
  -   Achieved commercial production at Boston Shaker underground at Tropicana, on schedule and on budget                              
  -   Sought to maximise benefit of higher gold price through cost management, seeking to limit increases of costs year-on-year        
  -   Near quadrupling of free cash flow to $339m helped drive adjusted net debt down to $875m, its lowest since 2011                  
  -   Further increasing liquidity through issue of $700m 10-year bond at a record low coupon for AGA of 3.75% per annum               
  -   Continued progress towards replacing ore reserves, extending mine lives and improving operating flexibility through exploration  
  -   Increased the dividend payout ratio from 10% to 20% of free cash flow generated before growth capital                            
 
The Company continues to focus on safe production and the health of employees across all operations and ended the quarter with one
fatality and a 31% improvement in the all-injury frequency rate (AIFR), placing it at an all-time low at 2.23 per million hours worked.

Production improved by 1% year-on-year to 837,000oz and total cash costs increased by 2% to $801/oz, compared with 825,000oz at a total
cash cost of $786/oz in the same period in 2019. The solid production result was underpinned by strong performances at most sites, with
standout performances at Sunrise Dam and AGA Mineracao. The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued its ramp up, delivering a 52%
quarter-on-quarter increase in pre-production ounces. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose by only 1%, or $13/oz, to $1,044/oz in the third
quarter of 2020, compared to $1,031/oz in the third quarter of 2019. This largely reflected higher cash costs. COVID-19 related impacts 
resulted in AISC being approximately $51/oz higher for Q3 2020 due to approximately $22m COVID-19 related costs incurred ($33/oz) and 
approximately 18,000oz lost production at the South African operations ($18/oz).

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) increased by 72% to $803m, from $468m in the
third quarter of 2019. Cash flow was robust, demonstrating significant support from the rising gold price. Cash inflow from operating 
activities was up 56% to $551m, from $354m in the same period last year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends 
are calculated, increased by 104% to $361m during the quarter, compared to $177m in the third quarter of 2019.

Free cash flow after growth capital was $339m in the third quarter of 2020, this was a near fourfold increase from the $86m generated in the
comparable quarter of last year, as a result of a 30% higher gold price received, lower costs from continuing operations, lower capital
expenditure, partially offset by higher taxes paid. This free cash flow figure does not reflect a portion of the cash flows from Kibali, which
remain in the joint venture bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Cumulative cash receipts from the DRC for the
third quarter of 2020 totaled $38m, taking cumulative cash receipts received from Kibali (Jersey) Limited for the nine months ended
30 September 2020 to $92m. The Company's attributable share of the outstanding cash balance that has not yet been repatriated from the
DRC grew by $66m in the third quarter of 2020 to $359m. Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture,
continues to engage with the DRC government regarding remittance of this cash balance.

Cash flows were further impacted by VAT receivables that continue to be locked up at Geita ($130m) and Kibali ($68m) as well as by an
increase in lock-up of recoverable export duties at Cerro Vanguardia ($25m). The Finance Act 2020 (No. 8) became effective
on 1 July 2020 in Tanzania, amending the Value Added Tax Act, 2014 (No. 5) without retrospective effect, thereby allowing for the recovery of
VAT refunds for mineral exporters from July 2020 onwards. In Argentina, legislation was adopted to decrease the export duty rate from 12% to 
8% effective from the end of September 2020.

Adjusted net debt decreased to $875m at the end of September 2020, a 39% decline from the end of the previous quarter, and a 47%
reduction year-on-year. At quarter end, we concluded a 10-year $700m bond offering, priced at 3.75% per annum - the lowest achieved by
the Company for a bond offering - with the net proceeds directed to repaying a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the $1.4bn 
multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility in the next quarter. The initial proceeds of $200m received from the sale of the South 
African-producing assets were utilised to further reduce net debt. The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising the $1.4bn 
US dollar RCF of which approximately $700m is undrawn, the undrawn R4.0bn South African RCFs (the R2.5bn RCF was cancelled voluntarily
on 19 October 2020), and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1bn at 30 September 2020. The undrawn $1.0bn syndicated bridge
loan facility, originally entered into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, was
fully cancelled in early October. The Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet with an Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA target ratio of 1.0 times through the cycle.

The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 September 2020 was 0.36 times compared with 1.06 times as at 30 September
2019. This is the lowest point for this ratio since 2011, reflecting disciplined reduction in debt and robust cash generation from the business.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) decreased by 31% year-on-year to $161m in the third quarter of 2020,
compared to $234m in the third quarter of 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower project spend at Obuasi due to the impact of the
pandemic on delivery of supplies and restrictions on contractor movements and capitalised pre-production revenue offsetting a portion of the
growth capital spend during the quarter. As a result growth capital (non-sustaining) expenditure has declined 76% to $22m in the third quarter
of 2020, compared to $90m in the third quarter of 2019.

Total sustaining capital expenditure declined 3% to $139m in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $144m in the third quarter of 2019. 
Full-year guidance on sustaining capital expenditure for the continuing operations is forecast between $570m and $605m. The strategy of
improving operating flexibility through investment in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological
potential over the next two to three years, remains firmly on track.

OUTLOOK 2020

In line with historical trends, we expect a strong finish to the year, especially at Geita, as well as at the operations in Australia and Brazil. As
we previously flagged during the year, COVID-19 has resulted in some capital expenditure deferrals across the portfolio. At Obuasi, we
expect $70m to $90m of Phase 2 project capital rolling over into 2021.

We expect a significant step up in sustaining capital expenditure in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we invest in waste stripping at Iduapriem
and Tropicana and commence the planned developmental portal of a third underground mining area at the Geita Hill orebody. The portal will
commence from the west and the development will proceed along strike to the eastern extent of the orebody. Geita Hill underground mining
is forecast to start in 2021, having received the necessary regulatory approvals. These investments will be made in parallel with the ongoing
investments in Ore Reserve Development and Exploration.

In addition to tailings storage facilities (TSF) legislation passed in Brazil in 2019, further legislation specifically addressing the acceleration of
the decommissioning of existing TSFs and conversion thereof into dry-stacking structures was promulgated in the third quarter of 2020. It is
anticipated that the additional legislation will result in additional sustaining capital expenditure in 2020 of between $25m and $30m,
increasing to between $70m and $85m in 2021.

For the year-end Reserve declaration, we expect that Ore Reserve pricing will increase by $100/oz to $1,200/oz, reflecting the increased
long term gold price.

For the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to enforce capital and cost discipline across the business, ensuring that we continue to
deliver strong cash flow generation in the elevated gold price environment, while prioritising the health and wellbeing of our employees and
our host communities.

On 21 September 2020, the Company reinstated its annual guidance given improved operating certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and
in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of its South African assets, which occurred at the end of September 2020.

See the announcement : AngloGold Ashanti Reinstates 2020 Guidance on Growing Certainty and Anticipated Conclusion of SA Assets Sale

For 2020, in line with the unchanged reinstated guidance, the group is expected to produce between 3.030Moz and 3.100Moz, including nine
months of production from the South African-producing assets, or between 2.800Moz and 2.860Moz on a continuing operations basis. AISC
is expected to be between $1,060/oz and $1,120/oz including contributions from South African assets to the end of September 2020, or
between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz on a continuing operations basis. Sustaining capital expenditure is forecast between $610m and $650m,
and non-sustaining capital expenditure between $280m and $300m, or between $570m and $605m and between $280m and $300m on a
continuing operations basis, respectively. Total capital expenditure is expected to be between $890m and $950m, or between $850m and
$905m on a continuing operations basis.

Measures taken at our operations together with our business continuity plans aim to enable our operations to deliver in line with our
production targets; we however, remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts on communities and economies, and the actions
authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

Tragically, AngloGold Ashanti had one fatality for the quarter ended 30 September 2020. The group AIFR, the broadest measure of
workplace safety, improved by 31% year-on-year to 2.23 injuries per million hours worked for the quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 3.23 in the same period in 2019. AIFR measures workplace safety in terms of the total number of injuries and fatalities that
occur per million hours worked (by employees and contractors). Our safe production strategy continues at all operations, with a focus on
intensifying our employees' focus on safety practices in all workplaces in an effort to continue AngloGold Ashanti's sustainable safety
improvement.

All operations remain on high alert with respect to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we are actively dealing with both the
operational challenges and psychological effects associated with the virus as well as related protective measures, including lockdown
arrangements. The Company remains focused on the execution of its Safe Production Strategy as we aim to continually improve our safety
practices to ensure safe workplaces. Close tracking of High Potential Incidents and low-frequency, high consequence safety events remain
an important source of learning and encourage heightened awareness.

COVID-19

AngloGold Ashanti has taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and business, in line with the
Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in
which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our employees and our host communities remains our key priority. A cross-functional team,
including operations, technical, finance, health, community, government relations and other support disciplines, is helping to guide AngloGold
Ashanti's response to the crisis.

The Company has for some time employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped nonessential travel, instituted
mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures
to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It has also worked with local communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These
initiatives have complemented government responses in each of its operating jurisdictions. We remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic,
its impacts on communities and economies, and the actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

The impact from COVID-19 during the third quarter on production was estimated at 18,000oz, and $51/oz on AISC, an impact on costs of
around 5% ($33/oz impact related to costs incurred and $18/oz related to estimated lost production impacts). All of AngloGold Ashanti's
mines are now operating normally subject to updated protocols and various travel restrictions, except for Cerro Vanguardia which is currently
running at approximately 80% mining capacity due to continuing inter-provincial travel restrictions in Argentina currently preventing certain
employees to get to site. Production targets are still being achieved through processing existing stockpiles.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

Continuing operations

The Continental Africa region delivered a 6% increase in performance year-on-year, with gold production of 411,000oz (inclusive of
47,000oz of capitalised pre-production at Obuasi) at a total cash cost per ounce of $717/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 387,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $740/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
little changed at $903/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $900/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

In Ghana, gold production at Iduapriem was 69,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $646/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September
2020, compared to 73,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $854/oz for the same period last year. Production decreased by 5% year-on-
year due to reduced plant availability related to a longer-than-planned downtime. This was partially offset by 7% higher recovered grade, as a
result of higher feed grade to the plant in line with optimised grade control practices. Costs were favourably impacted by the higher grades,
efficiency gains and lower mining costs as well as favourable moves in stockpiles. These cost tailwinds were partially offset by the rise in
royalties linked to the higher gold price. 

A decision was taken to invest in and accelerate cut 2 waste stripping at the Block 7 and 8 pit, which will extend into 2021. A portion of the
high planned waste stripping in 2021 was brought forward to the fourth quarter in 2020. This will assist in reaching the ore zone earlier which
in turn would lead to a de-risked sequential mine plan in 2021. Further improvements in the crushing circuit via the addition of a tertiary
crusher has also been prioritised for the fourth quarter.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 152,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $628/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared
to 153,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $644/oz for the same period last year. Production was impacted by a 7% reduction in tonnes
treated, related to the installation of ball mill brackets and the annual mill inspection. This was largely offset by a 7% increase in recovered
grade, mainly due to the higher-grade ore sourced from the Nyankanga open pit. Mining at the pit bottom, which is nearing depletion,
continued and offset lower grades from underground operations. Costs were supported by the higher recovered grade and favourable
stockpile movements, which were partially offset by higher royalties, higher costs related to underground mining and an increase in freight
and clearing charges following the implementation by the Government of Tanzania, of a new clearing process for goods entering the country.

In the DRC, Kibali produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $651/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
91,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $586/oz for the same period last year. Production was flat year-on-year as higher throughput
offset the marginally lower recovered grades. Costs were negatively impacted year-on-year due to higher royalties, higher operational costs
and unfavourable movements in stockpiles.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 52,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,197/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared
to 51,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,075/oz for the same period last year. Production improved marginally year-on-year due to
5% higher recovered grade, which largely offset lower throughput. Throughput was lower due to power outages, as well as chute blockages
and a low feed rate to the mill. Total cash costs were 11% higher year-on-year due to an increase in processing costs as a result of the
increase in reagent consumption required for the high levels of carbon in the current period. Increases in the price of lime, cyanide and
activated carbon, as well as higher royalties paid, also negatively impacted costs.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Siguiri's production improved by 4%, which also resulted in a commensurate improvement in total cash costs
per ounce.

The Americas region produced 181,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $674/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 179,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $782/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$963/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,118/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

In Brazil, AGA Mineracao's production was 12% higher year-on-year at 103,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $683/oz for the third
quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to 92,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $847/oz for the same period last year. Production
was higher mainly due to 19% higher tonnes treated at Cuiaba, which was partially offset by lower recovered grade. Costs were favourably
impacted year-on-year due to higher gold production, a weaker exchange rate and lower acid production costs, partially offset by higher
inflation (mainly due to services, spare parts, fuel and power and mine contractors) as well as higher royalties paid.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, AGA Mineracao's production improved by 36%, with total cash costs per ounce improving by 21%.

At Serra Grande, production was 31,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $610/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 31,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $760/oz for the same period last year. Production was stable year-on-year, as higher
tonnes treated offset the lower recovered grade. Costs were 20% lower compared to last year, favourably impacted by an improvement in
efficiencies, a weaker exchange rate and a favourable movement in stockpiles, partially offset by higher inflation (mainly due to services and
power) as well as higher royalties paid.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 47,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $692/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September
2020, compared to 56,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $686/oz for the same period last year. Production was 16% lower year-on-year
due to lower underground ore throughput as a result of limitations imposed on the site by COVID-19, and the impact of lower grades, in line
with the life-of-mine plan. Costs were marginally higher year-on-year mainly due to salary increases, and higher royalties. These costs were
partially offset by higher by-product income derived from a higher average silver price, weaker exchange rate and favourable efficiencies
mainly derived from lower consumption of energy, maintenance services, explosives, other materials and spare parts.

The Australia region produced 149,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $932/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 146,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $775/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$1,174/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,066/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 74,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $967/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 60,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,153/oz for the same period last year. Production was 23% higher year-on-year
mainly due to higher head grade and a 4.5% increase in metallurgical recovery. The higher gold production, along with favourable inventory
movement, contributed to lower total cash costs.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Sunrise Dam's production improved by 25%, with total cash costs per ounce improving by 10%.

The recently discovered Frankie ore body within the Western Ramps complex at Sunrise Dam continued to deliver significant mineralised
intercepts during the quarter and a drilling platform is being developed to enable the area to be drilled at tighter spacing. During the quarter,
open pit mining of the Golden Delicious satellite deposit, 12km from the Sunrise Dam processing plant, was approved. Pre-stripping is now
underway and it is expected that the first ore will be mined in the second quarter of 2021. The pit is expected to deliver approximately
136,000oz over a 2.7 year life.

Production at Tropicana was 75,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $830/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
86,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $521/oz for the same period last year. Production was 13% lower year-on-year as planned, mainly
due to lower ore sourced from open pit mining, as well as the completion of grade streaming activities in the same period of 2019. Mill
throughput and metallurgical recoveries were higher than the same period last year, with the mill feed grade lower at 1.6 g/t reflecting the
completion of grade streaming and the greater proportion of stockpiled ore in mill feed. The lower production, along with unfavourable
inventory movement, contributed to an increase in the Tropicana total cash cost for the September quarter.

The Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana achieved commercial production on schedule, within budget in September. The
underground mine is expected to be at full capacity by the second half of 2021, to contribute approximately 100,000oz p.a. (100%) to annual
gold production over a seven year life.

Discontinued and held for sale operations

Discontinued operations

The South African region produced 96,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,140/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 113,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $973/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$1,324/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,132/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

Mponeng produced 58,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,094/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
65,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $967/oz for the same period last year. Production was 11% lower year-on-year mainly due to poor
ground conditions and safety stoppages combined with the revision of the production schedule post the COVID-19 lockdown. Production was
further impacted due to the lower overall recovered grade as a result of higher marginal ore dump tonnes treated to offset underground
volume losses. Costs increased year-on-year due to lower production, increases in labour costs and the price of consumables, higher royalty
costs, and unfavourable gold-in-process movements. These cost headwinds were partially offset by higher surface volumes treated and
favourable foreign exchange movements.

Surface Operations, including Mine Waste Solutions, produced 38,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,213/oz for the third quarter
ended 30 September 2020, compared to 48,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $982/oz for the same period last year. Production was
21% lower year-on-year due to the processing of lower grade tailings at the West Wits surface sources and low ore receiving availability at
Vaal River surface sources. This in turn had a negative impact on the overall recovered grade, which declined by 31% year-on-year.

Held for sale operations

In Mali, both our Morila and Sadiola operations are currently under separate sales processes and as such are treated as held for sale. We no
longer include production and ""Non-GAAP"" cost metrics for these operations. At Morila the mine continues to reprocess tailings material
according to plan with the objective of concluding re-processing in early 2021. At Sadiola, which is currently in limited operations, the mine
continues its stockpile treatment plan.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Project

Obuasi's redevelopment project continues to make steady progress. As previously highlighted, the COVID-19 pandemic caused some
construction delays and had the effect of limiting mining volumes. At Obuasi, construction of Phase 1 has been completed within budget,
while construction of Phase 2 of the project (to achieve 4,000tpd capacity) remains within budget and on track for completion towards the
end of the first quarter of 2021.

Operational Readiness

Phase 1 (2,000tpd capacity) continued pre-production for the quarter. Pre-production gold production was 47,000oz. Mining rates continued
to be constrained by skilled labour shortages caused by Australian international travel restrictions, though the focus on in-country recruitment
and training has helped bridge the gap. The mine plan has been revised to account for the COVID-19 limitations. This plan intends to
achieve the required ramp up in production in parallel with the construction schedule. Good progress is being made in the second production
area at Block 8-Lower.

Phase 2 Construction

Phase 2 construction reached 78.1% completion, compared to 68.4% at end of the prior quarter. Commissioning of the Phase 2 mill
continues to target early 2021. The KRS shaft, paste-fill plant and the GCVS ventilation shaft continue to target completion at the end of the
first quarter of 2021. The ramp up of Phase 2 capacity to 4,000tpd (~1.7Mtpa) is planned to commence in the second quarter of 2021.

Tropicana - Boston Shaker

On 17 September 2020, we announced that commercial production has been declared at the Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana.
The first production stope was fired in June 2020 and underground ore production has now reached an annualised production rate of 0.7
Mtpa with the design production rate expected to be achieved in March 2021. Boston Shaker is expected to deliver approximately 1.1 million
tonnes of ore per annum at an estimated grade of 3.5 grams/tonne, contributing approximately 100,000 ounces per annum (100% basis) to
gold production over a seven-year mine life.

A decision was made in the second quarter of 2020 to invest in the next cutback of the Havana pit (Stage 2) which is expected to allow
access to the deeper Havana open pit ore from 2022 onwards. While this cutback is being completed, mill feed will be sourced from the
Boston Shaker open pit, resulting in a lower milled grade over the period. The lower grade will be partially offset by the Boston Shaker
underground mine, which is ramping up and is expected to be contributing at full capacity by the second half of 2021.

We still expect gold production (at 100%) in 2020 and 2021, to be between 400,000oz and 450,000oz. From 2022 onwards, annual gold
production is expected to normalise at between 450,000oz and 500,000oz as the low grade stockpile ore in the mill feed is displaced by a
larger proportion of Boston Shaker underground ore and an increasing contribution of higher grade ore from the Havana pit, as the cutback
progresses.

Colombian projects

Quebradona

At our fully owned Quebradona project, the Feasibility Study (FS) continues to progress. The operations team is continuing with construction
readiness, environmental impact assessment (EIA) permitting, optimisation of the capital expenditure requirements which is currently
estimated around $1.3bn and $1.4bn over the first four to five years, and reviewing operational excellence opportunities to improve operating
costs and further enhance the project returns. The work on the FS is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. The project is
expected to treat 6.2Mtpa to produce 3,000Mlb of copper and 1.5Moz of gold over a potential twenty three year life with first production
expected to start in 2025.

Gramalote

During the third quarter of 2020, work continued to advance for infrastructure design, process plant design, pit design and social initiatives.
Resource modelling is anticipated to be completed in November 2020 at which time the final phase of the Gramalote FS work will proceed
based upon updated project parameters. The Gramalote FS work, now managed by B2Gold, our 50% partner, is expected to be completed
in the first quarter of 2021.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Asset sales

South Africa assets

AngloGold Ashanti reached an agreement and concluded the sale of its remaining South African producing assets to Harmony Gold Mining
Company Limited (Harmony Gold). These assets include the Mponeng mine as well as the Surface Operations, including Mine Waste
Solutions. The sale was part of the process of streamlining the AngloGold Ashanti portfolio. The sale transaction was completed on
30 September 2020 resulting in Harmony Gold taking full ownership of the assets and associated liabilities from 1 October 2020 and making
the initial cash payment of $200m.

See the announcement: AngloGold Ashanti Announces Closing of South African Asset Sale, Receipt of Proceeds

Mali assets

On 31 August 2020, AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold agreed to sell their effective 80% stake in the Morila Gold Mine in Mali, to Mali
Lithium. The consideration payable for the purchase is estimated at between $22m and $27m, with the final amount determined with
reference to the closing balance of tax credits in Morila. AngloGold Ashanti estimates that its share of the net consideration will be
approximately $10m or less. On 28 October 2020, we were advised that Mali Lithium had secured the required acquisition finance and that
this condition has been satisfied. Closing of the transaction is anticipated to take place soon.

See the announcement: AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Agree to Sell Morila Mine Stake to Mali Lithium

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD Corporation and Allied Gold Corp) remain committed to the
fulfilment of the conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Progress has been made in the fulfilment of the various conditions
precedent, which include certain approvals by the Government of Mali. However, political instability and related events in Mali have delayed
the process from the originally anticipated timeline. All parties are nevertheless actively working to achieve a solution and closing as soon as
possible.

Bond Issue

On 1 October 2020, AngloGold Ashanti issued an aggregate principal amount of $700m 10-year bonds with a coupon of 3.75% per annum.
The notes were issued by AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and are unsecured and fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by AngloGold Ashanti. The net proceeds from the bond financing have been used to repay a portion of the
outstanding borrowings under the US$1.4bn multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility, which is expected to remain the Company's
primary short-term funding facility. Subsequent to the bond issue, the undrawn $1.0bn syndicated bridge loan facility, originally entered 
into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, was fully cancelled.

Tanzania Arbitration Proceedings Update

The arbitral proceedings against the Government of Tanzania have been stayed at the request of the parties since 15 January 2019 in order
to afford them the opportunity to achieve an amicable resolution of the dispute. On 28 May 2020, the Arbitral Tribunal granted another
extension to stay the arbitral proceedings until 11 September 2020, which has since then been further stayed until 12 March 2021.

Dividend Policy Update

In recognition of the increase in profit margins and the ongoing reduction in borrowings and leverage, going forward, the Company will pay
shareholders 20% of free cash flow before growth capital expenditure, increased from 10% previously. Proceeds from asset sales are excluded 
from this formula. The Company will also double the frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.

The board will continue to exercise discretion in determining the quantum of the dividend, dependent on market conditions and capital requirements.

expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements,
growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of
commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold
Ashanti's liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental

forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially
from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and
operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome
of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and
operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the Risk

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Doubles Dividend Payout Ratio on Stronger Balance Sheet,
Improved Margins

(Press Release – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti will double its dividend payout ratio,
recognising the increase in profit margins and the ongoing reduction in borrowings and
leverage.

The Company will now pay shareholders 20% of its free cash flow before accounting for growth
capital expenditure, increased from 10% previously. The Company will also double the
frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.
Proceeds from asset sales are excluded from this formula.

“This move demonstrates confidence in our ability to improve direct returns to shareholders
whilst self-funding our growth projects and sustaining capital requirements,” said Christine
Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s interim Chief Executive Officer.

AngloGold Ashanti has prioritised capital discipline and debt reduction over the past five years.
Over that period, it has reduced its Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio from a 2.29
times ratio at 30 September 2015, to a 0.36 times ratio at 30 September 2020. Over the same
period, margins have widened, helped by operating efficiencies and a rising gold price. The
Company has not issued new equity to shareholders for more than a decade.

The board will continue to exercise discretion in determining the quantum of the dividend,
dependent on market conditions and capital requirements.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Announces Closing of South African Asset Sale, Receipt of Proceeds

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that the sale of its remaining mines in
South Africa to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited has concluded, and the initial $200 million
cash payment has been received.

Harmony will now assume full ownership of the portfolio of assets and associated liabilities from
tomorrow, 1 October 2020. This follows the unconditional approval of the transaction by South
Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, earlier this month.

The proceeds from the transaction will be used to further reduce debt.

“Concluding this sale has been important to the execution of our strategy, while also providing
certainty for the long-term and responsible development of these assets,” said Christine Ramon, the
interim Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti. “We wish the employees of our South African
operations all the very best in future as they embark on this new chapter in the life of these assets.”

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those
concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs,
all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth
prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project
milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and
production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity
and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or
regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s
operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements
to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking
statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory
environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or
epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of
such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.
Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes
no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All
subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are
qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce the pricing of an offering of US$700
million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). Subject to customary
conditions, the offering is expected to close on 1 October 2020. The Notes will be issued by AngloGold
Ashanti Holdings plc (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and will be unsecured and
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The net proceeds from the bond financing will be used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings
under the US$1.4 billion multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility, which will remain the Company’s
primary short-term funding facility. In addition, the undrawn US$1.0 billion syndicated bridge loan facility,
originally entered into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the
COVID-19 pandemic, will be automatically canceled in an amount equal to the net proceeds from the
offering.

Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities, CIBC Capital Markets, Citigroup, Deutsche
Bank, J.P. Morgan, RBC Capital Markets, Scotiabank and Standard Chartered Bank are joint bookrunners

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Reinstates 2020 Guidance on Growing Certainty and Anticipated Conclusion of
SA Assets Sale

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti today reinstated annual guidance given
improved operating certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of
its South African assets at the end of this month.

On 14 September 2020, it was announced that all conditions precedent have been met with respect to the sale
of its remaining mines in South Africa (“the transaction”) to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited
(“Harmony”). Consequently, the transaction is scheduled to close in accordance with the transaction
agreement on 30 September 2020, upon which Harmony will assume full ownership and operation of all assets
and liabilities that form part of the transaction.

“We’re pleased to reintroduce guidance, which reflects our greater certainty in relation to full year operating
performance,” said Christine Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s interim Chief Executive Officer. “Our operators have
done an outstanding job managing through this period – limiting the impact of COVID-19 on production and
costs, while prioritising the health of our employees and host communities.”

Annual guidance on financial and operating metrics was withdrawn on 27 March 2020 as the pandemic
accelerated and many governments responded by restricting travel, closing borders and ordering some
businesses to cease or limit operations. The Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina, Serra Grande in Brazil and
all South African operations were ordered to close for varying periods, while border closures slowed down the
Obuasi Redevelopment Project. All subsequently returned to full production, whilst the completion date for the
Obuasi project was moved out by three months to the end of the first quarter next year and it remains on track
to meet that schedule.

The Company benefited from its diversified global portfolio and careful management during the intervening
period, with the impact in the first half of the year limited to 85,000oz – or approximately 3% of production –
and $53/oz, or approximately 5% of the all-in sustaining cost during the period. Most of this impact was related
to the South African assets, where the Mponeng mine was ordered to close from 26 March 2020 and only
resumed production on 4 May 2020, after which it was initially allowed to ramp up to just 50% of capacity. The
mine was closed again on 24 May 2020 until 1 June 2020.

AngloGold Ashanti has taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and
business, in line with the Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our
employees and our host communities remains our key priority. A cross-functional team, including operations,
technical, finance, health, community, government relations and other support disciplines, is helping to guide
the response to the crisis.

The Company has for some time employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped non-
essential travel, instituted mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness
across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It
has also worked with local communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These initiatives have
complemented government responses in each of its operating jurisdictions.

While we expect that these measures together with our business continuity plans will enable our operations to
deliver in line with our production targets, we remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts on
communities and economies, and the actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

NEWS RELEASE
Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana achieves commercial production

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, in conjunction with its joint venture partner IGO Ltd,
is pleased to announce that commercial production has been declared at the Boston Shaker
underground mine at Tropicana in Western Australia.

Tropicana, located 330 kilometres east-northeast of Kalgoorlie, is managed by AngloGold Ashanti
Australia (AGAA) with a 70% interest. IGO holds a 30% interest.

Development of the Boston Shaker mine was approved in March 2019, and the mine transitioned
into commercial production this month on schedule, below the A$105.7 million (US$77 million)
budget and importantly, with no recordable safety incidents.

Boston Shaker will deliver approximately 1.1 million tonnes of ore per annum at an estimated grade
of 3.5 grams/tonne, contributing approximately 100,000 ounces per annum1 to gold production
over a seven-year mine life.

“Underground mining at Boston Shaker will leverage further value from this high performing
operation, achieving payback in just over three years with upside potential as the deposit remains
open at depth,” AngloGold Ashanti SVP Australia Michael Erickson said.

“The underground mine will contribute higher grade mill feed from the current quarter onwards,
improving the gold production profile and enhancing cash flow during calendar 2021-2023 when
the mine plan includes periods of higher waste stripping in the Havana open pit.”

The first production stope was fired in June 2020 and underground ore production has now
reached an annualized production rate of 0.7 Mtpa with the design production rate expected to be
achieved in March 2021.

The commercial production milestone at Boston Shaker comes after Tropicana produced its 3
millionth ounce in March this year, just seven years after pouring first gold in September 2013.

1   At 100%.

Tropicana strategy and production outlook

From commencement of the operation at Tropicana the mining strategy has been designed to
optimize cash flow, NPV and the delivery of ore.

The Tropicana, Havana, Havana South and Boston Shaker open pits have been mined as a series
of cutbacks, sequenced and scheduled to maximize value at a mining rate that delivers the best
mining unit cost for the scale of the operation. Up until June 2020 ore production from the open
pits exceeded the plant capacity, allowing higher grade ore to be preferentially treated (grade
streaming) while lower grade ore was accumulated on stockpiles.

Over the course of H2 2019 and H1 2020 the Tropicana pit and Havana pit were completed, in line
with the mine plan. As a result, grade streaming came to an end and stockpiled ore is currently
being used to supplement the mill feed from the Havana South and Boston Shaker pits.

A decision was made in the June 2020 quarter to invest in the next cutback of the Havana pit
(Stage 2) which will allow access to the deeper Havana open pit ore from 2022 onwards. While
this cutback is being completed, mill feed will be sourced from the Boston Shaker open pit,
supplemented by approximately 4 Mtpa of low grade (0.85 – 1.05 g/t) stockpiled ore, resulting in a
lower milled grade over the period.

The lower grade will be partially offset by the Boston Shaker underground mine, which is ramping
up and will be contributing at full capacity by the second half of calendar 2021. The plan remains
for gold production (at 100%) in 2020 and 2021, to be between 400,000 and 450,000 oz, compared
to 513,785 oz last year.

From 2022 onwards, annual gold production will normalize at between 450,000 – 500,000 oz as
the low grade stockpile ore in the mill feed is displaced by a larger proportion of Boston Shaker
underground ore and an increasing contribution of higher grade ore from the Havana pit, as the
cutback progresses.

For Figure 1 illustrating tonnes milled by ore source, please refer to the PDF version of the
announcement: https://www.anglogoldashanti.com/investors/announcements/

Cost guidance

Operating costs from 2020 onwards increase with the addition of the Boston Shaker underground
mine. All other costs remain stable, with open pit mining volumes being maintained year-on-year.
All-in-sustaining costs (AISC) increase due to four factors:

•   Lower production – lower year-on-year production spreading fixed costs over a smaller
    volume of production

•   Investment in Havana Stage 2 cut back – Total open pit mining costs are consistent with
    prior years. The focus shifts to waste movement as the Havana stage 2 cut-back continues
    through 2021 and into 2022. The benefit of the cut-back can be seen from the second half of
    calendar 2022 onwards as ore mining and gold production ramps back up.

•   Underground mining costs – additional mining costs with the inclusion of underground
    mining costs from the Boston Shaker underground mine into the operation’s cost structure
•      Non-cash cost elements – In prior years where the operation has mined and built stockpiles,
       costs incurred were accounted for as inventory adjustments and have had the effect of
       enhancing (decreasing) AISC. In 2020 and 2021, as stockpiles are drawn down, the
       associated costs are transferred from the balance sheet to the profit and loss statement, which
       has the effect adding a largely non-cash component to AISC.

Growth Opportunities

Significant potential remains to unlock known extensions of mineralisation beneath the Tropicana
and Havana open pits and the extensions at depth of the Boston Shaker Underground.

Development of an underground drill drive from the Boston Shaker Decline is well advanced with
a total of 240 m completed to date. The drill drive is well positioned to also provide production
access to the Tropicana underground reserve should the drilling prove successful. Underground
diamond drilling is scheduled for the December 2020 quarter with a decision to mine expected
during 2021.

Final trade-off studies are currently being completed on the Havana Stage 3 open pit cut-back and
Havana underground to determine the optimal open pit – underground interface. A decision on the
way forward for Havana Stage 3 is expected to be made during 2021.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Receives Unconditional Approval for the Sale of its South African Mines

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that all conditions precedent have
been met with respect to the sale of its remaining mines in South Africa (“the transaction”) to Harmony
Gold Mining Company Limited (“Harmony”). This includes the unconditional approval by the Department
of Mineral Resources and Energy (“DMRE”) for the transfer of the West Wits mineral rights from
AngloGold Ashanti to Harmony. Consequently, the transaction is scheduled to close in accordance with
the transaction agreement on 30 September 2020, upon which Harmony will assume full ownership and
operation of all assets and liabilities that form part of the transaction.

AngloGold Ashanti is well-positioned to safely deliver better returns as its focus narrows on growing
free cash flow and shareholder dividends, while investing in its next generation of opportunities. “While
the decision to sell our South African assets was not an easy one, we are pleased that the assets are
going to Harmony, a capable and responsible operator that will ensure their long-term sustainability,”
Christine Ramon, Interim CEO of AngloGold Ashanti said. “We can now sharpen our focus to pursue
high return projects at several of our key assets, deliver new ounces from the world class Obuasi mine
in Ghana, and advance studies in Colombia, a new frontier for our business.”

Consideration for the transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around
$300 million, subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits are
developed below current infrastructure. Harmony will pay US$200 million in cash on completion of the
transaction. Furthermore, Harmony has agreed to pay to AngloGold Ashanti:

    • a contingent compensation of US$260 per ounce on underground gold production from the
        Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona mines that exceeds 250,000 ounces per annum for a period
        of six years commencing on 1 January 2021. This is valued at approximately US$100 million
        based on AngloGold Ashanti's current production forecast; and
    • a contingent compensation of US$20 per ounce in relation to underground production sourced
        within the West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona mines)
        below the current infrastructure if it is developed.

The transaction is in line with AngloGold Ashanti’s aim to continually improve its portfolio and supports
its disciplined approach to the allocation of capital and other resources to ensure maximum value
generation for all shareholders. This, together with the pending sales of the Company’s assets in Mali,
will result in a streamlined, high-margin business with quality assets and a robust pipeline for growth.
Gross cash proceeds from the transaction will be applied to further debt reduction.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Agree to Sell Morila Mine Stake to Mali Lithium

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold have agreed to sell their effective 80% stake
in the Morila Gold Mine in Mali, to Mali Lithium.

Mali Lithium will buy Morila Limited, a Jersey-based company, which is equally owned by AngloGold
and Barrick. Morila Limited owns 80% of Société des Mines de Morila SA (Morila SA), a Malian
registered company in which the State of Mali owns a 20% interest, and in turn owns the Morila Gold
Mine. The transaction is consistent with AngloGold Ashanti’s strategy of rationalising its portfolio to
focus its capital and other resources to maximise returns to its shareholders and other stakeholders.

Morila Gold Mine halted mining operations in 2019, and is currently processing only ore stockpiles. It
produced 27,000oz of gold in 2019. Mali Lithium, based in Perth, Western Australia, aims to increase
sustainable production at Morila Gold Mine as quickly as possible after acquisition. Under the new
ownership structure, the mine has the potential to utilise existing infrastructure to access additional
resources and extend the life of mine using different planning and evaluation criteria, benefiting Morila’s
in-country stakeholders.

The consideration payable for the purchase is estimated at between US$22 million and US$27 million,
with the final amount determined with reference to the closing balance of tax credits in Morila SA. The
consideration received will be allocated against the interests that AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold
hold in Morila Limited, as well as intercompany loans that Barrick Gold Group holds against Morila SA.

AngloGold Ashanti estimates that its share of the net consideration will be approximately US$10m or
less in accordance with the above. Accordingly, this is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements.

The closing of the transaction is conditional on, among others, Mali Lithium securing acquisition finance
and that the deal be acknowledged without objection by the Government of Mali.

Barrick Gold, the operator of Morila Gold Mine, has agreed to work with Mali Lithium on a transition plan
to ensure continuity of key mine management personnel and operations.

AngloGold Ashanti Weathers COVID-19 Disruptions to Post Surge in Free Cash Flow

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti withstood COVID-19-related
disruptions to deliver a solid first half production performance and a surge in free cash flow
generation to $177m, most of it coming in the three months to June 2020.

Free cash flow rose to an inflow of $177m for the first six months of the year, compared to an
outflow of $31m in the same period last year. Of that amount, $173m was generated in the
second quarter of the year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends
are calculated, rose 376% - or nearly fivefold - to $324m.

“The business is in excellent shape - cash flows are extremely robust, demonstrating the
significant operating leverage we have to this strong gold price,” Kelvin Dushnisky, outgoing
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AngloGold Ashanti, said. “While the recent rally in the gold
price is welcome, tight cost and capital management will continue to be the key focus areas
for us as we work to capture this widening margin and increase reserves.”

AngloGold Ashanti is investing in the redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, as well as
exploration and ore reserve development to increase its operating flexibility and increase
reserves. Interim CEO Christine Ramon will continue to focus on the inward investment
programme, with rigorous capital allocation guidelines including leverage and return targets.

Operating Performance

Production in the six months ended 30 June 2020 was 1.469Moz at a total cash cost per ounce
of $810/oz, compared to 1.554Moz at $792/oz for the first six months of last year. Geita
delivered an outstanding performance, Serra Grande posted a strong recovery from the first
quarter while Kibali, Iduapriem, Tropicana and AGA Mineração delivered steady production.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,031/oz for the first six months of 2020, compared to an
AISC of $1,002/oz for the corresponding period last year.

The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on production in the first half of the year was limited to an
estimated 85,000oz, of which 63,000oz related to the South African operations. AISC were
impacted by $53/oz.

Second quarter production increased 5% over the first quarter of 2020, rising to 753,000oz
from 716,000oz. Quarter-on-quarter production improvements were recorded at Sunrise Dam,
Serra Grande, Iduapriem, Obuasi, Geita, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA).
Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of the year increased by 59% to $1.096bn compared
to $689m during the first half of last year, helped by a 26% year-on-year increase in the gold
price received and weaker local currency impacts.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued to ramp up, delivering 50,000oz in the first half
of 2020 despite delays in receiving equipment and the arrival of certain critical skills to the site
as a result of lockdowns in various jurisdictions, with Phase 2 ramp-up expected by the end of
the first quarter of next year.

Free cash flow before growth capital – the metric on which dividends are calculated –
increased significantly to $324m in the first half of 2020, compared to $68m for the same
period in 2019. Cash flows were impacted by VAT that continues to be locked up at Geita and
Kibali, with balances owing at the end of June 2020 of $131m and $71m respectively. At the
end of June 2020, the Company’s attributable share of the outstanding cash balances awaiting
repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)amounted to $293m. Barrick
Gold Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with
the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining Code and the cash repatriation.

The sale processes related to South Africa and Mali continue to progress, with final conditions
precedent to be fulfilled, and the decision was taken to retain CVSA.

The first production stope in Tropicana’s Boston Shaker underground mine was fired in June
2020 and the project remains on track to achieve commercial production in the second half of
2020. The work on the Feasibility Study at the Quebradona project is progressing and is now
expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. At the Gramalote project, our joint venture
partner, B2Gold Corp expects to complete the Feasibility Study in the first quarter of 2021.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued
reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2020
was 0.67 times, well below the targeted level of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 18% to $1.428bn at 30 June 2020, from $1.739bn at 30 June
2019. In order to safeguard the balance sheet during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company
took proactive steps to further bolster liquidity. As at 30 June 2020, the Company’s liquidity
remained strong with approximately $2.47bn available, including cash and cash equivalents
of $1.29bn.

Safety

Regrettably, there was one fatality in the second quarter, involving a Long-haul Dump operator
who was fatally injured in a Heavy Mobile Equipment related incident at Obuasi. Subsequent
to the end of the second quarter, a security guard was fatally injured at the Obuasi mine when
he was struck by a private vehicle that veered off the road. In addition, we have previously
reported four fatalities in the first quarter, which occurred in two separate safety incidents in
March at the Mponeng mine. The tragic occurrence of these fatal incidents remains a stark
reminder that we must continue to redouble our efforts to make sure our employees return
home safely each day.

CEO Change and Executive Team Update

On 30 July 2020, AngloGold Ashanti announced that Mr. Kelvin Dushnisky decided to step
down as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Director, effective 1 September 2020.
The Board of Directors of the Company (Board) thanks Kelvin for his role in advancing
AngloGold Ashanti’s strategy and wishes him the very best in the future. Kelvin will remain in
Toronto to spend time with his family but will be available to assist the group with a smooth
handover until 28 February 2021.

“Kelvin has done an excellent job in delivering on the Company’s strategy and leaves
AngloGold Ashanti in solid shape, with an improving portfolio, robust cash flows and ongoing
debt reduction,” Sipho M. Pityana, AngloGold Ashanti’s Chairman, said.

The Board is also pleased to announce the appointment of Ms. Christine Ramon, currently
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Executive Director, as Interim CEO. Christine will assume
the role from 1 September 2020, while the Board embarks on a comprehensive
recruitment process to find a new permanent CEO. Mr. Ian Kramer, currently Senior Vice
President: Group Finance, will assume the role of Interim CFO for the duration of the

The information on this page is provided for the AngloGold Ashanti group as a whole. Following the announcement of the South Africa assets sale, the South African
operations are classified as an asset held for sale and recorded as a discontinued operation in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months
ended 30 June 2020.
AngloGold Ashanti withstood COVID-19-related disruptions to deliver a solid first half production performance and a surge in free cash flow
generation to $177m, most of it coming in the three months to June 2020.

Free cash flow rose to an inflow of $177m for the first six months of the year, compared to an outflow of $31m in the same period last year.
Of that amount, $173m was generated in the second quarter of the year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends
are calculated, rose 376% - or nearly fivefold - to $324m.

“The business is in excellent shape - cash flows are extremely robust, demonstrating the significant operating leverage we have to this
strong gold price,” Kelvin Dushnisky, outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AngloGold Ashanti, said. “While the recent rally in the gold
price is welcome, tight cost and capital management will continue to be the key focus areas for us as we work to capture this widening
margin and increase reserves.”

AngloGold Ashanti is investing in the redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, as well as exploration and ore reserve development to
increase its operating flexibility and increase reserves. Interim CEO Christine Ramon will continue to focus on the inward investment
programme, with rigorous capital allocation guidelines including leverage and return targets.

Operating Performance

Production in the six months ended 30 June 2020 was 1.469Moz at a total cash cost per ounce of $810/oz, compared to 1.554Moz at $792/
oz for the first six months of last year. Geita delivered an outstanding performance, Serra Grande posted a strong recovery from the first
quarter while Kibali, Iduapriem, Tropicana and AGA Mineração delivered steady production.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,031/oz for the first six months of 2020, compared to an AISC of $1,002/oz for the corresponding
period last year.

The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on production in the first half of the year was limited to an estimated 85,000oz, of which 63,000oz related
to the South African operations. AISC were impacted by $53/oz.

Second quarter production increased 5% over the first quarter of 2020, rising to 753,000oz from 716,000oz. Quarter-on-quarter production
improvements were recorded at Sunrise Dam, Serra Grande, Iduapriem, Obuasi, Geita, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA).

Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of the year increased by 59% to $1.096bn compared to $689m during the first half of last year,
helped by a 26% year-on-year increase in the gold price received and weaker local currency impacts.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued to ramp up, delivering 50,000oz in the first half of 2020 despite delays in receiving equipment
and the arrival of certain critical skills to the site as a result of lockdowns in various jurisdictions, with Phase 2 ramp-up expected by the end
of the first quarter of next year.

Free cash flow before growth capital – the metric on which dividends are calculated – increased significantly to $324m in the first half of
2020, compared to $68m for the same period in 2019. Cash flows were impacted by VAT that continues to be locked up at Geita and Kibali,
with balances owing at the end of June 2020 of $131m and $71m respectively. At the end of June 2020, the Company’s attributable share of
the outstanding cash balances awaiting repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) amounted to $293m. Barrick Gold
Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining
Code and the cash repatriation.

The sale processes related to South Africa and Mali continue to progress, with final conditions precedent to be fulfilled, and the decision was
taken to retain CVSA.

The first production stope in Tropicana’s Boston Shaker underground mine was fired in June 2020 and the project remains on track to
achieve commercial production in the second half of 2020. The work on the Feasibility Study at the Quebradona project is progressing and
is now expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. At the Gramalote project, our joint venture partner, B2Gold Corp. expects to
complete the Feasibility Study in the first quarter of 2021.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2020 was 0.67 times, well below the targeted level of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 18% to $1.428bn at 30 June 2020, from $1.739bn at 30 June 2019. In order to safeguard the balance sheet
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took proactive steps to further bolster liquidity. As at 30 June 2020, the Company’s liquidity
remained strong with approximately $2.47bn available, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.29bn.

Safety

Regrettably, there was one fatality in the second quarter, involving a Long-haul Dump operator who was fatally injured in a Heavy Mobile
Equipment related incident at Obuasi. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, a security guard was fatally injured at the Obuasi mine
when he was struck by a private vehicle that veered off the road. In addition, we have previously reported four fatalities in the first quarter,
which occurred in two separate safety incidents in March at the Mponeng mine. The tragic occurrence of these fatal incidents remains a
stark reminder that we must continue to redouble our efforts to make sure our employees return home safely each day.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI CEO TO STEP DOWN

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti announces that Kelvin Dushnisky will step down as chief
executive officer (CEO), effective 1 September 2020. The Board thanks Kelvin for his contribution in
delivering on its strategy and wishes him well in the future. Kelvin will remain in Toronto to spend time
with his family but will be available to assist the group with a smooth handover until 28 February 2021.

“I would like to thank Kelvin for his role in advancing our strategy, and wish him the very best for the
future,” AngloGold Ashanti Chairman Sipho Pityana said. “AngloGold Ashanti is well positioned to
further improve returns for shareholders, through improved operational performance and our rigorous
approach to capital allocation.”

Kelvin leaves AngloGold Ashanti in solid shape, with robust cash flows aiding ongoing debt reduction.
The quality of the portfolio continues to improve, with the agreed sale of our South African assets in
progress, the Obuasi Redevelopment Project ramping up to full production, our two high-quality
Colombia projects progressing through feasibility-study stage, and initiatives to increase reserve life at
key assets, progressing well.

“I’ve enjoyed the challenge of leading AngloGold Ashanti over these past two years, during which time
we’ve made tremendous progress on many fronts, from safety, to effective capital deployment and
streamlining the asset base, all while continuing to deliver strong returns,” Dushnisky said. “I’d like to
thank my executive team and employees across the business for their hard work and dedication, and
the Board for its support.”

Transitional Arrangements

The Board is pleased to announce that Christine Ramon currently chief financial officer (CFO), has
been appointed Interim CEO, whilst the Board embarks on a comprehensive recruitment process to
find a new CEO to deliver on the Group’s strategy for enhanced value creation. Christine will assume
the role on 1 September 2020. The recruitment process will be designed to search for the candidate
with strong leadership skills and relevant industry experience as well as values which are aligned with
AngloGold Ashanti’s.

Christine brings extensive experience and knowledge of the business to the interim role. A chartered
accountant, she has been an executive director of AngloGold Ashanti’s Board and a member of its
executive management team for the past six years. Prior to that, Christine held senior management and
executive positions in various companies, including CFO at Sasol from 2006 to 2013 after having served
as CEO of Johnnic Holdings. Ian Kramer, currently Senior Vice President: Group Finance, will assume
the role of Interim CFO for the duration of the transition period.
During this transitional period the Board, primarily through the Investment Committee and Audit and
Risk Committee, will provide additional guidance and support to the executive management team.

Looking ahead, the Board and executive management have maintained a clear set of near-term
priorities, including safe navigation of the Covid-19 pandemic, prioritising the welfare and safety of our
people and the support of healthcare systems in host communities, while also ensuring continued
operating improvements.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (the “Period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 7 August 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Expected Headline Earnings and Basic Earnings

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings for the
Period are expected to be between $392 million and $416 million, with headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) of between US 94 cents and US 99 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative
period in 2019 were $120 million and US 29 cents, respectively.

The total basic earnings from continuing and discontinued operations (“basic earnings”) for the Period
are expected to be between $410 million and $432 million, resulting in total basic earnings per share
from continuing and discontinued operations (“EPS”) of between US 97 cents and US 102 cents. The
basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were $114 million and US 27 cents, respectively.

The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings for the Period compared to the
comparative period were primarily due to the following reasons:

•      The gold price received increased by more than 25%;
•      Weaker local currencies mitigated increases in cost of sales;
•      Higher foreign exchange gains of $19 million;
•      Income from joint ventures, mainly Kibali, increased by $41 million (post-tax) or US 10 cents per
       share; and
•      Care & maintenance costs of $21 million (post-tax) or US 5 cents per share incurred at Obuasi
       in the prior year were not repeated in the current Period.

The increases in earnings were partly offset by:
•      Higher taxes, withholding taxes and royalties paid in most jurisdictions and deferred taxes raised
       in Brazil on foreign exchange movements relating to non-monetary assets;
•      Negative movements on realised and unrealised oil and gold derivatives of $18 million (post-
       tax) of US 4 cents per share;
•      Discounting of the Argentine export duties receivable resulted in a decrease in earnings of $11
       million (post-tax) or US 3 cents per share; and
•      A Brazilian power utility legal settlement received in April 2019 of $11 million (post-tax) or US 3
       cents per share not repeated in the current period.

In addition to the above, earnings were favourably impacted in the current Period by $17 million (post-
tax) relating to the non-cash impairment reversal on the South African producing assets and related
liabilities classified as held for sale as a result of the agreement to sell these assets to Harmony Gold
Mining Company Limited. For headline earnings purposes, the impairment reversal is excluded.

South African asset sale and impact of IFRS 5

On 12 February 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited for consideration in
cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of $300 million, subject to subsequent
performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits assets are developed below current
infrastructure.

In terms of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, the Company has determined that the sale of its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities are required to be treated as non-current assets held for sale
and disclosed as discontinued operations. This accounting treatment resulted in the separation of the
earnings disclosures between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the current period
results. Comparative periods will be restated on the same basis.

The effect of the application of IFRS 5 on the current and comparative period earnings will be explained
in the Company’s results announcement on 7 August 2020, which shareholders should consider in
order to gain a full appreciation of the Company’s financial performance.

Operational Performance – Continuing and Discontinued Operations

Production for the six months ended 30 June 2020 is expected to be 1.469Moz, compared to 1.554Moz
for the first six months of 2019. AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid production performance for the first
half of the year, especially given the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance
was supported by strong second-quarter performances from Geita, Iduapriem and Serra Grande, as
well as steady production from Kibali and AGA Mineração. Notable production improvements quarter-
on-quarter were recorded at Sunrise Dam, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA). The Obuasi
Redevelopment Project continues to ramp up and was impacted by the delays in receiving equipment
and in the arrival of certain critical skills to site due to Covid-19.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported
on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth
prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project

unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements
to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking
statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in

environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or

such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.
Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes
no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for
the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating
results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including
the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and production
projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures
and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking
statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that
the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have
been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other
government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings,
any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and
other factors. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause
AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also
have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold
Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking
statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

This communication may contain certain “Non-GAAP” financial measures. AngloGold Ashanti utilises certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in
managing its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the reported operating results or cash flow
from operations or any other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures other companies may use.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti provides further update on COVID-19 cases at Mponeng Mine

25 May, Johannesburg - AngloGold Ashanti advises that, following the announcement made
on 24 May 2020, the full processing of tests from the COVID-19 testing initiative at its Mponeng
Mine is now complete, with 651 tests completed and processed, yielding 196 positive cases.

In the vast majority of these cases, the individuals were asymptomatic, with the balance
showing very mild symptoms. The initiative was undertaken following the detection of a
positive COVID-19 case at the mine last week, after which a comprehensive screening,
contact tracing and testing programme was embarked upon. All positive cases continue to be
isolated in line with national health protocols, with on-site isolation facilities available for those
who may need them.

Operations at Mponeng Mine continue to be voluntarily suspended to enable contact tracing,
further engagement with all relevant stakeholders, and deep cleaning and sanitisation of
workplaces and key infrastructure.

The Department of Health, Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, regional health
authorities and labour unions continue to be fully engaged in the process. The management
of the mine and its medical team are working closely with the regional health authorities in our
joint efforts to slow the rate of infection and to protect those who may be most vulnerable.

Mponeng's COVID-19 risk management plans and protocols remain in place and include:
  o appropriate screening of staff arriving at work;
  o social distancing measures;
  o a cleaning schedule for designated infrastructure;
  o hand-sanitising facilities at the appropriate locations on site, and
  o availability of Personal Protective Equipment for employees, including gloves and face
     masks.

While the Company is well-placed to detect infections and to manage the social and medical
responses required, it recognises that it needs to continue to play a proactive role in the
community in which it is located. To this end, AngloGold Ashanti continues to support a range
of initiatives to provide resources for healthcare providers and communities. This includes
making two hospitals available to the health departments in the North West and Gauteng
provinces for public use; a partnership to provide bulk sanitiser to state hospitals; providing
handwashing stations in high traffic areas and major taxi ranks in Gauteng; distributing care
parcels to vulnerable members of its host communities; procuring ICU beds; and contributing
R20 million to South Africa's Solidarity Response Fund.

the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or

Financial and Operating Report

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti recorded a solid operational and financial start to 2020. In February, the Company announced that the year ahead would
be an important transitional year for the business, with investments in our ore bodies to improve operating flexibility and further increase
reserves; progressing the redevelopment of the Obuasi Gold Mine; completing the announced sales of our Sadiola mine and our South
African portfolio; continuing the reduction of debt; and progressing the feasibility studies for the future development of our Colombian
projects. Excellent progress was made in each strategic area of focus despite the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world during the
quarter.

The Company prioritised protection of employees, communities and assets, along with support for government measures to help fight the
pandemic. The geographically diverse portfolio, comprising 14 operating assets across nine countries, provided a measure of protection
against disruptions caused by COVID-19, and the measures employed by governments to slow its spread. In order to further assist with
business continuity, inventories of critical items were built across all sites to an average of four months and ore stockpiles were built to
improve operating flexibility. The Company will continue to regularly update the market on its activities and developments as they unfold.

Production for the first quarter of 2020 was 716,000oz at a total cash cost of $814/oz, compared with 752,000oz at a total cash cost of
$791/ oz in the same period in 2019. AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid performance, despite the temporary COVID-19 related stoppages
at Serra Grande in Brazil, Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina and the South African operations, which together impacted production by 11,000oz.
Strong performances were delivered by Kibali, Geita and Iduapriem. As a result of lower production year-on-year, combined with higher cash
costs, rehabilitation expenses and sustaining capital expenditure, All-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose by 4%, or $38/oz, to $1,047/oz in the
first quarter of 2020, compared to $1,009/oz in the first quarter of 2019.

Cash flow was robust, demonstrating significant leverage to the rising gold price. Cash inflow from operating activities was up 227% to
$219m in the first quarter of 2020, from $67m in the same period last year. Free cash flow before growth capital - the metric on which
dividends are calculated - increased by 231% to $94m during the first quarter of 2020 versus an outflow of $72m during the same period in
the prior year.

The improvement in free cash flow was achieved despite higher capital expenditure with total growth capital spend of $90m, of which $53m
was spent at Obuasi as its redevelopment project continued, alongside higher operating costs and outstanding cash balances awaiting
repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Company's attributable share of the cash balance available in the DRC
amounted to $252m at the end of March 2020. AngloGold Ashanti received a quarterly dividend of $25m from Kibali at the end of March.
Barrick, the operator of Kibali, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining Code and the cash repatriation.

Cash flows were further impacted by VAT which continues to be locked up at Geita and Kibali, and export duties at Cerro Vanguardia.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) increased by 54% to $473m in the first quarter of
2020, from $307m in the first quarter of 2019.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 10% to $1.6bn at 31 March 2020, from $1.78bn at the same time last year. At 31 March 2020, the group had
a cash position of approximately $1.9bn after fully drawing on the US dollar RCF, whilst R1.55bn remains available on the R4bn South
African RCFs. On 15 April 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, AngloGold Ashanti repaid the principal and final coupon of the $700m
10-year bond, which was issued in April 2010. The group is in a strong cash position, and to further bolster available liquidity following the
repayment of the 2010 bonds, has secured additional credit facilities by signing a new standby credit facility of $1bn with a term of 364 days
that can be extended for a further six months with the participating syndicated banks' consent.

The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 31 March 2020 was 0.85 times compared with 1.27 times as at 31 March 2019.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) increased by 41% year-on-year to $199m in the first quarter of 2020,
compared to $141m in the first quarter of 2019. This increase was largely due to growth capital expenditure at Obuasi, where $53m was
spent in the first quarter of 2020 on the redevelopment of the project, as well as $25m on advancing the Quebradona project. Total sustaining 
capex increased by 5% to $109m in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $104m in the first quarter of 2019. The strategy of improving operating 
flexibility through investment in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological potential over the next two to 
three years, remains intact.

COVID-19

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The accelerating spread of the COVID-19
virus and the extraordinary steps taken by governments across the world to slow it down, have caused significant disruption to normal
operating conditions for businesses across the world.

AngloGold Ashanti has worked alongside authorities and key stakeholders in each operating country to assist public health efforts and to
help slow the spread of the virus. Comprehensive measures have been taken to help protect the well-being of our employees and
communities. Details of our initiatives and the impacts to the business can be found at https://www.anglogoldashanti.com/covid-19/.

The impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 to production and AISC, was 11,000oz and $18/oz respectively. Of the $18/oz AISC impact, 
$16/oz related to the production impact, while additional cost impacts were $2/oz. All of AngloGold Ashanti's mines are now operating normally, 
other than the Mponeng mine in South Africa which started its ramp-up to 50% capacity on 22 April 2020. It will continue to produce at around 
that level until current restrictions are lifted.

We took the step of withdrawing our annual guidance on 27 March 2020, given the prevailing uncertainty caused by the pandemic. We
confirm that our performance year to date is consistent with our prior guidance. Nonetheless, while the prevailing uncertainty persists - in 
respect of the length or severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, or the government actions to stop its spread - guidance will remain suspended.

Plans are in place to ensure business continuity under a range of scenarios. Liquidity has been bolstered as described above.

Inventories of critical spares have been built to cover between three and six months of operations, depending on a number of factors
including the resilience of the supply chains in each jurisdiction, lead times for specific items and available storage capacity. Those stocks
are now at an average of four months across the portfolio. We remain in close contact with our suppliers, many of which are maintaining
inventories in the respective regions for critical items.

We have also identified contingency plans to counter potential disruptions across a wide range of activities in connection with the ongoing
COVID-19 outbreak and are building ore stockpiles to provide additional operating flexibility where possible.

We have further worked closely with our associate partners of Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited in Johannesburg to ensure inbound transport of
gold dore from our African operations through accredited private charters when commercial airlines have suspended operations. The
transport of refined gold from Johannesburg to clients and bullion banks abroad has been ensured by the same means, achieving seamless
refining and sale of our product despite challenges caused by border closures.

Temporary suspensions that were in place during the months of March and April at Serra Grande in Brazil, at Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina
and at the South African operations have since been lifted. Serra Grande has since restarted and is back to operating at normal levels and
Cerro Vanguardia is processing stockpiles and operating at near-planned production rates. In South Africa, surface processing operations
have restarted, since being cleared to restart on 6 April 2020 and the Mponeng underground mine started its ramp-up on 15 April 2020 with
health screening processes, taking the entire South Africa portfolio to 50% of its operating capacity, in line with government regulations.

From a capital allocation standpoint, our strategy and clear approach to managing capital remains unchanged and continues to serve the
Company well - even through this challenging time - as we:

   -  prioritise the safety and health of our employees;
   -  ensure financial flexibility of our business with the aim to generate free cash flow sustainably;
   -  maintain the integrity of our orebodies and the sustainability of our operations;
   -  preserve the long-term options within our portfolio; and
   -  provide returns to our stakeholders, before we invest in growth.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

Regrettably, there were four fatalities in the first quarter of the year which occurred in two separate safety incidents in March at the Mponeng
mine. The first incident occurred on 5 March 2020 when three of our colleagues were fatally injured by a fall of ground, caused by a large
seismic incident roughly 3.6km below surface. The second took place on 16 March 2020 in a tragic accident during an underground
horizontal transport incident, which fatally injured one employee. Subsequent to the quarter end, an employee of Covalent Water, a wholly
owned subsidiary in South Africa, passed away as a result of injuries sustained in an electricity-related incident.

We continue our vigilance and seek to further improve our safety practices to ensure safe workplaces for our colleagues. The All-injury
frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the group has improved by 2% to 2.75 injuries per million hours
worked in March 2020, compared to 2.80 injuries per million hours worked in the fourth quarter of 2019. AIFR for the first quarter in 2019
was 4.22 injuries per million hours worked. The safe production strategy which aims towards our goal of zero harm and is aided by safety
campaigns has yielded significant improvements overall, with 22 consecutive months having passed without a fatality across any of our
operations before the tragic incidents during the first quarter of 2020.

AngloGold Ashanti recognises that all our stakeholders have a direct and material interest in the way in which we, as a business, prepare for
and respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, our communities and the regions and countries in which we
operate. We are guided by our values and aim to protect the health of our employees and host communities, while working to ensure
business continuity.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

Continuing operations

The Continental Africa region produced 360,000oz at a total cash cost of $717/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to
338,000oz at a total cash cost of $819/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The region's AISC was $879/oz for the quarter ended 
31 March 2020, compared to $969/oz for the same period in 2019.

In Tanzania, Geita delivered another strong performance, increasing production by 24% year-on-year to 135,000oz at a total cash cost of
$657/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 109,000oz at a total cash cost of $939/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019.
The production performance was boosted by a 35% year-on-year increase in tonnes milled mainly as a result of the planned maintenance of
the ball mill in the first quarter of 2019. Consistent blend feed resulted in higher recoveries in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same
period in 2019. Total cash cost benefitted from higher production volumes, improved mining rates and an increase in the ore stockpile
movement compared to the same period last year. These were partly offset by higher royalty costs and lower recovered grades in the first
quarter of 2020.

In the DRC, Kibali produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost of $583/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 93,000oz at a total
cash cost of $575/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. Production was lower year-on-year as a result of a planned reduction in plant
throughput and the processing of lower grade material from the Sessenge and KCD pits in the first quarter of 2020. Total cash costs
increased due to lower production and higher stockpile utilisation compared to the same period in the prior year. The higher hydropower mix
achieved during the first quarter of 2020 delivered benefits in lower power cost compared to the same period last year.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased by 5% year-on-year to 67,000oz at a total cash cost of $689/oz for the quarter ended 31 March
2020, compared to 64,000oz at a total cash cost of $693/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. Production increased as a result of a 5%
increase in grade due to mining higher grade ore from Blocks 7 and 8 in the Teberebie pit, as per the mining plan. Total cash costs
decreased in line with increased production volumes, partly offset by higher mining costs and royalties paid during the first quarter of 2020.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 48,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,183/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 49,000oz at a
total cash cost of $1,078/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The mine saw an increase in tonnes treated during the first quarter of 2020,
reflecting the added hard rock processing capacity that came on stream at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Recovered grades were 18%
when compared to the same period last year. This is attributable to the type of ore blend fed to the Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) Combination Plant 
which resulted in high washed residues and increasing solution tail values. Total cash costs increased mainly due to higher processing costs 
and other costs attributable to the operational challenges that were experienced at the mine compared to the same quarter of 2019.

In Mali, at Morila, the mine continues to reprocess tailings material according to plan with the objective of concluding re-processing by end
of 2020. At Sadiola, which is currently in limited operations, the mine continues its stockpile treatment plan.

The Americas region produced 140,000oz at a total cash cost of $829/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 165,000oz at
a total cash cost of $719/oz in the quarter ended 31 March 2019. AISC for the first quarter of 2020 was $1,157/oz, compared to $967/oz for
the same period in 2019. Total cash costs were higher reflecting lower production and cost escalations across the region. Production for the
region was impacted by lower grades, geotechnical issues in the underground areas in Brazil, unexpected heavy rainfalls and the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary suspension of mining activities at Serra Grande and Cerro Vanguardia.

In Brazil, at AngloGold Ashanti Mineracao, production was 77,000oz at a total cash cost of $834/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020,
compared to 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $733/oz for the same period last year. Production was lower due to the impact of model
changes affecting the access to the high grade orebody at Cuiaba as well as the unexpectedly long and heavy rain season which affected
output from the open pit mine at the Corrego do Sitio (CdS) complex. At Cuiaba, the mine introduced a new underground support standard
and revised mining sequence to address the deteriorating ground conditions which were previously flagged in 2019. Longer and heavier
than normal rains, which extended from October 2019 to March 2020, were the strongest rainfalls experienced in the State of Minas Gerais
in the last 110 years. The underground section was impacted by geotechnical issues, reworks which delayed blasts, low utilisation of
equipment due to absenteeism caused by COVID-19 and a shutdown of the autoclave for unplanned maintenance.

Serra Grande produced 18,000oz at a total cash cost of $993/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 26,000oz at a total cash cost of
$736/oz in the same quarter last year, due to lower grades. Ramp-up of production began on 5 April 2020, following the suspension of
operations which took effect on 27 March 2020 as a result of measures taken by the State of Goias to limit the spread of COVID-19. Total
cash costs were higher year-on-year as a consequence of lower production, partially offset by a favourable movement in the exchange rate
of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia's production decreased by 13% to 45,000oz at a total cash cost of $754/oz for the first quarter of 2020,
compared to 52,000oz at a total cash cost of $677/oz for the first quarter of 2019. Production was mainly impacted by planned lower grades
according to the current life of mine plan and by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension of operations which took
effect on 21 March 2020 as a result of the Argentinean government's measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cerro Vanguardia
restarted milling operations on 6 April 2020. Total cash costs increased year-on-year mainly due to inflationary pressures as a result of
salary increases, higher energy consumption and higher costs for maintenance services, explosives and other materials and spare parts.
This increase was partially compensated by a weaker exchange rate of the Argentinean Peso against the US Dollar, higher by-product
income derived from higher volumes sold as well as higher average silver price. Lower heap leach costs and favourable stockpile
movements due to higher tonnes mined also had a positive impact on total cash costs.

The Australia region produced 130,000oz at a total cash cost of $923/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 158,000oz at a total
cash cost of $687/oz in the first quarter of 2019. AISC for the first quarter of 2020 was $1,184/oz, compared with $919/oz for the same
period in 2019.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 57,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,026/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 72,000oz at a total cash
cost of $854/oz for the first quarter of 2019. The lower head grade in the first quarter of 2020, which was in line with the mine plan, impacted
production negatively. This was however, partially offset by a 3% increase in mill throughput. Stoping flexibility continues to improve and 
underground exploration drilling was ahead of forecast for the first quarter of 2020. As previously flagged, a key focus for Sunrise Dam is 
to deliver the development and drilling needed to grow its Ore Reserves. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, exploration drilling is on track.

Tropicana produced 73,000oz at a total cash cost of $753/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $541/oz 
for the first quarter of 2019. The planned 15% drop in production followed the completion of grade streaming in 2019 and reflected a 16%
drop in the mill feed grade to 1.52 g/t, which was offset by minor increases in mill throughput. In line with the mine plan, ore mined from the 
Havana South, Boston Shaker and Havana 02 pits was supplemented by stockpile drawdowns to fill the mill as waste mining was carried out as part 
of the Havana Stage 1 cutback. The Boston Shaker underground mine remains on track to begin production in the second half of 2020 with key 
underground infrastructure progressing to schedule.

During the first quarter of 2020 Tropicana gold production reached the 3-million-ounce milestone, just seven years after the mine poured first
gold. When construction of the mine was approved Ore Reserves (at 100%) totaled 3.3Moz and since then the operation has averaged
production of approximately 470,000oz per annum.

Discontinued operations

The South African region produced 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,107/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to
92,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,036/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The AISC for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 was
$1,227/oz, compared to $1,197/oz in 2019, due to lower gold production and higher total cash costs.

Mponeng produced 49,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,087/oz in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 53,000oz at a total cash cost of
$1,073/oz in the first quarter of 2019. Production decreased compared to the same quarter last year mainly because of the extended
Christmas break, with later start-up in January. Production was also impacted by poor ground conditions, safety stoppages due to fatalities
and the unplanned closure beginning on 27 March 2020 due to government restrictions related to COVID-19. Preparation for production from the 
Mponeng underground operation resumed on 22 April 2020, facilitated by no more than half of the usual staff complement, in compliance with the
South African lockdown regulations as amended on 16 April 2020. Production from the mine resumed on 4 May 2020 after following safe start-up procedures.

Surface Operations produced 37,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,137/oz in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 39,000oz at a total cash
cost of $987/oz in the first quarter of 2019. Mine Waste Solutions processed lower tonnes during the first quarter of 2020 due to increased
floor cleaning activities at Sulphur Pay Dam (SPD) tailings storage facility (TSF), which negatively affected throughput, despite the higher-
grade profile of the floor cleaning material. Inclement weather disruptions further contributed to the low tonnage performance. Initiatives are
being investigated to assist with the tonnage shortfall which include high volume trucking contracts to supplement the SPD volume with
Buffels TSF material as well as remote mining operations to mitigate inclement weather stoppages.

The West Wits surface operations' production declined due to poor mill availability, the mining mix which had higher TSF proportions
resulting in lower plant efficiency and the Eskom electricity load shedding. A lower recovery factor was achieved at Vaal River Surface
sources while inefficiencies with fine carbon management were also experienced, which further contributed to the lower recovery achieved.
The carbon management problem has since been rectified. Access to Margaret and Scott marginal ore dumps was secured for ore
treatment, which will maintain a higher grade and better recovery compared to the treatment of TSF material. Despite the nationwide
lockdown, effective on 27 March 2020, AngloGold Ashanti was granted permission by the South African Department of Mineral Resources
and Energy for the limited restart of its Surface Operations in South Africa, which recommenced operations on a limited basis on 6 April
2020.
 
UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Project
In Ghana, the Obuasi redevelopment project continued to make good progress, following the first pour of gold in December 2019,
considering the country's responses and restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Construction of Phase 2 (to achieve a capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day) reached 54.9% completion. Concrete works, structural steel
erection, mechanical equipment installation and tailings facility earthworks progressed well. While procurement is almost complete, some
manufacturing and deliveries have been delayed due to lockdowns in supply countries, while international travel restrictions and country
lockdowns have also hampered mobilisation of critical skills. The areas most impacted are the KRS shaft which is required to increase
mining capacity to 4,000 tonnes per day, and the SAG/Ball Mill installation which is required for the process plant to achieve 4,000 tonnes
per day. Based on current circumstances it is expected that Phase 2 commissioning and ramp-up will be delayed towards the end of the first 
quarter of 2021. However, the cost of the delays is expected to be managed within the project contingency, and the project remains on budget.

Ramp-up of Phase 1 operations (2,000 tonnes per day) progressed well. The process plant achieved design parameters by the end of the
first quarter. Plan run time progressively improved as commissioning issues in a refurbished plant were resolved. However, international travel
restrictions and the encouragement by home countries for expatriates to return home, had some impact on mining operations. The mining
contractor (a 70:30 Joint Venture between African Mining Services and Rocksure International, a Ghanaian company) has been extremely
supportive and most skilled expatriate operators have remained on site. The training focus and skills transfer to the Ghanaian workforce are
achieving good outcomes. Nevertheless, the mine is currently operating at approximately 80% capacity. As a result of the COVID-19
impacts, the declaration of Phase 1 commercial production is now expected in the third quarter of 2020.

Last month, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana partnered with national and local health authorities to increase proactive testing in the Obuasi town
and at the mine, which included voluntary tests of asymptomatic individuals. Proactive testing has identified asymptomatic cases, including
individuals at mine site. All positive cases are required to self-isolate for four weeks per Ghana's national health protocols, while their
contacts must self-quarantine. The early detection of asymptomatic individuals has been key to contain the spread of the disease and to
help ensure minimised impact on the business. The mine's management is awaiting delivery of additional testing equipment, in order to
continue its own ongoing proactive testing of employees with quick turnaround of results.

Tropicana - Boston Shaker
At Tropicana, the Boston Shaker underground mine remains on track to begin production in the second half of 2020. The primary escape
way was successfully installed in the first quarter of 2020 after raise boring finished on target in February 2020. The overhead power line,
high voltage electrical feed and underground power distribution was commissioned in the first quarter of 2020. The primary ventilation fan
chamber has been prepared and installation of the fans is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2020. Surface infrastructure remains
on target to be completed in the second half of 2020. A third drilling jumbo has been mobilised in line with the mining plan. Optimisation work
on level spacing and other initiatives to maximise gold extraction are ongoing.

Colombian projects
At Quebradona, the Feasibility Study (FS) continues to progress and during the first quarter of 2020 the National Environmental Licensing
Authority of Colombia conducted a site evaluation as part of the Environmental Impact Study (EIA). While the work on the FS is still
progressing, the COVID-19 context will likely result in a delay in the completion of the FS, which was previously expected to be completed
by the end of the year.

At Gramalote, it was decided to suspend drilling of the Inferred Mineral Resource following extensive consultation with the surrounding
communities and the Colombian government in view of the national state of emergency and government-mandated quarantine measures.
Our joint venture partner, B2Gold Corp, which manages the project, will continue to progress the FS where possible and expects that the
suspension of drilling will likely delay the completion of the FS to the first quarter of 2021.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Asset sales
The sale processes for our South African portfolio and Sadiola continue to progress.

In respect of the sale of the South African portfolio, both AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony Gold remain committed to the fulfilment of the
conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Certain conditions precedent have already been fulfilled, including the South African
Competition Tribunal approving the transaction, without conditions, on 29 April 2020, based on the recommendation of the South African
Competition Commission. The parties continue to target a completion date of 30 June 2020, subject to any impact that the COVID-19
pandemic may have on the fulfilment of the remaining conditions precedent.

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD and Allied Gold) remain committed to the fulfilment of the
conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Good progress has been made in the fulfilment of conditions precedent, including
positive discussions with the Government of Mali and despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, which have
delayed the progress against the originally anticipated timeline when the sale agreement was executed in December 2019.

At Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina, after an extensive sale process and thorough review of the offers received, it has been concluded that the
maximum potential value from the remaining resource endowment of the operation will be better realised inside the AngloGold Ashanti

portfolio, resulting in the decision to retain the asset. Cerro Vanguardia's management team will focus on seeking opportunities to unlock
further reserves and extend the life of mine.

Moody's Investor Services update
AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed the Company's Baa3 credit rating, with a
stable outlook. Moody's cited the favourable geographic diversification of the Company's portfolio, which offers a de-risked production profile
linked to multiple streams of free cash flow generation. Furthermore, it cited the conservative financial policies in place and the proactive
measures that the Company has taken to manage the COVID-19 impacts. Moody's also noted a strong liquidity position.

Newmont litigation
On 18 March 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed all causes of actions in the lawsuit filed
by Newmont Corp. (formerly Newmont Mining Corp.), against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties in 2017, and ordered the case to be closed. 
Newmont Corp. did not appeal the judgement.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Trebles Q1 Cash Flow from Operating Activities; Bolsters
Liquidity to $2bn

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti bolstered its
available liquidity to more than $2bn, improved leverage and more than trebled first
quarter cash flow from operating activities as key mines delivered solid
performances.

A diverse portfolio of 14 mines in nine countries helped limit the impact of COVID-19-
related stoppages to 11,000oz during the first quarter of 2020. First quarter free cash
flow before investment in growth projects – the measure on which dividend
payments are based - rose 231% year-on-year to $94m. Cash flow from operating
activities rose by 227 % from $67m to $219m over the same period.

“Cash flow is strong, leverage is down, and all operations are running,” Chief
Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. “We’re making good progress on achieving
our core strategic objectives – including asset sales and the redevelopment of
Obuasi – and have worked hard to ensure we have the liquidity to weather potential
disruptions.”

AngloGold Ashanti received a strong tailwind from bullion prices which averaged
$1,506/oz during the first quarter of 2020 and have continued to rise in subsequent
weeks as investors sought a safe haven. The Company secured an additional $1bn
credit facility to supplement cash on hand of around $1.1bn* as it increased its
liquidity position to withstand any potential disruptions from the COVID-19 epidemic.

AngloGold Ashanti has made good progress in achieving its strategic objectives,
namely the ongoing redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, investment in the
increase of reserves and mine lives of its key assets, and the process to conclude
the announced sales of assets in South Africa and Mali. These milestones were
achieved despite disruption caused by COVID-19-related stoppages at Serra
Grande, Cerro Vanguardia and the South Africa operations, which straddled the first
and second quarters and have since been lifted.
The announced sale of the South African Operations to Harmony Gold crossed an
important hurdle after the South African Competition Tribunal approved the
transaction, without conditions, on 29 April 2020. AngloGold Ashanti will no longer be
selling its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina, after concluding it can derive more
value for shareholders by developing the remaining potential in the ore body.

The ramp-up of Obuasi’s mining rate to 4,000 tonnes per day, from 2,000 tonnes per
day, is now expected to occur in the first quarter of next year. This is due to slower
shipments of certain equipment to Ghana and difficulties in ensuring key, skilled
employees can travel to the site amidst COVID-19-related border closings. The
project remains on budget.

The Company has taken a pragmatic approach in limiting the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on its operations by building inventories of critical spares and ore stockpiles
to improve the ability to respond to operational disruptions. The Company has also
implemented innovative relief interventions across all host countries, working closely
with governments, peers, and communities to help slow the spread of the pandemic.

PRODUCTION

Production was 716,000oz at a total cash cost of $814/oz for the quarter ended 31
March 2020, from 752,000oz at $791/oz in the same period last year. All-in sustaining
cost (AISC) was $1,047/oz for the three months ended 31 March 2020, compared with
$1,009/oz in the same period last year. Geita and Iduapriem delivered stand out
performances, offsetting lower production at Siguiri, Sunrise Dam and AGA
Mineração.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA) jumped 54% to $473m while free cash flow, before capital expenditure on
growth projects, soared by 231% to $94m. Free cash flow improvements were
achieved despite higher capital expenditure, with growth investment of $90m --
principally at the Obuasi project as its redevelopment continued and outstanding cash
balances available of $252m awaiting repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

BALANCE SHEET

The balance sheet continues to improve as strong cash flows helped with the
continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was
0.85* times at 31 March 2020, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle.
Adjusted net debt was 10% lower at $1.6bn at quarter end, from $1.78bn at the
same time last year.

The Company is in a strong cash position of $1.1bn after it redeemed the 10-year
$700 million bond and the coupon and has secured additional credit facilities of
$1bn, providing further liquidity in the event of operational disruptions.

SAFETY

Tragically, we lost four colleagues in the first quarter of the year in two separate
incidents in March at the Mponeng mine. The first incident occurred on 5 March 2020
when three of our colleagues were fatally injured by a fall of ground, caused by a large
seismic event roughly 3.6km below surface. The second took place on 16 March 2020
in a tragic accident during an underground horizontal transport incident, which fatally
injured one employee. Subsequent to the quarter end, an employee of Covalent
Water, a wholly owned subsidiary in South Africa, passed away as a result of injuries
sustained in an electricity-related incident.

Despite these fatalities, our pursuit of zero harm remains the priority. The Company
is absolutely focused on this critical area of our business and no effort will be spared
to not only understand the cause of each of these incidents, but also the root cause
of other high potential incidents that could have resulted in fatalities.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s external auditors

(*) The above results include continuing and discontinued operations.

EXTENTION OF ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (“AGM”)

Shareholders are advised that the Company has applied to the JSE Limited (“JSE”), requesting an extension
for the issue date of the Company’s notice of AGM which, in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, is
required to be distributed by no later than 30 April 2020. The JSE has granted AGA permission to delay the
issue of the notice of AGM and summarised Annual Financial Statements to on or about 20 May 2020.

The rationale for the request to the JSE was due to the current uncertainties with respect to future
developments, including duration, of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited operations of the South African
Post Office, which impacts the Company’s ability to distribute the notice of AGM to its shareholders.

A further announcement providing details of the notice of the AGM will be made at the appropriate time.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides an Update on Restart of Certain Operations

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti recognises the significant global challenge
presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are working closely with governments and civil society groups
in each of our operating jurisdictions to help slow the spread of the virus, mitigate the risks of infection,
ensure the sick receive treatment and cushion the economic impact caused by necessary government
measures to slow its spread. Throughout this process, we continue to prioritise the safety and health of our
employees and host communities.

This update provides details on the restart of production that had been suspended in Argentina, Brazil and
South Africa, highlights the recent affirmation of our credit rating outlook by Moody’s Investor Service and
today’s repayment of the 10-year, $700m bond, which has now matured.

“A diverse portfolio and proactive management of our balance sheet has given us flexibility during this
unprecedented time,” said Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky. “We’re focused on the health of our
employees and our communities, while ensuring we have the ability to contribute meaningfully to a range of
vital public health and economic initiatives in each of our operating jurisdictions.”

Update on operations in Latin America

AngloGold Ashanti’s sole mine in Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia, successfully restarted milling operations on
6 April 2020. The operation has now ramped up capacity and will initially process stockpiles, allowing
production to remain near planned levels with a significantly smaller staff complement. The mining operation
had been suspended since 21 March 2020 as a result of countrywide COVID-19 related restrictions on travel
and border closings.

In 2019, Cerro Vanguardia produced 225,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $859/oz.
In Brazil, at Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (Serra Grande), operations resumed based on the Municipality
Decree and Federal Statement (Ordinance) from the Mining Minister. Ramp up of production began on 5
April 2020 following a suspension that took effect on 27 March 2020 in response to measures taken by local
authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In 2019, Serra Grande produced 123,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,105/oz.

In each case, the resumption of operations has occurred alongside stringent screening, hygiene, social
distancing and other measures designed to mitigate the risk of infection.

The Company’s operations in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil (AGA Mineração) continue as they do in
Australia, Tanzania, the DRC, Guinea, Ghana and Mali. Exploration work in the USA has been suspended
for a time. The situation related to COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly and the Company will continue to
assess developments and provide updates as they occur.

Update on the South African operations

AngloGold Ashanti has been granted permission by the Department of Mineral Resources & Energy for the
limited restart of its Surface Operations in South Africa, which have now recommenced operation on a
limited basis. This includes the processing of marginal ore dumps at the West Wits Operations and the
reclamation of tailings at the Mine Waste Solutions business unit, in the Vaal River region.

The restart of these operations on 6 April 2020 has been facilitated by about 500 employees, spread across
both the West Wits and Vaal River regions. This is less than a third of the usual staff complement for these
business units, and roughly 8% of our total South Africa workforce. All sites have the requisite Covid-19 risk
management plans in place. The limited restart will help safeguard technical infrastructure and enable a
safe and quick resumption of all remaining operations once the lockdown is over.

In 2019, the marginal ore dumps business produced 70,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,272/oz and
Mine Waste Solutions produced 106,000oz at an AISC of $894/oz.

Production from the Mponeng underground operation remains suspended during the lockdown which is
currently expected to continue to 30 April 2020. This is now the only one of AngloGold Ashanti’s 14
operations where production is currently suspended.

Moody’s Investor Service and Bond Repayment

AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the Company’s
Baa3 credit rating, with a stable outlook.

Moody’s cited the favourable geographic diversification of the Company’s portfolio, which offers a de-risked
production profile which links to multiple streams of free cash flow generation. Furthermore, it cited the
conservative financial policies in place and the proactive measures that the Company has taken to manage
the COVID-19 impacts. Moody’s also noted a strong liquidity position.
AngloGold Ashanti will today repay the principal of $700m on its 10-year bond issued in April 2010, which
has now matured. As announced on 27 March 2020, the funds for the repayment of the bond have been
drawn from the $1.4 billion revolving credit facility. The Company is in a strong cash position after the bond
repayment, and as mentioned on the 27 March 2020 is procuring additional credit facilities to further bolster
available liquidity. Further updates in this regard along with the release of its first quarter market update, on
11 May 2020.

Background

AngloGold Ashanti remains in a state of high-alert and preparedness to deal with the global challenge
presented by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Company has created heightened awareness around the
COVID-19 virus and steps to prevent its spread, stepped up screening and surveillance of employees,
banned non-essential travel, instituted clear self-quarantine measures where applicable and increased
hygiene awareness and facilities across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures taken to
mitigate the risks presented by the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak as it unfolds and
remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our employees and with our key suppliers and
other business partners, to help ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Measures taken in Response to COVID-19

(PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti recognises that the COVID-19 pandemic represents an
unprecedented global challenge that requires cooperation from all members of society.

To date, we have taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and
business, in line with the Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our
employees and our host communities remains our key priority.

A cross-functional team, including operations, technical, finance, health, community, government relations and
other support disciplines, is helping to guide the response to the crisis. The Company has for some time
employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped non-essential travel, instituted
mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness across its operations, in addition
to a range of other measures to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It has also worked with local
communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These initiatives have complemented government
responses in each of its operating jurisdictions.

As a precaution against the potential effects of the pandemic on our ability to secure spares and consumables,
our supply chain teams have proactively placed orders to build increased safety stocks on critical items at our
operations. Specific inventories depend on the level of risk identified in each region, lead time considerations,
and storage capacity. In general, we are targeting inventories of three to six months on primary consumables,
while recognising we have the support of strategic partnerships with key suppliers who themselves are
maintaining inventories in the respective regions for many critical items.

On 21 March 2020, following the Argentinian government’s decision to impose a nationwide lockdown
(quarantine) until 31 March 2020, including temporary travel restrictions, border closings and suspension of
most industries, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) was required to temporarily suspend mining activities.

On 23 March 2020, the South African government announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown, effective from
midnight on 26 March 2020, resulting in the temporary suspension of mining activities of the company’s South

                                                       
African operations particularly Mponeng, and the partial suspension of mining activities at Mine Waste
Solutions and Surface Operations.

On 26 March 2020, the State of Goiás, in Brazil, extended a set of restrictions on the operation of non-essential
business, to include mining. These restrictions are set to run through 4 April 2020. Mineração Serra Grande
S.A. will temporarily suspend its operations.

In each case, the suspension of mining activities will continue for the period during which the respective
restrictions remain in force.

The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines in its diversified portfolio of 14 assets in nine countries, continue to
operate. For the sites where production has been suspended, plans for a safe and smooth ramp-up, and for
safely regaining part of the delayed production, are being developed.

“We have been proactive in positioning ourselves to respond to the impact of the outbreak,” said CEO Kelvin
Dushnisky. “We will respond quickly and work in deep partnership with stakeholders whilst doing our part in
fighting this global pandemic.”

The pandemic, if prolonged, would have a wide range of impacts, including the direct consequences of the
virus on the health of employees and communities, but also the consequent restrictions to travel and work put
in place by governments to slow its spread. There would also be other consequences, including temporary
mine site closures, and the reduced ability to effectively move people, supplies and equipment to sites amongst
others. These may cause production interruptions or delays to projects. These risks are being continually
evaluated and we have – and are developing -- the necessary contingency plans to mitigate them.

The Company had a good start to the year, and – notwithstanding an anticipated impact of 30,000oz – 40,000
oz from operations that are suspended at this stage (less than 2% of annual production) – AngloGold Ashanti
currently remains on track to meet its annual guidance. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties with respect to
future developments, including duration, severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary
government responses to limiting its spread, AngloGold Ashanti has decided to withdraw its market guidance
at this time.

The Company will continue to focus on the necessary steps to protect people, work to meet production targets
and to secure the longer-term future of the business during this period of uncertainty.

AngloGold Ashanti is implementing cash conservation measures, including focused capital prioritisation and
reducing non-essential spending across the business and is well positioned to weather the current market
uncertainty. At the end of 2019, the Company had $463m of cash, $2.0bn of debt and revolving credit facilities
with $1.42bn and R4.65bn available.

The Company has drawn down $1.4bn on its US Dollar RCF to cater for the $700m bond redemption due mid-
April 2020 and to provide additional liquidity headroom. After the drawdowns, cash on hand is approximately
$1.8bn (excluding cash lock-up positions at Kibali and Sadiola, where AngloGold Ashanti’s combined share
totals about $300m). Management will continue to take a prudent and proactive approach to managing the
Company’s liquidity, which may include procuring additional credit facilities or debt over and above its current
facilities.

The Company will continue to provide updates to the market as developments unfold. For additional
information on AngloGold Ashanti’s response to COVID-19, please refer to our website.

PRESS RELEASE

24 March 2020

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Status of South African Assets

(Press Release) – AngloGold Ashanti notes the announcement on Monday evening by
South Africa’s State President Cyril Ramaphosa that the country would go into a nationwide
lockdown for 21 days in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The health and safety of our employees remains our first priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, and is working alongside the
authorities in this regard.

As a result of the President’s order, AngloGold Ashanti will temporarily suspend production
from its South African Operations for three weeks as of midnight on 26 March 2020. These
operations will be safely placed into care and maintenance over that period. Plans will be
developed to help safely regain production delayed by this shutdown, where possible.
The South African operations include the Mponeng Mine, Mine Waste Solutions and surface
rock-dump processing operations. These operations produced 419,000oz for the year ended
31 December 2019.

An agreement has been reached to sell these assets to Harmony Gold Mining Co., a
transaction which is expected to close on about June 30 of this year, subject to certain
conditions precedent. Both parties remain committed to the transaction.

AngloGold Ashanti announced on Friday, 20 March 2020, that it would suspend production
at its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina until the end of the March, in line with a suite of
COVID-19-related work and travel restrictions imposed by the Argentinian Government.
The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate, employing a suite of measures
to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak
as it unfolds and remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our
employees and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help ensure business
continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

(Press Release) – AngloGold Ashanti notes the announcement on Monday evening by
South Africa’s State President Cyril Ramaphosa that the country would go into a nationwide
lockdown for 21 days in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The health and safety of our employees remains our first priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, and is working alongside the
authorities in this regard.
As a result of the President’s order, AngloGold Ashanti will temporarily suspend production
from its South African Operations for three weeks as of midnight on 26 March 2020. These
operations will be safely placed into care and maintenance over that period. Plans will be
developed to help safely regain production delayed by this shutdown, where possible.
The South African operations include the Mponeng Mine, Mine Waste Solutions and surface
rock-dump processing operations. These operations produced 419,000oz for the year ended
31 December 2019.

An agreement has been reached to sell these assets to Harmony Gold Mining Co., a
transaction which is expected to close on about June 30 of this year, subject to certain
conditions precedent. Both parties remain committed to the transaction.
AngloGold Ashanti announced on Friday, 20 March 202020, that it would suspend
production at its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina until the end of the March, in line with a
suite of COVID-19-related work and travel restrictions imposed by the Argentinian
Government.

The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate normally, employing a suite of
measures to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak
as it unfolds and remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our
employees and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help ensure business
continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Argentina Operations

(PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti provides an update on its operations in Argentina given the
recent countrywide restrictions on travel and border closings to the end of this month.

There are no COVID-19 cases at the Cerro Vanguardia mine, the company’s only operation in
Argentina, and which is set to account for about 6% of this year’s production.

Cerro Vanguardia will be required to suspend mining activities during the period of these current
restrictions, which are scheduled to last to the end of March. Safety and environmental monitoring
activities will continue. Plans are being developed to help regain delayed production once mining
operations resume.

This situation related to COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and the Company will continue to assess
developments as they occur.

Background

AngloGold Ashanti remains in a state of high-alert and preparedness to deal with the global
challenge presented by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company has created heightened awareness
around the COVID-19 virus and steps to prevent its spread, stepped up screening and surveillance of
employees, banned non-essential travel, instituted clear self-quarantine measures where applicable
and increased hygiene awareness and facilities across its operations, in addition to a range of other
measures taken to mitigate the risks presented by the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti has a multi-disciplinary COVID-19 taskforce directing the company’s global
response to the crisis, with input from its health, operational, travel, human resources, community
relations, finance and supply teams, among others. Each office and site have emergency
preparedness plans in place, developed in line with national protocols and plans. The first aim is to
protect employees, their families and our host communities.

The worldwide outbreak has thus far not impacted AngloGold Ashanti’s production. The company is,
however, constantly monitoring the situation as it unfolds, all the time remaining in close contact
with authorities in each country and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help
ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur. The company is also
working with community groups and local authorities, to understand where it can provide support to
healthcare systems as they gear up to manage the pandemic.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Free Cash Flow Jumps 90% to $127m; Lifts Dividend

(PRESS RELEASE - JOHANNESBURG) - AngloGold Ashanti nearly doubled free
cash flow in 2019 to $127m, raised its dividend and improved leverage to below its
target level after a higher gold price and improved efficiencies helped ensure
exceptional performances at a number of its key mines. The Company's safety
performance was also the best on record.

The Company worked to deliver its strategic objectives, meeting guidance on its key
operating metrics for the seventh straight year; concluding agreements to sell its
South African portfolio and the Sadiola mine in Mali; lowering debt; adding reserves
at its retained assets after accounting for depletion; and restarting its Obuasi mine in
Ghana on schedule and on budget. The annual dividend increased by 74% to 165
ZAR cents per share (approximately US 11 cents per share).

""We're working hard to deliver on our strategy and to capture the wider margin in this
strong gold price environment,"" Chief Executive Officer, Kelvin Dushnisky said.
""We're generating strong cash flow from our operations, and that's allowing us to
increase returns to shareholders, strengthen our balance sheet and invest in our ore
bodies.""

AngloGold Ashanti invested sustaining capital of $494m in 2019 and has forecast an
increase to between $640m and $670m in 2020. The additional investment will help
the Company convert existing resources into additional ore reserves and increase
development at its key mines. The added reserves extend mine lives, while more
development will allow greater operating flexibility, which in turn will translate into
more efficient and predictable cost and production outcomes.

Production was 3.281Moz at a total cash cost of $776/oz in the 12 months through
31 December 2019, from 3.400Moz at $773/oz in the previous year. All-in Sustaining
Cost (AISC) was $992/oz for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to
$976/oz for the previous year. Headline earnings of US 91 cents per share, were up
72% from the previous year, while free cash flow before capital expenditure on
growth projects, rose 106% to $448m.
The Company reported exceptional performances from its Geita, Kibali, Tropicana
and Iduapriem mines, with production and efficiency gains partly offset by operating
challenges at its Siguiri and Sunrise Dam mines.

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the
continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was
0.91 times at year end, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle.
Adjusted net debt was 5% lower at $1.581bn at year end, down from $1.659bn at 31
December 2018.

SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE

Production for the second half of 2019 was 1.727Moz at a total cash cost of
$762/oz, compared to 1.772Moz at $726/oz for the last six months of 2018. AISC
was $981/oz for the last six months of 2019, compared to $936/oz for the same
period in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,033m during the second half of 2019, compared to $756m
during the second half of 2018. Free cash flow of $159m was generated in the
second half of 2019, compared to $118m for the second half of 2018.

SAFETY

AngloGold Ashanti's safe production strategy, along with targeted safety campaigns,
have helped ensure a record safety performance for the Company. For the first time
in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a calendar year without a workplace fatality
and injury rates declined by almost two thirds since 2012. While these are important
milestones, the pursuit of zero-harm remains in sharp focus.

GUIDANCE 2020**

Production guidance for the 2020 year is estimated to be between 3.050Moz and
3.300Moz. Total cash costs are estimated to be between $775/oz and $825/oz and
AISC between $1,040/oz and $1,100/oz at average exchange rates against the US
Dollar of 15.00 (South Africa Rand), 3.95 (Brazil Real), 0.70 (Australia Dollar) and
70.00 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $65/bbl average for the year, based on market
expectations.

Total capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $920m and $990m, with the
Company prioritising investment in growing its Ore Reserves and improving
operating flexibility by investing in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve
Conversion at sites with high geological potential. The increase in sustaining capital
for 2020 includes around $30/oz to facilitate additional exploration and development.
Two projects are being advanced simultaneously in Colombia, with the completion of
feasibility studies expected by year end 2020 for both Quebradona and Gramalote,
the latter now managed by B2Gold Corp.


Ends
**Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further
changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated sales in South Africa
and Argentina) and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have
material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold
Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation may be
significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Assuming an exchange rate of R1/¢0.3540, the gross dividend payable per share, which is subject to a 20% South African withholding tax, is
equivalent to c.0.5841 cedis. However, the actual rate of payment will depend on the exchange rate on the date for currency conversion.
AngloGold Ashanti nearly doubled free cash flow in 2019 to $127m, raised its dividend and improved leverage to below its target level after a higher
gold price and improved efficiencies helped ensure exceptional performances at a number of its key mines. The Company’s safety performance
was also the best on record.

The Company worked to deliver its strategic objectives, meeting guidance on its key operating metrics for the seventh straight year; concluding
agreements to sell its South African portfolio and the Sadiola mine in Mali; lowering debt; adding reserves at its retained assets after accounting
for depletion; and restarting its Obuasi mine in Ghana on schedule and on budget. The annual dividend increased by 74% to 165 ZAR cents per
share (approximately US 11 cents per share).

“We’re working hard to deliver on our strategy and to capture the wider margin in this strong gold price environment,” Chief Executive Officer, Kelvin
Dushnisky said. “We’re generating strong cash flow from our operations, and that’s allowing us to increase returns to shareholders, strengthen our
balance sheet and invest in our ore bodies.”

AngloGold Ashanti invested sustaining capital of $494m in 2019 and has forecast an increase to between $640m and $670m in 2020. The additional
investment will help the Company convert existing resources into additional ore reserves and increase development at its key mines. The added
reserves extend mine lives, while more development will allow greater operating flexibility, which in turn will translate into more efficient and predictable
cost and production outcomes.

Production was 3.281Moz at a total cash cost of $776/oz in the 12 months through 31 December 2019, from 3.400Moz at $773/oz in the previous
year. All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) was $992/oz for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to $976/oz for the previous year. Headline
earnings of US 91 cents per share, were up 72% from the previous year, while free cash flow before capital expenditure on growth projects, rose
106% to $448m.

The Company reported exceptional performances from its Geita, Kibali, Tropicana and Iduapriem mines, with production and efficiency gains partly
offset by operating challenges at its Siguiri and Sunrise Dam mines.

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA was 0.91 times at year end, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle. Adjusted net debt was 5% lower at $1.581bn
at year end, down from $1.659bn at 31 December 2018.

SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE

Production for the second half of 2019 was 1.727Moz at a total cash cost of $762/oz, compared to 1.772Moz at $726/oz for the last six months of
2018. AISC was $981/oz for the last six months of 2019, compared to $936/oz for the same period in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,033m during the second half of 2019, compared to $756m during the second half of 2018. Free cash flow of $159m was
generated in the second half of 2019, compared to $118m for the second half of 2018.

SAFETY

AngloGold Ashanti’s safe production strategy, along with targeted safety campaigns, have helped ensure a record safety performance for the
Company. For the first time in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a calendar year without a workplace fatality and injury rates declined by almost
two thirds since 2012. While these are important milestones, the pursuit of zero-harm remains in sharp focus.

GUIDANCE 2020**

Production guidance for the 2020 year is estimated to be between 3.050Moz and 3.300Moz. Total cash costs are estimated to be between $775/
oz and $825/oz and AISC between $1,040/oz and $1,100/oz at average exchange rates against the US Dollar of 15.00 (South Africa Rand), 3.95
(Brazil Real), 0.70 (Australia Dollar) and 70.00 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $65/bbl average for the year, based on market expectations.

Total capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $920m and $990m, with the Company prioritising investment in growing its Ore Reserves
and improving operating flexibility by investing in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological potential. The
increase in sustaining capital for 2020 includes around $30/oz to facilitate additional exploration and development. Two projects are being advanced
simultaneously in Colombia, with the completion of feasibility studies expected by year end 2020 for both Quebradona and Gramalote, the latter
now managed by B2Gold Corp.

**Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further changes to asset portfolio
and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated sales in South Africa and Argentina) and have not been reviewed
by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance
can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from

NEWS RELEASE

ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"") on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 21 February 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next, will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous
corresponding reporting period.

Expected headline earnings and basic loss

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that the headline earnings for the
period are expected to be between $357 million and $401 million, with headline earnings per share
(""HEPS"") of between 86 cents and 96 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period
were $220 million and 53 cents, respectively.

The total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations) for the period is expected to be
between $26 million and $0 million, resulting in a total basic loss per share of between 6 cents and 0
cents. Basic earnings and basic earnings per share for the comparative period were $133 million and
32 cents, respectively.

The total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations) for the period was negatively
impacted by a non-cash impairment charge of $385 million (post-tax) or 92 cents per share related to
the sale of the South African operations as described below.

South African asset sale and impact of IFRS 5

On 12 February 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited. Consideration for
the transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around $300 million,
subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits assets are developed
below current infrastructure.

In terms of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, the Company has determined that the sale of its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities are required to be treated as non-current assets held for sale
and disclosed as discontinued operations. This accounting treatment will result in the separation of the
earnings disclosures between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the current period
results. The earnings disclosures for all comparative periods presented will also be separated between
continuing operations and discontinued operations to align with the current year disclosures as required
by IFRS 5.

The effect of the application of IFRS 5 on the current and comparative period earnings will be explained
in the Company's results announcement on 21 February 2020, which shareholders should consider in
order to gain a full appreciation of the Company's financial performance.

The classification of the remaining South African producing assets and related liabilities to held for sale
resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $385m (post-tax) or 92 cents per share accounted for in
order to reflect these assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell,
therefore negatively impacting the total basic loss for the current period.

Headline earnings

The expected overall increase in headline earnings for the period compared to the comparative period
was primarily due to the following reasons:
*      The higher gold price received on gold sold during the period, coupled with weaker local
       currencies assisted the improved financial performance of the Company and more than negated
       the lower gold output, higher operating costs mainly due to inflation and lower grades, and the
       payment of higher royalties and taxes.
*      Income from Kibali and other equity investments increased by $46 million (post-tax) or 11 cents
       per share.

Total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations)

In addition to the effects on headline earnings, total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued
operations) was negatively impacted by the non-cash impairment charge of the South African asset
sale as described above.

This was partially off-set by the non-recurrence of significant once-off items affecting basic earnings for
the prior period as follows:
*       A non-cash impairment of the Uranium plant relating to Mine Waste Solutions of $66 million
        (post-tax) or 16 cents per share.
*       Retrenchment costs related to the restructured South African operations of $25 million (post-
        tax) or 6 cents per share.

The current period headline earnings and total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations)
were also negatively impacted by the recognition of an increase in the non-cash environmental
rehabilitation obligation of $15m (post-tax) or 4 cents per share as a result of the changes in
environmental legislation in Brazil relating to tailings storage facilities.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti's external auditors.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Agrees South African Asset Sale to Harmony Gold

1. Introduction

AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement (the
""Agreement"") to sell its remaining South African producing assets and related liabilities
to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (""Harmony""). Consideration for the
transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around $300
million, subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West
Wits assets are developed below current infrastructure (the ""Transaction"").

AngloGold Ashanti announced in May 2019 that it was undertaking a process to review
sale options for the portfolio of assets, principally comprising the Mponeng
underground mine, where further capital, necessary to extend the mine life was in
competition with other, higher-return AngloGold Ashanti priorities; Mine Waste
Solutions, the mine waste retreatment operation; and a surface rock dump processing
business. The sale is part of the process of streamlining AngloGold Ashanti's portfolio,
in line with its clear capital allocation framework, to create a more focused business
with enhanced operating and financial metrics.

A rigorous nine-month sales process identified Harmony as the most suitable party to
acquire these assets, given its financial capacity and proven technical capability in
operating ultra-deep, hard-rock mining assets in South Africa.

""From the beginning of the process an objective has been to sell our SA assets to a
strong, capable and responsible operator that will ensure their long-term sustainability;
we believe that this transaction achieves that,"" Kelvin Dushnisky, CEO of AngloGold
Ashanti said. ""This sale helps deliver on our commitment to sharpen our management
focus and capital allocation on the highest return investment options available to us.""

AngloGold Ashanti will continue its work to position the Company to deliver long-term
value for stakeholders through performance, disciplined capital allocation, as
demonstrated by this pro-active portfolio management, and ongoing review of all
aspects of its corporate structure.

AngloGold Ashanti has 14 gold-producing operations in nine countries. Its mines
include differing ore-body types, located in key gold-producing regions around the
world. Its business activities span the full spectrum of the mining value chain - from
exploration through mining to the production of refined gold and its sale.

2. Transaction Details

     2.1. Relevant assets and liabilities

The Transaction will include the following assets and liabilities:
   * The Mponeng mine and its associated assets and liabilities;
   * The Tau Tona and Savuka mines and associated rock-dump and tailings
      storage facility reclamation sites, mine rehabilitation and closure activities
      located in the West Wits region and their associated assets and liabilities;
   * First Uranium (Pty) Limited which owns Mine Waste Solutions (Pty) Limited and
      Chemwes (Pty) Limited as well as associated tailings assets and liabilities;
   * Covalent Water Company (Pty) Limited, AngloGold Security Services (Pty)
      Limited and Masakhisane Investments (Pty) Limited; and
   * Certain rock-dump reclamation, mine rehabilitation and closure activities
      located in the Vaal River region and their associated assets and liabilities.

Together these assets produced revenue of ZAR8,047 million and profit after tax of
ZAR331 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The book value of these assets
as at 31 December 2019 was ZAR9,901 million.1

AngloGold Ashanti will retain its interest in Rand Refinery Limited as well as its
obligations relating to the post-retirement medical cost for its applicable retired and
remaining employees and its obligations under the Silicosis Class Action Settlement
Agreement.

     2.2. Consideration

The Transaction consideration comprises three elements:
   * US$200m in cash payable at closing; and
   * Two components of deferred consideration, payable as follows
      a. US$260 per ounce payable on all underground production sourced within
         the West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and
         TauTona mines) in excess of 250,000 ounces per annum for 6 years
         commencing 1 January 2021. This was agreed between the parties on the
         basis that it is expected to deliver aggregate nominal proceeds to AngloGold
         Ashanti in the order of US$100 million using AngloGold Ashanti's

1
  The results form part of the unaudited historical combined information for the year ended 31 December 2019, prepared of the
assets and liabilities forming part of the transaction, which has been based on management accounts. AngloGold Ashanti is
satisfied with these management accounts which form part of its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

In preparing the unaudited historical financial statements of the assets and liabilities forming part of the transaction, the recognition
and measurement principles of IFRS, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee,
and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council have been applied, however,
since IFRS do not provide for the preparation of unaudited historical combined financial information, in preparing these results
certain accounting conventions commonly used in the preparation of unaudited historical combined financial information have
been applied.

           assumptions regarding production from Mponeng Mine during this period;
           and
        b. US$20 per ounce payable on underground production sourced within the
           West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona
           mines) below the datum of current infrastructure. This currently constitutes
           8.53 million ounces of reserves. If all these reserves were mined it would
           therefore deliver additional aggregate nominal proceeds of approximately
           US$170 million to AngloGold Ashanti over the period that the ounces are
           mined.

AngloGold Ashanti intends to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce net debt.

   2.3. Significant terms of the Agreement

The Agreement provides for terms customary in agreements of this nature and is
subject to customary conditions precedent. Key conditions precedent includes:

   *    Approval from the South African Competition Authorities in terms of the
        Competition Act, 1998; and
   *    Section 11 approval from the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy in
        terms of the MPRDA in relation to West Wits Mineral Right.

   2.4. Timing and Effective Date

AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony have committed to engage with the relevant
authorities and other stakeholders in order to ensure the conditions precedent are
fulfilled as soon as possible with earliest closing anticipated on or about 30 June 2020.

The Transaction is deemed a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited.

               operating cost per ounce

1   AngloGold Ashanti will publish its own pricing sensitivities upon completion of the Feasibility Study

                                                                                                                               1
       o   Average LOM all-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") of $648 per ounce of gold, and
           average LOM all-in costs (including pre-production capital costs) of $882 per ounce
           of gold
       o Annual processing rate of 11.0 million tonnes per annum (""Mtpa"")
       o Average LOM gold recovery of 94.3% from conventional milling, flotation and
           cyanide leach of the flotation concentrate
       o Estimated pre-production capital cost of $901 million (includes approximately $160
           million for mining equipment)
       o LOM pre-tax net cash flow of $1,827 million, and after-tax net cash flow of $1,283
           million
       o Assuming a discount rate of 5%, net present value (""NPV"") pre-tax of $1,027 million
           and NPV after-tax of $671 million, generating an after-tax internal rate of return
           (""IRR"") of 18.1% at the project construction decision date (estimated to be January
           1, 2021), with a project payback (including construction capital) of 3.6 years
       o Assuming a gold price of $1,500 per ounce and a discount rate of 5%, NPV pre-
           tax increases to $1,394 million and NPV after-tax increases to $928 million,
           generating an after-tax IRR of 21.9% at the project construction decision date
           (estimated to be January 1, 2021), and reducing the project payback (including
           construction capital) to 3.2 years
   *   Continue ongoing feasibility work to optimize the PEA results and a final feasibility
       study expected to be completed by December 31, 2020
   *   Amended and restated shareholders agreement signed by B2Gold and AGA on
       December 23, 2019 under which B2Gold agreed to sole fund the next $13.9 million of
       expenditures on the Gramalote Project, following which B2Gold and AGA will each
       hold a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture (currently 48.3% B2Gold and 51.7%
       AGA)
   *   Exploration drilling is ongoing at the Trinidad deposit, with additional drilling at the
       Monjas zone to commence later in 2020

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered
too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would
enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA
based on these Mineral Resources will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral
Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

B2Gold is currently completing approximately 42,500 metres of infill drilling at Gramalote
Ridge to convert existing Inferred Mineral Resources to an Indicated category, and 7,645
metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure.

PEA Overview

The Gramalote Project is located in central Colombia, approximately 230 kilometres (""km"")
northwest of Bogota and 120 km northeast of Medellin, in the Province of Antioquia which has
expressed a positive attitude towards the development of responsible mining projects in the
region. The PEA was prepared by B2Gold and evaluates recovery of gold from a an open pit
mining operation that will move up to 143,000 tonnes per day (""tpd"") (50.0 Mtpa), with a
30,137 tpd (11.0 Mtpa) processing plant that includes crushing, grinding, flotation, with fine
grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of both the flotation concentrate and
the flotation tails followed by a carbon-in-pulp recovery process to produce dore bullion. The
PEA is based solely on production from the Gramalote Ridge deposit and does not include
potential production from the nearby Trinidad deposit, which has a current Inferred Mineral
Resource estimate (see above), and the Monjas West zone. The Mineral Resource estimate
for Gramalote Ridge that forms the basis for the PEA includes Indicated Mineral Resources of
70,110,000 tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold for a total of 2,070,000 ounces of gold, and Inferred
Mineral Resources of 79,030,000 tonnes grading 0.79 g/t gold for a total of 2,010,000 ounces
of gold.

The PEA updates and enhances the previous studies on the Gramalote Project in several
areas, including:
*      For Gramalote Ridge, additional drilling has been completed, and a new Mineral
       Resource model has been developed
*      The PEA is based solely on Gramalote Ridge Mineral Resources, where the previous
       studies included mining and processing ore from Trinidad deposit and the Monjas West
       zone
*      Recent metallurgical test work has resulted in slightly lower processing costs and
       improved economics
*      The new Mineral Resource model for Gramalote Ridge includes new interpretations of
       higher grade ore zones and has allowed more efficient mine optimization, which has
       resulted in higher grade ore being fed to the plant during the first years of production,
       significantly improving project economic
*      Due to better defined high-grade zones in Gramalote Ridge in the block model, the
       overall gold grade for the PEA is 0.85 g/t, which is significantly higher than previous
       studies

Accelerated mining is planned in the early years of production to provide higher grade feed to
the plant while stockpiling lower grade material. The final four years of plant feed are from low
grade stockpiles and oxide ore. Oxide ore, which only makes up about 3% of the plant feed,
will be stockpiled and processed at the very end of the project life as blending this material
with the fresh ore does not yield optimal gold recoveries.

The PEA assumptions include revenues using a gold price of $1,350 per ounce and current
prices for fuel, reagents, labor, power and other consumables. The key parameters of the
PEA are presented in the following table (100% basis):

Based on the positive results from the PEA, B2Gold believes that the Gramalote Project has
the potential, to become a large low-cost open pit gold mine, subject to completion of ongoing
infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020. The
Gramalote Project has several key infrastructure advantages, including:
*      Reliable water supply - high rainfall region and located next to the Nus River
*      Adjacent to a national highway, which connects directly to Medellin and to a major river
       with port facilities, capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 kilometres of the
       site
*      Proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low-cost power and stable record
       of hydroelectric power
*      Skilled labor workforce within Colombia

In addition, B2Gold expects the Gramalote Project to benefit from several key operational
advantages, including:
*      Excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore, which results in high recovery rates
       at low processing costs
*      Relatively low strip ratio in the mine (1.9:1)
*      Ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting
       in improved project economics

The PEA is subject to a number of assumptions and risks, including among others, that a
Modified Environment Impact Study and a Modified Project Implementation plan will be
approved within the required timeline, all required permits and other rights will be obtained in
a timely manner, the Gramalote Project will have the support of the local government and
community, the regulatory environment will remain consistent and no material increase will
have occurred to the estimated costs.

Economic Sensitivities

Gramalote is a large, low grade, low cost project and sensitive to the gold price, as
demonstrated in the following table:

Project Next Steps

B2Gold and AngloGold have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the Gramalote
Project of approximately $37 million through the end of 2020. This budget will fund 42,500
metres of infill drilling to convert existing Inferred Mineral Resources to the Indicated category,
and 7,645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure. The Company currently
expects to complete all drilling by the end of May 2020. In addition, the budget will fund
feasibility work including an updated Mineral Resource estimate, detailed mine planning,
ongoing environmental studies, additional metallurgical test work, engineering and detailed
economic analysis.

The Gramalote joint venture will continue to advance resettlement programs, establish
coexistence programs for small miners, work on health, safety and environmental projects and
continue to work with government and local communities on social programs. B2Gold, as
manager, plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of B2Gold completing a final
feasibility study by December 31, 2020. Due to the amount of work completed by AGA over
the past several years, including extensive testing programs, the work with local communities
and small miners, and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study,
the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive. The main work program for
feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resources to the Indicated
category.
The Environmental Impact Study and Project Implementation Plans for the Gramalote Project
have been fully approved by the National Authority of Environmental Licenses of Colombia.
Due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations, a
Modified Environment Impact Study and a Modified Project Implementation plan were
submitted and are currently in the final approval process. If the final economics of the feasibility
study are positive and the joint venture makes the decision to develop Gramalote as an open-
pit gold mine, B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine
and mill facilities and operate the mine on behalf of the joint venture.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti's Obuasi Gold Mine Pours First Gold - On Time and On Budget

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (the
Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti, has achieved its first pour of
gold from the Obuasi Gold Mine, signaling the successful redevelopment of the mine into a
modern, mechanized mining operation since mining activities were suspended five years
ago.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project, which seeks to access Obuasi's 30-million-ounce ore
body over the next two decades and beyond, has completed the first phase of construction
on time and on budget. Refurbishment of an existing plant and construction of new
infrastructure and underground development, in line with a new mine plan, has taken place
over the past 18 months.

""Producing first gold on budget and on a tight schedule is a significant achievement for the
Company, for the community at Obuasi and for Ghana as a whole,"" said AngloGold Ashanti
Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky. ""Restarting this important mine is testament to the
focused execution by our team on the ground, as well as the clear investment framework
and supportive environment created by the President of Ghana and his government, and the
King of Ashanti.""

Following a ramp-up period, AngloGold Ashanti estimates mining at a rate of 2,000 tons per
day from Obuasi during 2020, climbing to 4,000 tons per day by year-end. The mine will be
producing gold at an average run-rate of 350,000oz - 400,000oz per year for the first ten
years, and above 400,000oz over the life of mine at all-in sustaining costs of around
$800/oz.

""The team has done an excellent job completing the first phase of this project and will be
focused on ramping up production through next year,"" said Graham Ehm, AngloGold
Ashanti's Executive Vice President of Group Planning and Technical, who is overseeing the
project. ""The difficult decision was made to suspend production in 2014 to rebuild the mine's
foundation for a sustainable long-term future that will bring benefit to the region over the
coming decades. We are tremendously proud of what has been achieved since then.""

The underground mine development is ongoing, with deepening of the Obuasi Deeps
Decline and access to the KRS shaft on schedule for mid-2020. The construction of new
plant and infrastructure will continue in 2020. The initial project capital for Obuasi remains in
the range of $495m to $545m, spent between 2018 to the end of 2020

AngloGold Ashanti is working closely with government and community stakeholders to
ensure that the Obuasi mine is developed sustainably, fuelling growth for Ghana and
benefitting the communities around the mine. A committee, including local stakeholders and
regulators, has been created to track execution of the reclamation of the mine site and the
mine will also be contributing $2/oz of gold produced to a Community Trust Fund, over its
life, to facilitate development projects in the local area.

The project has placed a premium on local content, with 80% of the capital thus far spent in-
country, according to the Managing Director of the Obuasi Mine, Eric Asubonteng. Ghanaian
companies have been given preference in the procurement of goods and services, from the
large-value underground mining contract all the way to catering and security contracts.
Employment has also prioritised Ghanaians from the immediate area around the mine
wherever possible, with Ghanaians from elsewhere in the country next in line for recruitment
in available roles.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Free Cash Flow up 156%; Obuasi Set for Year-End Start

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti increased free cash flow to
$87m in the third quarter of 2019, more than double the free cash flow in the third quarter of
2018, as the Company prepared to recommence production from its Obuasi mine which is
on track to pour first gold by the end of the year.

Obuasi, the 36Moz ore body in Ghana, is set to resume production by year-end, ahead of an
anticipated ramp-up through the course of 2020 which is expected to introduce about
400,000oz a year of lower-than-average cost production to the Company's portfolio. The
strong improvement in cash flow, aided by a higher gold price, helped reduce debt and bring
leverage close to the Company's target levels.

""The team has made extraordinary progress toward meeting the year-end target of bringing
this world-class ore body back into production,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said.
""The fact that we've generated strong cash flow and improved our balance sheet while making
this investment, is testament to the strength of our portfolio.""

The Company also achieved five consecutive quarters and a total of 541 days without a fatality
by quarter end, a first in AngloGold Ashanti's history. Sadiola, Siguiri, Iduapriem, Geita, Cerro
Vanguardia, the Colombia Projects and Generative Exploration had no recordable injuries in
the third quarter.

Free cash flow was $87m for the third quarter of 2019, a 156% step up from the $34m
generated in the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher capital expenditure and
operating costs, and lower gold sales.

Production in the three months to 30 September 2019 was 825,000oz at a total cash cost of
$786/oz compared to 851,000oz at $722/oz for the third quarter of last year. Production was
impacted by the planned reduction in output from Cerro Vanguardia, Kibali, where open-pit
mining is contributing fewer ounces of the high base achieved in the comparable quarter last
year, and Mponeng, which saw lower grades during the quarter. Strong production
performances occurred at Iduapriem and AGA Mineracao.
AngloGold Ashanti has initiated processes to review divestment options for its entire business
in South Africa and separately its respective interests in Sadiola in Mali and Cerro Vanguardia
in Argentina. These processes are active and continue to make progress. In South Africa, the
process has moved forward at a steady pace with site due diligence by prospective bidders
now complete. For Sadiola and Cerro Vanguardia, these processes have similarly moved
forward and engagement with prospective bidders, including site inspections and other due
diligence, is ongoing.

Lower production, along with inflationary pressures and other factors, raised total cash costs
by 9% year-on-year to $786/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2019, while All-in
Sustaining Costs (AISC) rose 12% year-on-year to $1,031/oz. With a strong fourth quarter
anticipated, cash costs and AISC are expected to improve on the back of increased
production, in line with past trends.
Balance Sheet

The balance sheet remains robust with strong liquidity and long-dated maturities providing
financial flexibility. Adjusted net debt declined by 6% to $1.646bn at 30 September 2019, from
$1.749bn in the third quarter of 2018. The adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 30
September 2019 was 1.06 times compared with 1.2 times at 30 June 2019 and 1.13 times at
30 September 2018. The Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet
with an adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target of 1x through the cycle.

The 2019 guidance* for key operating metrics, including production, costs and sustaining
capital expenditure, remains on track, with production expected at the lower half of the range
and costs at the upper end of the range, excluding the non-cash impact of the change in the
Brazilian TSF regulations.

* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor any
changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated divestitures in South
Africa, Argentina and Mali) and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could
also have material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by
AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation may
be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31
December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

Third quarter overview

Production for the third quarter ticked upwards quarter-on-quarter, underpinned by strong performances at Geita (in Tanzania) and AGA
Mineracao and Serra Grande (both in Brazil). As previously reported, production increases from Geita, Siguiri, as well as from the Australian
and Brazilian operations, are expected in the fourth quarter. The Company remains committed to its strategy of safely improving cash flows
from a simpler, higher quality portfolio, through disciplined cost management and capital allocation.

During the third quarter of 2019, the Company generated $87m of free cash flow after growth capital. This was significantly higher than the
$34m generated in the comparable quarter of last year, owing to a 22% higher gold price received and favourable working capital movements,
partially offset by lower gold sales, higher capital expenditure and operating costs, as well as the retention of cash in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC), pending remittance.

AngloGold Ashanti's operating partner at Kibali in the DRC, Barrick Gold Corporation, continues to constructively engage with the DRC
government and administration on the issues relating to the 2018 mining code, including the repatriation of funds from the DRC. Free cash
flow continued to be affected by the slower than anticipated repatriation of cash from the DRC for Kibali loan repayments. AngloGold Ashanti
received $22m (AngloGold Ashanti's attributable share) in the third quarter from off-shore accounts. Cumulative cash receipts for the nine
months ended 30 September 2019 amounted to $53m, while $177m (AngloGold Ashanti's attributable share) has not yet been repatriated
from the DRC.

Production increased 3% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the preceding quarter, but was 3% lower year-on-year at 825,000oz
compared to 851,000oz during the same period in 2018. Production for the quarter was impacted by the planned reduction in output from Cerro
Vanguardia, which now produces fewer by-products and at lower grades, Kibali, where open-pit mining is contributing fewer ounces off the high
base achieved in the comparable quarter last year and Mponeng, which saw lower grades during the quarter. Stabilisation of the Siguiri
combination plant has proven challenging, particularly given ore variability aggravated by high rainfall and associated delays in the crushing
circuit caused by wet fines. The site team has taken remedial steps and is optimising hard-rock throughput ahead of an expected recovery in
both cost and production through the balance of the year and into 2020.

Given the lower production, total cash costs for the Company came in at $786/oz, 9% higher than $722/oz reported during the same period
in 2018. Costs year-on-year were also impacted by lower grades, inflation, lower silver by-products from Cerro Vanguardia, and higher royalties,
more than offsetting benefits from exchange rates, throughput volumes and efficiencies. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,031/oz during
the third quarter of 2019, rising 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2018, due to the planned increase in sustaining capital expenditure
together with the rise in total cash costs. AISC increased by $35/oz or 4% from the second quarter of 2019, due to the planned increase in
sustaining capital expenditure, while total cash costs decreased slightly.

The Company continues to focus on safe production across all operations, and by quarter-end achieved 541 fatality-free days. The all-injury
frequency rate (AIFR) for the quarter improved by 24% year-on-year to a near all-time low at 3.23 per million hours worked, demonstrating an
ongoing focus on safety alongside fundamental operating improvements.

Key projects remain on track and within budget. The Obuasi Redevelopment Project in Ghana remains a strategic priority for the management
team and a key area of growth for the business. Strong progress was made during the quarter and the project is on track for the first gold pour
expected at the end of 2019. The development of the underground reserve at Tropicana's Boston Shaker deposit is making steady progress.

AngloGold Ashanti, as previously communicated, has initiated processes to review divestment options for its entire business in South Africa
and separately its respective interests in Sadiola in Mali and Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina in a strategic move to streamline its portfolio,
optimise capital allocation and increase its focus on areas with the greatest long-term potential for value-adding growth. These divestment
processes are active and continue to make progress. In South Africa, the process has moved forward at a steady pace with site due diligence
by prospective bidders now complete. An update on this process can be expected by the end of the year. For Sadiola and Cerro Vanguardia,
these divestment processes have similarly moved forward and engagement with prospective bidders, including site inspections and other due
diligence, is ongoing.

In an effort to further sharpen the focus on core growth projects, the Company announced an agreement in mid-September whereby B2Gold
would assume management of the Gramalote project effective 1 January 2020 with a target to complete the feasibility study by the end of
2020. B2Gold will fund an investment and exploration programme next year valued at $13.9m to earn-in back to a 50:50 partnership.

On the exploration front, the Company remains committed to reserve conversion and increasing the mineral inventory at its operating assets,
while progressing greenfields opportunities in strategic areas, to maintain a healthy portfolio over the long term. Mine site drilling programmes
are progressing well in all areas in support of mine operations and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource replacement programmes. On the
generative front, activities continue in Australia, the US, Brazil and West Africa with the aim of further developing optionality in the Company's
portfolio. After a period of sub-optimal spending on underground development and reserve conversion, the Company intends to allocate
additional capital to improving reserve definition within our existing operations. This is expected to improve the lives and valuations of these
assets, while improving ore body flexibility, reducing operating variability and supporting the medium-term objective to provide guidance beyond
the Company's customary 'in-year' outlook.

Adjusted net debt declined by 6% to $1.646bn at 30 September 2019, from $1.749bn at the same time last year. The adjusted net debt to
adjusted EBITDA ratio as at 30 September 2019 was lower at 1.06 times compared with 1.2 times as at 30 June 2019 and 1.13 times as at
30 September 2018. The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising the largely undrawn $1.4bn US dollar RCF, approximately
R4.25bn available on the R5.65bn South African RCFs and other facilities, and cash and cash equivalents of $417m at 30 September 2019.
The Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet with an adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1 time through
the cycle.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) increased by 44% from $163m for the third quarter of 2018 to $234m for
the third quarter of 2019. This increase was largely due to growth capital expenditure at Obuasi. Total sustaining capital expenditure increased
by 3% to $144m for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $140m for the third quarter of 2018. Capital expenditure is expected to rise going
into the next financial year, mainly at Geita, Iduapriem and AGA Mineracao, as a result of increased ore reserve development and brownfields
exploration drilling, as work is done to increase mine lives, improve ore body flexibilities and reduce operating variability. The capital outlook
at Obuasi remains unchanged, as previously disclosed at half year. The overall project to achieve a production rate of 4,000tpd remains within
budget and on schedule for completion, anticipated at the end of 2020.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

The Company achieved a fatality-free period for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The group AIFR, the broadest measure of
workplace safety, improved 24% year-on-year: during the third quarter of 2019 AIFR was 3.23 injuries per million hours worked. For the nine
months ended 30 September 2019, AIFR was 3.49 injuries per million hours worked, compared to 5.18 in the same period in 2018. Our safe
production strategy continues at all operations, with a focus on intensifying our employees' focus on safety practices in all workplaces in an
effort to continue AngloGold Ashanti's sustainable safety improvement.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

African Operations

The Continental Africa region produced 387,000oz at a total cash cost of $740/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 391,000oz at a
total cash cost of $718/oz in third quarter of 2018. AISC was $900/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $834/oz for the third quarter of
2018. Despite the significant increase in Iduapriem's production and a good performance from Geita, production for the third quarter of 2019
decreased by 1% compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to lower year-on-year contributions from Kibali and Siguiri.

In Ghana, Iduapriem delivered an increase in production to 73,000oz at a total cash cost of $854/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to
64,000oz at a total cash cost of $827/oz in the same quarter in 2018. Production improved 14% when compared to the third quarter of 2018
due to an increase in grade from Block 7 & 8 Cut 1 compared to lower grade from Block 7 & 8 Cut 3. The increase in production was also
attributable to a 3% increase in tonnage treated due to improved throughput rate following reinstallation of SAG Mill 2 pebble ports and improved
blast fragmentation/blend. Total cash costs, however, increased due to higher operating cost and higher utilisation of the stockpile compared
to the previous period, partly alleviated by increased production volume.

There will be a shutdown during the fourth quarter to effect a repair of the trunnion on the second of two SAG Mills. The first SAG Mill and both
ball mills will continue to operate during this time.

In Tanzania, Geita's production increased to 153,000oz at a total cash cost of $644/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 151,000oz
at a total cash cost of $735/oz in the same period in 2018. The 1% increase in production is a result of an 8% increase in tonnes treated due to
improved year-on-year plant utilisation. This was partially offset by a 6% drop in recovered grade due to the lower open pit mining cut off grades
and alignment of milling throughput. Total cash costs decreased due to lower operating mining costs and the increase in production.

In the DRC, Kibali produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost of $586/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 101,000oz at a total cash cost
of $510/oz in the same quarter in 2018. Production was 10% lower compared to the third quarter of 2018 mainly due to the planned reduction
in open pit mining as the focus shifts to sourcing ore from underground. Total cash costs consequently increased due to lower volumes of
production and higher stockpile utilisation compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase in total cash costs was partially offset by lower
mining contractor and power costs due to increased use of hydropower during the third quarter of 2019.

In Guinea, Siguiri's production was 51,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,075/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 54,000oz at a total
cash cost of $823/oz in the same quarter in 2018. Production was 6% lower year-on-year as a result of a decrease in recovered grades, despite
a 26% increase in tonnes treated during the quarter. The mine also experienced operating challenges related to the integration of the new
combination plant and processing of hard rock material. Total cash costs increased due to the lower production, higher drilling and blasting cost
due to harder material mined in Kami and Tubani pits, as well as an increase in treatment costs.

In Mali, Sadiola's production decreased by 7% to 13,000oz for the period compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to a 10% decrease in
tonnes treated as the mine continued its stockpile treatment plan. This was partially offset by improved recovered grades from 3W and FE3
mining areas. Total cash cost increased by 2% to $927/oz due to lower production.

Morila's production decreased by 14% to 6,000oz for the period compared to the third quarter of 2018 as the mining of the satellite pits was
completed. The mine continues to treat tailings material resulting in a 44% decrease in recovered grade. This was partially offset by a 28%
increase in tonnes treated in the period compared to the same period in the prior year.

The South African region produced 113,000oz at a total cash cost of $973/oz for the third quarter of 2019, a 6% decrease in production
compared to 120,000oz at a total cash cost of $894/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2018. AISC was recorded at $1,127/oz for the third
quarter ended 30 September 2019 compared with $1,026/oz for the same period a year ago. The total cash costs increase is attributed to
lower production, inflationary pressures, partially offset by a weaker exchange rate.

At Mponeng, production was 65,000oz at a total cash cost of $967/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2019 compared with 79,000oz at
a total cash cost of $811/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2018. Whilst improvements in face advance at Mponeng was noted with
mining volumes consistent with the third quarter of 2018, Mponeng's production was 18% lower mainly due to lower grade. Grade challenges
were experienced due to face length availability, which was impacted by increased seismicity in the Above 120 level mining area.

Production at Mine Waste Solutions increased by 17% to 28,000oz mainly on the back of an increase in recovered grades. This was the result
of optimising the mining mix through more efficient blending of high-grade feed sources and improving metallurgical efficiencies in the processing
plants. A continued focus on cost management and improving efficiencies remains a priority, with total cash costs at $814/oz for the quarter
ended 30 September 2019 at similar levels to the same period in the prior year.

Production at Surface Operations increased by 25% to 20,000oz mainly due to improved efficiencies on tonnes delivered to the plant, the
appointment of a new contractor and higher recovered grades. As a result, total cash costs at $1,227/oz for the quarter ended 30 September
2019 reflected a marked improvement compared to the same period in the prior year at $1,424/oz.

The new carbon tax regulations in South Africa were implemented on 5 June 2019, with the first payment date on 31 July 2020. Phase 1 of
the regulations, which is applicable until the end of 2022, will have an insignificant impact on the South African operations.

International Operations

The Australia region produced 146,000oz at a total cash cost of $775/oz and an AISC of $1,066/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September
2019 compared to 148,000oz at a total cash cost of $748/oz and an AISC of $1,082/oz in the same quarter of 2018.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 60,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,153/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 61,000oz at a total cash
cost of $1,013/oz in the same quarter a year ago. Production was impacted by lower underground ore tonnes, which necessitated a greater
proportion of feed from stockpiled lower-grade ore. Critical for the success at Sunrise Dam is increasing flexibility to ensure consistently high
underground tonnages are available to displace lower-grade surface stockpiles. In line with this objective, development during the period was
above budget as the larger stopes in Vogue and Cosmo East were in the process of being commissioned for production, which is expected to
result in higher underground mining volumes in the fourth quarter. In addition, drill platforms have now been established at the southern end
of the mine to access the strike and depth extensions of the Vogue orebody. Strategic drill platforms have also been established to facilitate
systematic exploration of the middle and northern regions of the property.

In line with the broader strategic drive to increase flexibility, extend the reserve life and increase ore body confidence across the portfolio, the
Company will increase the investment in brownfields exploration and ore reserve development at the mine, which will further assist in improving
the ore blend.

At Tropicana, production was 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $521/oz for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 87,000oz at $536/oz in the
same quarter of 2018. Lower mill feed grades were offset by higher mill throughput. The Boston Shaker underground project remains on
schedule with 650m of development completed during the quarter.

The Americas region produced 179,000oz at a total cash cost of $782/oz and an AISC of $1,118/oz for the third quarter of 2019, a 7% decrease
in production compared to 192,000oz at a total cash cost of $607/oz and an AISC of $817/oz in the same quarter of 2018.

In Brazil, the operations produced 123,000oz at a total cash cost of $834/oz in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 121,000oz at a total cash
cost of $687/oz in the third quarter of 2018. AISC was recorded at $1,203/oz compared to $917/oz for the same period in 2018. This 31%
increase is due to higher operating costs related to vehicle maintenance and spare parts, higher sustaining capital expenditure and inflation,
partly offset by favourable exchange rates in 2019 and higher gold production in the period.

At AGA Mineracao, production was 6% higher, at 92,000oz, when compared to the same period of the prior year, mainly due to higher ore
mined and better grades. The mine complex delivered an improvement in production compared with the previous quarter and also year-on-
year. AISC was, however, impacted by the increase in sustaining capital expenditure. At Cuiaba, the mine has experienced weaker ground
conditions in the deeper areas of the mine. To ensure safe production, a decision was taken to slow the rate of mining until the work is completed
to improve ground conditions. A similar challenge was experienced in 2012, at which time the operational and geotechnical teams employed
an enhanced support regime to negotiate the poor ground challenges and return the mine to normalised safe production levels. Operational
excellence initiatives are focused on improving development rates, to increase face length availability and create additional flexibility. It is
expected that increased development rates will improve resource confidence and create flexibility by having additional workplaces, which in
turn will help increase production to match available processing plant capacity.

At Serra Grande, production of 31,000oz was 9% lower year-on-year, reflecting lower recovered grades partly offset by higher tonnes mined
and treated.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia s gold production of 56,000oz was 21% lower than the third quarter of 2018, mainly due to planned lower
grades in line with Cerro Vanguardia's current life of mine plan. AISC was recorded at $928/oz compared to $627/oz for same period in the
prior year, due to lower by-product income derived from lower volumes of silver sold and inflationary pressures, partially offset by a higher
average silver price received, a weaker exchange rate and favourable mining-related efficiencies.

BRAZIL TSF UPDATE

As communicated on 8 August 2019, along with the first half financial and operating results, several draft bills were under consideration in
Brazil at Federal and State levels which include, amongst others, proposals for a surety bond to cover incidents related to tailings storage
facilities (TSF's), stricter requirements for approval, construction, inspection and maintenance of existing and new TSFs, a possible increase
in mining royalties and taxes, and the possible removal of existing export incentives. AngloGold Ashanti has been proactive in reviewing its
TSF deposition methodology following the Brumadinho tragedy. All seven of the Company's TSFs in Brazil received external stability declarations
ahead of the legislated 30 September 2019 deadline, and the subsequent reports must be submitted by March next year. The Brazilian operations
continued to accelerate the transition to dry stacked tailings material including, at AGA Mineracao, construction of the mobile filtration plant at
the Corrego do Sitio mine and commissioning the first filtration plant at Cuiaba. The impact of the revised rehabilitation provisions required
by the new legislation is forecast at about $20m to $28m or $37/oz to $53/oz for the Brazil operations, which equates to about $6/oz to $9/oz
at a Group level. While this provision is non-cash in nature, it will reflect in AISC at year end. This impact had not been previously factored into
guidance.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Project
Work is continuing towards achieving the project's timeline for the first gold pour at the end of 2019. The overall project to achieve a production
rate of 4,000tpd remains within budget and on schedule for completion, anticipated at the end of 2020.

The Phase 1 (2,000tpd) crushing, milling and flotation sections of the plant have been commissioned. Approximately 5,000 tonnes of ore was
milled to produce sulphide concentrate for the growth of the BIOX bacteria in preparation for the start up. Refurbishment of the remainder of
the plant for Phase 1 is well advanced and full commissioning remains on track for the end of this year. The overall Phase 1 progress is at
78% completion.

Phase 2 construction (4,000tpd) remains on schedule for completion at the end of 2020 and is currently 44% complete. The engineering,
procurement and construction (including the demolition, refurbishment and new build) is ongoing, achieving progress of about 27% in the third
quarter of 2019. The overall project is at 76% complete.

Operational readiness work streams also remain on track. 3,510 metres of underground development was completed. Surface works for the
GCVS ventilation shaft commenced. Production drilling of the first stope at Sansu has commenced. Currently, there are four diamond drill rigs
operational on site, focusing on grade control and exploration.

As previously communicated, due to the later parliamentary approval of the various agreements, timing of capital spend has been adjusted.
The initial project capital for Obuasi remains around $545m, including $46m for the mining fleet purchased, of which 10% was spent in 2018,
50% is expected to be spent in 2019 and the remainder in 2020.

Boston Shaker Underground Project
The Boston Shaker underground project is on schedule with 650m of development completed during the quarter and remains on track to deliver
first gold in the second half of 2020. The project continues to progress in accordance with the mine plan and schedule, with an underground
mining team in place to execute according to plan.

EXPLORATION UPDATE

During Q3 2019, brownfields exploration activities completed 234,388m of drilling for a total expenditure for the quarter of $13.9m (capital) and
$14.2m (expensed).

Greenfields exploration and target generation during Q3 2019 was completed in Australia, Brazil, United States and West Africa with 27,248m
of drilling and total expenditure of $7.4m.

In Australia, exploration took place in the Laverton District on both tenements (AngloGold Ashanti 100%) and on the Butcher Well and Lake
Carey JV tenements (AngloGold Ashanti 70%). At the Bismark prospect near Sunrise Dam (AngloGold Ashanti 70%), five diamond holes were
completed as an initial test of the Central and Eastern Zones. An intercept of 5m @ 7.1 g/t Au from 91m was returned from diamond hole
BID011 within the Central Zone. Gold mineralisation is associated with a steeply-dipping zone of quartz stockwork veins. Aircore drilling
continued in the Northern, Central and Eastern zones in order to provide better definition of these targets. Aircore hole BIA255 returned an
intercept of 19m at 1.6 g/t Au from 29m. At the Cleveland prospect (AngloGold Ashanti 100%), diamond hole CLD002 returned a best intercept
of 3m @ 6.8 g/t Au from 166m and 5m @ 2.1 g/t Au from 215m within a broad zone of anomalous gold (76m @ 0.46 g/t Au). In addition, aircore
hole CLA105 returned 22m @ 1.05 g/t Au from 28m to bottom of hole. A total of 22,527m of aircore drilling and 3,743m of diamond drilling
was completed in the Laverton district during Q3 2019.

Elsewhere in Western Australia, the results from the six diamond holes drilled at the Glandore project in Q2 2019 returned no significant assays.
In NE Queensland, drilling commenced at the Mt Clark prospect. Three diamond holes were completed for 978m and these intercepted wide
zones of complex breccias with variable sulphide content and cut by quartz veins. Assay results are pending.

In the United States, at Silicon in Nevada (option to earn-in to 100%), a ground gravity survey was completed to assist with drill hole targeting
and an Exploration Plan of Operations was submitted to the Bureau of Land Management. At Rhyolite, detailed surface mapping and rock
chip sampling continued over potential target areas. Surface gridded soil, stream sediment and rock chip sampling continued at the Transvaal
prospect.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Says B2Gold To Earn Management of Gramalote Project

(PRESS RELEASE - DENVER) -- AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce an agreement with
B2Gold, its joint venture partner at the Gramalote Project in Colombia, whereby B2Gold will fund an
investment and exploration program next year to the value of $13.9m, in order to earn back to a 50:50
partnership and assume management of the project effective 1 January 2020.

""This aligns closely to our strategy of sharpening the focus of our capital and management resources
on the suite of options available to us,"" said AngloGold Ashanti CEO Kelvin Dushnisky. ""B2Gold has
proven itself a strong, experienced player in exploration, feasibility studies and project execution,
which makes it an excellent partner for us.""

This agreement, which is subject to definitive documentation expected to be completed by year end
2019, will provide additional momentum to the Gramalote project, one of AngloGold Ashanti's two
advanced exploration projects in Colombia. B2Gold currently owns a 48.3% stake, with AngloGold
Ashanti holding the remaining 51.7%. The parties have agreed to target completion of a feasibility
study for Gramalote by the end of 2020.

AngloGold Ashanti's wholly-owned Quebradona copper and gold project, also in the Colombia
department of Antioquia, is currently undergoing a feasibility study.

AngloGold Ashanti has operating partnerships at its Sadiola, Tropicana and Cerro Vanguardia mines,
and non-operating partnerships at its Morila and Kibali mines.

""We believe the Gramalote project has the potential to become a low-cost open pit gold mine,"" B2Gold
Chief Executive Clive Johnson said. ""The project has several key infrastructure advantages including
reliable water supply, close proximity to key infrastructure and a technically capable workforce in
country.""

""This agreement is a positive step toward unlocking value from our Colombia portfolio,"" Dushnisky
said. ""Gramalote continues to improve and we fully support the additional drilling program soon to get
underway; we will now focus our own management efforts on moving the Quebradona project up the
value curve.""

AngloGold Ashanti Posts Strong Q2 2019 Operating Recovery; Key Projects on Track

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti achieved strong gains in second quarter production and cash flow, set new safety
records and kept key projects on track. Full-year key operating and cost guidance remained on track, with an especially strong fourth-quarter
anticipated.

Second quarter production increased 7% over the first quarter of 2019, rising to 801,000oz from 752,000oz. Free cash flow for the second quarter
also increased to $78m, compared with an outflow of $109m in the first quarter of 2019. The average gold price received of $1,302/oz was only
$5/ oz higher than in the first quarter of 2019. The price has subsequently averaged about $1,414/oz as of 4 August 2019.

""While we've seen a rally in the gold price, this will not diminish our focus on improving free cash flow and returns through active portfolio management
and strict capital discipline,"" Kelvin Dushnisky, Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti, said ""Tight cost management will continue to be a key
driver for us.""

Production in the six months through 30 June 2019 was 1.554Moz at a total cash cost of $792/oz, compared to a production of 1.578Moz at a total
cash cost of $807/oz in the first six months of last year (excluding Moab Khotsong and Kopanang). Production decreases from Sunrise Dam (lower
grade) and Siguiri (lower grades and plant throughput), as well as a planned decrease in production from Cerro Vanguardia were partly offset by
strong improvements from Kibali, Iduapriem, Geita and Tropicana.

AngloGold Ashanti is streamlining its portfolio to ensure greater management focus and to concentrate its capital on projects delivering the highest
returns. The Company has received strong interest for its remaining South African assets. Separate sale processes are underway for its holdings
in the Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina and the Sadiola mine in Mali.

Key projects remain on track and within budget. Obuasi remains a strategic priority for the management team and a key area of growth for our
business with work continuing towards meeting a tight schedule of achieving its first gold pour at the end of this year.

The Company achieved four consecutive quarters and a total of 449 days without a fatality, a first in AngloGold Ashanti's history.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the first half of 2019 improved by 2% year-on-year to $1,002/oz while total cash costs declined by 4% year-on-
year to $792/oz. This reflects a solid performance at Kibali with a higher contribution from the underground mine; improved grade-control at Iduapriem
alongside better metallurgical recoveries at Tropicana; and a streamlined South Africa portfolio, which delivered a $139/oz or 11% improvement in
AISC when compared to the same period last year.

Full-Year Guidance*

The 2019 guidance for key operating metrics, including production, costs and sustaining capital expenditure, is maintained at the previous levels
reported. The growth capital metric has been revised downwards due to the timing of some of the Obuasi capital spend, however the overall Obuasi
project budget remains intact.

Production between 3.25Moz to 3.45Moz.

Total cash costs between $730/oz and $780/oz.

 AISC between $935/oz and $995/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US Dollar of ZAR 14.00 (South African Rand), BRL 3.65
(Brazilian Real), AUD 0.75 (Australian Dollar) and AP 40.00 (Argentinian Peso), with the Brent crude oil price at $74/bl average for the year; and

Capital expenditure anticipated to be between $850m and $920m.

* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor any changes to asset portfolio
and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated divestitures in South Africa, Argentina and Mali) and have not been
reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no
assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could
differ from guidance and any deviation may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form
20-F for the year ended 31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Certain information presented in this results announcement constitutes pro forma financial information. This information is the responsibility of the Company's board of
directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature the pro forma financial information may not fairly present the Company's financial information,
changes in equity and results of operations or cash flows. This information has not been reviewed or audited or otherwise reported on by Ernst & Young Inc.
AngloGold Ashanti achieved strong gains in second quarter production and cash flow, set new safety records and kept key projects on track. Full-
year key operating and cost guidance remained on track, with an especially strong fourth-quarter anticipated.

Second quarter production increased 7% over the first quarter of 2019, rising to 801,000oz from 752,000oz. Free cash flow for the second quarter
also increased to $78m, compared with an outflow of $109m in the first quarter of 2019. The average gold price received of $1,302/oz was only
$5/ oz higher than in the first quarter of 2019. The price has subsequently averaged about $1,414/oz as of 4 August 2019.

""While we've seen a rally in the gold price, this will not diminish our focus on improving free cash flow and returns through active portfolio management
and strict capital discipline,"" Kelvin Dushnisky, Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti, said ""Tight cost management will continue to be a key
driver for us.""

Production in the six months through 30 June 2019 was 1.554Moz at a total cash cost of $792/oz, compared to a production of 1.578Moz at a total
cash cost of $807/oz in the first six months of last year (excluding Moab Khotsong and Kopanang). Production decreases from Sunrise Dam (lower
grade) and Siguiri (lower grades and plant throughput), as well as a planned decrease in production from Cerro Vanguardia were partly offset by
strong improvements from Kibali, Iduapriem, Geita and Tropicana.

AngloGold Ashanti is streamlining its portfolio to ensure greater management focus and to concentrate its capital on projects delivering the highest
returns. The Company has received strong interest for its remaining South African assets. Separate sale processes are underway for its holdings
in the Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina and the Sadiola mine in Mali.

Key projects remain on track and within budget. Obuasi remains a strategic priority for the management team and a key area of growth for our
business with work continuing towards meeting a tight schedule of achieving its first gold pour at the end of this year.

The Company achieved four consecutive quarters and a total of 449 days without a fatality, a first in AngloGold Ashanti's history.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the first half of 2019 improved by 2% year-on-year to $1,002/oz while total cash costs declined by 4% year-on-
year to $792/oz. This reflects a solid performance at Kibali with a higher contribution from the underground mine; improved grade-control at Iduapriem
alongside better metallurgical recoveries at Tropicana; and a streamlined South Africa portfolio, which delivered a $139/oz or 11% improvement in
AISC when compared to the same period last year.

Full-Year Guidance*

The 2019 guidance for key operating metrics, including production, costs and sustaining capital expenditure, is maintained at the previous levels
reported. The growth capital metric has been revised downwards due to the timing of some of the Obuasi capital spend, however the overall Obuasi
project budget remains intact.

Production between 3.25Moz to 3.45Moz.

Total cash costs between $730/oz and $780/oz.

 AISC between $935/oz and $995/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US Dollar of ZAR 14.00 (South African Rand), BRL 3.65
(Brazilian Real), AUD 0.75 (Australian Dollar) and AP 40.00 (Argentinian Peso), with the Brent crude oil price at $74/bl average for the year; and

Capital expenditure anticipated to be between $850m and $920m.

* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor any changes to asset portfolio
and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated divestitures in South Africa, Argentina and Mali) and have not been
reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no
assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could
differ from guidance and any deviation may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form
20-F for the year ended 31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (the ""Period"") on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 8 August 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Expected Headline Earnings and Basic Earnings

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings for the
Period are expected to be between $111 million and $129 million, with headline earnings per share
(""HEPS"") of between 27 US cents and 31 US cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative
period in 2018 were $99 million and US 24 cents, respectively.

The basic earnings for the Period are expected to be between $106 million and $122 million, resulting
in basic earnings per share (""EPS"") of between US 25 cents and US 29 cents. The basic earnings and
EPS for the comparative period were $33 million and US 8 cents, respectively.

The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings for the Period compared to the
comparative period were primarily due to the following reasons:

•      Prior period retrenchment costs related to the restructured South African operations were not
       repeated in 2019, resulting in increased earnings of $22 million (post-tax) or 5 US cents per
       share;
•      A Brazilian power utility legal settlement received in April 2019 of $11 million (post-tax) or 3 US
       cents per share; and
•      Income from joint ventures, mainly Kibali, increased by $38 million (post-tax) or 9 US cents per
       share.
These increases were partly offset by:
•      A decrease in net by-product revenue of $25 million (post-tax) or 6 US cents per share, mainly
       related to a decrease in silver sales and silver price received (mainly from Cerro Vanguardia);
       and
•      An increase in environmental rehabilitation costs of $27 million (post-tax) or 7 US cents per
       share (non-cash item) as a result of the adverse impact of lower risk-free interest rates used in
       determining the environmental rehabilitation obligations.

In addition, in 2018, a non-cash impairment of the Uranium plant of Mine Waste Solutions affected basic
earnings by $66 million (post-tax) or 16 US cents per share (non-cash item).

Operational Performance

Production for the six months ended 30 June 2019 is expected to be 1.554 Moz, from 1.578 Moz for
the half year ended 30 June 2018 (excluding Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona mines).
Production decreases from Sunrise Dam (lower grade) and Siguiri (lower grades and plant throughput),
as well as a planned decrease in production from Cerro Vanguardia in terms of its life-of-mine plan were
offset by strong production improvements from Kibali, Iduapriem, Geita and Tropicana.

The process to streamline the AngloGold Ashanti portfolio continues with sales processes ongoing in
South Africa, Mali and Argentina.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti's external auditors.

The board of directors of AngloGold Ashanti are committed to sound corporate governance and values the
opinion of the Company's shareholders and will take cognisance of the outcome of the vote when considering
the Company's implementation report. As the non-binding advisory endorsement approving the Company's
implementation report has been voted against by shareholders exercising 25% or more of the voting rights
exercised on this resolution, the Company extends an invitation to dissenting shareholders to engage with the
Company by forwarding their concerns/questions on the implementation report to Investor Relations in writing
on email sbrockman@anglogoldashanti.com or Investors@anglogoldashanti.com by close of business on
Friday, 17 May 2019. In addition, proactive steps will be taken in the coming months to initiate a dialogue with
investors in this regard.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Starts Process to Review Divestment Options for South African Assets

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) AngloGold Ashanti announced today that it was embarking on a
process to review divestment options for its remaining South African assets. This process will consider
all ownership options, with a view to maximising the value and future prospects of these assets. This
is in line with AngloGold Ashanti's ongoing review of its portfolio and a disciplined approach to
allocation of capital and other resources to ensure it generates maximum value for all its stakeholders.

AngloGold Ashanti has dedicated significant time and resources over the past few years to restructure
its South African operating portfolio into a more focused business with enhanced operating and
financial metrics. The successful completion of the restructuring has resulted in this portfolio
comprising a single underground mine, Mponeng, a surface rock dump processing business and a mine
waste retreatment operation, Mine Waste Solutions. These assets are now better positioned for the
future, with the potential for further enhanced production growth, profitability and free cash
generation from the significant remaining ore reserve base of 16.8 million ounces.

Mponeng is ramping up production from the Below 120 Level project, which is expected to give it a
lifespan of around eight years, with improved margins from anticipated higher grades within this new
mine area. In the medium term (starting in around two years), Mponeng will require additional capital
investment to further extend its life and to realise the full potential of this operation.

""We believe that under the right ownership, our South African assets offer a compelling long-term
value proposition that may allow for an extension to Mponeng Mine's current life,"" Chief Executive
Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""The investment to extend Mponeng's life beyond eight years has very
strong competition for capital and other scarce resources from a host of other projects in our portfolio,
which at current planning assumptions are more attractive, generating higher returns and quicker
payback periods - we have therefore decided to review divestment options for our South African
business.""

This process is at an early stage and may not ultimately result in any change to the ownership of the
South African business. AngloGold Ashanti's priority is to ensure that the process is conducted with
the appropriate thoroughness to ensure the best possible outcome for all stakeholders.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Costs Improve, Guidance Maintained; Starts Process on SA Assets

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti said costs improved in the first
quarter and all aspects of full-year guidance remained on track, as the Company started a
process to review divestment options for its South African assets.


Production for the three months ended 31 March 2019 was 752,000oz at an average total
cash cost of $791/oz, compared to 824,000oz at $834/oz during the first quarter of last year.
All-in sustaining costs from these operations fell 2% to $1,009/oz over the same period. The
company delivered a solid Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37%, despite a lower gold price and
marginally lower production from certain assets, which it had flagged earlier in February.


AngloGold Ashanti is streamlining its portfolio to ensure greater management focus and to
concentrate its capital on projects delivering the highest returns. The Company, which today
said it started a process to review divestment options for its South African assets, already has
processes underway to find buyers for its holdings in the Cerro Vanguardia mine, in Argentina
and the Sadiola mine, in Mali.


""Our priorities are to safely improve margins, and to ensure we increase long-term value for
our stakeholders,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""We're working hard on both
fronts - driving fundamental cost improvements through investment and efficiency initiatives,
and ensuring we have a fit-for-purpose portfolio.""
Cash generation, despite the 5% improvement in total cash costs year-on-year was offset by
a number of factors including a 2% lower gold price, lower production and sales volumes, and
adverse working capital movements. Iduapriem, Tropicana and Kibali delivered strong
operating performances, while production was impacted at Siguiri, due to ramp-up of a new
plant; in Brazil, due to regulatory stoppages; in South Africa, due to power interruptions and
seismicity; and at Geita, which underwent scheduled maintenance of its mill. Moving into the
second quarter and for the remainder of the year, both production and costs are set to improve.


The Company continued to focus on safety, efficiencies and improving the overall quality of
its portfolio. For the first time in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a year without a fatal
accident at any of its operations on 7 April 2019.


Key projects remain on track and within budget. Obuasi remains the main area of growth
development focus for this year as the Company works towards its first gold pour at the end
of 2019. The Siguiri Combination Plant is currently ramping up towards full production in June.
At Tropicana in Australia, decline development at Boston Shaker is about to commence with
mining of the first stope expected in August 2020.

The Company has also announced its decision to further streamline the portfolio through a
process to review the divestment options of its South African assets aimed to ensure that the
value and future prospects of these assets are maximised. This is in line with AngloGold
Ashanti's ongoing review of its portfolio and a disciplined capital allocation approach to ensure
it generates maximum value for all its stakeholders.

The full-year guidance* remains unchanged as follows:

     •    Production between 3.25Moz to 3.45Moz;
     •    Total cash costs between $730/oz and $780/oz;
     •    AISC between $935/oz and $995/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the
          US Dollar of ZAR 14.00 (South African Rand), BRL 3.65 (Brazilian Real), AUD 0.75
          (Australian Dollar) and ARS 40.00 (Argentinian Peso), with the Brent crude oil price at
          $74/bl average for the year; and
     •    Capital expenditure anticipated to be between $910m and $990m.

* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational, labour or power disruptions or other interruptions, nor further
changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or
unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any
expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from
guidance and any deviation may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report
on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

First quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti delivered a steady start to the year, as the Company continued to focus on safety, efficiencies and improving the overall
quality of its portfolio and balance sheet. Delivering year-on-year improvements in both total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (AISC), the
Company recorded a solid Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% in the three months ended 31 March 2019 and remains on-track to deliver annual
guidance across all metrics.

Production from retained operations during the first quarter of 2019 was 752,000oz at an average total cash cost of $791/oz, compared to
773,000oz at an average total cash cost of $803/oz from the retained operations during the first quarter of last year. As discussed at the
February 2019 results presentation for the full year ended 31 December 2018, the slower-than-normal start from the retained operations was
due to unfavourable performances from Siguiri, which was ramping up after completion of the new combination plant; Brazil, which was affected
by regulatory stoppages subsequent to the tailings dam wall collapse at Vale; and South Africa, which experienced power disruptions and
seismicity challenges. Nonetheless, the portfolio delivered solid year-on-year trends across most of the asset base, with strong production
performances from Geita, Iduapriem, Tropicana and Kibali. AISC for the quarter increased slightly to $1,009/oz compared to $1,001/oz from
retained operations during the first quarter of last year.

The Continental Africa region delivered strong year-on-year gold production, with solid operating performances at Geita, Iduapriem, and
Kibali. In Australia, AISC improved significantly as a result of lower capital expenditures in the region with both AISC and total cash costs
impacted by favourable exchange rates. Although production was lower from the South Africa region, the performance was solid considering
Eskom-related power issues and the care required in managing seismic activity underground. The Americas region experienced lower production
due to operational issues. However, we anticipate a stronger second half of 2019 in this region.

For the first time in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a year without a fatal accident at any of its operations on 7 April 2019. This represents
the collective and cumulative efforts of every individual in the business, as well as the strategic focus on safety. While this is a momentous
achievement, there is certainly no complacency and the focus remains on achieving our goal of zero harm, across all workplaces.

The solid operating quarter, was assisted by a 5% improvement in total cash costs, offset by a 2% lower gold price received, lower year-on-
year production and sales volumes and adverse working capital movements of $21m compared to the first quarter of 2018 and as a result cash inflow
from operating activities was $67m compared to $117m during the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) decreased by 20% to $307m in the first quarter from $383m in the first quarter of 2018. The impact of
the above resulted in a free cash outflow of $109m during the first quarter, compared to a free cash outflow of $70m reported in
the first quarter of 2018.

Key projects remain on track and within budget. Obuasi remains the main area of growth development focus for this year as the Group works
towards its first gold pour at the end of this year. The Siguiri Combination Plant is currently ramping up towards full production in June 2019. 
At Tropicana in Australia, decline development at Boston Shaker is about to commence with mining of the first stope expected in August 2020.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) during the first quarter was $141m, lower than the $169m reported for the
first quarter of 2018. Total capital expenditure included project capital of $37m, most of which was spent at Obuasi, with some minor residual
project capital spent at Siguiri, Mponeng and Kibali. Capital expenditure is expected to rise 50-60% from the first quarter to the second
quarter with increased spending anticipated, mainly at Obuasi, Tropicana and the Brazil operations.

Net debt was $1.78bn at 31 March 2019(1), compared to $1.77bn at 31 March 2018. As at 31 March 2019, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA was
1.27 times, up from 1.14 times at 31 March 2018 and 1.12 times at the end of last year, given the effects of lower production, which is expected
to improve as the year progresses, and lower gold price received. The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity and ample headroom
under our covenants. The balance sheet is expected to improve further as production steps up during the year, in line with historical trends.
Both production and capital expenditure are expected to increase in the remaining three quarters of the year, in line with historical seasonal trends.

(1) In terms of AngloGold Ashanti's covenants, net debt excludes the impacts of IFRS 16, Leases, which was effective from 1 January 2019. 
    At 31 March 2019, lease liabilities in terms of the new standard amounted to $119m, which is not included in the $1.78bn net debt number.

The full-year guidance(2) remains unchanged as follows:

     -    Production between 3.25Moz to 3.45Moz;
     -    Total cash costs between $730/oz and $780/oz;
     -    AISC between $935/oz and $995/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US Dollar of ZAR 14.00(Rand), BRL 3.65(Brazilian Real), 
          AUD 0.75(Australian Dollar) and ARS 40.00(Argentinian Peso), with the Brent crude oil price at $74/bl average for the year; and
     -    Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $910m and $990m.

(2) Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational, labour or power disruptions or other interruptions, nor  further changes to asset 
    portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material 
    adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct.
    Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold 
    Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

There were no fatalities during the first quarter ended 31 March 2019. Shortly after quarter end, AngloGold Ashanti reached a full 12 months 
without a fatal accident at all operations for the first time in its history.

The Group All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 4.22 injuries per million hours worked for the first
quarter of 2019, compared to 6.35 in the first quarter of last year, a 34% decline demonstrating a continued improvement in our safety
performance.

In South Africa, Mponeng - the deepest mine in the world - achieved 1 million fatality-free shifts on 14 January 2019 and 365 fatality-free days 
on 7 April 2019.  Mponeng's AIFR improved by 27% from the same reporting period a year ago. The region's AIFR for the quarter was 9.43, a 25% 
improvement from 12.58 during the same quarter in 2018.

Continental Africa region's AIFR improved by 46% for the quarter, from 7.17 to 3.89 compared to the first quarter in 2018. The Siguiri, Geita, 
and Serra Grande mines, as well as the La Colosa, Gramalote and Quebradona projects all achieved injury-free quarters.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The Continental Africa region delivered an 8% year-on-year increase in gold production to 338,000oz at a total cash cost of $819/oz in the
first quarter of 2019 compared to 314,000oz at a total cash cost of $842/oz in the first quarter of 2018. AISC for the first quarter of 2019 was
$969/oz compared to $963/oz in the same quarter a year ago. The region's production gains were driven mainly by strong performances in
a few of the mines, with Kibali delivering a 21% increase in production, Iduapriem a 12% increase and Geita a 11% increase.

Kibali's production increased due to improved underground output and record shaft hoisting, very stable mill operations and improved
metallurgical recovery. Grades improved during the first quarter of 2019 due to a greater contribution of material from the underground tonnes
compared to last year when the underground operations were in the initial stages of ramping up production.

AngloGold Ashanti's operating partner at Kibali, Barrick, continues to engage with the DRC government and administration on the issues
around the new mine code introduced in 2018, in order to ensure that the mining code equitably balances the interests of the DRC government
and the capital providers to allow both to participate fairly in the value creation that the mining industry offers.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's strong production performance is attributable to higher recovered grades in Teberebie cut 1 and cut 3 during the period
which, together with a lower stripping ratio, contributed to 15% lower cash costs. This more than offset higher processing and other costs,
including dewatering costs incurred to repair the old pumping infrastructure in preparation for the rainy season and those incurred to safeguard
the existing TSF dam wall, as planned.

In Tanzania, Geita's production was supported by strong average recovered grades at 3.58g/t compared to 2.44g/t in the same period last
year, which helped to offset the lower throughput due to planned maintenance on the ball mill during the quarter. This increase in grades was
due to planned higher feed grade as ore was being sourced from Nyankanga block 5 and Star and Comet cut 2 underground operations.

At Siguiri, in Guinea, production decreased 18% year-on-year as a result of limited flexibility during the commissioning of the Carbon-In-Leach
plant. Total cash costs were impacted by the lower volumes treated and higher utilisation of oxide stockpile ore tonnes compared to the previous
period. The mine has started to see grades increase as higher volumes of fresh rock material feed are coming into production following the
commissioning of the hard rock crushing and milling circuit in the latter part of the quarter.

In Mali, production remained flat at 22,000oz for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year. Morila saw an increase in
recovered grade due to the availability and treatment of higher-grade material being mined from the Viper pit, partly offset by a 27% decrease
in tonnes treated as a result of treatment of harder ore compared to the blend of softer tailings and oxides treated in the previous period. At
Sadiola, the mine continued with the stockpile treatment plan.

Production in the Americas region was 165,000oz at a total cash cost of $719/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019 compared to 191,000oz
at a total cash cost of $657/oz in the first quarter of 2018. AISC for the first quarter of 2019 was $967/oz compared to $843/oz in the same 
quarter a year ago. Total cash costs were higher reflecting cost escalations across the region and lower by-product contributions, partly offset 
by favourable exchange rates.

At AngloGold Ashanti Mineracao, production was down 8% year-on-year due to lower grades at Corrego do Sitio as a result of geological
model changes and geotechnical issues. Additionally, heavy rains and a 21-day work stoppage at Corrego do Sitio due to the regulatory 
requirement following the tailings dam wall collapse at Vale, impacted production and resulted in higher costs as a consequence.

At Serra Grande, production was lower due to lower tonnages from the underground. However, costs benefited from favourable gold inventory
and exchange rate movements.

In the Australia region, production was 158,000oz at a total cash cost of $687/oz for the first quarter ended 31 March 2019 compared to
161,000oz at a total cash cost of $742/oz in the first quarter of 2018. The AISC for the first quarter of 2019 was $919/oz compared to $1,022/oz
in the same quarter a year ago. Costs benefited from favourable exchange rates and lower capital spend.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 72,000oz at a total cash cost of $854/oz compared to 88,000oz at a total cash cost of $782/oz in the same
quarter last year when the mill feed grade was 7% higher. Production for the first quarter of 2019 was also impacted by lower metallurgical
recoveries. The Recovery Enhancement Project circuit is meeting Feasibility Study specifications and the focus is now on stabilising the
downstream circuits to maximise gold recovery. This, along with work to lift underground production, is part of a holistic strategy to 
increase gold production and reduce costs.

Tropicana produced 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $541/oz compared to 73,000oz at a total cash cost of $661/oz in the same quarter last
year. Production was boosted by a 9% increase in mill throughput and an 18% increase in mill feed grade, along with a 1% increase in
metallurgical recovery. During the quarter the Boston Shaker Underground Project was approved after a Feasibility Study confirmed that
underground mining is technically and financially viable. The project demonstrates robust economics with an anticipated IRR of 39% for a
capital investment of $79.3 million (100%).

The South African operations produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,037/oz for the first quarter ended 31 March 2019, compared to
107,000oz produced by the retained operations for the first quarter of 2018 at a total cash cost of $1,049/oz. During the first quarter of 2018,
gold production from the South African operations was 158,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,131/oz. The AISC for the region was $1,197/oz for
the quarter ended 31 March 2019 compared to $1,225/oz for the same quarter a year ago by the retained operations. Lower total cash costs
for the period are attributable to improved operating efficiencies as well as a weaker exchange rate, all partially offset by lower gold output.
Cost reduction initiatives, focused on both on- and off-mine cost structures for the smaller production base, are continuing.

At Mponeng, 15% lower production was due to limitations on face length availability as a de-risking process was implemented to manage
seismicity in the above 120 Level mining area. Seismicity remains closely monitored and continuous work is undertaken to manage the hazard in
the normal course of business.

Following the introduction of the new shift arrangement in November 2018, Mponeng's employees are responding positively in the transitioning
phase of these shift arrangements which enable increased face time. The early results observed includes safety improvements, increased
blasting frequency, and a better-than-anticipated rate of face advancement. The mine management team, through the implementation
committee, is consistently monitoring the implementation of the intended design and adjusting where necessary.

At Mine Waste Solutions (MWS) production was lower mainly due to intermittent power availability from Eskom and inclement weather,
which impacted all of the region's surface operations. This had an adverse impact on tonnages processed and plant stability at MWS, ultimately
impacting metallurgical efficiencies. Plans are currently being executed to increase delivered grades to recoup some of the lost gold production.
This will be done by optimising the mining mix through more efficient blending of feed sources and improving metallurgical efficiencies in the
processing plant.

CORPORATE UPDATE

AngloGold Ashanti will be embarking on a process to review divestment options of its remaining South African assets. This process will consider
all ownership options, with a view to maximising the value and future prospects of these assets. This is in line with AngloGold Ashanti's ongoing
review of its portfolio and a disciplined approach to allocation of capital and other resources to ensure that it generates maximum value for all
its stakeholders.

AngloGold Ashanti has dedicated significant time and resources over the past few years to restructure its South African operating portfolio into
a more focused business with enhanced operating and financial metrics. The successful completion of the restructuring has resulted in this
portfolio comprising a single underground mine, Mponeng, a surface rock dump processing business and a mine waste retreatment operation,
Mine Waste Solutions. These assets are now better positioned for the future, with the potential for further enhanced production growth,
profitability and free cash generation from the significant remaining ore reserve base of 16.8 million ounces.

Mponeng is ramping up production from the Below 120 Level project, which is expected to give it a lifespan of around eight years, with improved
margins from anticipated higher grades within this new mine area. In the medium term (starting in around two years), Mponeng will require
additional capital investment to further extend its life and to realise the full potential of this operation.

""We believe that under the right ownership, our South African assets offer a compelling long-term value proposition that may allow for an
extension to Mponeng Mine's current life,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""The investment to extend Mponeng's life beyond
eight years has very strong competition for capital and other scarce resources from a host of other projects in our portfolio, which at current
planning assumptions are more attractive, generating higher returns and quicker payback periods - we have therefore decided to review
divestment options for our South African business.""

This process is at an early stage and may not ultimately result in any change to the ownership of the South African business. AngloGold
Ashanti's priority is to ensure that the process is conducted with the appropriate thoroughness to ensure the best possible outcome for all
stakeholders.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Update on the Obuasi Redevelopment Project

The project continues to target first gold at the end of 2019 with the commissioning of Phase 1 (2,000tpd). Completion of the project at the
end of 2020 (4,000tpd) remains on track. The estimated capital spend to completion remains on budget. Design and procurement are in progress. 
Demolition of redundant plant infrastructure is close to completion. Refurbishment for Phase 1 commenced. The operating management team is in place, 
and recruitment and training of the operating team is progressing on schedule. The underground mining contractor has been mobilised and the first 
development blast was achieved on 1 February 2019.

Siguiri Combination Plant
Construction of the Siguiri combination plant was successfully completed in March 2019. Commissioning of the different sections of the plant
is underway. The Carbon-In-Leach circuit was commissioned and first gold from it was poured at the end of 2018. The 30MW power plant was
commissioned in October 2018 and is now fully operational providing reliable, low-cost power to the Siguiri mine. The crushing and milling
circuits for the treatment of the hard sulphide ore are currently being commissioned and full ramp-up is expected in the first half of 2019. The
focus for the year will be to stabilise the combination plant throughput and operating stability following its commissioning.

Boston Shaker
During the quarter, the Company announced the approved development of the Boston Shaker Underground Project at the Tropicana Gold Mine
in Western Australia. Boston Shaker will contribute higher grade mill feed, resulting in an improved gold production profile and enhanced cash
flow. Importantly, the underground mine will provide improved cash flow during 2021-2023 when the mine plan includes periods of higher waste
stripping in the Havana open pit. Ore from the underground mine will enable Tropicana gold production to be maintained at between
450,000-500,000oz per annum (100%) over the next five years, lifting the average to 480,000oz per annum over the five-year period, while also 
providing attractive returns.

Decline development is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2019 with first gold scheduled for the third quarter of 2020. The portal
will be located in the completed Tropicana Pit, to minimise interaction between the open pit fleet working in the Boston Shaker pit and underground
equipment.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry,
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, productivity improvements, growth prospects
and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial
operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti's
liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and
safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti's operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts

statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from

NEWS RELEASE

Boston Shaker underground mine to go ahead at Tropicana
(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE)

AngloGold Ashanti Australia Ltd (70% and manager) and Independence Group NL (30%)
have approved development of the Boston Shaker Underground Project at the Tropicana
Gold Mine in Western Australia.

A Feasibility Study has confirmed that underground mining is technically and financially
viable, demonstrating robust economics with an anticipated IRR of 39% for a capital
investment of $79.3 million (100%). See Table 1 for breakdown.

Boston Shaker will contribute higher grade mill feed, resulting in an improved gold
production profile and enhanced cash flow. Importantly the underground mine will provide
improved cash flow during 2021-2023 when the mine plan includes periods of higher waste
stripping in the Havana open pit.

Ore from the underground mine will enable Tropicana gold production to be maintained at
between 450,000-500,000 ounces per annum (100%) over the next five years, lifting the
average to 480,000 oz. per annum over the five year period.
The project will commence in the June quarter 2019 and first gold is scheduled for the
September quarter in 2020.

""Underground mining at Boston Shaker will leverage further value from this high performing
operation, achieving pay-back in just over three years,"" said Ludwig Eybers, AngloGold
Ashanti's Chief Operating Officer International.

""An ongoing focus on Operational Excellence has enabled Tropicana to consistently exceed
expectations, and I am sure this world class performance will extend into the underground
operation.""

The expanded ore production from the mine will capitalise on investments made in the
Tropicana processing plant, which includes the second ball mill, commissioned in November
2018, increasing throughput capacity to 8.1 Mtpa.

The Boston Shaker ore body remains open at depth and the JV partners will continue to test
high grade extensions to the Mineral Resource beneath the Tropicana and Havana pits to
assess the opportunity for further underground mining operations (see Figure 1 in the
complete announcement available on the company website – www.anglogoldashanti.com).


Project Details
A maiden underground Ore Reserve has been declared at Tropicana, based on an Ore
Reserve gold price of $1,100/oz The Boston Shaker (100%) Ore Reserve is estimated at 2.8
million tonnes grading 3.84 g/t for 317,000 oz of contained gold – see Table 2.

The Boston Shaker underground Mineral Resource estimate is 12.5 Mt at 4.2 g/t for 1.7 Moz
– see Table 3.

The Feasibility Study was based on the mining of 6.58 million tonnes, grading 3.84 g/t,
assuming the systematic conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves over the life of
the mine.

The average underground mining rate will be approximately 1.1 Mtpa (including
development) over an eight year mine life to 2026 to produce a total of 732,000 oz. Mining
methods will comprise conventional mechanised mining and underhand sublevel open
stoping.

The proposed mining fleet comprises: two jumbos, two production drills, three remote-
capable loaders and four trucks.

An underground mining contract has been awarded to Macmahon Holdings Ltd
(Macmahon), the mining alliance partner at Tropicana since commencement of open pit
mining in 2012. As Macmahon will operate both the open pit and underground mines
significant operational and management synergies will be delivered.

The underground operation adds an additional year to Tropicana's overall mine life, taking it
to 2029 based on the current Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource of 136.2
Mt at 1.76 g/t for a contained 7.7 Moz.

Decline development is expected to commence in Q2 2019 with mining of the first stope
scheduled to begin in August 2020. The portal will be located in the completed Tropicana Pit,
to minimise interaction between the open pit fleet working in the Boston Shaker pit and
underground equipment (see Figure 2 in the complete announcement available on the
company website – www.anglogoldashanti.com).

Average underground mining costs, including geology, are anticipated to be between $55-
$60/tonne.

Metallurgical test work based on current processing plant conditions indicate a recovery rate
of 89.9% from the underground ore. Underground ore will be blended with open pit ore and
no changes are anticipated in the plant operating expenditure.

The capital cost (100%) is estimated at $79.3 million (A$105.7 million) – see Table 1 for
breakdown.

Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria                                 Commentary

Sampling techniques                         - AngloGold Ashanti Australia (AngloGold) has used drilling and subsampling of the cuttings or cores as
                                              the data basis for the Mineral Resource estimates of the Tropicana deposits. Details are given in the
                                              following subsection.
                                            - Drill hole spacings range from 25m×25m grids to 100m×100m grids, with most of the drilling of the
                                              Open Pit Mineral Resources on a 50m×50m spacing with 25m×25m testing the starter pits of the
                                              Tropicana and Havana initial pits, and the southern end of the Boston Shaker deposit.
                                            - A 100m×100m area of Havana was drilled out on a 10m×10m grid to validate the resource model and
                                              optimise the grade control sample spacing.
                                            - The Boston Shaker Underground Mineral Resource is drilled at 50 x 25m in the upper levels and out to
                                              100 x 100m at deeper levels.
                                            - The Underground Mineral Resource down-plunge extensions of Havana Deeps is tested using a
                                              100m×100m grid. Deep +800m deep step-out holes have been drilled on nominal ?200m×100m to test
                                              the high-grade mineralisation of Havana Deeps.
                                            - All holes are drilled plunging towards the west to intersect the east dipping mineralised zones


Drilling techniques                     -  Reverse circulation (RC) percussion drilling using face-sampling bits (5¼ inch or 133mm diameter) has
                                           been used to collect samples from the shallower (up-dip) part of the deposits with a nominal maximum
                                           RC depth of 150m.
                                         - Diamond core drilling has been used for deeper holes, with diamond tails drilled from RC pre-collars.
                                           To control the deviation of deep DD holes drilled since 2011, many of these holes were drilled from
                                           short ? 60m RC pre-collars or using 63.5mm (HQ) diameter core from surface.
                                         - Diamond core drilling for Mineral Resource definition is predominantly 47.6mm (NQ) diameter core,
                                           with a lesser number of holes drilled for collection of metallurgical and/or geotechnical data using
                                           63.5mm (HQ2, HQ3) ore 85mm (PQ) core diameters.
                                         - In fresh rock, cores are oriented wherever possible for collection of structural data. Prior to 2009, core
                                           orientations are made using the EzyMark tool with the Reflex Ace Tool replacing the system in later
                                           drilling programmes.


Drill sample recovery                    -    RC recovery:
                                               o    Prior to 2008 semi-quantitative assessment was made regarding RC sample recovery with
                                                    recovery visually estimated as 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the expected mass volume of a 1m
                                                    drilling interval.
                                               o    Since 2008, AngloGold has implemented quantitative measure on every 25th interval where the
                                                    masses of the sample splits are recorded and compared to the theoretical mass of the sampling
                                                    interval for the rock type being drilled.
                                               o    AngloGold found that overall recovery in the regolith was >80% and with total recovery in fresh
                                                    rock.
                                         -    DD Recovery:
                                               o    DD recovery has been measured as percentage of the total length of core recovered compared
                                                    to the drill interval.
                                               o    Core recovery is consistently high in fresh rock with minor losses occurring in heavily fractured
                                                    ground or for DD drilling in the regolith.
                                         -    The main methods to maximise recovery have been recovery monitoring as described above and
                                              diamond core drilling below ?150m depth.
                                         -    No relationships have been noted between sample recovery and grade and sample biases that may
                                              have occurred due to the preferential loss or gain of fine or course material are considered unlikely.
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria                  Commentary

Logging                   -   RC cuttings and DD cores have been logged geologically and geotechnically with reference to
                              AngloGold's logging standard library, to levels of detail that support Mineral Resource estimation,
                              Underground Ore Reserve estimation and metallurgical studies.
                          -   Qualitative logging includes codes for lithology, regolith, and mineralisation for both RC and DD, with
                              sample quality data recorded for RC such as moisture, recovery, and sub-sampling methods.
                          -   DD cores are photographed, qualitatively structurally logged with reference to orientation
                              measurements where available.
                          -   Geotechnical quantitative logging includes QSI, RQD, matrix and fracture characterisation.
                          -   The total lengths of all drill holes have been logged.

                          -   RC – Primary splitting
Sub-sampling techniques
and sample preparation         o   Prior to 2007 RC samples were collected from the cyclone stream using a tiered riffle splitter.
                                   From 2007 a static cone splitter was introduced and replaced riffles splitters on all rigs.
                               o   The RC sampling interval is generally 1m but from 2016, 2m intervals were introduced for RC
                                   pre-collars.
                               o   The splitters collected a ?12% split from the primary lot with two 12% splits collected – the first for
                                   laboratory submission and second as a reference or replicate. Most samples were collected dry
                                   with <2% of samples recorded as being split in moist or wet state.
                               o   The main protocol to ensure the RC samples were representative of the material being collected
                                   was monitoring of sample recovery and collection and assay of replicate samples.

                               o   DD cores are collected of intervals determined by geological boundaries but generally targeting a
                                   1m length
                               o   All NQ cores have been half-core sampled with the core cut longitudinally with a wet diamond
                                   blade.
                               o   A few of the DD whole cores have been sampled from HQ3 cores drilled to twin RC holes in the
                                   regolith or for geotechnical or metallurgical testing.
                               o   In 2005, some 1,150m of cores drilled in the oxide zone were chisel split rather than wet cut but
                                   this poorer sub-sampling represents <0.01% of the core drilled.
                          -   Laboratory preparation
                               o   Sample preparation has taken place at three laboratories since commencement of Mineral
                                   Resource definition drilling including SGS Perth (pre- 2006), Genalysis Perth (2006 to April 2016)
                                   and SGS Tropicana onsite laboratory (2015 Boston Shaker samples and post-April 2016 – Dec,
                                   2017 samples), and SGS Perth from Jan, 2018 onwards.
                               o   RC samples are oven dried then pulped in a mixer mill to a PSD of 90% passing 75 microns
                                   before subsampling for fire assay.
                               o   SGS prepared DD half-core samples by jaw-crushing then pulverisation of the whole crushed lot
                                   to a particle size distribution (PSD) of 90% passing 75 microns. A 50g subsample of the pulp was
                                   then collected for fire assay.
                               o   Genalysis prepared the samples in a Boyd crusher rotary splitter combo with nominally 2.5kg
                                   half-core lots crushed to <3mm then rotary split to ? 1 kg before pulverisation and sub-sampling
                                   for fire assay.
                               o   At SGS Tropicana samples are processed in automated sample preparation system, where
                                   samples are crushed in a Boyd crusher to a PSD of 90% passing 2mm then subsampled using a
                                   linear sample divider to ~1kg. Samples with mass <800g are manually pulped in a LM2 mill to a
                                   PSD of 75 microns before sub-sampling for fire assay.
                               o   From May 2016, a jaw crusher has been used to crush half-core samples to a PSD of 100%
                                   passing 6mm allowing for diamond core processing at the SGS Tropicana lab.
                          -   Quality controls for sampling and assaying
                               o   SGS inserted blanks and standards at a 1:20 frequency in every batch with a duplicate pulp
                                   collected for assay every 20th sample. Further repeats were also completed at a 1:20 frequency
                                   in a random manner.
                               o   Sieve checks were completed on 5% of samples to monitor PSD compliance.
                               o   Genalysis inserted blanks and standards in every batch and a duplicate pulp was collected for
                                   assay on every 25th sample and 6% of each batch was randomly selected for replicate analysis.
                                   Sieve checks were completed on 5% of samples to monitor PSD compliance.
                               o   Tropicana laboratory used barren basalt and quartz to clean equipment between routine samples
                          -   Sample size versus grain size
                               o   No specific heterogeneity tests have been carried out but the sample sizes collected are
                                   consistent with industry standards for the style of mineralisation under consideration.
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria                    Commentary
                                 o   A 2008 sampling variability study found that 72% of the gold in the samples tested was in size
                                     fraction <300 microns, and that repeated sampling of the same lot have very low variance
                                     between replicates.

Quality of assay data and   -   No geophysical tools were used to determine any element concentrations material to the Mineral
laboratory tests                Resource estimate.
                            - All Mineral Resource prepared pulps have undergone 50g fire assay which is considered a total assay
                              for gold.
                            - As discussed above all laboratories have used industry standard quality control procedures with
                              standards used to monitor accuracy, replicate assay to monitor precision, blanks to monitor potential
                              cross contamination and sieve tests to monitor PSD compliance.
                            - AngloGold has also used other ‘umpire' laboratories to monitor accuracy including Genalysis Perth
                              (prior to November 2006), SGS (from November 2006 to August 2007) and ALS Perth (since August
                              2007), with these check assaying campaigns coinciding with each Mineral Resource update.
                            - AngloGold has reviewed the quality sample results on a batch by batch and monthly basis and has
                              found that the overall performance of the laboratories used for Mineral Resource estimation samples is
                              satisfactory.

Verification of sampling    -   Significant intersections of mineralisation are routinely verified by AngloGold senior geological staff and
and assaying                    have also been inspected by several independent auditors as describe further below.
                            -   Twin holes have been drilled to compare results from RC and DD drilling with the DD results
                                confirming that there is no material down-hole smearing of grades in the nearby RC drilling and
                                sampling.
                            -   All logging and sample data is captured digitally in the field using Field Marshall Software, prior to
                                upgrade to Micromine's Geobank in 2016. Data is downloaded daily to the Tropicana Exploration
                                Database (Datashed) and checked for accuracy, completeness and structure by the field personnel.
                            -   Assay data is merged electronically from the laboratories into a central Datashed database, with
                                information verified spatially in Vulcan software. AngloGold maintains standard work procedures for all
                                data management steps.
                            -   An assay importing protocol has been set up to ensure quality samples are checked and accepted
                                before data can be loaded into the assay database
                            -   All electronic data is routinely backed up to AngloGold's server in Perth and provided to IGO via FTP
                                transfer.
                            -   There have been no adjustments or scaling of assay data other than setting below detection limit
                                values to half detection for Mineral Resource estimation work.

Location of data points     -   All completed drill hole collar locations of surface holes have been using RTK GPS equipment, which
                                was connected to the state survey mark (SSM) network.
                            -   The grid system is GDA94 Zone 51 using AHD elevation datum.
                            -   Prior to 2007, drill hole path surveys have been completed on all holes using Eastman single shot
                                camera tools, with down-hole gyro tools used for all drilling post 2007.
                            -   A digital terrain model was prepared by Whelan's Surveyors from aerial photography flown in 2007,
                                which has been supplemented with collar data surveyed using RTK GPS. This model is considered to
                                have centimetre-scale accuracy.

Data spacing and            -  The drill hole spacing nominally ranges from 25mN×25mE to 100mN×100mE (local grid) over most of
distribution                   the Mineral Resource area with a small area of 10mN×10mE used for grade control calibration work.
                            - Most of the Open Pit Mineral Resources has been tested on a 50mN×50mE grid with closer spaced
                               25mN×25mE patterns in the upper parts of the deposit.
                            - Open Pit Grade Control is completed on a 12mNx12mE pattern.
                            - The Boston Shaker Underground Mineral Resource is drilled at 50 x 25m in the upper levels and out to
                               100 x 100m at deeper levels.
                            - The Havana Deeps Underground Mineral Resource has been drilled on a 100mN×100mE pattern.
                            - Down-hole sample intervals are typically 1m with 2m compositing applied for Mineral Resource
                               estimation work.
                             - The Competent Person considers that these data spacings are sufficient to establish the degree of
                                geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Underground Ore Reserve
                                estimation procedures applied, and the JORC Code classification applied.


Orientation of data in      -   Most drill hole are oriented to intersect the shallowly east dipping mineralisation at a high angle and as
relation to geological          such, a grade bias introduced by the orientation of data in relation to geological structure is highly
structure                       unlikely.
Section 1: Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria                    Commentary

Sample security             - The chain-of-sample custody is managed by AngloGold.
                             - Samples were collected in pre-numbered calico bags, which are then accumulated into polyweave
                               bags for transport from the collection site. The accumulated samples are then loaded into wooden
                               crates and road hauled to the respective laboratories (Perth) or processed onsite at Tropicana.
                             - Sample dispatches are prepared by the field personnel using a database system linked to the drill hole
                               data.
                             - Sample dispatch sheet are verified against samples received at the laboratory and any missing issued
                               such as missing samples and so on are resolved before sample preparation commences.
                             - The Competent Person considers that the likelihood of deliberate or accidental loss, mix-up or
                               contamination of samples is considered very low.

Audits or reviews           -   Field quality control data and assurance procedures are reviewed on a daily, monthly and quarterly
                                basis by AngloGold field personnel and senior geological staff.
                            -   The field quality control and assurance of the sampling was audited by consultant QG in 2007 and
                                2009. The conclusion of the audit was that the data was suitable for Mineral Resource estimation work.

Section 2: Reporting of Exploration Results
Criteria                    Explanation

Mineral tenement and land   -  The Tropical Gold Mine Mineral Resources are located wholly within WA mining lease M39/1096,
tenure status                  which commenced on 11 Mar 2015 and has a term of 21 years (expiry 10 Mar 2036).
                            - Tropicana Gold Mine in a joint venture between AngloGold (70%) and IGO (30%) with AngloGold as
                               manager.
                            - Gold production is subject to WA State royalties of 2.5% of the value of gold value.
                            - There are no material issues relating to native title or heritage, historical sites, wilderness or national
                               parks, or environmental settings
                             - The tenure is secure at the time of reporting and there are no known impediments to exploitation of the
                               Mineral Resource and Underground Ore Reserve and on-going exploration of the mining lease.


Exploration done by other   -   AngloGold entered in to a JV with IGO in early 2002 with the main target of interest being a WMC gold
parties                         soil anomaly of 31ppb, which was reporting in a WA government open file report. Prior to the JV, the
                                WMC soil sampling program was the only known exploration activity and the only dataset available
                                were WA government regional magnetic and gravity data.

Geology                     -   The Tropicana Gold Mine is on the western margin of a 700km long magnetic feature that is
                                interpreted to the collision suture zone between the Archean age Yilgarn Craton to the west and the
                                Proterozoic age Albany-Fraser Origan to the east of this feature. The gold deposits are hosted by a
                                package of Archean age high metamorphic grade gneissic rocks.
                            -   Four distinct structural domains have been identified – Boston Shaker, Tropicana, Havana and Havana
                                South, which represent the same mineral deposit offset by NE striking faults that post-date the
                                mineralisation.
                            -   The gold mineralisation is hosted by a shallowly SW dipping sequence of quartz-feldspar gneiss,
                                amphibolite, granulite and meta-sedimentary chert lithologies.
                            -   The gold mineralisation is concentrated in a ‘favourable horizon' of quartz-feldspar gneiss, with a
                                footwall of garnet gneiss, amphibolite or granulite.
                            -   Mineralisation is characterised by pyrite disseminations, bands and crackle veins within altered quartz-
                                feldspar gneiss. Higher grades are associated with close-spaced veins and sericite and biotite
                                alteration.
                            -   Mineralisation presents as stacked higher grade lenses within a low-grade alteration envelope.
                                Geological studies suggest the mineralisation is related to shear planes that post-date the
                                development of the main gneissic fabric and metamorphic thermal maximum.

Database integrity             - AngloGold captures field data and drill hole logging directly in to handheld devices or laptop computers
                                 using Field Marshall and Geobank software.
                               - The drill hole data is managed in DataShed software, which is an industry recognised system for
                                 management of geoscientific drill hole information. Logging, assays and survey information is loaded
                                 directly into Datashed using data import routines, with loading procedures incorporating quality control
                                 checking and validation.
                               - Data is validated following loading through visual inspection of results on-screen both spatially and
                                 using database queries and cross section plots. Typical checks carried out against original records to
                                 ensure data accuracy include items such as overlapping records, duplicate records, missing intervals,

Criteria                    Commentary

Site visits                 -   The Competent Person is site based and is actively involved in the management and supervision of
                                the Mineral Resource estimation.

Geological interpretation   - To control the Mineral Resource estimation process, three dimensional digital solids were prepared in
                              LeapFrog software for the mineralised zones, dykes, shears and garnet (mostly hangingwall) gneiss.
                            - Mineralised solids are prepared using a nominal 0.3g/t Au drill hole cut-off grade to encompass the
                              gold mineralisation targeted for Mineral Resource estimation. The dykes, shears and garnet gneiss
                              solids are prepared from geological logging. Regolith units are prepared as surfaces below topography
                              based on the geological logging.
                            - The resulting models encompass the mineralisation, the post-mineralisation barren dykes, the shears
                              controlling higher grade mineralisation and the main waste rock units that are the footwall and
                              hangingwall to the mineralisation.

Dimensions                  -   The Open Pit Mineral Resource is reported within an open pit Lerchs-Grossman-Analysis (LGA) pit
                                optimisation ‘shell' based on a gold price of $A1,778/tr.oz. ($US1,400 /tr.oz), and life-of-mine pit
                                designs.
                            -   This reporting shell has dimensions of approximately 4.7km along strike, up to 1km wide and up to
                                450m deep, spanning all the major deposits.
                            -   The Underground Mineral Resource extends from the base of the Open Pit Resource below the Open
                                Pit designs with plan extents in long dimension down dip to the SE by up to 900 m and up to ?200m
                                wide. A smaller lode extends from the Havana South pit with down dip extents of ?200m and up to
                                200m wide. Other parts of the Underground Mineral Resource are below the other pits.

Estimation and modelling    -   The Mineral Resource excluding Boston Shaker, was updated in July 2018:
techniques
                                 o   A single model was created to estimate both the Open Pit and Underground Mineral Resource.
                                 o   Has been estimated from the drill hole data available to 11 July 2018, which included 15,556 drill
                                     holes for a total of 1,172,907m of drilling of which, 1,285 holes were DD for 479,972m and 2,474
                                     holes were RC for 284,552m. An additional 11,797 RC Grade Control holes were used in the
                                     estimate (408,383m).
                                 o   The drill hole data was composited to 2m lengths within geological estimation domains using
                                     Vulcan software.
                                 o   Grade top-cut or caps were applied to the composites after examining cumulative probability
                                     plots of the data, and high-grade estimation limits were applied to limit the spatial spread of high
                                     grades in weakly mineralised domains.
                                 o   The composite data was declustered in each estimation domain using cell declustering with
                                     varying cell sizes, to determine a stable declustered mean grade.
                                 o   Gold continuity was interpreted for each estimation domain and grades for large panels were
                                     estimated using ordinary block kriging in Isatis software, with estimation panel dimension
                                     24mE×36mN×10mElv.
                                 o   A multi-pass search was used to account for the different drill hole spacings after incorporating
                                     the grade control drilling into the estimate. A short search-radius was used to estimate blocks in
                                     and around the grade control data, with an expanding search up to 120 x 120m used for wider-
                                     spaced data.
                                 o   Selective Mining Unit (SMU) grades were then estimated for each panel using the Local Uniform
                                     Conditioning method, where the SMU grade distribution within each panel is estimated through a
                                     change of support then the SMUs are localised using kriging so the distribution within the panel
                                     reflects the local grade trends in nearby data. The information effect of 12mE×12mN grade
                                     control information was accommodated in the change of support from panels to SMUs
                                 o   The SMU dimensions were set to prepare multiple SMUs per panel with SMU dimensions of
                                     12mE×12mN×3.33mElv. The elevation heights nominally match the mining flitch heights applied
                                     at each area.
                                 o   The estimate model was validated by comparing (input) data declustered means for each domain
                                     to the respective (output) block estimated grades both globally within each domain and locally
                                     using moving window ‘swath-plot'. On screen visual inspections were also completed in plan and
                                     section to ensure that the grade trends observed in the data were acceptably reproduced in the
                                     estimates without over extrapolation in areas of sparse drilling.
                                 o   Comparison of the Open Pit estimate forecasts to mine production indicates acceptable
                                     forecasting performance for monthly, quarterly and annual recompilation periods.
                            -   The Boston Shaker Mineral Resource was updated in January 2019:
                                 o  A single model was created to estimate both the Open Pit and Underground Mineral Resource.
                                 o  Has been estimated from the drill hole data available to 22nd January 2019, which included 1,471
                                    drill holes for a total of 191,340m.
                                 o Estimation parameters were kept consistent with the previous estimate (detailed above).
                            -   Sulphur is modelled as a secondary variable.

Moisture                   -   The tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.

Cut-off parameters         -   Open Pit
                                o   The Open Pit estimate is reported within a pit optimisation shell with an assumed gold prices of
                                    $US1,400/tr.oz ($A1,778/tr.oz) and cost assuming back-filling of pits (‘Long Island Study').
                                o   On the basis described above, and assuming lower processing costs and higher metallurgical
                                    oxide ore, the cut-off are ?0.3g/t Au for oxide Mineral Resources and ?0.4g/t Au for transitional
                                    and fresh Mineral Resources.
                           -   Underground
                                o   The Underground estimate cut-off grade is based on the assumptions of the Boston Shaker pre-
                                    feasibility study, and uses a gold price of $US1,400/tr.oz ($A1,778/tr.oz) and underground mining
                                    and processing cost assumptions for fresh Mineral Resource.
                                o   The cut-off grade for reporting the Underground Mineral Resource on this basis is ?1.8g/t Au.


Mining factors or          -   The mining factors and assumption for the Open Pit Mineral Resource is the current mining method of
assumptions                    conventional truck and shovel mining with blasting of 10 m benches in Tropicana and Havana and
                               blasting of 7.5 m benches in Boston Shaker.
                           -   Open Pit ore is mined in three 1/3 blast height flitches, with ore predefined by 12mE×12mN RC grade
                               control drilling and 1m downhole sampling.
                           -   The assumed Open Pit mining selectivity are the SMU dimensions assumed for the LUC estimates.
                           -   The assumption for the Underground Mineral Resource is long-hole open stoping between 25m levels.
                           -   No Mineral Resource margin (extremal) dilution has been modelled in either estimate.
                           -   Eventual prospects of economic extraction for the Open Pit resource have been assessed through pit
                               optimisation studies and reporting the Mineral Resource within pit designs and an optimisation shell.
                           -   The Boston Shaker Underground Mineral Resource is currently the focus of a study into Underground
                               mining.

Metallurgical factors or   - The ore processing method at Tropicana is well-established with conventional, crushing, grinding then
assumptions                  carbon-in-leach extraction of gold followed by electrowinning to produce gold bars.
                           - An average metallurgical recovery as described in Section 4 further below, has been assumed for both
                             the Open Pit and Underground Mineral Resources based on metallurgical testing completed as part of
                             the Feasibility Study for the Havana Open Pit.

Environmental factors or   -  Tropicana Gold mine operates under an environmental management plan that meets or exceeds all
assumptions                   statutory and legislative requirements.
                           - Mined waste rock is disposed in waste dumps which are progressively rehabilitated as mining
                              progresses with any potentially acid generating waste encapsulated in non-acid generating material.
                            - A tailing storage facility is used to contain and capture process residues.
                            - The mine produces rehabilitation plans for ongoing rehabilitation and mine closure plans, and the costs
                              are included in the financial model.

Bulk density               -  AngloGold routinely collects in situ bulk density measurements on ?10cm long core segments using
                              the Archimedes principle method of dry weight versus weight in water. There are ?200,000 density
                              measurements in the estimation database with the vast majority (~98%) of measurements from fresh
                              rock and the remainder in the regolith or cover.
                           - Measurements are collected over 1m to 5m intervals targeting intervals that are deemed representative
                              of key lithologies in fresh rock. Density has been collected on core within the regolith from ‘core-from-
                              surface' drill holes, with the measurement method accounting for voids.
                            - Depending on rock type density ranges of 1.89 t/m3 to 2.18 t/m3 in the saprolite and ranges from
                               2.56t/m3 to 2.96 t/m3 in the transitional and fresh rock domains.
                            - Density is estimated by ordinary block kriging in the Mineral Resource estimates apart from a few
                               minor domains with sparse data (such as the regolith), where density is assigned as a mean of the
                               data.

Classification             -   The basis of classification of the Tropicana estimates into different JORC Code confidence categories
                               is drill hole spacing as follows:
                           Open Pit:
                                o   Measured Mineral Resources: average 25mE×25mN collar spacing

                                         geological or grade continuity is sufficient to support grade estimation.
                            Underground:
                                    o    Measured Mineral Resources: average 12.5mE×12.5mN intercept spacing

                                    o    Inferred Mineral Resources: average 100mE×100mN collar spacing (or less) when evidence of
                                         geological or grade continuity is sufficient to support grade estimation.
                                    o    The Underground Mineral Resource is filtered to remove isolated blocks that are unlikely to pay
                                         for development to be included in the mine plan.

                            -   AngloGold considers that the Measured Resource support mine planning with a 90% confidence
                                interval of ±15% on tonnage or grade on a quarterly production basis, with Indicated Resources have
                                the same confidence but applicable on an annual production basis.
                            -   The Competent Person considers this classification takes in to account all relevant factors such as data
                                reliability, confidence in the continuity of geology and grades, and the quality, quantity and distribution
                                of the data.
                            -   The classification reflects the view of the Competent Person reporting the estimate.

Audits or reviews           -   The Open Pit estimate methodology was audited by consultant QG in 2007, 2009 and 2011.
                            -   Consultants Golder Associates audited the 2015 estimate in 2015.
                            -   Consultants Optiro reviewed and endorsed the Mineral Resource Estimate in November 2017.
                            -   AngloGold also conducts internal peer reviews on the completion of estimate updates.

Relative                    - AngloGold has carried out some non-conditional simulation studies to confirm the relationship between
Accuracy/Confidence           drill spacing and 90% confidence interval assumptions and found the study results in agreement with
                              the drill spacing classification criteria described above.

   Mining factors or            -   Open Pit
   assumptions                       o The open cut material is scheduled to be mined using conventional methods using a large
                                         hydraulic shovel/excavator fleet matched with large rear dump trucks. The pits are designed
                                         based on 10.0m to 12.5m benches.
                                     o Overall Wall angles for the open pit designs range between ~36 degrees for the footwall and 59
                                         degrees for the hangingwall. Conventional drill and blast techniques are used to break the rock.
                                     o Within the open pit resource model ore loss and dilution is accounted for in the selectivity of the
                                         SMU sizes volume, as such no further factors applied.

                                -   Underground
                                     o The underground is designed using conventional longitudinal and transverse stoping method.
                                         The stopes are designed with a footwall angle of 40 degrees.
                                     o Planned mining dilution for the underground operation has been designed into the mining
                                         shapes, with a further 10% unplanned dilution factor applied.
                                     o New infrastructure appropriate for an underground mine of the size and life of the Underground
                                         Ore Reserve has been planned and costed.
                                     o Mining recovery of development ore is assumed to be 100% and production ore is assumed to
                                         be 95%.

                                - Inferred Mineral Resources are excluded from both the Open Pit and the Underground Ore Reserve
                                  estimates.

   Metallurgical factors or     - The metallurgical process for Tropicana ores is established and is a process flow of crushing (grinding
   assumptions                    rolls), grinding, and the recovery of gold through carbon-in-leach and electrowinning to produce gold
                                  bars.
                                - Gold recovery factors are based on extensive metallurgical testing and range from 92.5% recovery in
                                  mineralised transported material down to 89.9% recovery in fresh rock.
                                - No deleterious elements are present in the ore.
                                - In the project Feasibility Study Pilot scale test work was carried out on large diameter (PQ) core
                                  collected in a spatially representative manner from the deposit. To date metallurgical recoveries have
                                  been consistent with the forecasts from these studies.
                                - As a gold mine, the gold doré bars produced are not subject to any specification requirements.

   Environmental                -  Tropicana Gold mine operates under an environmental management plan that meets or exceeds all
                                   statutory and legislative requirements.
                                - Rock waste is disposed in waste dumps which are progressively rehabilitated as mining progresses
                                   with any potentially acid generating waste encapsulated in non-acid generating material.
                                 - A tailing storage facility is used to contain and capture process residues.
                                 - The mine produces rehabilitation plans for ongoing rehabilitation and mine closure plans, and the
                                   costs are included in the financial model.

   Infrastructure               - All processing and support infrastructure is in place as part of the established open pit mine.
                                - Underground specific infrastructure is planned to be installed and costed.
                                - No other significant infrastructure is anticipated and sustaining capital cost for infrastructure are
                                  included in the financial model.

   Costs                        - The capital cost of infrastructure have been provided by suppliers and engineering consultants.
                                - Budget level mining operating costs are provided by the mining contractor.
                                - Processing, maintenance and general administration costs have been obtained by the Tropicana
                                  budget.
                                - As discussed there are no deleterious elements and as such related costs are not relevant.
                                - The source of $AU to $US exchange rates is AngloGold/IGO corporate guidance.

Section 4: Estimation and Reporting of Ore Reserves
Criteria                    Commentary
                              - Transportation charges for gold doré bars is relatively minor and are charged on a contract basis with
                                the refinery.
                              - Treatment and refining charges are included in the refining contract and there are no specification ore
                                penalties associated with treatment and refining.
                              - WA State royalties are levied at 2.5% of the value of gold produced.

   Revenue factors            - The assumption for gold prices for the Underground Ore Reserve is based on corporate guidance and
                                assessment of historical prices
                              - The $AU to $US exchange rate is also based on corporate guidance and assessment of historical
                                exchange rates.

   Market assessment          - The primary product being produced is gold within the same parameters and methods as current
                                operations.
                              - The market is the same as current operations.

   Economic                   - The inputs into the economic analysis for the Underground Ore Reserve update have already been
                                 described above under previous subsections.
                              - The economic evaluation has been carried out on a real basis (adjusted for inflation) with rates
                                 provided by AngloGold corporate.
                              - The confidence in majority of the economic inputs is high as Tropicana is an operating mine and as
                                 such, costs (operating and capital) are well understood.
                              - The confidence in metal prices and exchange rates is consistent with routine industry practices with
                                 the data derived from reputable forecasters.
                               - The discount rate used for NPV calculations is derived from the weighted average cost of capital in
                                 Australia.

   Social                     - Tropicana Gold Mine has all necessary agreements in place with key stakeholders and matters
                                leading to social licence to operate.

   Other                      - There are no material naturally occurring risks associated with the Tropicana operation.
                              - There are no material legal agreements or marketing arrangements not already discussed in prior sub
                                sections.
                              - There are no unresolved third-party matters hindering the extraction of the Underground Ore Reserve.
                              - Necessary government and statutory approvals are currently in application.

   Classification             - The Open Pit and Underground Ore Reserve has been classified into Proven and Probable Ore
                                Reserve as per the JORC classification based on the underlying MRE classification in the MRE model,
                                with Measured Mineral Resources converted to Proven Ore Reserves, and Indicated Mineral
                                Resources converted to Probable Ore Reserves.
                              - The classifications applied to the estimate are consistent with the opinion of the Competent Person(s)
                                reporting the both the Open Pit and Underground Ore Reserve.

   Audits or reviews          - The current Underground Ore Reserve estimate has been reviewed internally by AngloGold
                                personnel.

   Discussion of relative     - AngloGold has carried out simulation to quantify the confidence in the Underground Ore Reserve –
   accuracy/ confidence         refer to the commentary at the end of Section 3 above.
                              - The main driver of accuracy and confidence is the spacing of the pre-production drilling, which is
                                captured in the Mineral Resource JORC Code classifications underpinning the Underground Ore
                                Reserve estimates.
                              - Confidence in both the Open Pit and Underground Ore Reserve inputs is high given the mine is in
                                operation and costs, prices and recoveries are well understood.
                              - The Underground Ore Reserve estimates are considerate to have sufficient local accuracy to support
                                mine planning and production schedules with Proved Underground Ore Reserves considered a
                                reliable basis for quarterly production targeting and Probable Underground Ore Reserves reliable for
                                annual production targets.
                              - Confidence in the mine design and schedule are high as mining rates and modifying factors are based
                                on actual site performance. Mine designs are consistent with what has been effective previously.
                              - The mine to mill reconciliation data to date indicates the forecast precision of the estimates is good
                                with the Ore Reserve estimate being slightly conservative.

This Transaction supports the Company's broader strategic objective to maintain a focused
and efficient portfolio. In Colombia, AngloGold Ashanti will focus on its key projects in the
region, particularly Quebradona and Gramalote.

The sale of the exploration title package under Northern Colombia Holdings Limited represents
approximately 70% by area of the exploration titles outside of AngloGold Ashanti's three key
projects in Colombia. Upon closing of the Transaction, AngloGold Ashanti will receive a cash
payment of approximately US$4.6 million. Further payments will be made to AngloGold
Ashanti in the event of certain milestones being achieved by Royal Road Minerals including:
    -   US$5 million upon the declaration of an inferred mineral resource of not less than one
        million gold equivalent ounces on any specific area (""Specific Project"");
    -   US$5 million on completion of a feasibility study for any Specific Project;
    -   US$5 million on commencement of commercial production for any Specific Project;
        and
    -   US$20 million in four equal quarterly payments in the first year following the
        commencement of commercial production for any Specific Project.

In the event Royal Road Minerals declares an inferred mineral resource of not less than five
million gold equivalent ounces on a Specific Project, AngloGold Ashanti has a once-off option
to purchase a 75% interest in that Specific Project and certain of the receipts mentioned above
are then forfeited for that Specific Project.

Closing of the Transaction is subject to certain conditions precedent, including the completion
of a capital raise of at least US$3.5 million by Royal Road Minerals and the receipt of certain
regulatory approvals by Royal Road Minerals and AngloGold Ashanti.

(JOHANNESBURG – RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti Limited (AGA) is pleased to announce the maiden
Ore Reserve for the Quebradona Project. The Quebradona Project is a Joint Venture between AGA
(94.876% and manager) and B2Gold (5.124%). The AngloGold Ashanti board has approved the project
to proceed to a feasibility study (FS) phase.

The Quebradona project is situated in the Middle Cauca region of Colombia, in the Department of
Antioquia, 60km south-west of Medellin.

 Property          Quebradona is a project that completed a conceptual study (2016) and a
 description       prefeasibility study (PFS) (2019). It is a JV between AngloGold Ashanti (94.876%)
                   and B2Gold (5.124%). Five main targets have been identified, namely Nuevo
                   Chaquiro, Aurora, Tenedor, Isabela and La Sola. The most advanced of the targets,
                   Nuevo Chaquiro, a significant copper-gold porphyry-style mineralised system, is
                   one of five known porphyry centres on the property and has been the focus of
                   exploration activities since the beginning of 2011 with more than 75km of drilling.
                   Nuevo Chaquiro was the sole deposit considered in the PFS.
 History           Exploration was carried out from 2004 by AngloGold Ashanti and then from 2006 to
                   2009 by B2Gold. In 2010 AngloGold Ashanti took management control and focused
                   its exploration effort on Nuevo Chaquiro. In 2014 a maiden Mineral Resource was
                   published for Nuevo Chaquiro and a conceptual study was initiated. The PFS was
                   completed in January 2019. The FS is expected to be completed in 2020.
 Legal aspects     Quebradona comprises one tenement (5881). It is the result of integration of the five
 and tenure        original tenements (5869, 6318, 6359, 7579 and 5881). Integrated tenement 5881
                   was issued on the 9 December 2016 and totals 7,593ha.
 Mining method     The Quebradona Project is a Greenfields project. The PFS concluded that Sub-
                   Level-Caving (SLC) is the preferred mining method. The Nuevo Chaquiro deposit is
                   considered to be medium to large, steep dipping, competent rock mass with higher
                   grade material located at the top of the deposit which is approximately 200m below
                   surface. The grade profile reduces with depth, thus making exploitation of the
                   deposit amendable to SLC being a top down mining method. Drill and blast methods
                   will be used to fracture the orebody commencing at the top and sequentially moving
                   downwards with an inter-level spacing of 27.5m from 425m below surface to 975m
                   below surface.
Operational      The project is close to existing infrastructure such as the regional highway, power
infrastructure   and water. The planned underground infrastructure consists of an adit to access the
                 orebody and number of internal vertical ore passes that gravity feeds to the main
                 ore transfer level. The material will be transferred to the main internal crusher by
                 load and haul dump vehicles. Crushed material will then be transferred horizontally
                 to surface via a 6km conveyor, in a dedicated adit to a single Coarse Ore Stockpile.
Mineral          PFS level testwork confirmed that the ore can be treated by a typical porphyry
processing       copper flotation circuit producing a copper/gold concentrate. The concentrate is
                 clean and free of deleterious elements which would attract smelter penalties. The
                 processing circuit includes primary crushing underground, secondary crushing, high
                 pressure grinding rolls, ball milling, rougher-scavenger flotation for all elements (Cu,
                 Au, Ag), followed by regrinding the concentrate and cleaning, firstly in conventional
                 cells and then in columns. A further flotation stage removes pyrite to leave a non-
                 acid producing flotation tails and a pyrite concentrate that can be stored in a lined
                 and eventually sealed impoundment within the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF).
                 Molybdenum, at present, is not planned for recovery.
                 The Quebradona process plant will be designed to treat approximately 6.2Mtpa
                 underground ore to produce copper concentrate over a 23year mine life with
                 provision of space for a Molybdenum plant in the future.
Risks            Several risks have been identified which if properly managed can be mitigated.
                 Geological risk is considered low to moderate. About 89 % of the in-situ material
                 mined within the Life of Mine (LOM) mining plan is classified as Indicated Mineral
                 Resource including about 95 % mined within the defined payback period. Variability
                 in copper grade is low, with high continuity. Security risk is considered low. Nuevo
                 Chaquiro has a moderate seismic risk.

                 Other identified risks that will need to be mitigated include:
                 - Preventing schedule overruns both in the FS and in implementation
                 - Increasing geotechnical information levels
                 - Completing the final metallurgical test work
                 - Tailings
                           - Cost of earthworks
                           - Storage capacity in case of rain
                           - Seismic design criteria
                 - Financial:
                           - Labour costs understated
                 Environmental permits are expected to be forthcoming and will be progressed
                 during the FS phase. Community surveys have identified local opposition to the
                 project, though the project is listed by the national Government as a project of
                 national interest. AngloGold Ashanti Colombia (AGAC) will continue to work with
                 the community to address and mitigate concerns.
Project Summary
The project has several strengths both related to the deposit and the project itself:
Nuevo Chaquiro deposit:
      - A significant copper-gold porphyry.
      - One of the highest copper grade porphyrys among global producing and developing assets.
      - Favorable orebody geometry for caving with topographic advantages and good surface
          hydrology.
      - Expected to produce a ‘clean' copper concentrate with low level of impurities.
Quebradona Project:
      - Declared Project on National Interest (PINES)
      - Limited resettlement is envisioned
      - Low power cost. Project near the national power grid (distant to 20-25 km)
      - Available water and proximity to infrastructure links with Colombia's largest port on the Pacific
          coast.

The project will produce a total of 2.9Blb of copper, 1.4Moz of gold and 21.6Moz of silver over mine life at
a rate of between 110Mlbs and 160Mlbs of copper per annum. The gold production will drop from around
an average of 90Koz in year 8 to a low of 38Koz in year 20. The project has a very low All in Sustaining
Cost (AISC) of $0.88/lb (real terms) over the LOM and has a moderate All in Cost (AIC) of $1.23/lb (real
terms).

The Quebradona project will yield a real, after-tax IRR of 17%, with an NPV (9.45) of $536m (real terms).
Payback is achieved after 8 years after project implementation. The project capital will amount to $992m
(real value).

""The project is technically robust and the metallurgy is particularly impressive with the high quality
concentrate it produces."" Ludwig Eybers, AngloGold Ashanti's Chief Operating Officer International said.
""However, what really makes the project stand out from the pack is the low AISC which comes in at
$0.88/lb.""

Mineral Resource
The host rock geology of Nuevo Chaquiro consists of a volcanoclastic sequence of Miocene age (ash, tuffs,
agglomerates and andesites) intruded by small dykes of diorite and quartz diorite, also of Miocene age.
The intrusions are by various pulses of diorites with the primary intrusive being a fine to medium grained
quartz diorite. Most of the intrusives do not outcrop. These intrusives are categorised into pre-mineral,
early, intra-mineral and late, according to cross cutting relations, locality and copper-gold values. The
developed alteration follows a well zoned porphyry type alteration system ranging from a high temperature,
potassium silicate central zone (biotite, magnetite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite), which trends into an
overlying sericitic alteration zone (muscovite, chlorite, quartz, pyrite,+-tourmaline) surrounded by more
distal propylitic alteration (chlorite, epidote, illite, carbonate). There is also an inner core of calcic-potassic
alteration featuring biotite, actinolite, epidote, and anhydrite with lesser copper, gold and molybdenum
values.

The mineralised zone is characterised by fine stock works, disseminations and veinlets of quartz,
magnetite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite.

Traces of bornite and cubanite have been locally observed but in amounts not exceeding 0.1% volume.
Other sulphides include pyrite and amounts of pyrrhotite in specific area. Gold and silver correlate well with
copper and many but, by no means, all gold grains occur on the margins of sulphide grains within the
chalcopyrite. This was confirmed in the metallurgical test programme that finished in 2016.
The Mineral Resource, as at 31 December 2018, is tabulated in Table 1 and Table 2 (attributable to AGA).

 Notes:
 - Copper, gold, silver and molybdenum grades were estimated using ordinary kriging into a 40m x 40m x 20m block model. Grades
     were estimated within grade-based 3D wireframe boundaries for copper and gold grades with separate domains for molybdenum.
 - Drillhole data was composited to 6m down-hole lengths prior to estimation and extreme values were capped. Estimation was into
     homogeneous geological domains using ordinary kriging. Classification was guided by conditional simulation plus kriging variance

1.2   Location              Description of location and map (country, province, and closest town/city, coordinate systems and ranges, etc.).
                            Nuevo Chaquiro, which lies in the middle Cauca River region of Colombia, is an emerging, large, copper-gold porphyry-style Greenfield discovery made by AGA in the
                     (i)
                            Quebradona Mineral District of Antioquia, Colombia in 2006. The project is in a joint-venture arrangement between AGA (94.876 % current interest) and B2 Gold
                            (5.124 % current interest and diluting), as of December 2018.
                            Country Profile: describe information pertaining to the project host country that is pertinent to the project, including relevant applicable legislation, environmental and
                            social context etc. Assess, at a high level, relevant technical, environmental, social, economic, political and other key risks.
                            Colombian law determines that minerals of any kind and in any state that lie in the soil or subsoil are the property of the Colombian State. Such property is unalienable
                            and imprescriptible. The right to explore and exploit non-renewable natural resources is granted through the awarding of concession contracts that give rise to a
                            mining title.
                            Colombian regulations declare the mining industry to be of public and social interest and efficient development of this industry is necessary. Mining in Colombia is
                            regulated by law 685 of 2001 (mining development in the country is currently driven through the national development plan).
                            In Colombia, environmental legislation is focused on the protection of renewable natural resources and the interaction of man and the environment. The above
                     (ii)   mentioned is from a series of regulatory provisions requiring the application for a series of permits and authorizations for the exploitation of each one of the resources
                            before the competent environmental authority.
                            Environmental regulations in Colombia are generally comprised within the natural resource code, law 99 of 1993, whereby the ministry of environment was created
                            and actions the provisions that regulate the management of each of the resources.
                            A protected environmental area (DMI) is present in the vicinity of the project (in part of the mineral rights) but no infrastructure or mining designs area planned in that
                            area. A return of involved protected areas will be considered.
                           Provide a detailed topo-cadastral map. Confirm that applicable aerial surveys have been checked with ground controls and surveys, particularly in areas of rugged
                           terrain, dense vegetation or high altitude.

1.3   Adjacent             Discuss details of relevant adjacent properties. If adjacent or nearby properties have an important bearing on the report, then their location and common mineralized
      Properties           structures should be included on the maps. Reference all information used from other sources.
                   (i)     All the endowment areas analysed are inside the mineral rights. Exploration potential remains to be tested and could almost double the Mineral Resource. No
                           exploration is planned outside the mining rights. Exploration for new areas outside the main Nuevo Chaquiro deposit will only be considered closer to the start of
                           operations with the aim of replacing Ore Reserve.
1.4   History              State historical background to the project and adjacent areas concerned, including known results of previous exploration and mining activities (type, amount, quantity
                           and development work), previous ownership and changes thereto.
                           Modern exploration in the Cauca River region first started in the mid-1990s. This early work was focused on historic vein districts and alluvial workings. In 2004, AGA
                           did the first regional geochemical programs in the area targeting potential porphyry copper-gold mineralisation. This work identified Quebradona Creek as potentially
                           of interest. Follow-up work identified a 1300 x 1000 m area between Chaquiro and Higuerillos Creeks that contained strong sericitic alteration and a stockwork of Fe
                   (i)     oxide, and locally quartz veinlets. (This zone was later proved to overlie the Nuevo Chaquiro orebody.) In addition, other prospects in the Quebradona district such as
                           Aurora, La Sola, Tenedor and Isabela were identified. Preliminary field reviews suggested that these were either too small (or too deep in the case of Chaquiro) with
                           respect to open pit bulk tonnage copper-gold potential. In 2006, a joint venture with B2Gold was formed; the Quebradona district properties were included within this
                           joint venture.
                           Between 2006 and 2008, B2Gold drilled 13,319 m in the Quebradona district, of which 1,987 m (5 drill holes) were at Chaquiro. In 2009, B2Gold identified a potential
                           1 Moz Au-equiv. inventory at Aurora; this was considered too small to pursue further at that time.
                               In 2009, B2Gold decided not to continue with exploration in the district and the concessions reverted back to AGA. In 2010, AGA drilled the Chaquiro area (now
                               renamed Nuevo Chaquiro) for two types of targets: 1) a broad gold soil geochemical anomaly corresponding to an ISS (intermediate sulphidation state) D vein zone,
                               and 2) a deep porphyry target centred on an area of stockwork veining with a corresponding deep, high magnetic anomaly.
                               The deep drill holes encountered Cu-Au mineralisation associated with the intra-mineral igneous centre. A series of deep drill holes followed outlining a broad zone of
                               mineralisation assaying consistent 0.48-0.54% Cu and 0.18-0.31 g/t Au values. A large low-grade inventory was identified; however, there were concerns that the
                               grades encountered were insufficient to support an underground operation at the depths seen. Further geological understanding of the deposit coupled with detailed
                               geophysics led to discovery of the high-grade zone in Hole CHA-39 in August, 2013 (248 m averaging 1.06% Cu, 0.44 g/t Au) followed by CHA-48 (852 m @ 1.19%
                               Cu, 0.61 g/t Au) drilled at the end of 2013.
                               Present details of previous successes or failures with reasons why the project may now be considered potentially economic.
                       (ii)    The only constrain to find the deposit was the depth of mineralisation. Nuevo Chaquiro is a blind deposit and first drilling campaign was too shallow to find the
                               economic intercepts. After alteration analysis and interpretation deep drilling was proposed with success.

                               On November 19 2013 a request for integration of the five (5) tenements (5869, 6318, 6359, 7579 and 5881) was submitted. The two main objectives were: firstly,
                               facilitating environmental licensing, construction and operation under one license; secondly, consolidation of all free areas generated by brokers or spaces between
                               the tenements, to ensure the future development of the project. On 9th December 2016 the integration of the 5 tenements was successfully registered in the National

2.1   Geological               Describe the regional geology.
      Setting,                 The MQC is located in the Northern Andes of Colombia, a sector that has a complex tectonic history resulting from interactions between several tectonics plates. The
      Deposit,                 most important major tectonic feature in the project area is the Romeral Fault System, which at Quebradona changes its orientation and lateral movement (NNW strike
      Mineralisation           and right-lateral movement to the S) giving rise to assumptions this may have created the voids to accommodate the mineralisationt. The Romeral Fault System forms
                       (i)
                               the eastern boundary of the pull-apart basin which dominates the district. Another important structural feature is the Arma fault which trends NW and crosscuts the belt
                               as a N40W striking oblique normal, left-lateral fault.
                               This structural setting facilitated the rise of intrusive bodies through the volcanoclastic sequence of the Combia Formation. These intrusives generally don't reach the
                               surface and remain as blind deposits. Although erosive process acted over a long period, the Nuevo Chaquiro deposit remained buried.
                               Describe the project geology including deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.
                               Nuevo Chaquiro is a porphyry type deposit. The host rock composes a volcaniclastic sequence of the Combia Formation which is intruded by diorite dykes. The
                       (ii)    mineralisation at Nuevo Chaquiro has a distinct E-W orientation suggesting extension in this direction. Faulting in the greater Nuevo Chaquiro area has a general grid
                               like configuration with the main orebody cut by a series of sub-parallel ESE trending (100-115 degrees) faults and in places offset by later N10-15E faults. These
                               structures are vertical to steeply dipping to the North. Reviews of these faults indicates minimal offsets. Pre-mineralisation faults have not been observed.
                               Discuss the geological model or concepts being applied in the investigation and on the basis of which the exploration programme is planned. Describe the inferences
                               made from this model.
                               The initial geological interpretation was done on paper sections (11 main sections) and thereafter Leapfrog® software was used to create geological volumes. All dyke
                               generations were modelled (pre-mineral, early, intra mineral and late) as well as a saprolite surfacel. Four geologists participated in the interpretation and discussions.
                       (iii)
                               Copper, molybdenite and sulphur volumes, were generated in Datamine® software and validated against previous models and geological interpretation. It is important
                               to note that high grade copper (0.6 %) envelope is well constrained by the early quartz diorite intrusive. Lithology is useful and controls the mineralisation, high grade
                               copper is constrained in early quartz diorite intrusives, low grade copper is constrained into intra mineral intrusive. Host rock tuff is mineralised as well. The principal
                               factors controlling mineralisation at Quebradona are: Lithology with the presence of early quartz diorite intrusive, alteration, vein density and chalcopyrite content.
                               Discuss data density, distribution and reliability and whether the quality and quantity of information are sufficient to support statements, made or inferred, concerning
                               the Exploration Target or Mineralisation.
                               Drill hole spacing over the project is variable, being influenced by environmental and community considerations. Where possible multiple drill holes were drilled from

                               the same drill pad to minimize impact on the environment. Drilling at Quebradona varies from a 50 x 50 m grid in the central part and a 100x100m to 120 x 120m in
                               the adjacent low grade Inferred Mineral Resource areas. Due to the multi hole platforms, the drilling spacing in the first 300 meters is tighter than in the deeper
                               portions of the deposit.
                               Discuss the significant minerals present in the deposit, their frequency, size and other characteristics. Includes minor and gangue minerals where these will have an
                               effect on the processing steps. Indicate the variability of each important mineral within the deposit.
                               The ore minerals at Nuevo Chaquiro are principally chalcopyrite and molybdenite. Traces of bornite and cubanite have been observed never exceeding 0.1% by
                       (v)
                               volume. Other sulphides include pyrite and amounts of pyrrhotite in some intervals. Chalcopyrite is typically present as fine-grained disseminations and stringers, or
                               within quartz veinlets within potassic alteration (and to a lesser degree in calcic-potassic alteration) and rarely as metre thick massive sulphide zones within the cupola
                               zone. Molybdenite commonly appears as veinlets without other sulphides, as well as inclusions in early stage quartz-sulphide veinlets. Gold and silver correlate well
                            with copper and many, but by no means all, gold grains occurred on the margins of chalcopyrite. This was confirmed in the metallurgical test programme finished in
                            2016.

                             Describe the significant mineralised zones encountered on the property, including a summary of the surrounding rock types, relevant geological controls, and the

                            packages are Microsoft Excel and Access. Drilling data is captured in the field directly into laptop computers.

                            Identify and comment on the primary data elements (observation and measurements) used for the project and describe the management and verification of these data
                            or the database. This should describe the following relevant processes: acquisition (capture or transfer), validation, integration, control, storage, retrieval and backup
                            processes. It is assumed that data are stored digitally but hand-printed tables with well-organized data and information may also constitute a database.

                            Describe the survey methods, techniques and expected accuracies of data. Specify the grid system used.
                            The drill collar position is firstly designed in the office by the geologist, according to target desired, and then revised in consideration of the forest, creeks or any
                            constraints before going to the field. Once a drill hole is designed, a field visit involving all disciplines takes place in order to ensure there are no restrictions that could
                            affect platform construction and subsequent drilling procedures.
                            Initially the drill hole position is marked using normal hand-held GPS (Trimble, Magellan or similar) with about 1-2 m position accuracy.
                            Once the platform is constructed and the machine is ready to align, the geologist travels to the rig and supervises the setup of the azimuth angle in order to finalise the

                            constructed base where the machine will be finally placed.
                            When the drill rig is ready to drill, the geologist returns to supervise and give the final inclination using a Brunton type compass.
                            Once the drill hole is finished, the final collar position is surveyed (Easting, Northing and Elevation) using total station or RTK GPS (normally 5mm to 20 cm accuracy
                            for Topcon or Trimble units).
                            Downhole measurements every 50 m are normally being done with Reflex Ez-Track equipment. Some Gyro measurements at a 5 m spacing were done in the past in
                            order to compare with EZ-Track survey. No significant differences were found.
                            Initial drilling from CHA-01 to CHA-05 was surveyed every 50 m with a Pajari tool. Drill holes surveyed with Gyro technology were CHA-036 to CHA-039, CHA-043,
                            CHA-046 and CHA-069. All the remaining drill holes were surveyed with Reflex Ez-Track equipment. The geological model only includes holes up to and including
                            CHA-074, boreholes CHA-074 to 087 were for geotechnical, metallurgical and hydrogeological purposes.

                            and classifications applied.
                            Drill hole spacing over the project is variable, being influenced by environmental and community considerations. Where possible multiple drill holes are conducted

                            from the same drill pad to minimise impact on the environment. Drilling at Quebradona varies from 50 x 50 m grid in the central part and 100x100 to 120 x 120 in the
                            adjacent low grade Inferred Mineral Resource areas. Due to the situation to have some multi-hole platforms the drilling space in the first 300 meters is tighter than in

                            Once the necessary geological information is obtained, the core is prepared for cutting. During this process, core is halved by making a longitudinal cut with a

                            diamond saw, cutting on the left side of the bottom line in oriented holes. Finally, the core is returned into the tray keeping its original position. The left side of the core
                            is used for geochemical sampling, in order to preserve the bottom line (lower half) for further studies.
                            The rock sample is then broken into 5cm lengths and placed into a previously marked plastic bag with a sampling ID card inside. To avoid contamination or material

                            Intercepts are reported as down-hole depths and the length of core is compared to the theoretical length. Average dip of the drill holes is 66 degrees. Mineralisation is

                            Once the drill core processing is completed, boxes containing the remaining half core are stored in the warehouse located in the project facilities. The boxes are
                            stored according to a defined procedure. This process takes into account drill core diameter, core stage (complete or cut) and the storage size. The project has a main
                    (v)     warehouse with a capacity of 80,000 meters of core. The sample preparation for analysis in the laboratory generates rejects (fine and coarse). These are stored for a
                            period of 40 days in the laboratory warehouse. At the end of this period they are transferred to a warehouse located in the municipality of Girardota (Antioquia) close
                            to Medellin City. A logistics assistant receives and stores them in boxes or bags with their respective number identification.

                             sericitic alteration zone. Triple tube drill technology was used in the sericitic alteration zone (which is a less competent alteration zone). This impacted overall drill
                             rates as both lower pressure and rotation speed were used to limit any re-drilling and improve delivery quality /recovery of the drill core. Another measure was the
                             implementation of stricter controls regarding drilling practices, trying to reduce deviations in the orientation of the holes, using adapter and locking couplings in the
                             HTW line - adapters generate more stability in-line and decrease hole deviation.

                     (iii)   *Drying: samples are placed on stainless steel drying pans and placed into a dryer at 110 C, heated with a digitally controlled gas-fired burner.
                             *Crushing: Samples are crushed to more than 70 % < 2 mm. using a Terminator crusher.
                             *Splitting: One kilogram is split using a riffle splitter. The lab is also requested to pulverize a second split to be used as coarse reject duplicate.
                             *Pulverizing: The split is pulverized to more than 85% passing 75 micron using a LM2mill. A sub-sample of approximately 250 grams weight is split and shipped to the
                             analytical laboratory, ALS in Lima Peru, for analysis.

       Minera Quebradona Colombia (MQC) ore deposit will have two independent
       mine access portals located in the Cauca valley at the surface processing facility
       approximately 6 km away from the ore body. Twin tunnels will be developed in
       parallel for the first 2 km, then the twin tunnels will be developed upwards the
       SLC undercut level located 425 meters below surface. One of the twin tunnels is
       extended for the Material handling system located at the base of the SLC
       approximately 950 to 1000 meters below surface.

       The selected mining method for MQC is the common caving method of sub-
       level-caving and was chosen to maximise Mineral Resource extraction. This is a
       mass mining method that is development intensive and more susceptible to
       dilution. Drill and blast activities are used to fracture the orebody under
       controlled conditions. Commencing at the top and sequentially moving

       Predefined ore tonnage is extracted from each drawpoint (>37 thousand over the
       life of mine or LOM) on each the production levels. Migrating rock is allowed to
       fill the voids within the drawpoint, thus allowing caving to propagate up towards
       the surface. The production activities for a 6.2 Mtpa operation promote
       continuous caving by allowing the ore to breakup, resulting in surface
       subsidence and draw down directly above the mining area.
       The amount of extracted ore tonnes per drawpoint were determined by PGCA.

        The following Mineral Resource Classifications; waste (0), Inferred (3) and
        Indicated (2). The use of these fields separately allowed the in-situ percentage of
        each Mineral Resource classification to be estimated for each 5 m x 5 m x 5 cell

       For the Ore Reserves, the Nov 2018 mnc03_kvcu.dm Resource Model was
       converted to the mine planning model Nov 2018 - mp03_kv15 with a Net Smelter
       Return (NSR) value field ($/t) hard coded into the block model.

       The NSR determines the in-situ worth of each block model cell based on the
       costs incurred with delivering the final product to the market place. The NSR
       value excludes all mining costs associated with extracting the ore and delivery to
       the processing plant.

       All NSR values are estimated with +25 to -15% level of confidence.

       An initial cut-off grade was calculated based on the PFS A financial modelling
       results and a diluted NSR value of US$50/t,
                  Indicative only, CAPEX estimate of $715M,

                  Indicative only, mineable inventory estimates of 90 Mt.

       Production modelling evaluated a diluted US$55/t cut-off grade using PGCA to
       determine the minable footprint, tonnes, grade, and the production throughput
       rate. Based on estimated tonnage and production rate the cut-off was reduced to
       NSR of US$45/t tonnage >90Mt and to ensure a >6Mtpa rates was achievable.

       All material within the production boundary is classified as ore with a minimum
       drawrate of 50% assigned for sub economical production rings.

       Development was assigned a nominal US$25/t cut-off to cover processing costs,
       general and administrative costs.
        Description and justification of mining method(s) to be used.
        The grade distribution within the orebody contains high grade in the upper
        domain and reduces with depth. The SLC mining method makes for a sensible
        and robust option for initial mining phase with the following advantages,
        •   Less upfront capital debt compared to other caving methods,
        •   Ability to access high grade ore located at the top of the ore body during the
            early stages of production schedule,
(v)     •   Early establishment of the surface subsidence (Undercut consider shallow
            compared to block caving methods), Footprint capable of a 6.2Mtpa
            production rate and above,
        •   Provides flexibility through drill and blast techniques to define the ore
            boundary on each production level,
        •   Flexibility to change the mining method to other caving methods if and when
            required.

        The SLC caveability behaviour will vary between the rock types and will be
        influenced by major structures and faults zones. The Assessment of the rock
        mass quality concluded that for the Sub-level caving development drives for the
        upper production levels, rock mass show ""Fair"" to ""Good"" values along southern
        side. In terms of rock mass rating (RMR, Laubscher, 1990), the SLC
        development drives for the top 5 levels show ""Fair"" to ""Good"" values.

        Geotechnical assessment completed by AGA, and reviewed externally by
        Stratavison Pty Ltd and later a peer review in Jan 2019. The review concluded
        that the rock mass will cave. A Hydraulic radius of 39 (155 m x 155 m) is
        required to create the unstable span to initiate the caving process. Given the
        planned dimensions of the undercut of 74,000m2 it is expected that caving will
(vii)
        be initiated 6 months from the start of production.
        The size of each production level footprint is more than sufficient to maintain a
        HR 39 until cave connectivity is established to surface. The final depth of
        subsidence is estimated at around 365 meters below surface.

        The mine design of the underground is clipped to $45/t footprint and based on
        the Colombia Decree 1886 of 2015 statutory requirements, Underground Mining
        Safety Code (UMSC).

        The estimated airflow for steady state production is 1088m3/s. Independent
        ventilation modelling concluded that the total the dilution factor for diesel
        particulate matter (DPM) is 0.09m3/s per kW of diesel engine power is more than
        sufficient to cover the other limits such as thermal and Nitrogen dioxide.

         The technical study has estimated peak labour is around 300 employees for the
         underground project ramp-up period. The workforce number will be optimized
         during 2019 Feasibility Study.

         Each level has been designed with fresh air, return air, refuge chambers and the
         level access entry have 2 means of egress to the twin portals at the processing

         The hydrological and hydrogeological studies completed characterised the on-
         mountain area (deposit) as semi-confined hard-rock aquitard of low groundwater
         storage hosted in the low permeability tuff (volcano sedimentary rock of
         Colombia Formation). The groundwater inflow to the underground mine is
         expected to be low with the occurrence and circulation of underground water is
         restricted in most of the fresh rock due to the relatively small degree of
         fracturing.

         The storm water management strategy is to minimize water inflow to the
         subsidence area with the design of sumps and pumping systems that will cater
         from storm events of one 24 hour one in 100 year rain fall event.

       Discuss the nature, amount and representativeness of metallurgical test work
       undertaken and the recovery factors used. A detailed flow sheet / diagram and a
       mass balance should exist, especially for multi-product operations from which
       the saleable materials are priced for different chemical and physical
       characteristics.
       The metallurgical process is well tested and is in essence a typical porphyry
(iv)   copper flowsheet. Although modern equipment has been selected, all selected
       equipment has been previously used industrially and is not novel. The scale of
       the tailings filter plant is at the upper end of industrial experience with filtered
       tails, but the equipment itself is within the range of currently built equipment and
       the operation of multiple units presents no elevated risk. Conservative
       assumptions have been made in regard to equipment availability and the
       provision of stand-by filtration equipment. .

       State what assumptions or allowances have been made for deleterious elements
       and the existence of any bulk-sample or pilot-scale test work and the degree to
       which such samples are representative of the ore body as a whole.
       The Nuevo Chaquiro ore produces a concentrate that is exceptionally low in
       deleterious elements. Notable is the low arsenic content which will mean that
(v)
       the concentrate is in demand for blending. Bulk flotation tests have been carried
       out to generate samples for downstream testing and pilot scale testing will be
       done prior to commencing a Feasibility Study. Care has been taken to ensure
       that the samples tested are representative of the orebody as a whole, including
       work on the individual ore components.

       State whether the metallurgical process is well-tested technology or novel in
       nature.
        As noted 5.3 (iii) above, metallurgical testwork has encompassed standard
       bench scale techniques including comminution, flotation and filtration. Testwork
       has included work to estimate the optimum primary grind size, flotation residence
       time, flotation pulp density, optimum regrind size, cleaning circuit design,
       thickener sizing and filter sizing. Work has also been done to determine whether
       site water has any effect on flotation, including a process to simulate the
       generation and use of process water. Testing has used three composites made
(vi)
       up to represent early, middle and late mine life and has also tested 10 samples
       of individual tuff ore and 10 if dyke as well as samples of dilution material and a
       minor ore type that represents a substantial proportion of the ore in the middle
       years. Although it is not intended to include a copper-Mo separation stage in the
       initial process plant construction, Mo sales are expected to be potentially
       profitable after about five years, when Mo head grades rise, and preliminary
       work has been done to demonstrate Mo recovery and the potential for
       separation. The amount of testwork carried out is quite comprehensive and is
       considered adequate to support plant design and a conclusion that the ore can
                                                                                                                be profitably treated. Engineering process documentation has been prepared,
                                                                                                                including comprehensive flow sheets, mass balances, process design criteria,

        The implementation of the project will require the use of a port capable of
        managing the inbound equipment and construction supplies as well as outbound
        product destined for the market. Transportation routes have been established to
        the region of the project and the mine access roads will be established in order
        to safely connect the project to the Colombian road infrastructure. The main road
        routes to the Quebradona site from the identified ports at Buenaventura have
        been assessed according to transportation weights and size constraints, there is
(iii)   no significant issues to moving general cargo, or mine site throughput, between

                  according AGA BP2019 version August 2018
             •    Royalties: for copper 5% payable on the value of the production at the
                  mine gate (80% of the International Price LME) [As per current mining
                  tax legislation].
             •    for Gold and silver 4% payable on the value of the production at the
                  mine gate (80% of the International Price LME) [As per current mining
                  tax legislation].
             •    Capex and Operating Cost Estimate: The following points are
                  applicable to all operating costs developed for the project unless stated
                  otherwise:
             •    Base date for the project is mid-year 2018 and cashflow escalated to
                  2019.
(iii)        •    Costs are presented in US dollars undiscounted at input terms.
             •    Base Exchange rate is of $COL 3,025 to US$ 1 for 2018, with
                  fluctuation of the exchange in future years being captured by the
                  financial model (as per BP2019 version August 2018).
             •    Fuel cost corresponds to prices at the site and has been set at 0.66
                  US$/L.
             •    The cost of electrical power was taken from the information supplied by
                  IEB, in the file Precio Final kWh IEB 27-07-17, at $3025 COP:USD for
                  2018. The price for 2018 has been used and is US$0.0604/kWh.
             •    The labour cost estimate for direct operating positions includes
                  provision to cover personnel absences for holidays, vacation, training
                  and sick leave. There is no similar coverage for support, professional
                  and supervisory positions as coverage would be provided by other
                  departmental employees with similar skills.
             •    The Capital Cost Estimate (CAPEX) for the project components have
                  been developed by different consultants. Ausenco has been nominated
                  as the Capex Integrator and third-party reviewer and its scope was to
                  compile the Capex into a single database, to review the depth and
                  correctness of the overall project capital cost estimate, to perform a risk
                  range analysis of the WBS packages and to calculate the contingency
                  stochastically.
           •      The Operating Costs (OPEX) for the project were developed by the
                  technical areas involved in the preparation of the PFS report, with
                  support from specialists within AngloGold, specialized consultants,
                  engineering companies and valuable service providers.
       Overarching services were provided to guarantee the full operational status of
       the project in support for the technical areas. Careful consideration was given to
       reviewing battery limits between technical areas as well as qualifications,
       inclusions and exclusions from the technical reports. The overarching services
       account for personnel services, sales costs, specialized consultants, fees and
       taxes and others, as will be further detailed.
       Summary description, source and confidence of method used to estimate the
       commodity price/value profiles used for cut-off grade calculation, economic

       Present the details of the point of reference for the tonnages and grades
       reported as Mineral Reserves (e.g. material delivered to the processing facility or
       saleable product(s)). It is important that, in any situation where the reference
(v)    point is different, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is
       fully informed as to what is being reported.
       The reference point for the Ore Reserve is the point where the run of mine
       material is delivered to the processing plan.
       Justify assumptions made concerning production cost including transportation,
       treatment, penalties, exchange rates, marketing and other costs. Provide details
       of allowances that are made for the content of deleterious elements and the cost
(vi)   of penalties.
       Mine:
       The operating cost for underground mining considers any development in ore
       directly associated with the metal production once ore is taken from the first
undercut levels. From this point of view, mine operating costs include Stoping
costs of the SLC, operating development, and haulage.
The PFS assumption for development in ore and production operations is 100%
owner operating scenario.
Mine operating costs were derived based on first principles estimation in a
holistic cost model. The cost model connects production data to costs and its
structure is based on each mining production task:
 Direct: Drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, auxiliary services, underground mine
dewatering.
 Indirect: mine G&A.
Each direct task was evaluated under the cost structure of labor, fuel, power, drill
tools, explosives, tires, contractors and maintenance. Indirect tasks capture
management, supervision, minor supplies such as safety wear, light mobile
equipment, internal services; and external services.

Plant:
The processing plant operating cost includes all the expenditures associated
with each section of the plant and associated facilities such as Ore handling
(underground crushing and conveying), all process plant costs, concentrate load-
out, TSF management costs, ARD treatment and on-site infrastructure utilities
and facilities. It excludes all other mine costs and concentrate transport to port
etc.

Infrastructure:
The operating costs have been derived from raising the TSF dam, Filter plant,
and associated infrastructure, for HV Power Connection costs and for overall
buildings maintenance. The other infrastructure assets such as camps and
roads, that will be built during implementation have their operating and
maintenance costs.

For the TSF, operating costs include on-going construction of Dry Stack
components including stacking arrangement (toe buttresses), subdrains,
seepage collection system, and surface water management. The strategy has
been defined to outsource the execution of these tasks as they are not
considered core business

Logistics:
The operating cost regarding to Transportation, treatment, penalties and
marketing has been derived from a study analysis and advisory made by
Bluequest Resources AG (BQR) to Minera Quebradona.
The scope includes all the cost related to sea Freight, sampling & Analysis,
Treatment Charge(TC), Refining Charge (RC)

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Grows Margins and Cash Flow, Charts Path Forward

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti achieved guidance for the
sixth consecutive year, with improved margins driving significant growth in free cash flow
generation. The Company declared a dividend of ZAR 95 cents per share (approximately 7
US cents per share).

The Company generated free cash flow of $67 million in the 12 months to 31 December 2018
compared with only $1 million generated in 2017. Before one-time financing expenses and the
costs to complete the successful restructuring of the South African business in 2018, the
Company generated $140 million of free cash flow.

""This is a strong operating performance that shows our commitment to meeting our guidance
targets and improving our margins,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""We have
a clear set of return and leverage targets that will guide our investments, as we work to unlock
value for our shareholders.""

CEO Kelvin Dushnisky has started to streamline the portfolio by initiating processes to sell the
Company's interests in its Cerro Vanguardia and Sadiola assets, as he aims to focus
investments on those operations with longer lives and the ability to deliver higher returns. He
has set the hurdle for returns on new investments at 15% (calculated at a gold price of
$1,200/oz) and cut the Company's leverage target to a ratio of 1.0 times Net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA through the cycle, down from 1.5 times previously.

The redevelopment of the Obuasi mine, which was started in 2018, is on track to produce its
first gold at the end of this year and to build-up to its full production rate during 2020. That
follows on the ramp-up of production from the underground mine at Kibali, and commissioning
of a new plant, able to process hard rock, at its Siguiri mine in Guinea.
Production for the year ended 31 December 2018 came in toward the top end of guidance at
3.4Moz. Production from retained operations in 2018 (excluding Moab Khotsong, Kopanang
and TauTona), was 3.349Moz at a total cash cost of $765/oz, compared with 3.279Moz at
$738/oz in 2017.

All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) for these retained operations were $968/oz for the year ended
31 December 2018, compared with $1,017/oz during the same period in 2017. Kibali in the
DRC, Iduapriem in Ghana, Geita in Tanzania, Sunrise Dam in Australia and Mponeng in South
Africa were stand out performers.
Headline earnings for the year ended 31 December 2018 were $220 million, or 53 US cents
per share, compared with $27 million, or 6 US cents per share in 2017. Adjusted earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) were $1.48 billion in
2018, similar to 2017 levels despite the sale and closure of assets in South Africa. The ratio
of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2018 was 1.12 times compared with
1.35 times at the end of December 2017.

Net debt decreased by 17% to $1.659 billion at 31 December 2018, from $2.001 billion at the
31 December 2017. Financial flexibility was further improved in October 2018, when a new
five-year $1.4 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility was agreed with our banking
syndicate replacing our existing $1 billion US Dollar and $500 million Australian Dollar
facilities. Strong liquidity is provided both by this new revolving credit facility, which was fully
undrawn at the end of 2018, and $329 million in cash.


AngloGold Ashanti places a premium on a clear and uncompromising method of allocating
capital, which means that certain investments may not be made if the returns they offer rank
below other available opportunities within the portfolio. Consistent with this philosophy, the
Company has initiated sales processes for Sadiola in Mali as well as Cerro Vanguardia
(CVSA) in Argentina. Through these processes, AngloGold Ashanti aims to achieve both fair
value for these assets, and to place them with buyers with the operational track record and
financial capacity to take them forward.
On 14 February 2019, Sadiola Exploration Limited (SADEX), the subsidiary jointly held by
AngloGold Ashanti and IAMGOLD Corporation, entered into a share purchase agreement with
the Government of Mali, whereby SADEX agreed to sell to the Government of Mali its 80%
participation in Société d'Exploitation des Mines d'Or de Yatela (Yatela), for a consideration
of USD 1 (one US dollar). The transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of a number of
conditions precedent.


SAFETY

Regrettably, we lost three of our colleagues during the first half of the year. In Brazil there was
one fatality following an electricity-related incident in January. In South Africa at Moab
Khotsong a tramming incident caused one fatality in February and at Mponeng a mechanical
loader operator was fatally injured in a seismic fall of ground in April.

The Company will use lessons learned from these tragic incidents to strengthen safety
practices for a sustainable improvement in this important area. Significant progress has been
made, with record All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace
safety, decreased by 36% to 4.81 injuries per million hours worked for 2018, compared to 7.49
injuries per million hours worked for the previous year.


SECOND HALF
Production from retained operations for the second half of 2018 (excluding Moab Khotsong,
Kopanang and TauTona) was 1.722Moz at a total cash cost of $726/oz, compared to
1.761Moz at $733/oz for the last six months of 2017. AISC for these retained operations were
$936/oz for the last six months of 2018, compared to $1,002/oz for the same period in 2017.

Free cash flow of $118 million was generated in the second half of 2018, compared to $162
million for the same period in 2017. The Company generated $204 million of free cash flow,
before growth capital during the last six months of 2018, compared to $231 million during the
second half of 2017.

OUTLOOK**
Production guidance for 2019 year is estimated to be between 3,250Moz - 3,450Moz (reflects
the impact of the reduced South African operations and a step-down in production at CVSA).
Total cash costs are estimated to be between $730/oz and $780/oz and AISC between
$935/oz and $995/oz at average exchange rates against the US dollar of 14.00 (Rand), 3.65
(Brazil Real), 0.75 (Aus$) and 40.00(Argentina Peso), and oil at $74/bl average for the year,
based on market expectations. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be $910 million to $990
million reflecting the ramp up of the Obuasi redevelopment expenditure.

Financial and Operating Report

CORPORATE AND STRATEGIC REVIEW
AngloGold Ashanti recorded another solid performance in 2018, making steady progress on strategic efforts to improve the quality of its portfolio,
strengthen its balance sheet and advance value-enhancing options in its project pipeline. Cash flow and earnings showed steady growth over
2018, and for the sixth consecutive year, production, capital and all cost guidance metrics were met or improved upon.

Cash flow from the business continues to improve. Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 was little changed at $1,480m, versus $1,483m in 2017, as a
result of a flat gold price and despite a 355,000oz drop in production following the sale and closure of mines in South Africa. All-in sustaining
costs (AISC) of $976/oz in 2018, compared to $1,054/oz in 2017, were lower than the guidance range, continuing the shift towards the bottom
end of the industry cost curve. Safety saw another improvement, with the all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) falling 36% to a record 4.81 per million
hours worked in 2018, from a rate of 7.49 per million hours worked in 2017.

Restructuring of the South African asset base was completed after a collaborative effort with key stakeholders. Redevelopment of the Obuasi
Gold Mine, a transformational project for AngloGold Ashanti and Ghana, also commenced. In addition, the balance sheet was strengthened
after debt was further reduced and some revolving credit facilities were refinanced. Furthermore, progress was made on self-funded brownfields
projects aimed at sustainably improving mine lives and margins.

Exploration, which remains a cornerstone of the business, delivered another strong result, as the maiden reserve for the Quebradona project
in Colombia was registered. The efforts of the exploration programme resulted in added gold ore reserves of 4.3Moz and mineral resource of
4.5Moz for the year ended 31 December 2018.

Strategic Priorities
Maintaining a reliable track record of predictable, rational behaviour as custodians of shareholder capital is central to our approach. Capital
allocation will remain disciplined and focused on improving value creation without placing financial or operating risk on the business.

This model does not prioritise scale for its own sake, but rather focuses on patient and disciplined work to widen margins, lift returns, increase
cash flow and improve direct returns to shareholders over time. Given AngloGold Ashanti's current valuation and the suite of opportunities
available within its existing portfolio and project pipeline, AngloGold Ashanti favours organic opportunities to create value, over those available
through acquisition.

Our equity remains an important asset that should be protected while efforts are undertaken to close the considerable valuation gap that exists
with global industry peers. Within this framework, we will target returns of at least 15% through the cycle, using conservative discount rates
that account for specific jurisdictional and operating risks.

Preserving the integrity of the balance sheet is fundamental to the long-term health of the business and enforces disciplined decision-making
in allocating capital. This means that the Company will rank and prioritise its investments, assessing them not only on their returns but also on
their affordability with respect to maintaining leverage ratios at or around targeted levels as well as improving returns to its shareholders.
Importantly, the Company will weigh these competing priorities and consider the full suite of financing opportunities available when determining
whether to proceed with an investment, notably partnerships, asset sales and project financing.

For a gold-producing company such as AngloGold Ashanti, which produces a single, cyclical commodity in an increasingly complex global
operating environment, it is our view that over time, lower levels of debt will translate into lower risk and added strategic flexibility. Taking this
into account, the Company is now targeting a lower Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.0 times through the cycle, down from the previous
target of 1.5 times. We believe this new target is achievable, even as we invest inward, pay dividends to shareholders subject to approval by
the board of directors (Board) and service debt obligations.

Our dividend policy remains to pay out 10% of free cash flow, before growth capital, subject to the approval of the Board. Although currently
modest, the dividend policy represents a key element of our capital allocation policy, namely a dividend as a 'royalty' owed to shareholders
from the surplus cash generated by the business, before any investment in growth is pursued.

AngloGold Ashanti places a premium on a clear and uncompromising method of allocating capital. This means that certain investments may
not be made if the returns they offer rank below other available opportunities within the portfolio. For example, given fiscal uncertainty related
to the Sadiola sulphide project, the Company and IAMGOLD Corporation initiated a process last year to identify third parties that may be interested in
acquiring their collective interest in Sadiola. In addition, a process to divest the Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina (CVSA) is now also
underway. As with Mali, Argentina has been an excellent jurisdiction for the Company for almost two decades, but with competing demands
for limited capital, another owner may be better placed to invest in extending the life of these assets. Through these processes we aim to
achieve both fair value for these assets, and to place them in the hands of buyers with the operational track record and financial capacity to
take them forward. If we cannot fulfil these objectives, we will retain these assets.

In South Africa, the difficult but necessary work of restructuring the loss-making portfolio into a smaller business was completed, recently
returning these assets to generating free cash flow. To protect the cash flows of the South African region from Rand gold price risk for 2019,
a short-term Rand gold hedge was entered into on a zero cost collar basis at a floor of R545,000/kg and an average cap of R725,500/kg for
300koz of our South African gold production.

AngloGold Ashanti has one of the industry's top exploration teams. Over the past 15 years, the Company discovered 49Moz of Mineral Resource
from its portfolio outside of South Africa, averaging roughly 3.3Moz of gold a year at an average discovery cost of $34/oz from its brownfields
exploration and $13/oz from its generative greenfields programme. The Company will continue investing in exploration to ensure that its pipeline
of options remains well stocked and that the Company can sustain itself without being forced into expensive and complex mergers and acquisition
activity. This approach is well-supported by a strong track record.

As the business becomes even leaner and more efficient, greater management focus will be applied to areas of growth and improvement. Key
areas of focus for 2019 remain bringing Obuasi into production, executing on a series of affordable, high return brownfields improvements and
progressing two key projects in Colombia up the value curve. Operational Excellence initiatives remain at the heart of our efforts to counter
inflation and improve margins.

FULL-YEAR REVIEW
Production for 2018 came in toward the top end of guidance at 3.400Moz. Compared to 2017, production was 9% lower mainly due to the sale
and closure of assets in South Africa. Production from retained operations for 2018, excluding Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona, was
3.349Moz at a total cash cost of $765/oz, compared with 3.279Moz at a total cash cost of $738/oz in 2017. AISC for these retained operations
were $968/oz, compared with $1,017/oz in the same period last year. AISC for the International operations was $920/oz for 2018 compared
to $972/oz for 2017. AISC for the South African operations, including Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona, was $1,178/oz compared with
$1,245/oz in 2017.

Cash flow from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2018 decreased by 14% to $857m compared to $997m in 2017, reflecting
working capital lockups of $131m and the retrenchment costs related to the restructuring the South African business unit. In 2018, the Company
generated $205m of operating cash flow less capital expenditure compared to $167m in 2017 reflecting a solid operating performance and
lower capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the year, before taking growth capital into account, was $217m versus $125m a year earlier.

Free cash flow was negatively affected by delayed Kibali loan repayments due to the presidential elections in the DRC, which slowed down
the administrative processes. It is anticipated that these loan repayments will resume during the course of this year. Free cash flow excluding
abnormal cost such as the South Africa region redundancies, financing costs, and other was $140m in 2018,
compared to $50m a year earlier.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) decreased by 24% to $721m in 2018, compared to $953m in 2017 and
below the bottom end of the market guidance of between $800m to $920m. This included project capital expenditure of $148m invested in
growth projects at Obuasi, Siguiri and Kibali in Continental Africa and Mponeng in South Africa. Capital expenditures were lower in South Africa
due to the sale of assets in the region early in the year. Capital expenditures were also lower in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
at Kibali as the project development phase is coming to an end and the asset is ramping up production. In Guinea at Siguiri, investment was
made in the brownfields expansion project which was completed towards the end of 2018. The new combination plant is currently undergoing
commissioning ahead of ramp-up to full production. In Australia, capital investments were made towards a new secondary ball mill at Tropicana
and completion of the Recovery Enhancement Project at Sunrise Dam.

Headline earnings for the year ended 31 December 2018 were $220m, or 53 US cents per share, compared with $27m, or 6 US cents per
share, in 2017. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) of $1,480m in 2018 (compared to
$1,483m in 2017) was essentially flat year-on-year.

The ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2018 was 1.12 times compared with 1.35 times at the end of December
2017. Management has successfully maintained financial flexibility by remaining at or below its targeted leverage Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
ratio of 1.5 times, and well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times, which applies under our revolving credit agreements.

Net debt decreased by 17% to $1.659bn at 31 December 2018, from $2.001bn at the 31 December 2017. Financial flexibility was further
improved in October 2018, when a new five-year $1.4bn multi-currency revolving credit facility was agreed with our banking syndicate replacing
our existing $1bn US Dollar and A$500m Australian Dollar facilities. Strong liquidity is provided both by this new revolving credit facility, which
was fully undrawn at the end of 2018, and $329m in cash.

SECOND HALF YEAR REVIEW

Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further changes to asset

material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation may be significant. Please refer to the Risk

SAFETY UPDATE
It is with deep regret that we report three fatalities which occurred during the first half of the year. In Brazil there was one fatality following an
electricity-related incident in January. In the South Africa region at Moab Khotsong a tramming incident caused one fatality in February and at
Mponeng a mechanical loader operator was fatally injured in a seismic fall of ground in April. The All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), the broadest
measure of workplace safety, decreased by 36% to 4.81 injuries per million hours worked for 2018, compared to 7.49 injuries per million hours
worked for the previous year. AIFR for the quarter ended 31 December 2018 was 3.59 injuries per million hours worked, compared to 6.51
injuries per million hours worked for the same period in the previous year.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
The Continental Africa region produced 1,512,000oz at a total cash cost of $773/oz in 2018, compared to 1,453,000oz at a total cash cost
of $720/oz in 2017. AISC were $904/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to $953/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The region delivered a solid performance with production boosted by higher tonnes treated particularly from underground mining at Kibali and
Geita and improved underground grade from Geita.

In the DRC, Kibali's production was 363,000oz at a total cash cost of $600/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 268,000oz
at a total cash cost of $784/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. The increase in production was mainly due to the 26% increase in
recovered grade as underground mining displaced lower-grade open-pit ore, an improved recovery factor and an 8% increase in tonnage
treated as a result of improved plant performance. Total cash cost consequently fell 23% due to higher gold production, partly offset by higher
underground production costs compared to the open pit and a higher royalty rate introduced in the second half of the year.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased to 254,000oz at a total cash cost of $804/oz in 2018, compared to 228,000oz at a total cash cost
of $823/oz in 2017. Production increased 11% year-on-year to a record, driven by 6% higher tonnage treated due to improved grinding and
plant efficiency and 5% higher recovered grade, resulting from mining deeper, higher-grade areas in the Teberebie pit. Total cash cost dropped
2% over the year due to the increased production despite inflation effects related to higher fuel prices and mining costs particularly in the
second half of the year.

During 2018, Obuasi remained in the care and maintenance phase whilst the redevelopment project for recommencing operations continued.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 242,000oz at a total cash cost of $844/oz in 2018, compared to 324,000oz at a total cash cost of $725/oz in 2017.
Production was negatively impacted by a 16% decrease in recovered grade from treating lower grade oxide material and an 11% decrease in
tonnes due to delays in the commissioning of the Carbon-in Leach (CIL) combination plant. Total cash cost increased year-on-year as a result
of lower production, partly offset by lower mining costs compared to the same period the year before.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 564,000oz at a total cash cost of $804/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 539,000oz at a
total cash cost of $608/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. Recovered grade saw a 5% increase year-on-year due to a range of operational
improvements (advance grade control and underground mining efficiencies), which assisted in accessing higher grade ore particularly in the
fourth quarter of 2018. Total cash costs, however, increased as a result of increased underground and open-pit mining costs compared to the
same period in the previous year, in addition to some operational challenges in the primary crusher during the second half of the year.

In Mali, Sadiola produced 59,000oz at a total cash cost of $938/oz in 2018, compared to 63,000oz at a total cash cost of $900/oz in 2017.
Production decreased due to a 9% drop in recovered grade from limited availability of the oxide ore as mining ceased during the year. The
mine transitioned to a stockpile treatment plan at the beginning of the year, partly compensated for by a 3% increase in tonnes treated as a
result of newly installed variable speed drives in the mill. Total cash costs increased as a result of lower production, partly offset by lower
operating costs compared to the same period the year before.

Production at Morila increased to 30,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,145/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 28,000oz at
a total cash cost of $974/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. The increase in production was driven by a 19% increase in recovered
grade as mining resumed during the year, resulting in the treatment of higher grade ore, partly offset by a 11% decrease in throughput due to
treatment of harder ore. Total cash cost, however, increased due to higher operating cost as a result of the resumption of mining activities.

The Americas region produced 776,000oz at a total cash cost of $624/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 840,000oz at
a total cash cost of $638/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. AISC were $855/oz in 2018, compared to $943/oz achieved in 2017.

In Argentina at Cerro Vanguardia, full year output in 2018 was maintained at the same level as 2017 producing 282,000oz at a total cash cost
of $476/oz, compared to 283,000oz at a total cash cost of $522/oz in 2017. The mine managed to maintain production, despite lower underground
grade, mainly because of higher tonnes mined and treated. Total cash costs fell mainly as a result of the weaker exchange rate due to the
devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the US Dollar as well as improved efficiencies. These positive effects were partially attenuated by
rapidly rising inflation which ended the year at 47%, mostly related to salary increments, and unfavourable stockpile movements. Lower average
silver price and lower volumes sold also affected costs negatively.

A number of Operational Excellence initiatives were identified and implemented during 2018, including underground development optimisation,
cost reduction in material and services contracts, workforce recruitment freeze, nitrate and flocculants optimisation, cost reduction in mine
drilling steel and cyclone pumps liners, and overhead restructuring.

In September 2018, the Government of Argentina introduced the payment of export duties on exported goods. In terms of an existing tax
stability agreement, Cerro Vanguardia is entitled to a refund of these export duties. At 31 December 2018, $14m was reflected as receivable
and impacted free cash flow generated by the operation.

In Brazil, production was 494,000oz at a total cash cost of $706/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 557,000oz at a total
cash cost of $693/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. Total cash costs were impacted by lower year-on-year production and inflationary
pressure, partially offset by the Operational Excellence initiatives and favourable exchange rates. AISC was $966/oz for the year ended 31
December 2018, compared to $1,029/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. This decrease is mainly due to lower sustaining capital
expenditure driven by increased focus on capital management and benefits derived for the Operational Excellence initiatives. For the second
half of 2018, production was 264,000oz at a total cash cost of $650/oz, compared to 302,000oz at a total cash cost of $692/oz during the same
period in 2017. AISC were $922/oz for the second half of 2018, compared to $994/oz during the same period in 2017.

At AGA Mineração, full-year production in 2018 was 364,000oz at a total cash cost of $723/oz, compared to 424,000oz at a total cash cost of
$671/oz in 2017. Production was lower as the Cuiaba complex faced delays in development and infrastructure constraints. During the fourth
quarter of 2018, operating performance improved as measures were taken to improve mine quality by improving stope availability, drilling and
mine recoveries while ensuring compliance to plan, with an offset due to the timing of sales. At Córrego do Sítio (CdS), lower grades in the
sulphide operation and excessive rainfal resulted in 8% lower production. Production was also impacted by lower tonnes placed on the heap leach, 
model changes, and production stoppages due to strikes.

At Serra Grande, full-year production in 2018 was 130,000oz at a total cash cost of $660/oz, compared to 133,000oz at a total cash cost of
$764/oz in 2017. Production was lower due to less ore mined following delays in receiving environmental deforestation and waste dump permits.

AngloGold Ashanti has a clear framework that sets principles, standards and guidelines for the construction, management and oversight of its 
tailings storage facilities (TSFs). It is our obligation to ensure that our TSFs are stable, non-polluting and contained. We are guided in this 
regard by international best practice, and conduct regular detailed inspections by internal specialists and independent third-party experts, as 
well as ongoing monitoring and ongoing preventive maintenance. On 7 February 2019, Regulatory Authorities of Brazil's Minas Gerais state suspended 
all tailings facilities in the state constructed using the upstream design method.  AngloGold Ashanti does not have upstream TSFs in the state, but 
it does have one Centerline facility at the CdS operation.  As a precautionary step, CdS's tailings facility was temporarily suspended while the 
facility's design is confirmed by the regulators as the Centerline method. We are in close dialogue with the regulator in this regard, and look 
forward to resuming operation at the site as soon as they have satisfied themselves of the design of the facility. The TSF supports production of 
about 95,000oz a year at CdS. The balance of 35,000oz of CdS's annual production comes from its heap leach, and so is unaffected by the TSF suspension. 
In the meantime, scheduled maintenance is underway and mining at the site continues as we stockpile ore ahead of the plant, given that the plant at CdS 
has processing headroom above what is normally mined.

The Australia region produced 625,000oz at a total cash cost of $762/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 559,000oz at
a total cash cost of $743/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. AISC were $1,038/oz in 2018, compared to $1,062/oz in 2017. For the
second half of 2018, the Australia region produced 319,000oz at a total cash cost of $735/oz, compared to 305,000oz at a total cash cost of
$717/oz for the same period in 2017.

Higher mill feed grades in the first and the last quarters of 2018 contributed to a 21% increase in year-on-year production at Sunrise Dam,
which delivered 289,000oz of gold production at a total cash cost of $920/oz in 2018, compared to 238,000oz at a total cash cost of $919/oz
in 2017. Performance of the new Recovery Enhancement Project (REP) has been below expectation, however a structured optimisation
programme is delivering positive results and, along with a higher proportion of Vogue ore in the feed blend, recovery is expected to increase
to Feasibility Study levels during 2019. A number of critical once-off capital projects were completed in 2018, including construction of the REP,
a multi-year extension to the Tailings Storage Facility and the installation and commissioning of two 2MW primary ventilation fans.

Tropicana produced 336,000oz at a total cash cost of $594/oz in 2018, compared to 321,000oz at a total cash cost of $564/oz in 2017. At
Tropicana, production increased 5% due to higher mill feed grades and higher mill throughput. At Tropicana the second 6MW ball mill was
commissioned ahead of schedule in November 2018 and full ramp-up achieved within a week delivering increased throughput and improved
metallurgical recovery in line with the Feasibility Study. In December 2018, the Tropicana JV partners announced that a Feasibility Study into
the development of an underground mine beneath the Boston Shaker pit was underway after a Pre-Feasibility Study confirmed that underground
mining was technically and financially viable.

The South Africa region produced 487,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,033/oz for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to 903,000oz
at a total cash cost of $1,085/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. The lower production decrease reflects fewer mines in the region with
only two months of contribution from Kopanang and Moab Khotsong, following their sale on 28 February 2018. TauTona ceased mining in
September 2017 and has been placed in orderly closure. AISC for the South Africa region were $1,178/oz in 2018, compared to $1,245/oz in
2017.

Production from retained operations was 436,000oz in 2018, up 2% year-on-year. AISC from the retained operations was down 11% for the
second half of 2018, mainly as a result of higher gold output. Cost management efforts continue with earnest in the South Africa region, aimed
at ensuring that both on- and off-mine cost structures are appropriately resized for the smaller production base. As part of the Mponeng safe
production strategy related to the improvement of face time, Mponeng signed a new shift arrangement agreement with its South Africa trade
unions. The new shift arrangements were successfully implemented as of 12 November 2018 and are expected to help improve productivity.

At Mponeng, full-year production in 2018 was 265,000oz at a total cash cost of $977/oz, compared to 224,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,014/ oz
in 2017. Accessing higher-value reef and improving mining practices delivered an increase of 18% in production year-on-year. During the
second half of 2018, production increased by 24% year-on-year driven by improved mine call factor, increased tonnes treated, and improvement
in underground grade as a result of better mining mix and recoveries.

At Mine Waste Solutions (MWS), production for the year ended 31 December 2018 was 103,000oz at a total cash costs of $812/oz, compared
to 109,000oz at a total cash cost of $780/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017. MWS remained cash positive despite the 5% year-on-
year decline in production, which was mainly due to lower recoveries as a result of carbon management challenges experienced during the
third quarter of 2018, which improved toward the end of 2018. Tonnages ended lower year-on-year, impacted by unplanned stoppages due to
inclement weather and associated power outages. Approximately 167 hours of power failures were experienced in December alone.
Engagements were held with Eskom management, the electricity public utility, and a protocol was agreed to create flexibility during inclement
weather.

Hard Rock production for the year declined 18% while production at the Vaal River Surface Sources declined reflecting the sale of the Mispah
and West Gold plants. Yield contribution from West Wits Surface Sources was also 22% lower year-on-year due to the areas that were reclaimed
at the Savuka Marginal Ore Dumps and Tailings Storage Facilities (TSF). Accordingly, mining strategies were changed during the third quarter
of 2018 and feed grades are beginning to improve.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Board and CEO changes
Mr Kelvin Dushnisky was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and an executive member of the Board of Directors of AngloGold Ashanti,
effective 1 September 2018. The Company also announced the appointment of two independent non-executive directors to its Board of
Directors, Mr Alan Ferguson and Mr Jochen Tilk, with effect from 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019, respectively.

Changes in Executive Portfolios
Some organisational and management changes have taken place primarily drawing from the well-developed pool of talent from within the
organisation. These appointments are being implemented in parallel with the planned retirements of COO: South Africa Chris Sheppard,
Executive Vice President: Sustainable Development David Noko, and Executive Vice President Strategy & Business Development Charles
Carter. The global operating base will remain in two regions, each overseen by a chief operating officer.

The Africa portfolio, which will now include the rationalised South Africa footprint, will be overseen by Sicelo Ntuli, formerly Senior Vice
President: Continental Africa. Sicelo has done excellent work in driving the turnaround of Iduapriem and for the past two years under Ludwig
Eybers' guidance, has had line responsibility for the Continental Africa region, which has delivered consistently strong operating performances.

Moses Madondo, who did exceptional work as Senior Vice President: Vaal River Region, before the sale of those assets last year, has assumed
responsibility for our South Africa portfolio, as Senior Vice President: South Africa.

Ludwig Eybers will remain COO: International, with greater focus on advancing our Colombia options up the value curve, unlocking the
potential that exists within our Brazil and Australia assets, and ensuring our global exploration programme continues to deliver strong outcomes.

Pierre Chenard, formerly Senior Vice President of Business Development of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., and also its general counsel, has been
named Executive Vice President: Business Development & Strategy. Pierre, who has also held roles in the North American gold sector with
Cambior, Hope Bay and latterly as a director on the Board of Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd., brings a wealth of experience across a number of
jurisdictions, to the role.

Stewart Bailey, formerly Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Group Communications, has been named Executive Vice President:
Corporate Affairs, a portfolio that will include stakeholder relations and the broader ambit of sustainability policy and oversight. His in-depth
knowledge of the Company and many of its stakeholders, close cooperation with the sustainability team over several years and ongoing work
in integrating environmental, social and governance reporting into the broader business, provide a strong foundation for this role.

The incumbents have been working alongside their successors in each role ensuring a seamless transition in those areas.

Developments in the South Africa region
AngloGold Ashanti reached a three-year wage agreement with all its trade unions in South Africa, effective 1 July 2018. The wage agreement
includes wage increases over three years as well as a new shift arrangement, aimed at improving production with continued focus on safety.

Restructuring of the South African asset portfolio was completed in December 2018. The restructuring process was focused on protecting the
longer-term sustainability of the business to ensure that both on- and off-mine cost structures are appropriate for the significantly smaller
production base as compared to historic levels. The process was completed reaching a balance between preserving local jobs while rightsizing
overhead structures for the current smaller production base. Forced retrenchments were mitigated, from 2,000 initially anticipated in the most
recent restructuring, to 72, by offering voluntary severance packages, and selling non-core assets, such as healthcare facilities and rail networks
in the Vaal River region, which helped preserve jobs through a transfer of ownership.

Obuasi Arbitration Proceedings Resolved
The Obuasi mine, operated by AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited, had been the subject of a dispute with the Republic of Ghana since February
2016, when military protection was withdrawn from the mine and the site was being overrun by illegal miners for close to nine months. The
case was registered with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in May 2016. The dispute has now been resolved to
the parties' mutual satisfaction. As a result, on 19 July 2018, the Company submitted a request to the Tribunal for the legal proceedings to be
discontinued. Furthermore, the Parliament of Ghana has ratified a number of regulatory and fiscal agreements with the Company in relation
to the redevelopment of the mine into a modern and mechanised operation, and environmental permits have been issued by the relevant
Ghanaian agency, both events marking an important step for the mine's future.

Tanzania Arbitration Proceedings Update
With reference to the arbitration proceedings, previously disclosed, which commenced in July 2017, AngloGold Ashanti's focus continues to be on pursuing
a collaborative dialogue with the government of Tanzania. The arbitration proceedings are currently suspended until July 2019.

Yatela Sales Process
On 14 February 2019, Sadiola Exploration Limited (SADEX), the subsidiary jointly held by AngloGold Ashanti and IAMGOLD Corporation,
entered into a share purchase agreement with the Government of Mali, whereby SADEX agreed to sell to the Government of Mali its 80%
participation in Société d'Exploitation des Mines d'Or de Yatela (Yatela), for a consideration of USD 1. The transaction remains subject to the
fulfillment of a number of conditions precedent, among which the adoption of two laws, confirming the change of status of Yatela to a State
Entity, and also the creation of a dedicated state agency, notably in charge of mine rehabilitation and closure. As part of the transaction, and
upon its completion, SADEX will make a one-time payment to the said state agency, in an amount corresponding to the estimated costs of
completing the rehabilitation and closure of the Yatela site, and also financing certain outstanding social programs. Upon completion and this
payment being made, SADEX and its affiliates companies will be released of all obligations relating to the Yatela project including those relating
to rehabilitation, mine closure and the financing of social programs.

Settlement of Silicosis and TB class action
On 3 May 2018, Richard Spoor Inc, Abrahams Kiewitz Inc and the Legal Resources Centre (representing claimants in the silicosis and
tuberculosis class action litigation) and African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye-
Stillwater announced that they have reached a settlement in this matter. Following this announcement, on 13 December 2018, the Johannesburg
High Court issued a court order setting out the processes in terms of which members of the settling classes and any interested parties should
be invited to show cause why the settlement should not be made an order of court. Both the court order and the settlement agreement set out
steps that will need to be followed from this point. For more details on the process see: www.silicosissettlement.co.za and
https:// www.oldcollab.co.za/.

JSE Sponsor and Joint Corporate Brokers
The Company's previous JSE Sponsor, Deutsche Securities (SA) Proprietary Limited, resigned as sponsor following the closure of Deutsche
Bank's Sponsor Services business in South Africa. The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited was appointed as equity sponsor, with effect
from 30 November 2018, and debt sponsor, with effect from 31 January 2019.

Additionally, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Canada were named joint corporate brokers, effective 30 November 2018.

PROJECT UPDATES

Obuasi Redevelopment Project
Following receipt of all the requisite Ghanaian Government approvals, including parliamentary ratification, and environmental approvals in
June 2018, redevelopment of the Obuasi high-grade orebody has started in earnest. Establishment of the project and operating teams have
progressed well and all key roles have been filled. Detailed design has continued, focusing on the processing plant and underground
infrastructure. Critical long-lead items have been ordered. Demolition of redundant processing plant structures has commenced. Refurbishment
planning was completed, and works are set to commence by end of March 2019. The housing refurbishment programme has also commenced
and the expansion of the mining contractor's camp is well advanced.

The underground mining fleet has been delivered and commissioned. The underground mining contractor has commenced mobilisation.
Operational readiness activities, including the design of the mine operating systems, has progressed to plan.

The project is being developed in two phases, the first is to achieve production at 2,000tpd with first gold pour at the end of 2019. The second
is to achieve production of 4,000tpd by the end of 2020.

In order to ensure meaningful Ghanaian participation in the project, a key commitment made by AngloGold Ashanti at the outset of Obuasi's
redevelopment, the mining contract was awarded to a joint venture Underground Mining Alliance Limited (UMA) formed by Ghana's Rocksure
International (Rocksure) (30%) and Australia's African Underground Mining Services (AUMS) (70%), which will also help facilitate the transfer
of underground mining expertise to Accra-based Rocksure. To facilitate the JV and effect operating cost and import duty savings, AngloGold
Ashanti (Ghana) Limited purchased the mining fleet at a cost of approximately $46m. As announced in November 2018, this mining fleet
purchase increases the initial project capital expenditure range from $450 to $500m to $495 to $545m. However, at the same time, this purchase
reduces the contract rates over the period of the contract and is estimated to improve AISC by approximately $25/oz.

Given the delayed receipt of permit approvals in 2018, some capital expenditure has been deferred from 2018 into 2019 and from 2019 into
2020. The latest outlook on the capital spend profile is expected to be 10%, 60%, and 30% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Siguiri Combination Plant
The new Combination Plant construction has been completed and commissioning is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2019. The plant
will allow for the treatment of harder rock at the Siguiri mine. Additionally, a new power plant intended to bridge the gap to meet the mine's
additional power requirements was completed and ready for commercial operations at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, as planned.

Mponeng Project
During 2018, the raise boring of the reef pass from 123 level to 126 level was completed and the construction contractor was mobilised in
December 2018 to construct the tip and control chute. The process of installing additional support to consolidate the hanging wall and side
walls of the pump chamber and substation will follow in the second half of 2019. Alternative project design configurations are being studied for phase 2.

Quebradona Project
At Quebradona (94.9% AngloGold Ashanti interest and 5.1% B2Gold interest) the prefeasibility study was completed. The maiden ore reserve
has been declared of 1.26m tonnes of copper and 2.22Moz of gold. The study envisages a 6.2m tonnes per annum sub-level cave mining
operation, with 23-year mine life averaging 1.21% copper plus 0.66g/t gold ore milled resulting in an IRR of 16.8%, at a gold price of $1,240/
oz and a copper price of $2.90/lb.

AngloGold Ashanti will proceed with the feasibility study, the results of which will be announced in 2020. From January to April 2019, initial
feasibility activities focused on defining and enhancing the scope further, will be conducted, with the EIA submission aimed for May 2019.
During the second half of 2019, engineering work of the defined project will be the main focus.

Gramalote Joint Venture
The Gramalote project is a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti (51%) and B2Gold (49%), with AngloGold Ashanti as the operator and
manager of the project. Following additional infill and resource extension drilling the Mineral Resource model is being updated. The additional
drilling has indicated the potential for resource growth and potentially higher grades through selectivity.  Final budgets, schedules and work
plans for advancing Gramalote will be developed once the Mineral Resource model has been finalised and the updated audited project
economics are available.

EXPLORATION
See the Exploration Update document on the Company's website (www.anglogoldashanti.com) for a detailed update on both Brownfields and
Greenfields exploration programmes.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve for AngloGold Ashanti are reported in accordance with the minimum standards described by the South
African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (The SAMREC Code, 2016 Edition), and also
conform to the standards set out in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC
Code, 2012 Edition).

The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Ore Reserve component, unless otherwise stated. In complying with revisions to the SAMREC Code the
changes to AngloGold Ashanti's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve have been reviewed and it was concluded that none of the changes are
material to the overall valuation of the Company. AngloGold Ashanti has therefore once again resolved not to provide the detailed reporting as
defined in Table 1 of the SAMREC Code, apart from the maiden Ore Reserve declaration for Quebradona. The Company will however continue
to provide the high level of detail it has in previous years in order to comply with the transparency requirements of the SAMREC Code.

AngloGold Ashanti strives to actively create value by growing its major asset - the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve. This drive is based on
active, well-defined brownfields and greenfields exploration programmes, innovation in both geological modelling and mine planning and continual
optimisation of the asset portfolio.

PRICE
The SAMREC and JORC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-range commodity price and exchange
rate forecasts. These are reviewed annually and are prepared in-house using a range of techniques including historic price averages.

The Mineral Resource sensitivities shown in the detail of this report use a base of $1,400/oz and a range of $200/oz, unless stated otherwise.

Gold Price
The following local prices of gold were used as a basis for estimation in the December 2018 declaration:

                                                            Local prices of gold

MINERAL RESOURCE

Gold:
The AngloGold Ashanti Mineral Resource decreased from 208.2Moz in December 2017 to 184.6Moz in December 2018. This gross annual
decrease of 23.6Moz includes depletion of 3.9Moz and the disposal of assets of 20.1Moz. The balance of 0.4Moz reduction in Mineral Resource,
results from an increase due to exploration and modelling of 4.5Moz and reductions due to revised geotechnical design requirements of 4.0Moz,
other factors of 0.1Moz and changes in cost of 0.2Moz. The Mineral Resource has been estimated at a gold price of $1,400/oz (2017: $1,400/ oz).

5.4Moz includes depletion of 3.6Moz. The loss after depletions of 1.8Moz, results from the disposal of assets in the South African region of 6.1Moz,
additions due to exploration and modelling changes of 4.3Moz, whilst other factors resulted in a 0.1Moz addition and changes in economic
assumptions resulted in a 0.1Moz reduction. The Ore Reserve has been estimated using a gold price of $1,100/oz (2017: $1,100/oz).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AngloGold Ashanti has established a Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Steering Committee (RRSC), which is responsible for setting and
overseeing the Company's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve governance framework and for ensuring that it meets the Company's goals and
objectives while complying with all relevant regulatory codes. Its membership and terms of references are mandated under a policy document
signed by the Chief Executive Officer.

Over more than a decade, the Company has developed and implemented a rigorous system of internal and external reviews aimed at providing
assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The following operations were subject to an external review in line with
the policy that each operation project will be reviewed by an independent third party on average once every three years:

          Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Iduapriem
          Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Sunrise Dam
          Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Cerro Vanguardia
          Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Serra Grande
          Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Quebradona

The external reviews were conducted by Pivot Mining Consultants Pty (Ltd), AMC Consultants Pty Ltd, Golder Associates Pty Ltd, Ausenco
Engineering Canada Inc. and Optiro Pty Ltd respectively. Certificates of sign-off have been received from the companies conducting the external
reviews to state that the Mineral Resource and/or Ore Reserve comply with the SAMREC and JORC Codes.

In addition, numerous internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve process reviews were completed by suitably qualified Competent Persons
from within AngloGold Ashanti and no significant deficiencies were identified. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve are underpinned by
appropriate Mineral Resource Management processes and protocols that ensure adequate corporate governance. These procedures have been
developed to be compliant with the guiding principles of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).

AngloGold Ashanti makes use of a web-based group reporting database called the Resource and Reserve Reporting System (R3) for the
compilation and authorisation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting. It is a fully integrated system for the reporting and reconciliation
of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve that supports various regulatory reporting requirements including the US Securities and Exchange Commission
and the JSE under SAMREC. AngloGold Ashanti uses R3 to ensure a documented chain of responsibility exists from the competent persons at
the operations to the Company's RRSC.

AngloGold Ashanti has also developed an enterprise-wide risk management tool that provides consistent and reliable data that allows for visibility
of risks and actions across the group. This tool is used to facilitate, control and monitor material risks to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve,
thus ensuring that the appropriate risk management and mitigation plans are in place.

COMPETENT PERSONS
The information in this report relating to exploration results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is based on information compiled by or under

Independent auditor's review report on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended
31 December 2018 to the shareholders of AngloGold Ashanti Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti Limited (the 'Company') contained
in the accompanying preliminary report on pages 20 to 40, which comprise the accompanying condensed consolidated statement
of financial position as at 31 December 2018, the condensed consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive
income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the twelve months then ended, and selected explanatory
notes.

Directors' responsibility for the condensed consolidated financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated financial statements. We conducted our review
in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical
information performed by the independent auditor of the entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements are not prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply
with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures,
primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical
procedures, and evaluating the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the twelve months ended 31 December 2018 are not prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Income tax uncertainties
AngloGold Ashanti operates in numerous countries around the world and accordingly is subject to, and pays annual income taxes
under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual
agreements with local gorvernment, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The company has
historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and to pay the taxes reasonably determined to be due. In some
jurisdictions, tax authorities are yet to complete their assesments for previous years. The tax rules and regulations in many countries
are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax fillings
and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with tax authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules in respect of the 
Company's business conducted within the country involved.

The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing market values at the reporting date which results in the
difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and accordingly

Fair Value hierarchy
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly
(derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Environmental obligations

Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and rehabilitate the lands
which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence, AngloGold Ashanti is required in some circumstances to provide
either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or provide guarantees issued by the operation, to
the respective environmental protection agency or such other government department with responsibility for environmental oversight in the
respective country to cover the potential environmental rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.

In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are required to potentially
post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.

In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.077bn and guarantees of ZAR 0.549bn issued by various banks,
for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 0.796bn. In Australia, since 2014, we have paid into a Mine Rehabilitation Fund an amount
of AUD $5.5m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $125.5m. At Iduapriem we have provided a bond comprising of a cash component
of $9.99m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $36.4m issued by Ecobank Ghana Limited and Barclays Ghana Limited for a current
carrying value of the liability of $42.8m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.6m with a further bank
guarantee amounting to $30.0m issued by Standard Chartered Bank Ghana limited (SCB) and United Bank for Africa Ghana Limited (UBA)
for a current carrying value of the liability of $163.2m. In some circumstances we may be required to post further bonds in due course which
will have a consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the providers of the reclamation bonds.

Liquidity and capital resources

To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash resources, cash
generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to foreign
investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In addition, distributions
from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that external
borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to meet the above
commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that sufficient measures are in place
to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

Litigation claims

(1)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors Limited's (MBC)
      underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling agreement at Obuasi mine. The parties
      reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation agreement on 8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014,
      AGAG was served with a demand issued by MBC claiming a total of $97m. In December 2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High
      Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC submitted the matter to arbitration. On 12 July 2018, the Ghana Arbitration Centre
      notified AGAG that MBC had appointed an arbitrator and AGAG subsequently selected its own arbitrator.

(2)   Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that they were or
      are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by emission and/or other
      environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the Pompora Treatment Plant (PTP), which
      was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory infections, skin diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs
      subsequently did not timely file their application for directions, but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the
      matter struck out for want of prosecution. On 24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA),
      sued AGAG by themselves and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well
      as economic hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter has been adjourned indefinitely. AGAG intends to allow
      some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. In view of the limitation of current information for
      the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation in either matter.

(3)   Litigation - On 19 October 2017, Newmont Mining Co. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
      York against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties, alleging that AngloGold Ashanti and such parties did not provide Newmont
      with certain information material to its purchase of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company in 2015 during the negotiation- and-
      sale process.  AngloGold Ashanti believes the lawsuit is without merit and continues to vigorously defend against it. The matter is proceeding.
      In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

Tax claims

(4)   Tax disputes - AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various disputes with tax authorities. These disputes involve
      federal tax assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions, VAT and annual property tax. Collectively, the possible amount
      involved is approximately $21m (2017: $24m).  Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.

(5)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office (DIAN) that it
      disagreed with the Company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income and equity tax returns. On 23 October 2013,
      AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax of $20m (2017: $21m) will be
      payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes may amount to $115m (2017: $129m). The Company
      believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in
      March and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca (the trial court for tax litigation). Closing arguments on the tax
      disputes were presented in February and June 2017 and judgement is pending. On 23 April 2018, the Administrative Tribunal denied
      AGAC's arguments with respect to the 2011 income tax litigation. AGAC subsequently appealed
      this judgement to the Colombian Supreme Court. A final judgement could take several years. In addition, in January 2018 AGAC received notice from
      the DIAN that it also disagreed with AGAC's 2013 income and equity tax returns on the same basis as the 2010 and 2011 returns, calculating
      an additional tax of $32m, along with penalties and interest of $13m. On 21 December 2018, AGAC filed an appeal before the Administrative
      Tribunal in respect of the 2013 year of assessment.

Other

(6)   Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations, which have
      occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal studies have been
      undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable remediation solutions. The group has
      instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the
      existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances. Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling
      techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use of phyto-technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination.
      Subject to the completion of trials and the technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the
      obligation.

(7)   Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep groundwater in
      certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999 to understand this potential
      risk.  In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed solution needs to be a combined one supported
      by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that
      the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In
      view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation

16    New and amended standards adopted by the group

AngloGold Ashanti adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and, early adopted, IFRIC23 
Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments on 1 January 2018.

The new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period and the group has changed its accounting policies and
made retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting the standards.

The impact of the adoption of these standards and the new accounting policies are disclosed below.
Impact of adoption - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

The adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in the reclassification of by-product revenue in Revenue from product sales where previously by-product
revenue was recorded as a credit to cost of sales. Revenue from product sales includes gold income and by-product revenue. This change in
classification results in a corresponding increase in costs of sales, and therefore will not have an impact on previously reported gross profit.

In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 15, AngloGold Ashanti has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.

The revenue accounting policy applicable from 1 January 2018:

Revenue is recognised when control of the goods passes to the customer and the performance obligations of transferring control have been
met. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the entity is entitled in exchange for the goods transferred.

Revenue from product sales comprises sales of:

- refined gold;
- by-products including silver, uranium and sulphuric acid; and
- dóre bars.

Impact of adoption - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities,
derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.

The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the
financial statements. The new accounting policies are set out below. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative
figures have not been restated.

The group's financial assets include debt instruments (held to maturity bonds and negotiable certificates of deposit), cash restricted for use
and cash and cash equivalents which are subject to the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model as they are carried at amortised cost. The accounting
policy for listed equity investments depends on the nature of the listed investment. Listed equity investments which are held to meet rehabilitation
liabilities are classified as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) to eliminate accounting mismatch. Listed equity investments held for other
purposes are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost and
there is no change in their recognition or presentation under IFRS 9. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on total assets,
total liabilities or the results of the group.

Equity investments held in the Environmental Trust funds, previously classified as available for sale investments and measured at FVTOCI
have been reclassified to FVTPL on initial adoption of IFRS 9. Equity investments held for strategic purposes are measured at FVTOCI with
no recycling of profits or losses on disposal of the investments.

On 1 January 2018 management classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories.

Upon adoption of IFRS 9, available for sale reserve of $43m was transferred to the FVTOCI reserve - $33m and to accumulated losses - $10m
in respect of equity investments at FVTOCI and FVTPL respectively. Refer statement of changes in equity for reclassifications.

The Financial Instruments accounting policy applicable from 1 January 2018:

Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value when the group becomes a party to their contractual arrangements. Transaction costs
directly attributable to the instrument's acquisition or issue are included in the initial measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities,
except financial instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The subsequent measurement of financial instruments
is dealt with below.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. The group also derecognises a
financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case a new financial
liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:

- amortised cost;
- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - equity instruments; or
- FVTPL.

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs
that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL, are expensed.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows and its contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any
gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains or losses, together with foreign exchange
gains or losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment
that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains or losses in the period in which it
arises. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the proceeds received or receivable and the carrying amount of the asset
is included in profit or loss.

Equity instruments
Listed equity investments which are held to meet rehabilitation liabilities are classified as FVTPL. Listed equity investments held for other
purposes are classified as FVTOCI.

The group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the group's management has elected to present fair value gains
and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the
derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the group's
right to receive payments is established. Residual values in OCI are reclassified to retained earnings (accumulated losses) on derecognition
of the related FVTOCI instruments. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised in other gains or losses in the statement
of profit or loss as applicable.

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade receivables, loans, cash and cash equivalents and debt instruments. Impairment losses are
assessed using the forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. An allowance is recorded for all loans and other debt financial assets
not held at FVTPL. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Trade
receivable loss allowances are measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL's. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount
of the assets. Debt securities that are determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date and bank balances, for which credit risk has
not increased significantly since initial recognition, are measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

Impact of adoption - IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The group early adopted IFRIC 23 which is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application
permitted. No changes in estimates and judgements were made as a result of the adoption of IFRIC 23.

Impact of IFRS 16 Leases issued but not yet adopted
Management is in the process of completing its assessment of the accounting impact and required disclosures arising out of the adoption of
this standard. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities arising from lease contracts with additional
disclosures about leasing arrangements. Leases within the scope of IFRS 16 will result in increases in assets and liabilities. We expect an
increase in the group's depreciation expense and an increase in cash flows from operating activities as the lease payments will be recorded
as financing outflows in our cash flow statement. Management has determined that certain mining, drilling and power generation contracts
which are not classified as finance leases under the current accounting standards (IAS 17 and IFRIC 4), will have the most impact on the
group's results on adoption of IFRS 16. The adoption of the new standard will result in the recognition of additional right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities on 1 January 2019. AGA has elected to transition to IFRS 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the
Standard recognised at the date of initial application.  AGA will not restate comparative information. Instead, the cumulative effect of initially
applying IFRS 16 will be recognised by adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application. The adoption of
IFRS 16 will not impact AGA's current debt covenant arrangements with financial institutions.

Non-GAAP disclosure
From time to time AngloGold Ashanti Limited may publicly disclose certain ""Non-GAAP"" financial measures in the course of its financial
presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. Set out below are measures extracted from financial information
regularly presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee).

The group uses certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in managing the business and may provide users of this financial
information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. The Non-GAAP financial
measures are used to adjust for fair value movements on the convertible bonds as well as the highly volatile marked-to-market movements
on unrealised non-hedge derivatives and other commodity contracts, which can only be measured with certainty on settlement of the contracts.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or any other measure
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures that other companies use.

ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the year ended 31 December 2018 (""the period"") on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 19 February 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Expected headline earnings and basic earnings

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that the headline earnings for the
period are expected to be between $207 million and $224 million, with headline earnings per share
(""HEPS"") of between 50 cents and 54 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period
were $27 million and 6 cents, respectively.

The basic earnings for the period are expected to be between $120 million and $137 million, resulting
in basic earnings per share of between 29 cents and 33 cents. Basic loss and loss per share for the
comparative period were $191 million and 46 cents, respectively.

The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings for the period compared to the
comparative period were primarily due to the following reasons:

•      Lower amortisation levels for South Africa with the closure of TauTona in 2017 and the sale of
       the Moab Khotsong and Kopanang operations early in 2018, as well as a reduction of Ore
       Reserve Development amortisation in Brazil resulted in increased earnings of $78 million (post-
       tax) or 19 cents per share (non-cash impact); and
•      Income from Kibali increased by $95 million (post-tax) or 23 cents per share.


Significant once-off items affected basic earnings for the period as follows:
•       In 2018, a non-cash impairment of the Uranium plant of Mine Waste Solutions affected basic
        earnings by $66 million (post-tax) or 16 cents per share compared to 2017, where non-cash
        impairments and derecognition of certain of the South African assets and goodwill, largely as a
        result of the restructuring and disposal of the related assets, affecting basic earnings by an
        amount of $221 million (post-tax) or 53 cents per share; and
•         In 2018, retrenchment costs related to the restructured South African operations were $25
          million (post-tax) or 6 cents per share; while in 2017 the impact was $71 million (post-tax) or 17
          cents per share.

In addition, for 2017, a once-off non-cash provision in respect of the estimated costs of the settlement
of the silicosis class action claims and related expenditure, of $46 million (post-tax) or 11 cents per
share, affected both basic earnings and HEPS.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Posts Strong Q3 Operating Result; Net Debt falls by 15%
(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid third-quarter
operating result, with steady production and a significant drop in costs helping drive net debt
down by 15% year-on-year. Production for the full year remains forecast for the top end of
the guidance range, while costs are expected at the lower end.

Production from retained operations, after stripping out the South Africa asset sales, was
851,000oz at a total cash cost of $722/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2018,
compared with 853,000oz at $743/oz in the corresponding period of last year. Mponeng,
Kibali, Iduapriem and Tropicana delivered standout performances. In South Africa the
restructuring process to better match support infrastructure with the smaller production base,
is largely complete.

All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) were $920/oz during the third quarter of 2018, an
improvement of $151/oz or 14% compared to the third quarter of last year and a $94/oz
improvement from the second quarter of this year. This performance reflects both lower
capital expenditure and improved cash costs, supported by Operational Excellence
interventions and weaker operating currencies in key jurisdictions, notably Brazil, Argentina,
Australia and South Africa.

""This is a strong operating result that shows our absolute focus on safety and margins,""
Chief Executive Officer, Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""While we continue to work on improving
efficiencies right across our asset suite, we’re also making steady progress on our projects,
which are aimed at improving the overall quality and life of our portfolio.""

AngloGold Ashanti has invested in a slate of brownfields projects, aimed at extending life
and improving margins at key assets. At the Obuasi Redevelopment Project in Ghana, early
work in establishing the site has progressed, major contracts have been awarded and mobile
equipment deliveries have commenced. First production from the development of the large,
high-grade ore body remains on track for the end of next year.
Safety

The Company’s All-Injury Frequency Rate, the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the
first nine months of the year was 5.16 injuries per million hours worked, from 7.79 in the same
period last year, an improvement of 34%. In the three months through September, the AIFR
was 4.17, compared to 7.08 in the third quarter of last year. This is the lowest level in the
company’s history.

There were no fatalities during the third quarter ended 30 September 2018. The Company
remains vigilant and focused on its safe production strategy and on intensifying safety
practices for a sustainable improvement in this important area.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Free cash inflow was $34m for the third quarter of 2018, compared with $88m in the
corresponding period last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was affected by the 5% lower
gold price received, lower sales volumes year-on-year, and adverse working capital changes.
These negative factors were partly offset by lower capital expenditure and costs.

The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity. Adjusted earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) declined to $355m for the third quarter
of 2018, from $399m in the third quarter last year, due mainly to the lower gold price and
fewer ounces sold. Net debt declined by 15% to $1.749bn at 30 September 2018, from
$2.063bn at the same time last year. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30
September 2018 was 1.13 times compared with 1.49 times as at 30 September 2017. The
current net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio falls well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times
which applies under the company’s revolving credit facility agreements (RCFs), highlighting
the success of AngloGold Ashanti’s continued efforts to maintain financial flexibility.

Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
Third quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti reported a solid third quarter, demonstrating another progressive improvement in performance across its portfolio. Production
from retained operations remained steady year-on-year, as stronger output from Mponeng, in South Africa and a fully-ramped up Kibali, in the
DRC, offset a weaker quarter from both Siguiri, in Guinea and AGA Mineração, in Brazil. Free cash flow generation of $34m was weaker than
the $88m of the third quarter last year, due mainly to the lower gold price and higher working capital. The company remains committed to its
strategy of safely improving cash flows from a simpler, higher quality portfolio, while maintaining a flexible balance sheet. The all-injury frequency
rate for the quarter improved 41% year-on-year to 4.17 per million hours worked, the lowest level in the company’s history, demonstrating
ongoing focus on safety alongside fundamental operating improvements.

AngloGold Ashanti remains on track to at least meet full-year guidance on all metrics, costs are trending towards the lower end of the guided
range and production at the upper end, while capital expenditure guidance has been revised downwards. The company also remains on track
to complete the remaining restructuring of its South African cost base, where it seeks to better match its support infrastructure to the reduced
production base. The slate of brownfields projects, aimed at extending life and improving margins at key assets, remain on track. At Siguiri,
the new plant designed to enable the processing of higher grade, hard rock material, is expected to be fully commissioned by year-end, with
benefits in both costs and production to be seen next year. At Kibali, the underground ramp-up is essentially complete, with underground
mining rates steady and full-year production trending to outperform its full year guidance of 730,000 ounces, on 100% basis. At Obuasi, early
work in establishing the site has progressed, major contracts have been awarded and mobile equipment deliveries have commenced. Capital
expenditure is expected to ramp up during the fourth-quarter, and into next year.

""This is a strong operating result that shows our absolute focus on safety and margins,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. ""While
we continue to work on improving efficiencies right across our asset suite, we’re also making steady progress on our projects, which are aimed
at improving the overall quality and life of our portfolio.""

On the exploration front, the company remains committed to resource conversion and increasing the mineral inventory at mine sites, while
progressing greenfields opportunities in strategic areas, to maintain a healthy portfolio over the long term. (See the Exploration Update document
at www.anglogoldashanti.com for an update on both Brownfields and Greenfields exploration programmes.)

Production of 851,000oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2018, represents an increase of 6% compared to the second quarter of 2018,
and a 15% reduction compared to the third quarter of 2017, mainly due to the sale of assets in South Africa.

Production from retained operations for the third quarter of 2018 (excluding the Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona contribution in the
third quarter of last year), was 851,000oz at a total cash cost of $722/oz, compared with 853,000oz at $743/oz in the prior year. All-in Sustaining
Costs (AISC) for these retained operations were $920/oz, compared with $1,031/oz in the same period last year, an 11% reduction.

Production for the quarter was impacted by lower grades at AGA Mineração, partially offset by a strong performance from Continental Africa.
AISC was $920/oz during the third quarter of 2018, an improvement of $151/oz or 14% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and a $94/oz
improvement from the second quarter of 2018. This performance reflects both lower capital expenditure and improved cash costs, supported
by Operational Excellence interventions and by weaker operating currencies in key jurisdictions, notably Brazil, Argentina, Australia and South
Africa. Total cash costs decreased by 11% to $722/oz, compared to $807/oz for the third quarter of 2017.

As work continues to unlock value across the asset base, the lower contribution from higher-cost South African assets either sold or closed,
as well as the restructuring efforts in the region to match the production base with the support infrastructure, has led to an improvement in
costs. Total cash costs of $894/oz in South Africa during the third quarter of 2018 improved by 25% when compared to the second quarter of
this year and 18% when compared to the third quarter of 2017. AISC of $1,026/oz reflects a 17% improvement from the third quarter of 2017,
highlighting a strong performance at Mponeng with an AISC of $972/oz, a 21% improvement year-on-year.

Free cash inflow was $34m for the third quarter of 2018, compared with $88m in the third quarter of 2017. Free cash flow for the quarter was
affected by the 5% lower gold price received, lower sales volumes year-on-year, and adverse working capital changes, mainly comprising
timing of gold sales, pre-payments and dividends received. These negative factors were partly offset by lower capital expenditure and costs.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) declined to $355m for the third quarter of 2018, from
$399m in the third quarter of 2017, due mainly to the lower gold price and fewer ounces sold.

Net debt declined by 15% to $1.749bn at 30 September 2018, from $2.063bn at the same time last year. The balance sheet remains robust,
with liquidity comprising the $1.0bn US dollar RCF undrawn as at 30 September 2018, A$310m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF,
approximately R4.98bn available on the R5.65bn South African RCFs and other facilities, and cash and cash equivalents of $336m at
30 September 2018.

The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 September 2018 was 1.13 times compared with 1.49 times as at 30 September 2017.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) decreased by 35% from $251m for the third quarter of 2017 to $163m for the
third quarter of 2018. This decrease was largely due to planned lower capital expenditure across the portfolio, with declines led by Geita, Kibali,
AGA Mineração, and Moab Khotsong, which was sold earlier this year, and also the impact of weaker local currencies.

Total sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 36% to $140m for the quarter, compared to $219m for the third quarter of 2017. Sustaining
capital expenditure is lower year-on-year mainly because some brownfields projects have been completed or are near completion, in addition
to the impact of weaker currencies against the dollar. These projects include the new power plant and underground development at Geita, the
new underground mine at Kibali which is ramping up, and the Mponeng Below 120 Phase 1 project, now in the final stages of completion.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter, relative to the third quarter, in line with past trends due to timing of
investment.

Safety update

There were no fatalities during the third quarter ended 30 September 2018. We remain vigilant and focused on our safe production strategy
and on intensifying our safety practices for a sustainable improvement in this area. The group All-Injury Frequency Rate, the broadest measure
of workplace safety, for the first nine months of the year was 5.16 injuries per million hours worked, from 7.79 in the same period last year, an
improvement of 34%. In the three months through September, the AIFR was 4.17, compared to 7.08 in the third quarter of last year.

Operating Highlights

The Americas region produced 192,000oz at a total cash cost of $607/oz for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 213,000oz at a total cash
cost of $673/oz in the third quarter of 2017. AISC was $817/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to $989/oz in the third quarter of 2017.

In Brazil, production was 121,000oz at a total cash cost of $687/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 142,000oz at a total cash cost
of $715/oz in the third quarter of 2017. AISC was $916/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to $1,060/oz in the third quarter of 2017.

Production from AngloGold Ashanti Mineração was lower year-on-year, mainly due to lower grades and reduced volumes mined at Cuiabá
and Córrego do Sítio (CdS). At Cuiabá, production was impacted by lower feed grades and changes in the mine plan, while at CdS, output
was impacted by delays in environmental licensing as well variances in the geological model. A daily compliance tracking process has been
implemented to monitor and reduce deviations to the revised plan.

Total cash costs were impacted by lower production and some cost escalations, partially compensated by cost management initiatives, new
shift configurations and favourable exchange rate effects during the quarter.

At Serra Grande, production for the third quarter of 2018 improved to 34,000oz at a total cash cost of $587/oz, compared to 30,000oz at a
total cash cost of $799/oz for the third quarter of 2017. Production is reflective of higher feed grades and recoveries due to improved performance
in crushing, milling and leaching areas. There were temporary delays in receiving an environmental license, waste dump permits and
commencement of operations in the new open pit.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia's production was maintained at 71,000oz, while total cash costs improved by 19%, to $456/oz for the third
quarter of 2018, compared to $566/oz in the third quarter of 2017. Production was impacted by variability in the mining model while higher
tonnes treated were offset by lower tonnes placed in the heap leach. Silver production increased 28% year-on-year, in line with the mine plan.

Total cash costs were 19% lower compared to the third quarter of 2017, mainly as a result of the devaluation of the Argentinian peso against
the US dollar. In addition, favourable efficiencies were derived mainly from lower consumption of the fuel, services and consumables, as well
as lower heap leach costs given fewer tonnages. Unfavourable stockpile movements, caused by lower tonnes mined and higher tonnes treated,
had a negative impact on costs, which was in addition to the inflationary impact on payroll costs.

The Continental Africa region produced 391,000oz at a total cash cost of $718/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 380,000oz at a
total cash cost of $696/oz in the third quarter of 2017. AISC was $834/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to $946/oz in the third quarter
of 2017. Production increased due to the increased production at the Kibali mine by 55% and 10% from Iduapriem, more than offsetting the
decrease in production at Siguiri by 35%.

In the DRC, Kibali produced an attributable 101,000oz at a total cash cost of $510/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 65,000oz at
a total cash cost of $781/oz in the third quarter of 2017. Production increased given higher underground tonnage treated and a one-third
increase in overall grades. Total cash cost decreased by 35% mainly due to higher production, partly offset by inflationary increases and the
increased royalties implemented through the new mining code.

Kibali is on track to exceed its production guidance of 730,000oz for the year, as the operation has met or exceeded designed capacity on
throughput, recovery and hoisting capacity. Kibali has also reached an agreement with the Ministry of Finance on the reimbursement of
outstanding TVA (value added tax), which amounts to $218m in total. The agreement allows for $40m to be paid up-front, while the balance
will be settled on an offset basis. The Ministry has also agreed to exempt local goods and services purchased by Kibali, from TVA.

In Ghana, Iduapriem produced 64,000oz at a total cash cost of $827/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 58,000oz at a total cash
cost of $786/oz for the third quarter of 2017. Production increased by 10% as a result of an 8% increase in recovered grade, due to mining of
marginally higher ore-grade areas and higher recovery in the current period. There was also an increase in tonnage treated, due to continued
improvements in plant reliability and utilisation. Total cash costs, however, increased by 5% mainly due to the higher fuel price, and an increase
in mining costs.

At Obuasi the redevelopment project for recommencing operations continues, with the commencement of production on schedule for the end
of next year.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 151,000oz at a total cash cost of $735/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 152,000oz at a total cash
cost of $586/oz in the third quarter of 2017. A 10% increase in recovered grade, due to higher grade ore from Nyankanga Cut 8 pit and continued
improvements in underground operations, was offset by a 10% decrease in tonnes treated mainly as a result of operational challenges
experienced during the period, including unplanned downtime to repair the ball mill end-plate and primary crusher. Total cash costs increased
due to the higher operational underground mining costs relative to open pit, as well as higher stripping costs, elevated fuel prices, inflationary
pressures and the additional royalties and clearance fees.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 54,000oz at a total cash cost of $823/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 83,000oz at a total cash cost
of $704/oz in the third quarter of 2017. The mine saw a 26% decrease in tonnes treated and lower recoveries due to limited flexibility experienced
during plant stoppages following the integration of the Carbon-In Leach commissioning. Additionally, production was impacted by a 12%
decrease in recovered grade due to treatment of lower-grade stockpiles from the Kozan and Bidini pits, compared to the same period a year
ago when the high-grade Seguelen pit was more prevalent. Total cash costs were higher year-on-year mainly due to the decline in production.
This was partly offset by lower mining activity costs from mining lower volumes and shorter haulage distances, operational excellence initiatives,
and favourable movement in ore stockpiles.

In Mali, Sadiola produced 14,000oz at a total cash cost of $912/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 15,000oz at a total cash cost of
$902/oz in the third quarter of 2017. Production dropped 7% year-on-year primarily due to lower recovered grades. Total cash costs per ounce
produced for the third quarter of 2018 were higher compared to the third quarter of 2017 as a result of greater drawdowns of ore stockpiles.
All-in sustaining costs per ounce sold for the third quarter of 2018 were lower compared to the third quarter of 2017 as a result of lower sustaining

                                                                                                                                                    4
capital expenditures. Mining activity ceased during the second quarter of 2018, while processing of remaining ore stockpiles continued. Morila’s
production was 7,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,180/oz for the third quarter of 2018.

The Australia region produced 148,000oz at a total cash cost of $748/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 143,000oz at a total cash
cost of $825/oz in the third quarter of 2017. AISC for the third quarter of 2018 was $1,082/oz compared to $1,133/oz in the third quarter of
2017.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 61,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,013/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 63,000oz at a total cash
cost of $922/oz during the third quarter of 2017. Production was impacted by 6% lower metallurgical recovery and marginally lower mill
throughput, resulting from anticipated delays to improvements from the ramp-up of the new flotation-fine grind circuit. Commissioning of the
new circuit is now complete, with the High Intensity Grind mill now working to specification, after premature wear issues were addressed.
Higher total cash costs for the period were largely due to the lower gold production.

At Tropicana, production was 87,000oz at a total cash cost of $536/oz for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 80,000oz at a total cash cost
of $686/oz during the third quarter of 2017. Production was boosted by a 5% increase in head grade and a 2% increase in mill throughput.
Installation of the second 6MW ball mill in the Tropicana processing plant has progressed well. Commissioning remains on schedule and is
expected to occur before year end. Increased production and favourable inventory movement contributed to the 22% drop in the total cash
costs for the period.

The South African operations produced 120,000oz at a total cash cost of $894/oz during the third quarter of 2018, compared to 261,000oz
at a total cash cost of $1,088/oz in the third quarter of 2017. Production from retained operations, excluding Moab Khotsong and Kopanang
(both sold) and TauTona (closed), was 3% higher year-on-year, from 117,000oz to 120,000oz.

AISC for the third quarter of 2018 was $1,026/oz, 17% lower compared to $1,240/oz for the third quarter of 2017. Total cash costs decreased
18% year-on-year, from $894/oz in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $1,088/oz in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the restructuring
efforts in the region and the weaker rand relative to the dollar.

Production at Mponeng was up 25% year-on-year, mainly due to higher in-situ reef grade and improved mining practices. Total cash costs
were 17% lower than the same period a year ago. This strong performance at Mponeng was slightly offset by a weaker operating performance
at the Surface Operations which were negatively impacted by volume processed and recoveries (attributed to volume mined from base of
reclaimed TSF). These issues have been systematically addressed and it is expected that recovery improvements will show by the end of the
year.

The Kareerand Tailings Storage Facility expansion, to allow for treatment of tailings in the retained Vaal River operations, is undergoing a
feasibility study expected to be submitted for review in March 2019.

At Mine Waste Solutions, the AachenTM high shear reactor technology for the refractory portion of the feedstock was commissioned in October
and is expected to help to improve recoveries.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Update on wage negotiations in South Africa
AngloGold Ashanti in South Africa reached a three-year wage agreement with all its trade unions, effective from July 2018. The wage agreement
includes wage increases over three years as well as a new shift arrangement with all employee trade unions. The unions are Association of
Mining and Construction Union (AMCU), which represents 48.9% of AngloGold Ashanti’s workforce in South Africa, Solidarity, which represents
3.7% and the UASA Union, which represents 9.4% as well as the National Union of Mineworkers, which represents 32.8%. All employees in
the South Africa region are covered in the signed agreement, including the rest of the employees not affiliated to any trade union, who fall into
the worker categories according to the agreement.

Mponeng reached a new shift arrangement agreement with all the trade unions as part of the safe production strategy to ensure safe work
places and practices and it is expected to result in an improvement in face time and increased operational efficiency. We view the agreement
as an important step in the process to improve productivity and the resulting improvement in remuneration for our employees - particularly
those at the entry level - while providing certainty for three years, as we work to return the South African operations to profitability.

For further details on the agreement see the announcement the Company made on 17 September 2018 on: https://www.anglogoldashanti.com/
investors/announcements/.

Restructuring of the South African Portfolio
The restructuring of the asset portfolio continues in South Africa, focused on protecting the longer-term sustainability of the business by ensuring
that both on- and off-mine cost structures are appropriate for the significantly smaller production base. The Section 189 consultation process,
which envisaged the reduction of about 2,000 jobs from the South African workforce, is complete, with forced job losses mitigated by the sale
of some assets, including healthcare facilities and rail networks in the Vaal River region, and the acceptance of voluntary severance packages
by some employees, resulting in a lower number of forced retrenchments, which will be less than 200 in total, with a further 942 Voluntary
Separations (VSP), and the balance representing the success in securing job loss avoidance measures.

Debt refinance
At the end of October 2018, AngloGold Ashanti signed a new 5-year Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), with a syndicate of 14 banks. The new
RCF is for an amount of US$1.4bn and is a multi-currency facility, allowing for a drawing in A$ in addition to US$, up to a maximum of A$500m.
This new single facility replaces the US$1bn RCF and A$500m RCF put in place in 2014.

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, on 22 August 2018, AngloGold Ashanti announced the
appointment of Alan Ferguson and Jochen Tilk as independent non-executive directors to its board of directors, with effect from1 October 2018
and 1 January 2019, respectively.

PROJECTS UPDATES

Kibali
The Kibali project is now complete with underground mining fully operational. The last major work was on the Azambi hydropower plant which
has been completed and the plant was commissioned in September 2018. Construction work for the next phase of the tailings storage facility,
which was initiated at the end of 2017, is on schedule for completion during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Obuasi
Following receipt of all the requisite Government and environmental approvals in June 2018, redevelopment of the Obuasi high-grade orebody
has started in earnest. Establishment of the project and operating teams is progressing. Detailed design continued and is focused on process
plant critical path procurement and contracts. The contract for demolition of redundant plant has been awarded. Detailed plant refurbishment
planning commenced. Orders for the underground mining fleet were placed and delivery has commenced. The underground mining contract
was awarded in late October to African Mining Alliance LTD, a 70/30 Joint Venture between AUMS and Rocksure International. Preparatory
underground works commenced to facilitate a timely start by the underground contractor. Operational readiness activities commenced with
the design of the mine operating systems. The project is being developed in 2 stages. The first is to achieve production at 2,000tpd with first
gold at the end of 2019. The second phase is to achieve production at 4,000tpd by end 2020.

In terms of the original Obuasi project announcement in February 2018, initial project capital of $450-500m was expected to be spent for the
period until the end of 2020. The additional mining fleet purchase will now add around $45m to the project capital estimate, but is expected to
have a resultant favourable impact on contract rates over the period of the contract and is estimated to improve AISC by approximately $25/ oz.
Given the timing of permit approvals earlier this year, some capital expenditure has moved into 2020. The latest outlook on the spend profile
is 15% - 55% - 30% over the period 2018 through 2020. Production is scheduled to start at the end of next year.

Sadiola Sulphide Project
Agreement with the Government of Mali, on the terms for investment in the Sadiola Sulphide Project, is needed to prevent the mine being
placed on suspended exploitation (care and maintenance), once processing of the stockpiles is complete midway through next year. While
this agreement has not yet been reached, AngloGold Ashanti and IAMGOLD, who collectively own an 82% interest in Sadiola, have initiated
a process to identify third parties that may be interested in acquiring their collective interests in Sadiola. The process is at a very preliminary
stage and there is no certainty of its outcome.

Mponeng Project
Phase 1 and 2
The fatal accident in April at 126 level, impacted on the Ore Reserve Development (ORD) and some of the construction activities. The water
management infrastructure construction is currently behind schedule with the piping installation still outstanding. Construction of ore-handling
infrastructure is complete. Progress on ORD at 126 level also encountered areas with a high geological complexity, which required additional
secondary support, slowing advance rates.

The reef pass between 123 and 126 level has also been delayed due to contractor non-performance. A replacement contractor has been
secured.

Geita Power Plant
The construction of a $43m power plant at our Geita mine has been completed, with the new 40Mw facility producing its first electricity in
August 2018. The world-class plant, built to support the mine’s operations over the long-term, will play a key role in ensuring stable, reliable
energy supply for mining and processing activities at Geita mine. This will not only ensure stable operations for the Geita mine, but also provide
a stable source of power for the extension of the life of the mine. The new energy generating capability is expected to be more efficient with
lower operational and maintenance costs.

Siguiri Combination Project
The Siguiri Combination Project is nearing completion with commissioning of the various phases of construction underway. The combination
plant aims to treat hard and soft ore to optimise efficiencies of the current plant. The current circuit is designed to treat soft oxide which is
currently depleting.

The combination project comprises a crushing plant, milling circuit, Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) plant, an upgrade of the elution circuit and a new
power plant to meet the demands of additional power requirements. The project is at an advanced stage and nearing completion in its execution.
The trash screen and the CIL tanks were commissioned in August, enabling the plant to process transitional material. Additionally, the main
tower crane as well as several belts within the current plant have been completed and commissioned.

Construction of the new mill is complete, which includes the mill feed structure, the cyclone cluster and other elements. The final conveyor
structures have also been installed and the necessary Electrification and Instrumentation (E&I) work for quality assurance purposes is underway.

At the power plant, the necessary performance testing of the new Wartsila engines to determine the readiness of the plant has taken place
and it is expected that the plant will shortly be handed-over by the contractor.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Signs Obuasi Mining Contract with AUMS, Ghana’s Rocksure
(ACCRA – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce finalisation of a
five-year underground mining contract at the Obuasi Re-Development Project with
Underground Mining Alliance Limited (UMA), a joint venture between African Underground
Mining Services (AUMS) and Accra-based Rocksure International, a wholly-owned
Ghanaian mining contractor (""Rocksure"").

The agreement, valued at $375m over 5 years, will help develop mechanised, underground
mining expertise within Ghana’s local mining and engineering sector, given that Rocksure,
which has a strong track record in open-pit mining, will work closely with Australia’s AUMS,
which has significant experience in underground mining. Rocksure will have a 30% stake in
the joint venture and AUMS the balance.
UMA will provide the full suite of underground mining services at Obuasi, with major capital
equipment supplied by AngloGold Ashanti. Works are expected to start in the first quarter of
2019.

In encouraging the creation of the joint venture, AngloGold Ashanti is demonstrating its
commitment to increasing meaningful local participation in the redevelopment of the Obuasi
orebody, which has 5.8Moz of Ore Reserves and 34Moz in Mineral Resource, and will have
an initial mine life of roughly 20 years. Around 550 people, predominantly Ghanaians, will be
employed and trained by the contractors for the duration of the contract term, allowing for
knowledge and skills transfer.

""We’ve worked closely with the Government of Ghana to progress the redevelopment of
Obuasi Gold Mine into a modern, productive operation, making it a key asset in our portfolio
for the long term,"" said AngloGold Ashanti Executive Vice President: Group Planning and
Technical, Graham Ehm. ""This is also an investment in Ghana’s future, particularly in terms
of local procurement, employment, training and development and overall mining capacity
building, which will benefit the region and the economy for decades to come.""
Obuasi, which has been primarily an underground operation, was placed on care and
maintenance in 2016 pending the commencement of the redevelopment project. In June
2018, the Parliament of Ghana ratified the regulatory and fiscal agreements that cover the
redevelopment of the Obuasi Gold Mine and the Environmental Protection Agency issued
environmental permits for the mine.

""Rocksure International is proud to be active participants in the redevelopment of Ghana’s
iconic gold mine, and enable it to benefit Ghana’s economy"" said Rocksure International
CEO, Kwesi Osei Ofori.

With the key permitting and regulatory processes finalised, the finalisation of the mining
services contract is a further key milestone in delivering a modern, mechanised underground
mining operation with a life of more than 20 years.
The Obuasi Re-Development Project remains on track to produce its first gold by the end of
2019.

Obuasi Redevelopment Project – Details
The project implementation will be undertaken in two distinct phases, with stage one
comprising project establishment, mine rehabilitation and development, plant and
infrastructure refurbishment to enable production at a rate of 2,000t per day for the first
operating year. This is expected to take roughly 18 months, with the first gold pour expected
at the end of 2019.

The second phase includes refurbishment of the underground materials handling system,
shafts and ventilation; and construction of the primary crusher, the SAG/Ball circuit, carbon
regeneration, a new gold room and tailings storage facility. This is expected to take a further
12 months and enable the operation to climb to 4,000t per day. The operation is then
expected to ramp up to 5,000t per day, over the following three years.

Mine production for the first 10 years will be focussed on the upper ore bodies and is
expected to average 350,000oz to 450,000oz at an average head grade of 8.1g/t. In the
second 10 years, production averages 400,000oz to 450,000oz. Total cash costs are
expected to average between $590/oz to $680/oz, while All-in Sustaining Costs are
expected to be between $750/oz to $850/oz.

NEWS RELEASE
Kibali Set for Record Third-Quarter on Strong Throughput, Recovery Performance
(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti (the ‘Company’) reports that the
Kibali Gold Mine is expected to deliver a record performance for the third quarter, and is on
track to exceed its guidance for the year, as the operation met or exceeded designed
capacity on throughput, recovery and hoisting capacity.

The mine, a joint venture with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (10%), AngloGold
Ashanti (45%) and Randgold Resources (45% and operator), is trending to outperform its
full-year production guidance of 730,000oz. The joint venture has also reached agreement
with the DRC Ministry of Finance, for the return of outstanding value-added tax (VAT)
refunds.

 “This is an important, tier-one asset for the country at large, and for us, as we work to
improve returns to our shareholders,” AngloGold Ashanti CEO Kelvin Dushnisky said. “It’s
encouraging for us as investors, and for the future development of the DRC’s mining
industry, that Kibali is poised to start returning capital to those who funded the first large-
scale, industrial gold mining project in one of the country’s most remote areas.”
“We’d also like to acknowledge the strong operating performance of our JV partner,
Randgold,” Dushnisky said.

Kibali is now operating at steady state. It has successfully converted from contract- to
owner-mining by an almost-entirely Congolese team, and there is now a strong focus on
exploring for new ore sources, and conversion of resources to reserves. In addition, the
third hydropower plant has been commissioned, marking the first time a Congolese
contractor has completed an industrial-scale power plant. This provides invaluable expertise
to further develop the country’s engineering sector.

Kibali has made a significant contribution to the DRC – about $2.5 billion -- throughout the
seven-year capital investment programme, once taxes, salaries and all payments to local
suppliers are considered. In the third quarter alone, $40 million has been paid to local
contractors and so far this year, $1.3 million has been spent on community development
projects.

Equally encouraging is the accord reached with the DRC Ministry of Finance on VAT refunds,
which will commence with an initial payment of $40 million to the joint venture. The
balance to be offset against future taxes owed. The DRC Ministry of Finance has also
exempted local goods and services, purchased by Kibali, from incurring VAT.

AngloGold Ashanti has invested in improving the quality of its portfolio, through the
development of new mines in Australia and the DRC, and in projects that will extend life and
improve margins at existing operations. The Company has simplified its portfolio, reduced
debt, lowered interest costs and advanced options in its project pipeline. The Company will
release its third-quarter market update on 5 November 2018.

AngloGold Ashanti Reaches Three-Year Deal on SA Wages, New Shift Arrangement

(JOHANNESBURG -- PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to have reached
agreement on wage increases for the next three years, as well as a new shift arrangement
with trade unions representing the majority of its employees in South Africa. The deal,
signed on Monday, 17 September 2018, is another step in an important process to improve
pay for its employees – particularly those at the entry level - while providing certainty as it
works to return its business in the country to profitability.

“We are pleased to have reached this agreement after robust but constructive talks with the
unions who represent most of our employees in South Africa,” Chris Sheppard, AngloGold
Ashanti’s Chief Operating Officer: South Africa, said. “The new shift arrangement is an
important factor, as it provides an opportunity for us to realise improvements in productivity
and Safe Production, which are essential to the long-term sustainability of the business.”

The agreements were signed by the Association of Mining and Construction Union (AMCU),
which represents 48.9% of AngloGold Ashanti’s workforce in South Africa, as well as
Solidarity, which represents 3.7% and the UASA the Union, which represents 9.4%. Talks
are ongoing with the National Union of Mineworkers, which represents 32.8% of AngloGold
Ashanti’s employees in South Africa. Non-union members account for 5.1% of the
Company’s South Africa staff complement.
The agreements on pay and shift arrangements are key pillars in the strategy to complete
the turnaround of the business, which represents around 13% of the Company’s total
production.

The AngloGold Ashanti final agreement with Unions entails the following:

In respect of category 4 – 8 employees:
   o   1st year: R700 increase per month on standard rate plus an additional R300 per month
       in consideration for agreeing to and working the new shift arrangements as envisaged
       in the New Shift Arrangements Agreement. In total, this will result in an increase of the
       standard rate of pay of R1000.
   o   2nd year: R800 increase per month on standard rate plus an additional R200 per month
       in consideration for agreeing to and working the new shift arrangements as envisaged
       in the New Shift Arrangements Agreement. In total, this will result in an increase of the
       standard rate of pay of R1000.
   o   3rd year: R900 per month on standard rate plus an additional R100 per month in
       consideration for agreeing to and working the new shift arrangements as envisaged in
       the New Shift Arrangements Agreement. Altogether, this will result in an increase of
       the standard rate of pay of R1000.

The wage agreement for the Miners & Artisans and Officials comprises 5.5% on the standard
rate with an additional 1% in consideration for agreeing to and working the new shift
arrangements as envisaged in the New Shift Arrangements Agreement. This final offer, which
will result in an increase on the standard monthly rate of 6.5% for the first year, will be carried
through to the second and third years as 6.5% or CPI, whichever is the greater for the balance
of the agreement.

About AngloGold Ashanti South Africa:

the West Wits region and long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings retreatment operation, as
well as the surface rock-dump reclamation operations in the Vaal River region. These assets

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Says First-Half Costs, Earnings, Cash Flow Improve

(PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti said today that a strong production and cost
performance in the first half of this year, as inward investment started to bear fruit, helped
deliver a strong earnings result and allowed the Company to forecast production for 2018 at
the top end of its guided range, and costs at the bottom end.

The Company continued to deliver on its strategy to improve free cash flow and returns by
focusing on improving margins and reinvesting in high-return projects in its existing portfolio.
Productivity rates, up 58% since 2012, continued to improve as the effects of portfolio
restructuring became evident, the brownfields investments started to yield returns, and its
operational efficiency initiatives gained traction.

“We continued to improve our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and increase
productivity, all of which are the cornerstones of our strategy to improve free cash flow and
returns over the long term,” outgoing Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said.
“The business is in good shape - production is strong, costs are improving and our pipeline is
well stocked with options.”

On 1 September 2018, Kelvin Dushnisky, the current President of Barrick Gold Corporation,
will assume the CEO role at the Company.

Adjusted headline earnings were $85m, or 21 US Dollar cents per share, for the first six
months of 2018 versus a loss of $93m, or 23 US Dollar cents per share in the first half of 2017.
Increases in adjusted headline earnings were due mainly to the improved operating
performance and the higher gold price.

Free cash flow improved by $110m to an outflow of $51m in the first six months of 2018 versus
an outflow of $161m in the first six months of last year. Positive free cash flow of $19m was
recorded during the second quarter of 2018.
The Company’s balance sheet also continued to improve, with debt falling, ample liquidity of
around $2 billion, and no near-dated bond maturities. Net debt declined by 17% year-on-year
to $1.786bn at 30 June 2018, from $2.151bn at the same time last year. The ratio of Net debt
to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 June 2018 was 1.12 times, compared to 1.56 times at 30 June
2017, well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under the revolving credit
facilities.

Operating Performance

Total production for the group, including those operations either sold earlier this year or closed
during 2017, was 1.629Moz at a total cash cost of $823/oz for the six months ended 30 June
2018, compared to 1.748Moz at a total cash cost of $796/oz in the first six months of 2017.
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for this set of assets fell 5% to $1,020/oz, versus $1,071/oz in
the first half of 2017.

The International Operations posted another strong performance, achieving a 4% year-on-
year reduction in AISC to $948/oz during the first half of 2018, from $988/oz during the first
half of 2017. This was alongside a 4% increase in production to 1.372Moz, from 1.313Moz.

The sale of the Vaal River underground mines was completed at the end of February 2018,
and the proceeds were immediately applied to reduce debt and further improve balance sheet
flexibility. Brownfields projects remained on track and on budget. The ratification of investment
agreements by Ghana’s Parliament in June 2018 allows for the redevelopment of the high-
grade Obuasi Gold Mine to commence in earnest.


Safety Performance

It is with great sadness that we report three fatalities in the first half of 2018. The South Africa
region suffered two fatal accidents. At Moab Khotsong a tramming accident caused one fatality
and at Mponeng a mechanical loader operator was fatally injured in a seismic fall of ground.

Financial and Operating Report

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW (1)

AngloGold Ashanti continued to deliver on its strategy to improve free cash flow and returns, with a strong first-half operating and financial
result. Production from retained operations increased by 4% year-on-year, which along with good cost control and a higher gold price, helped
drive improvements in earnings and free cash flow. Productivity rates, up 58% from 2012, continued to improve as the effects of portfolio
restructuring became evident, brownfields investments started to yield returns, and operational efficiency initiatives gained traction. Strong
progress on many fronts allowed AngloGold Ashanti to maintain guidance across all metrics with production expected at the top end of the
range and costs trending towards the lower end of the range.

The sale of the Vaal River underground mines was completed at the end of February, and the proceeds were immediately applied to reduce
debt and further improve balance sheet flexibility. Brownfields projects remained on track and on budget. The ratification of investment
agreements by Ghana's Parliament in June 2018 allowed the redevelopment of the high-grade Obuasi Gold Mine to commence in earnest.

""We continued to improve our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and increase productivity, all of which are the cornerstones of our strategy
to improve free cash flow and returns over the long term,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""The business is in good
shape - production is strong, costs are improving and our pipeline is well stocked with options.""

Group Operating Performance

Production from retained operations for the first six months of 2018 (excluding Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona mines) was 1.578Moz
at a total cash cost of $807/oz, compared to 1.517Moz at a total cash cost of $740/oz for the first six months of 2017. All-in sustaining costs
(AISC) for these retained operations were $1,005/oz for the first six months of 2018, compared to $1,030/oz in the same period last year.

The International Operations achieved a 4% year-on-year reduction on AISC to $948/oz during the first half of 2018 from $988/oz during the
first half of 2017, alongside a 4% increase in production to 1.372Moz from 1.313Moz.

Total production for the group, including those operations either sold or closed earlier this year, was 1.629Moz at a total cash cost of $823/oz
for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 1.748Moz at a total cash cost of $796/oz in the first six months of 2017. AISC for this set
of assets fell 5% to $1,020/oz, versus $1,071/oz in the first half of 2017.

There was a $16/oz improvement in group total cash costs from the first to the second quarter of this year, reflecting a positive trend in
performance as the Operational Excellence initiative starts to gain traction. This trend is expected to continue over the remainder of the year
and beyond, as underground production at Kibali continues to ramp up, Sunrise Dam's improving productivity trend continues, Brazil recovers
from minor disruptions related to a nationwide trucker strike during the first half of this year, and South Africa completes its restructuring and
ramp-up at Mponeng's below 120 area.

Group Cash Flow and Earnings

Free cash flow for the six months ended 30 June 2018 improved by $110m to an outflow of $51m from an outflow of $161m in the first six
months of last year. Free cash flow of $19m was recorded during the second quarter of the year. The year-on-year movement in free cash
flow was aided by a higher gold price received, lower capital expenditure and an improved operating performance, and was partially offset by
a reduction in gold sold and the lock-up of $29m indirect taxes in Tanzania ($19m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($10m). The Company
generated $13m of free cash flow before investment of growth capital during the first six months of the year.

The Company reported basic earnings attributable to shareholders of $33m, or 8 US cents per share for the first six months of 2018. This
includes the adverse impact of $66m, or 16 US cents per share (post-tax) related to the impairment of the Mine Waste Solutions Uranium plant
in South Africa, given that, under current market conditions, the plant is unlikely to be utilised. This compared to a loss of $176m, or 43 US
cents per share in the first half of last year, which included impairments on certain South African assets of $86m, or 21 US cents per share
(post tax).

Adjusted headline earnings were $85m, or 21 US cents per share, for the first six months of 2018 versus a loss of $93m, or 23 US cents per
share in the first half of 2017. Increases in adjusted headline earnings were due mainly to the improved operating performance and the higher
gold price received.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) grew 19% to $723m, during the first half of 2018,
compared to $610m in the first half of last year, which included the $63m pre-tax impact from the silicosis class-action law suit settlement 
provision made last year.

Net debt declined by 17% to $1.786bn at 30 June 2018, from $2.151bn at the same time last year. The balance sheet remains robust, with
the $1bn US Dollar RCF undrawn, A$325m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R4.5bn available from the South African 
RCF's and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $215m at 30 June 2018.

The ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of June was  1.12 times, compared to 1.56 times at 30 June 2017. The current Net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA ratio falls well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under the revolving credit facilities, and also below AngloGold
Ashanti's own target of 1.5 times, through the cycle.

(1) Production and financial results from retained operations for the six months ended 30 June 2018 have been presented as part of this financial and corporate
review. Retained operations exclude any results from Moab Khotsong, Kopanang and TauTona and these results have been provided for illustrative purposes only.
This information constitutes pro forma information.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) decreased by 26% from $454m for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to $335m
for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This decrease was largely due to a decrease in capital expenditure in South Africa, the Americas and
in Continental Africa. It is expected that group capital expenditure will increase in the second half of the year relative to the first half, 
in line with past trends, whilst remaining within the guided range.

material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December
2017, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

International operations have delivered a reduction in AISC, reflecting the results of the intensified work on the Operational Excellence initiative.
The Company continued to deliver on its strategic objective to improve the quality of its portfolio, as the higher spending on capital in the last
year has begun to bear fruit. There have been delays in permitting in Brazil, which (although now resolved) are expected to have only a minor
impact on the region's production for the year.

The Continental Africa region posted a strong operating performance, led by higher grades and volumes at Iduapriem, and also at Kibali
where underground production continued to ramp up. Inflationary pressure, dominated by higher fuel prices, led to higher total cash costs
year-on-year of $816/oz, up from $721/oz in the first half of 2017. Quarter-on-quarter production rose 21% to 380,000oz at the end of the
second quarter, compared to 314,000oz in the first quarter, and total cash costs improved quarter-on-quarter to $794/oz, down $48/oz, or 6%
from the first quarter.

In Ghana, Iduapriem produced 126,000oz at a total cash cost of $781/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 107,000oz at
a total cash cost of $847/oz in the same period in 2017. Production increased by 18% as a result of a 7% increase in recovered grade from
mining of marginally higher grade areas and an 11% increase in tonnage treated due to improved plant reliability and utilisation compared to
the previous period. Total cash costs per ounce decreased by 8% mainly due to the higher gold production, partly offset by higher mining costs
from higher volumes mined and increased fuel prices. Obuasi remained in care and maintenance during the period.

In Mali, Morila's production increased by 22% to 15,000oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018 as a result of a 37% increase in recovered
grade as the operation recommenced mining activities in N'tiola pit with access to higher grade ore, compared to tailings treatment in the
previous period. Morila produced 12,000oz in the same period last year. At Sadiola, production was 30,000oz at a total cash cost of $980/oz
for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 31,000oz at a total cash cost of $862/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased
in line with reduced recovered grade as the mine transitions to a stockpile treatment plan, partly offset by a 1% increase in tonnage throughput.
Total cash costs per ounce increased because of stockpile treatment transition costs, full grade ore stockpile utilisation and lower production
compared to the previous period.

In Guinea, at Siguiri, lower planned grades resulted in lower production and higher costs.  In Tanzania, at Geita, the increase in treated
volumes was offset by a 6% drop in recovered grades and additional cost pressures from higher fees and royalties when compared to the
first half of last year. However, Geita's total cash costs remained flat quarter-on-quarter.

In the Americas region, production declined mainly due to lower tonnes treated in Brazil, where operations were impacted by a 10-day trucker
strike in the region.

In Brazil, at AngloGold Ashanti Mineração, production was 11% lower due to lower grades and less tonnes treated. Cuiabá was impacted by
lower tonnages and challenges accessing high-grade areas. Córrego do Sítio was mainly affected by lower grades.

At Serra Grande, production was 55,000oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 57,000oz for the same period last year, due
to lower tonnages mined and treated, partially offset by higher grade. Total cash cost was at $802/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018,
a decrease of 8%, compared to a total cash cost of $876/oz in the same period last year. Such decrease is mainly due to contributions from
the higher grades and the favourable impact of exchange rates, partly offsetting lower volumes, stockpile movements and higher inflation.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia's production and costs remained relatively flat. The operation experienced unfavourable stockpile movements,
due to lower tonnes mined and higher tonnes treated, which was partially ameliorated by lower heap leach costs.  Higher inflation also impacted
costs negatively following the second round of wage negotiations during the period. These negative effects were attenuated by the continued
weakening of the Argentine peso and favourable efficiencies  derived from lower spending on fuel, lubricants, energy, mine contractors,
maintenance services, explosives and spare parts. Higher by-product income due to higher volumes sold was partially offset by the lower
average silver price.

The Australia region produced 306,000oz at a total cash cost of $790/oz, compared to 255,000oz at a total cash cost of $775/oz in the same
period last year. AISC for the first half of 2018 was $1,052/oz compared to $1,083/oz in the first half of last year. The 20% increase in gold
production was largely due to a significant lift in the contribution from Sunrise Dam.

At Sunrise Dam the successful implementation of a strategy to lift mined grade and underground ore production resulted in a 43% increase in
gold production to 153,000oz for the first half of 2018 compared to 107,000oz in the same period last year. The total cash costs decreased by
9% to $888/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018 from $977/oz in the first half of 2017, largely due to the higher gold production. The
Recovery Enhancement Project (REP) at Sunrise Dam, involving the addition of a flotation and ultra-fine circuit, was successfully commissioned
on schedule in June. The REP is expected to deliver an average increase in gold recovery of 8%.

Tropicana's production (70%) was 153,000oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, an increase of 3% compared to the output in the amount of
148,000oz in the same period last year. The total cash costs increased by 14% to $655/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared
to $575/oz in the first half of 2017. The increase in the cash cost was due to a lesser proportion of waste mining being allocated to capital in
the first half of 2018 compared to the corresponding period last year. During the first half of 2018, concrete works were completed for installation
of a second, 6MW ball mill in the Tropicana processing plant. This project is on schedule for completion at the end of 2018.

The South Africa region produced 257,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,152/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 435,000oz
at a total cash cost of $1,092/oz in the same period in 2017. Total cash costs increased 6% year-on-year given inflationary pressure, particularly
in wages, power and consumables, and the negative impact of the exchange rate as the Rand remained stronger against the US Dollar during
the half year.

Production from retained operations (excluding Moab Khotsong and Kopanang which were sold, and TauTona undergoing orderly closure),
was up 1% year-on-year to 206,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,115/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 204,000oz at a
total cash cost of $1,014/oz in the same period in 2017. AISC from the retained operations was $1,269/oz for the first half of 2018, up from
$1,166/oz for the first half of 2017, with the increase attributable mainly to the 10% rise in cash costs year-on-year. The restructuring of the
asset portfolio in South Africa, announced in May 2018, is underway to ensure that both on- and off-mine cost structures are appropriate for
the considerably smaller production base. Discussions with affected employees and their representatives in organised labour are in progress and
are anticipated to be completed in the second half of the year.

Mponeng delivered a 12% production improvement year-on-year at 119,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,147/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2018, compared to 106,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,046/oz in the same period in 2017. The improvement was mainly a result of
a higher reef value and the operation improving mining practices. Total cash costs were 10% higher year-on-year, mainly due to inflationary
increases and the negative impact of the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate.

Surface Operations produced 87,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,061/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 92,000oz at a
total cash cost $970/oz in the same period in 2017. Production at the Vaal River Surface Sources was impacted by the sale of Mispah and
West Gold plants. West Wits Surface Sources' production was down for the first six months of the year as a result of the low-grade areas
reclaimed at the Savuka marginal ore dumps and the tailings storage facilities.

Mine Waste Solutions' production was assisted by significant recovery improvements (four percentage points higher), as the operations reverted
to normal production levels compared to the first half of 2017, which was impacted by significant storms.

The Vaal River operations, which included Moab Khotsong and Kopanang, produced 51,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,307/oz for the six
months ended 30 June 2018, compared to 174,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,003/oz in the same period in 2017. The decrease in production
results from the fact that only two months of contribution from the mines, which were sold on 28 February 2018, have been reflected.

SAFETY UPDATE
It is with great sadness that we report three fatalities in the first half of 2018. The South Africa region suffered two fatal accidents. At
Moab Khotsong a tramming accident caused one fatality and at Mponeng a mechanical loader operator was fatally injured in a seismic fall of
ground. In Brazil there was one fatality following an electricity-related incident. AngloGold Ashanti remains committed to establishing and
adhering to the best safety practices in the industry. The group's All-Injury Frequency Rate, the broadest measure of workplace safety, was
5.6 injuries per million hours worked for the six months ended 30 June 2018, down 31% from the first half of last year and its lowest level in
the Company's history.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Kibali
At Kibali, the underground ore production has now stabilised at planned capacity and the underground materials handling system and ore
hoisting via the shaft is on track to reach name plate capacity. The total underground ore tonnes mined for the first half of the year are 1,686t
(compared to 1,595kt in the same period last year), of which 1,194kt were hoisted (compared to 118kt in the same period last year). In addition,
5km of development was completed from the declines. The third hydropower station at Azambi is still on track for completion in the second
half of 2018. Construction of the next phase of tailings storage facility was initiated at the end of 2017, providing additional capacity for carbon
in leach (CIL) tails and is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018.

Mponeng Phase 1 and 2
Phase 1 was negatively impacted by a fatal accident which occurred on 126 level in April 2018. This fatal accident caused a delay in the ore
reserve development and also had an impact on the construction activities to a lesser extent. Progress on the construction activities was as
follows:

- Water Management Infrastructure - piping installation completed;
- Ore Handling Infrastructure - construction completed with commissioning planned for the third quarter of 2018;
- The reef pass between 123 and 126 level is delayed due to the breakdown on the raiseborer reamer head. This is an additional
  scope to overcome congestion on 123 level tramming;
- The ventilation hole from 116 level to decline 3 was stopped due to repeated non-compliance in accuracy by the contractor. A
  procurement process has been initiated for the replacement of the contractor; and
- Ore Reserve Development at 126 level - encountered slow advance rates in areas of high geological complexity, which require
  additional secondary support.

The Mponeng feasibility study
A technical review was undertaken in the period ended June 2018, resulting in various technical recommendations which include optimising capital 
expenditure, and conducting further studies in the ventilation and tailing storage strategies.

The Technology Innovation project has been scaled down in line with the accelerated closure of the TauTona mine. Work continues to
establish the site for the High Strength Backfill (HSB) plant at Mponeng mine. However, delays were encountered in the development of the
excavation and it is estimated that the plant construction will now commence in third quarter of 2018.

Siguiri Combination Plant
Siguiri is undergoing construction of a new Combination Plant, which is expected to be completed by year end and will allow for the treatment of 
harder rock.  Most of the civil work is nearing completion, which is anticipated by the third quarter of the year. The mill was lifted into position 
and the installation of the secondary and tertiary crushers was completed during the first half of the year. The conversion of the carbon-in-leach tanks 
has been completed. Construction of the new power plant, to meet additional power requirements, will be ready for commercial operations during 
the fourth quarter, as planned.

Obuasi project
In June 2018 the parliament of Ghana ratified the development and fiscal agreement for the redevelopment of Obuasi. After considering the environmental 
impact statements for the project, the EPA issued the permits for the project. Work has started in earnest towards the redevelopment of the Obuasi high-grade 
orebody, including commencement of the recruitment of the project and operating teams. Detailed planning for execution and preparation for early works contracts 
continue, with focus on redeveloping the mine into a modern and mechanised operation. AUMS, through its 70/30 JV with Rocksure International (a Ghanaian mining 
contractor), is the preferred contractor for delivery of underground mining services. Negotiations of the final contract terms and conditions are well advanced 
with an expectation that project works will commence later in 2018.  The joint venture will trade under the name Underground Mining Alliance Limited. The project 
will be developed in two phases; the first phase will enable a production rate of 2,000tpd and first gold is expected in late 2019, while the second phase will 
enable production to be increased to 4,000tpd, approximately 12 months later, toward the end of 2020.

CORPORATE UPDATE

CEO Transition
On 23 July 2018, the Company announced the appointment of Kelvin Dushnisky as chief executive officer (CEO) and an executive director of
the Board of Directors of AngloGold Ashanti, effective 1 September 2018. Mr. Dushnisky, who will relocate to Johannesburg, where AngloGold
Ashanti is based, replaces outgoing CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan (Venkat), who departs at the end of August 2018 for a role at London-
based Vedanta Resources. Venkat will cease to be a member of the Company's Board of Directors with effect from 31 August 2018.

Obuasi Arbitration Proceedings Resolved
The Obuasi mine, operated by AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited, had been the subject of a dispute with the Republic of Ghana since February
2016, when military protection was withdrawn from the mine and the site was being overrun by illegal miners for close to nine months.

The case was registered with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes on 2 May 2016, with the Company filing an urgent
request for provisional measures on 3 June 2016. This request was eventually voluntarily suspended following the gradual restoration of law
and order at the mine under the directive of the Minerals Commission from October 2016 onwards.

AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited proceeded to file a memorial on the merits in April 2017. Shortly thereafter, the parties by mutual agreement
suspended the proceedings in order to explore an amicable resolution to the dispute. The dispute has now been resolved to the parties' mutual
satisfaction and the Company has submitted a request to the Tribunal on 19 July 2018 that the proceedings be discontinued. Further, the
Ghanaian Parliament has ratified a number of regulatory and fiscal agreements with the Company in relation to the redevelopment of the mine
into a modern and mechanised operation, marking an important step for the mine's future.

DRC Mining Code and Regulations amendment
In the DRC, the Mining Code and Regulations have been amended with an updated Mining Code which came into effect on 9 March 2018
(2018 Mining Code) and the related amended Mining Regulations which came into effect on 8 June 2018, although the regulations were only
actually published in July 2018 so have only recently started being enforced. Kibali Goldmines SA is considering all its options to protect its
vested rights under the 2002 Mining Code, as well as the specific state guarantees it previously received, including preparing for international
arbitration. In addition, it continues to engage with the government to find alternative solutions which would be mutually acceptable to both
parties, including through the application of Article 220 of the 2018 Mining Code, which affords benefits to mining companies in landlocked
infrastructurally challenged provinces, such as where Kibali is located.

    Borrowings
    The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing market values at the reporting date which results in
    the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and
    accordingly the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair value.

    Fair Value hierarchy
    
    The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
    
    Level 1:    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
    Level 2:    inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or
                indirectly (derived from prices); and
    Level 3:    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

    Environmental obligations
    
    Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and rehabilitate the
    lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence AngloGold Ashanti is required in some circumstances to
    provide either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or provide guarantees issued by the
    operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or such other government department with responsibility for environmental
    oversight in the respective country to cover the potential environmental rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.
    
    In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are required to
    potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.
    
    In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.065bn and guarantees of ZAR 0.549bn issued by various
    banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 0.771bn. In Australia, since 2014, we have paid into a Mine Rehabilitation Fund
    an amount of AUD $4.2m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $109.8m. At Iduapriem we have provided a bond comprising
    of a cash component of $9.9m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $35.9m issued by Ecobank Ghana Limited and United Bank
    for Africa (Ghana) Ltd for a current carrying value of the liability of $43.4m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising of a cash
    component of $20.3m with a further bank guarantee amounting to $30.0m issued by Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the
    liability of $207m. In some circumstances we may be required to post further bonds in due course which will have a consequential income
    statement charge for the fees charged by the providers of the reclamation bonds.

    Liquidity and capital resources

    To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash resources, cash
    generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

    Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to foreign
    investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In addition,
    distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

    The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that external
    borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to meet the above
    commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that sufficient measures are
    in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

   Litigation claims

   (1)    Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors Limited's
          (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling agreement at Obuasi
          mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation agreement on 8 November 2012.
          On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a demand issued by MBC claiming a total of $97m. In December 2015, the proceedings
          were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC submitted the matter to arbitration. On 12 July 2018,
          the Ghana Arbitration Centre notified AGAG that MBC had appointed an arbitrator and requested that AGAG also nominate an
          arbitrator.
   
   (2)    Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that they
          were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by emission and/
          or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the Pompora Treatment Plant
          (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory infections, skin diseases and certain
          cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions, but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass
          prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On 24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP
          (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on
          grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter
          has been adjourned indefinitely. AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want
          of prosecution. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be
          made for AGAG's obligation in either matter.

  (3)     Litigation - On 19 October 2017, Newmont Mining Co. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
          New York against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties, alleging that AngloGold Ashanti and such parties did not provide
          Newmont with certain information material to its purchase of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company in 2015 during the
          negotiation- and-sale process.  AngloGold Ashanti believes the lawsuit is without merit and continues to vigorously defend against
          it. The matter is proceeding. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable
          estimate can be made for the obligation.

          Tax claims

  (4)     Tax disputes - AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various disputes with tax authorities. These disputes
          involve federal tax assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions, VAT and annual property tax. Collectively, the
          possible amount involved is approximately $21m (2017: $24m).  Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.

  (5)     Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office (DIAN)
          that it disagreed with the Company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income and equity tax returns. On 23
          October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax of $21m
          (2017: $21m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes may amount to $128m
          (2017: $129m). The Company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC subsequently challenged
          the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in March and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca (the trial court for
          tax litigation). Closing arguments on the tax disputes were presented in February and June 2017 and judgement is pending. On
          23 April 2018, the Administrative Tribunal denied AGAC's arguments with respect to the 2011 income tax litigation but reduced the
          fine imposed to $15m. AGAC subsequently appealed this judgment. The Administrative Tribunal may take 12 months or more to
          deliver its decision and if an appeal from either party is sought, a final judgement could take several years. In January 2018, AGAC
          received notice from the DIAN that it also disagreed with AGAC's 2013 income and equity tax returns on the same basis as the
          2010 and 2011 returns. A final assessment is awaited. AGAC will likely challenge this assessment as well by filing a lawsuit before
          the Administrative Tribunal.

  (6)     Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority (AFIP)
          requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of $4m (2017: $6m) relating to the non-deduction of tax
          losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not be considered as
          hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of hedging contracts.
          Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $14m (2017: $21m). CVSA and AFIP have corresponded
          on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are not payable, the government
          continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives. CVSA filed an appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June
          2015, and the parties submitted their final reports in July 2017. The matter is pending with the Tax Court.

  (7)     Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations, which
          have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal studies have
          been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable remediation solutions. The

          (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances. Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials
          and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use of phyto-technologies can address the soil and
          groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable
          estimate can be made for the obligation.
   
  (8)     Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep groundwater
          in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999 to understand this
          potential risk.  In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed solution needs to be a combined
          one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act
          (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department
          of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate
          can be made for the obligation.

16 New and amended standards adopted by the group

   AngloGold Ashanti adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)
   on 1 January 2018.

   The new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period and the group has changed its accounting policies
   and made retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting the standards.

   The impact of the adoption of these standards and the new accounting policies are disclosed below.

   Impact of adoption - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
   
   The adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in the reclassification of by-product revenue in Revenue from product sales where previously
   by-product revenue was recorded as a credit to cost of sales. Revenue from product sales includes gold income and by-product
   revenue. This change in classification results in a corresponding increase in costs of sales, and therefore will not have an impact on
   previously reported gross profit.
                                                                       As reported    IFRS 15      Restated

   In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 15, AngloGold Ashanti has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively to each prior reporting period
   presented in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
   
   The revenue accounting policy applicable from 1 January 2018:
   
   Revenue is recognised when control of the goods passes to the customer and the performance obligations of transferring control have been
   met. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the entity is entitled in exchange for the goods transferred.
   
   Revenue from product sales comprises sales of:
   
   - refined gold;
   - by-products including silver, uranium and sulphuric acid; and
   - dore bars.
   
   Impact of adoption - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
   IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial
   liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
   
   The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the
   financial statements. The new accounting policies are set out below. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative
   figures have not been restated.
   
   The group's financial assets include debt instruments (held to maturity bonds and negotiable certificates of deposit), cash restricted for use
   and cash and cash equivalents which are subject to the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model as they are carried at amortised cost. The accounting
   policy for listed equity investments depends on the nature of the listed investment. Listed equity investments which are held to meet rehabilitation
   liabilities are classified as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) to eliminate accounting mismatch. Listed equity investments held for other
   purposes are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost and
   there is no change in their recognition or presentation under IFRS 9. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on total assets,
   total liabilities or the results of the group.
   
   Equity investments held in the Environmental Trust funds, previously classified as available for sale investments and measured at FVTOCI
   have been reclassified to FVTPL on initial adoption of IFRS 9. Equity investments held for strategic purposes are measured at FVTOCI with
   no recycling of profits or losses on disposal of the investments.
   
   On 1 January 2018 management classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories.
   
   Upon adoption of IFRS 9, available for sale reserve of $43m was transferred to the FVTOCI reserve - $33m and to accumulated losses - $10m
   in respect of equity investments at FVTOCI and FVTPL respectively. Refer statement of changes in equity for reclassifications.
   
   The Financial Instruments accounting policy applicable from 1 January 2018:
   
   Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value when the group becomes a party to their contractual arrangements. Transaction costs
   directly attributable to the instrument's acquisition or issue are included in the initial measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities,
   except financial instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The subsequent measurement of financial instruments
   is dealt with below.
   
   Financial liabilities
   
   Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.
   
   A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. The group also derecognises a
   financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case a new financial
   liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.
   
   Financial assets
   
   On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:
   
   - amortised cost;
   - Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - equity instruments; or
   - FVTPL.
   
   At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs
   that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL, are expensed.
   
   A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
   cash flows and its contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
   amount outstanding. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any
   gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains or losses, together with foreign exchange
   gains or losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment
   that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains or losses in the period in which it
   arises. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the proceeds received or receivable and the carrying amount of the asset
   is included in profit or loss.
   
   Equity instruments
   Listed equity investments which are held to meet rehabilitation liabilities are classified as FVTPL. Listed equity investments held for other
   purposes are classified as FVTOCI.
   
   The group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the group's management has elected to present fair value gains
   and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the
   derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the group's
   right to receive payments is established. Residual values in OCI are reclassified to retained earnings (accumulated losses) on derecognition
   of the related FVTOCI instruments. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains or losses in the statement
   of profit or loss as applicable.
   
   Impairment of financial assets
   
   Financial assets at amortised cost consist of trade receivables, loans, cash and cash equivalents and debt instruments. Impairment losses are
   assessed using the forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. An allowance is recorded for all loans and other debt financial assets
   not held at FVTPL. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Trade
   receivable loss allowances are measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL's. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount
   of the assets. Debt securities that are determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date and bank balances, for which credit risk has
   not increased significantly since initial recognition, are measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.
   
   Impact of IFRS 16 Leases issued but not yet adopted
   
   IFRS 16 Leases, with an effective date of 1 January 2019, is likely to affect future financial reporting and management is still in the process of
   assessing all of the potential consequences arising out of the adoption of this standard. With the removal of the operating lease classification,
   leases that are within the scope of IFRS 16 will result in increases in assets and liabilities. We expect a likely increase in the depreciation
   expense and also an increase in cash flows from operating activities as the lease payments will be recorded as financing outflows in our cash
   flow statement. Management expects that the mining and drilling contracts which are not classified as finance leases under the current accounting
   standards (IAS 17 and IFRIC 4), will potentially have the most impact on the group's results on adoption of IFRS 16.

Non-GAAP disclosure

From time to time AngloGold Ashanti Limited may publicly disclose certain ""Non-GAAP"" financial measures in the course of its financial
presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. Set out below are measures extracted from financial information
regularly presented to the Chief Operating Decision maker (the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee).

The group uses certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in managing the business and may provide users of this financial
information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. The Non-GAAP financial
measures are used to adjust for fair value movements on the convertible bonds as well as the highly volatile marked-to-market movements
on unrealised non-hedge derivatives and other commodity contracts, which can only be measured with certainty on settlement of the contracts.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or any other measure
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures that other companies use.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry,
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, productivity improvements, growth prospects
and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations
of certain of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti's liquidity and capital
resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-
looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti's operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result
of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other
government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational
risk management. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual reports on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These
factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other
unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or
any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Sees Gains in FTSE/JSE Responsible Investment Index Position

(JOHANNESBURG) -- AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to advise that it has been ranked
amongst the top performers in the FTSE/JSE Responsible Investment Index Series (the “Index
Series”) for 2018, improving its score by 31% since the last ranking.

The Index Series, which has replaced the JSE’s Socially Responsible Investment Index, offers
an objective methodology to promote greater transparency by companies with respect to their
environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. This allows investors to better
integrate ESG considerations into their own investment decisions, assisting in ensuring that
their portfolio holdings comply with best practise in each area.

AngloGold Ashanti scored an overall rating of 4.2, compared to the 3.2 achieved last year, out
of a maximum achievable score of 5. This was significantly above the average of 3 for the
gold-mining sector, and the 2.5 for the basic materials’ sector as a whole. The Company
scored 4.2 for its environmental performance, 4 for its social performance, and 4.6 for
governance.

“Mining is by its very nature an invasive activity, so it’s crucial to devote significant time, energy
and resources to improving our performance with respect to each of the key ESG areas,” said
AngloGold Ashanti’s CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan. “While our ranking in the Index Series
is an important milestone, we realise there remains much for us to do on this journey, and we
remain committed to doing our utmost not only for the sustainability of our business, but for
the countries, communities and environments in which we operate.”

The Company achieved a perfect score of 5 in some key areas, notably its performance on
biodiversity, climate change, water use, human rights & community, anti-corruption and
corporate governance. At 3.5%, AngloGold Ashanti has the fifth-largest weighting in the 32-
member index, which includes a range of companies from banks and healthcare groups, to
retailers and telecommunication providers.

AngloGold Ashanti continues to strive toward creating a sustainable gold mining business,
characterised by safe work practises that promote the interests of all stakeholders including
the communities and countries in which we operate. Particular focus continues to be placed
on ensuring that we have the commitment and expertise to continue improving the
performance of the Company in the fields of environmental stewardship, human rights,
economic development, and health and safety.

The Index Series measures the performance of companies across the globe against best
practice ESG practices and performance metrics. Companies eligible for the FTSE/JSE
Responsible Investment Index Series are those that are constituents of the FTSE/JSE
Shareholder Weighted All Share Index and are also listed in the FTSE All World Index.

NEWS RELEASE

ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED
30 JUNE 2018

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the half year ended 30 June 2018 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 20 August 2018.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading
statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that financial results for the next reporting
period will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous, corresponding reporting period.

Operational performance

Production from retained operations (excluding closed and sold operations) for the period is expected
to increase by 4% to 1.578 Moz from 1.517 Moz for the half year ended 30 June 2017 (“comparative
period”). This is due to strong production improvements from Sunrise Dam, Kibali, Iduapriem, Mponeng
and Tropicana. International operations contributed 87% and South African operations 13%
respectively to the Group’s production from retained operations.

Given the sale of Moab Khotsong and Kopanang mines in the first quarter of 2018, and the closure of
TauTona at the end of last year, which together resulted in a net year on year reduction of 180,000oz,
production for the period is expected to be 1.629 Moz, compared to 1.748 Moz in the comparative
period.


Expected headline and basic earnings

The Company expects to report positive basic and headline earnings for the six months ended 30 June
2018. This represents a turn-around from the losses reported for the comparative period.

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings for the
period are expected to increase to a profit of between $91 million and $108 million, with headline
earnings per share of between 22 cents and 26 cents. Headline loss and headline loss per share for
the comparative period were $89 million and 22 cents, respectively.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to increase to a profit of between $16 million and $51 million,
with basic earnings per share between 4 cents and 12 cents. This includes the adverse impact of $67
million, or 16 cents per share (post-tax) related to the derecognition of the Mine Waste Solutions
Uranium plant in South Africa, given that, under current market conditions, the plant is unlikely to be
utilised. Impairments on certain South African assets of $86 million (post-tax) or 21 cents per share
were accounted for in the comparative period. Both the asset derecognition and the impairments, are
non-cash items and have been excluded from headline earnings.

Basic loss and basic loss per share for the comparative period were $176 million and 43 cents,
respectively.

Expected increases in both basic and headline earnings for the period were due to:
    - An improved operating performance, reflected in the 4% improvement in production from
      retained operations;
    - An improvement in All-in sustaining costs due to lower sustaining capital expenditure, and
      lower exploration and rehabilitation costs;
    - A 6% improvement in the average gold price received;
    - Lower retrenchment costs, relating to the South African operations, of $22 million (post-tax),
      which were $25 million (post-tax) or 6 cents per share lower than the comparative period; and
    - Earnings in the comparative period unfavourably impacted by the estimated once-off, non-
      cash settlement costs for silicosis class action claims, of $46 million (post-tax), or 11 cents per
      share.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

AngloGold Ashanti Sees Significant Step Change Improvement at Sunrise Dam

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) --- AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to report that the commissioning
of the Recovery Enhancement Project at its Sunrise Dam Gold Mine in Western Australia was
successfully completed on time at the end of June 2018, cementing the next step in the mine’s
renaissance.

Development of the large, high-grade Vogue orebody at Sunrise Dam Gold Mine is now underway,
which along with improved recoveries, increased mining volumes and a range of productivity
enhancements, is expected to result in an increase in production of around 25%, to about 300,000
ounces in 2018. AngloGold Ashanti will today map out the plan to sustain long-term production from
the mine at 300,000 – 350,000 ounces a year, with all-in sustaining cost trending toward $900/oz in
coming years, making this one of Australia’s most important gold mines and a cornerstone asset for
the group.

“With a combination of innovation, strict capital discipline and incremental investment, we will see a
significant step up in production and a reduction in our all-in-sustaining costs over time,” said Mike
Erickson, AngloGold Ashanti’s Senior Vice President for Australia, said. “We are on an exciting
improvement pathway at Sunrise Dam Gold Mine which will enable us to optimise the development
world-class orebody and achieve sustainable cash margins over the life of mine.”

AngloGold Ashanti continues to prize strict capital discipline and high-return projects with relatively
low capital expenditure, as it executes on its strategy to improve free cash flow generation and returns
over time.

A presentation about the impact of the new flotation/fine grind circuit along with the evolution of the
mining and exploration strategy at the operation will be delivered in a webcast by AngloGold Ashanti
SVP Australia, Michael Erickson at 1pm, Johannesburg time, today, 5 July 2018.

AngloGold Ashanti Says Ghana Parliament Ratifies Obuasi Agreements

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to advise that the
Parliament of Ghana yesterday ratified the regulatory and fiscal agreements that cover the
redevelopment of the Obuasi Gold Mine into a modern, productive mining operation.
The ratification of the Development Agreement and the Tax Concession Agreement is an
important step in progressing Obuasi’s redevelopment. The environmental permitting process
is also at an advanced stage. The Board of Directors of AngloGold Ashanti had approved
spending of $31m in February 2018, for front-end engineering and other preparatory work for
the mine’s redevelopment, which is continuing.

“This is an important milestone that follows extensive negotiations and debate,” AngloGold
Ashanti Chief Executive Officer, Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said. “Obuasi is a high-grade,
long-life ore body that will provide production for at least two decades at a very competitive
cost, which will benefit a truly diverse set of stakeholders.”

“We’d like to extend special thanks to His Excellency, President Nana Akufo-Addo, the
Honourable Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, John-Peter Amewu, Minister of
Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, their respective Deputy Ministers and their teams, for providing
leadership that produced an equitable outcome to benefit the national, regional and local
economies,” Venkat said.

NEWS RELEASE
DEALING IN SECURITIES BY AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI LIMITED

In terms of JSE Listings Requirement 3.63, AngloGold Ashanti gives notice that an executive director has
dealt in ordinary shares of the Company, after having received clearance to do so in terms of JSE Listings
Requirement 3.66.

The resignation of AngloGold Ashanti Chief Executive Officer Mr Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan was
announced on 16 April 2018, as well as his intention to remain in his role until 30 August 2018. In terms of
the rules of the AngloGold Ashanti share incentive plans, all share awards granted to an employee lapse if
not exercised by the date of the employee’s departure from the company.

During 2014 and 2015, Mr Venkatakrishnan opted to convert his 2013 cash retention bonus and 2014 Bonus
Share Plan cash bonus on a pre-tax basis into AngloGold Ashanti shares which resulted in the conversion of
118,428 AngloGold Ashanti shares. These shares were restricted until retirement, or resignation, or
termination of employment, or any corporate activity resulting in a change of control or death, whichever
came first (“the Restricted Shares”). As Mr Venkatakrishnan has now resigned the restriction has been lifted
and he is able to take ownership of the Restricted Shares. A portion of the Restricted Shares has been sold
to cover the tax liability as detailed below.

In advance of his scheduled departure from AngloGold Ashanti, Mr Venkatakrishnan has, therefore, opted
to:
-   exercise all categories of vested share awards granted to him since 2010 (“Vested Share Awards”)
    (499,469 AngloGold Ashanti shares); and
-   sell sufficient AngloGold Ashanti shares to cover his tax costs in respect of the exercise of the Vested
    Share Awards and the Restricted Shares (279,073 AngloGold Ashanti shares)

The net impact resulting from the transactions above is that Mr Venkatakrishnan will retain 463,203
AngloGold Ashanti shares (including the balance of the Restricted Shares after the disposal to settle the
relevant tax costs and AngloGold Ashanti shares held in his personal portfolio), which he will continue to
own as an investment. Mr Venkatakrishnan will forfeit all share awards that have not yet vested.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Posts Strong Q1 Cost, Production Performance; Net Debt Falls

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti posted a strong first-quarter
performance, with lower debt and improvements in both production and all-in sustaining
costs, driving wider margins and stronger cash flows. The Australian operations were the
standout performers.

Production of 824,000oz at all-in sustaining cost of $1,029/oz in the three months through 31
March, compared with 830,000oz at AISC of $1,060/oz in the first quarter of last year.
Production was little changed despite TauTona undergoing orderly closure and the sales of
Moab Khotsong and Kopanang concluding a month before the end of the quarter. Looking
only at retained operations (operations excluding closed and sold operations), production
rose 6% to 773,000oz at an AISC of $1,002/oz, representing a margin of 25% to the gold
price received for the period.

“Our hard work in restructuring the business to focus on portfolio quality is starting to bear
fruit as our operations are demonstrating strong, consistent results,” Chief Executive
Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said. “The core portfolio is performing well, the
balance sheet is solid, our projects are on schedule and we see good potential for further
efficiencies in both our International and South African Operations.”

AngloGold Ashanti has restructured its portfolio to focus on higher-margin, longer-life assets,
while investing in a series of brownfield projects with strong return profiles. The company
has focused on tight cost control and disciplined capital allocation across its portfolio, which
now has about 87% of production from its International Operations.
With roughly a quarter of the full year’s guided production delivered in the seasonally weak
first quarter, AngloGold Ashanti remains on track to meet its annual production, cost and
capital guidance.

Production at the International Operations increased 5% year-on-year to 666,000oz, with
AISC improving further to $950/oz from $963/oz in the first quarter of last year, as the
continued focus on operating efficiencies gains momentum. Standout performers include
Sunrise Dam in Australia which recorded a 54% increase in production, and Tropicana,
Kibali, Iduapriem and Serra Grande.

In South Africa, the smaller and more focused footprint delivered an encouraging
performance as production from Mponeng increased 29%, while rand-denominated all-in
sustaining costs fell 14%. Restructuring of the asset portfolio in South Africa is still underway
to ensure that both the on- and off-mine cost structures are appropriate for the size of the
smaller production base in the country.

BALANCE SHEET
Cash generation from retained operations remained strong despite the smaller asset base,
with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA)
rising 21%, from $316m to $382m.

The Company further improved its balance sheet after applying asset-sale proceeds to
reduce South Africa debt. Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.14 times, down from
1.35 times at the end of 2017. Net Debt at 31 March was $1.77bn, compared with $2.05bn
at the end of March last year.


SAFETY UPDATE
Regrettably, two fatalities were recorded during the quarter. South Africa region suffered
one fatality following a tramming accident at Moab Khotsong, and an electricity-related
fatality occurred in Brazil. These incidents are a reminder of the importance of adhering to
our safety standards.

The group All-Injury Frequency Rate, the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 6.35
injuries per million hours worked for the period, down 28% from the first quarter of last year
demonstrating improvement for the fourth consecutive quarter. Sadiola and Geita passed the
quarter without a single injury, demonstrating the potential possible when there is strong
oversight and compliance to world-class standards.

Despite these setbacks, the Company remains focused on this critical area of our business
and concerted efforts are underway to not only understand the cause of each of these
incidents, but also the root cause of other high potential incidents that could have resulted in
fatalities.

Outlook*
Full- year guidance remains unchanged as follows:

     -      Production is estimated to be between 3.325Moz and 3.450Moz;
     -      Total cash costs are between $770/oz and $830/oz; and
     -      AISC between $990/oz and $1,060/oz, assuming average exchange rates against
            the US dollar of 12.79ZAR (Rand), 3.20BRL (Brazil Real), 0.78AUD (Aus$) and
            19.61ARS (Argentina Peso), with the Brent Crude oil price at $62/bbl average for the
            year. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $800m and $920m.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

First quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti recorded an exceptionally strong start to the year as all key operations delivered solid performances in the three
months ended 31 March 2018. The company continued to deliver on its strategic objectives, with its planned drop in capital
expenditure, continued focus on efficiency and steps to improve the overall quality of its portfolio and balance sheet, all coming
together to deliver another strong operational and financial result.

Cash inflow from operating activities rose 13% to $117m underscoring the quality of the operations remaining after the divestments and
closures. The strategic inward investment programme continues, with a focus on medium-to-long term operating improvements, as
well as the ongoing prioritisation of cost management and the disciplined allocation of capital, all aimed at delivering sustainable free
cash flow improvements and returns through the cycle.

With roughly a quarter of the full-year's guided production* delivered during the seasonally weaker first quarter, notwithstanding the 
sale of Vaal River assets concluding a month earlier than planned, the group remains on track to meet annual production guidance of between 
3.325Moz and 3.450Moz for 2018. Guidance on all other cost and capital expenditure metrics also remains unchanged.

""Our hard work in restructuring the business to focus on portfolio quality is starting to bear fruit as our operations are demonstrating
strong, consistent results,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said. ""The core portfolio is performing well, the
balance sheet is solid, our projects are on schedule and we see good potential for further efficiencies in both our International and
South African Operations.""

Production was 824,000oz at an average total cash cost of $834/oz, compared to 830,000oz at $813/oz in the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in cash costs was driven largely by a 10% strengthening year-on-year of the South African rand versus the US dollar,
a 4% strengthening of the Australian dollar versus the US dollar over the same period and inflation. These cost increases have been
largely offset by the improved production performance and the closure and sale of loss-making operations. Gold production from
retained operations was up 6% to 773,000oz from 726,000oz a year ago.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the period improved to $1,029/oz compared to $1,060/oz in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the
anticipated decline in sustaining capital expenditure. AISC from retained operations for the period was $1,002/oz, a 25% margin to
the average gold price received for the quarter. All-in costs for the period also improved by 3% to $1,105/oz compared to $1,137/oz in
the first quarter of 2017.

Looking only at retained operations, that is, excluding the assets sold (Moab Khotsong and Kopanang) and undergoing orderly
closure (TauTona), the performance was strong for the quarter, with production up 6% year-on-year, from 726,000oz to 773,000oz.
AISC from retained operations were marginally lower at $1,002/oz, compared with $1,007/oz in the first quarter of last year.
Importantly, the cash generation from retained operations remained strong despite the smaller asset base, with adjusted earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) rising 21%, from $316m to $382m.

As anticipated, last year saw increased investment of sustaining capital used to build a new power plant at Geita, advancements in
the underground development at Geita and Kibali, initiation of the cutback at the Teberebie pit at Iduapriem, increased ore-reserve
development to improve flexibility at Cuiabá in Brazil, and for a collection of other activities aimed at improving margins and/or mine
lives, across the asset portfolio.

First quarter production from the International Operations increased 5% to 666,000oz at a total cash cost of $768/oz, compared
to 632,000oz at $714/oz in the corresponding period last year. This strong production result reflects a particularly positive performance
from Sunrise Dam which saw a 54% increase in production, triggered by a boost in underground grades and higher throughput of
underground material. AISC of the International Operations dropped to $950/oz from $963/oz during the first quarter of last year,
notwithstanding the effects of inflation, higher oil prices and stronger currencies in some key jurisdictions, notably Australia.

The remaining South African assets also delivered a promising performance in the first quarter as production increased from both
Mponeng and the Surface Operations. Restructuring of the asset portfolio in South Africa is still underway to ensure that both the on-
and off-mine cost structures are appropriate for the size of the smaller production base in the country, following the completion of
asset sales at the end of February, and the orderly closure of TauTona.

Key projects in the International portfolio,  remain on track and on budget. The Siguiri Combination Plant is on schedule for completion 
before the end of this year. A project to increase the plant throughput at Tropicana to 8.1Mtpa, from a current 7.4Mtpa (100%), along with 
a 3% improvement in recovery, with attractive returns and a payback of only 12 months, is also slated for completion by the end of the year. 
At Sunrise Dam, a recovery enhancement initiative is underway with completion also targeted during 2018. The new power plant at Geita is
almost ready for operation with ""no-load"" tests completed successfully.

The company further improved its balance sheet, with Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.14 times, down from 1.35 times at the end
of 2017. Net Debt at 31 March was $1.77bn, compared with $2.05bn at the end of March last year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by
22% to $383m, compared with $314m in the first quarter of 2017.

Cash inflow from operating activities during the first quarter of 2018 was $117m compared with $93m in the same period last year,
supported by a higher gold price and partially offset by higher operating costs over the same period.

Free cash outflow for the period was $70m, compared to the $119m reported in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting higher prices
received, lower capital expenditure and improved operating performance, partly offset by $36m of retrenchment costs related to
Kopanang and the lock-up of $19m in indirect taxes in Tanzania ($14m) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ($5m).
Excluding the Kopanang retrenchment costs of $36m, VAT lockups of $19m and a receivable from Harmony Gold of $15m which was 
received a few days after quarter end, free cash flow would have been break even. Free cash outflow during the quarter, before 
growth capital, was $41m, a $48m improvement compared with the same quarter the year before. The asset sale proceeds from 
Moab Khotsong and Kopanang are not included in free cash flow.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) during the quarter was $169m, compared with $216m in the first quarter
of 2017. Total capital expenditure included project capital expenditure of $29m. Both production and capital expenditure are expected
to increase in the remaining three quarters of the year, in line with historical seasonal trends.

The full-year guidance* remains unchanged as follows:

 -Production between 3.325Moz to 3.45Moz

 -Total cash costs between $770/oz and $830/oz and

 -AISC between $990/oz and $1,060/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of 12.79ZAR (Rand), 3.20BRL
(Brazil Real), 0.78AUD (Aus$) and 19.61ARS (Argentina Peso), with the Brent crude oil price at $62/bbl average for the year. 
Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $800m and $920m.

* Both production and cost estimates assume no labour or other interruptions, or changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines and  
have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our 
future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

Safety Update
Regrettably, two fatalities were recorded in the quarter ended 31 March 2018; South Africa region suffered one fatality following a
tramming accident at Moab Khotsong, and an electricity-related fatality occurred in Brazil. These incidents are a reminder of the
importance of adhering to safety standards.

The group All-Injury Frequency Rate, the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 6.35 injuries per million hours worked for the
period, down 28% from the first quarter of last year demonstrating improvement for the fourth consecutive quarter.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations produced 158,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,131/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2018, compared
to 198,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,158/oz in the first quarter of 2017. Production decreased, reflecting no contribution from
TauTona following cessation of mining on 15 September 2017, and only two months of contribution in respect of Kopanang and
Moab Khotsong following their sale. AngloGold Ashanti ceased to have underground mining operations in the Vaal River area from
the end of February, but has retained the long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings retreatment operation, as well as the short-life
surface rock-dump reclamation operations treated through the Kopanang gold plant.

South Africa's AISC for the first quarter ended at $1,292/oz, compared to $1,327/oz in the same quarter a year ago, emphasising
the importance of the rationalisation of the region's cost base in line with the smaller operating footprint. Total cash costs increased
2% year-on-year as a result of a lower gold output and the negative impact of the exchange rate as the rand remained strong against
the dollar during the quarter.

At Mponeng, production for the quarter increased 29% to 62,000oz as a result of adopting better-quality mining practices and an
improved mining mix compared to a poor first quarter last year.

The Vaal River operations produced 51,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,307/oz, compared to 74,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,120/oz
in the same quarter a year ago. As mentioned above, the sale of the underground mining assets was completed at the end of
February.

Surface Operations' production for the first quarter of 2018 was 45,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,021/oz, compared to 43,000oz at
a total cash cost of $999/oz in the same quarter a year ago. Production at Mine Waste Solutions improved by 17% as the operations
reverted to usual production levels when compared to the first quarter of last year which was impacted by significant storm events, 
which resulted in the stoppage of the Kareerand tailings storage facility for some time in February 2017 to allow for responsible 
reticulation of the rain water. However, production was assisted by significant recovery improvements. Production at Vaal River 
Surface Sources declined given the lack of activity from the Mispah and West Gold Plants, post their sale. West Wits Surface Sources, 
however, delivered increased production during the quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, including tonnes from marginal ore dumps.

The Continental Africa region's production was flat year-on-year at 314,000oz. Total cash cost was $842/oz compared to a total cash
cost of $759/oz in the first quarter of 2017. AISC for the first quarter of 2018 was $963/oz compared to $939/oz in the same quarter a
year ago.

In the DRC, Kibali's production increased by 22% to 77,000oz at a total cash cost of $765/oz compared to 63,000oz at a total cash
cost of $881/oz for the same quarter in 2017. The production increase was driven by a 4% increase in tonnage treated, a 6% increase
in overall plant recovery on commissioning of the new ultra-fine grind mills, and ramp up of the underground operation providing
higher-grade underground production. Total cash costs consequently decreased by 13% for the quarter mainly due to higher
production, partly offset by higher stockpile utilisation cost.

In Ghana, Iduapriem production increased by 16% to 57,000oz at a total cash cost of $820/oz compared to 49,000oz at a total cash
cost of $920/oz for the same quarter in 2017. Production gains were driven by a 14% increase in tonnage treated due to improved
plant utilisation compared to the same quarter last year and a 2% increase in recovered grade from mining of marginally higher grade
areas in the current period. The 11% decrease in total cash costs is mainly attributable to the higher gold production and ore stockpile
tonnes mined, partly offset by increased volumes mined at a higher fuel price. Obuasi remained in care and maintenance phase during
the quarter whilst awaiting the parliamentary ratification, by the Ghana government, of the fiscal, development and security agreements
for its redevelopment.

In the Republic of Guinea, Siguiri's production was 60,000oz at a total cash cost of $833/oz compared to 75,000oz at a total cash cost
of $695/oz for the same quarter in 2017. Production decreased as a result of a planned 21% decrease in recovered grade from mining
lower grade areas in the current period, partly offset by a 1% increase in tonnes treated.

In Mali, Morila's production was 7,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,020/oz compared to 5,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,027/oz for
the same quarter in 2017. The increased production followed an increase in recovered grade as the operation continued limited mining
activities in the Domba pit with access to higher grade ore, partly offset by a 13% decrease in tonnes treated as a result of treating
mined ore compared to softer tailings treatment in the previous period. Total cash costs decreased by 1% relative to the same quarter
in 2017 as a result of the higher production partially offset by the higher mining activity cost.

Sadiola produced 15,000oz at a total cash cost of $949/oz compared to 16,000oz at a total cash cost of $971/oz for the same quarter
in 2017. Production was impacted by a 3% decrease in tonnage throughput and a 5% decrease in recovered grade as flexibility in the
oxide mining operations continue to diminish. Total cash costs however decreased by 2% given the changes in stockpile utilisation
relative to the same quarter last year.

In Tanzania, Geita's production was 99,000oz at a total cash cost of $892/oz compared to 105,000oz at a total cash cost of $615/oz
for the same quarter in 2017. Production decreased because of a 6% decrease in recovered grade due to mining of lower open-pit
grades compared to the previous period, partly offset by higher underground grades as the transition to the underground operation
continues. Total cash costs increased as a result of the lower production and higher initial underground mining cost.

Production in the Americas region remained flat at 191,000oz at a total cash cost of $657/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2018
compared to a total cash cost of $631/oz in the first quarter of 2017. AISC for the first quarter of 2018 was $843/oz compared to
$954/oz in the same quarter a year ago.

In Brazil, production was 125,000oz at a total cash cost of $724/oz in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 124,000oz at a total cash
cost of $690/oz for the same quarter in 2017. AISC for the first quarter of 2018 was $924/oz compared to $1,024/oz in the same
quarter a year ago. Despite steady production, total cash costs were higher when compared to same period last year, impacted by
inflationary pressures, particularly higher power prices and labour costs, and partially offset by a favourable exchange rate.

Production at AngloGold Ashanti Mineração was 93,000oz at a total cash cost of $709/oz compared to 95,000oz at a total cash cost
of $628/oz in the same quarter last year. Despite increased production from the CdS complex, in line with changes in the mining plan,
production at Mineração was lower due to a decreased contribution from the Cuiabá complex. Total cash costs are higher year-on-
year due to lower grades, higher costs of spares and equipment, inflationary increases on labour and services, partly offset by
favourable exchange rate movements.

Serra Grande's production was 32,000oz at a total cash cost of $770/oz compared to 29,000oz at a total cash cost of $891/oz in the
same quarter last year. The 10% increase in production for the period was mainly due to higher feed grades and recoveries supported
by the good performance in crushing, milling and leaching areas. Total cash costs were 14% lower compared to the same quarter last
year due to increased production and a weaker exchange rate, partially offset by increased inflation.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 66,000oz at a total cash cost of $543/oz compared to 67,000oz at a total cash cost of
$533/oz in the same quarter last year. Production was slightly lower mainly because of lower planned grades, while silver production
increased 24% year-on-year due to higher sliver grades and recovery improvements. Total cash costs were higher mainly as a result
of unfavorable stockpile movements due to higher tonnes treated and inflation, reflecting annual salary increases following the
completion of the second round of negotiations in October 2017.

The Australia region produced 161,000oz at a total cash cost of $755/oz for the first quarter of 2018, 27% up from 127,000oz at a
total cash cost of $734/oz in the first quarter of 2017. AISC for the first quarter was $1,046/oz, compared to $1,045/oz in the same
quarter a year ago. Costs in the region were negatively impacted by a 4% stronger Australian dollar to the US dollar.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 88,000oz at a total cash cost of $782/oz compared to 57,000oz at a total cash cost of $885/oz in the
same quarter last year. The 54% increase in gold production reflected successful implementation of the new mining strategy, which
resulted in a significant lift in mined grade, as well as Operational Excellence improvements. Production also benefited from a draw-
down of gold-in-circuit. The higher production contributed to a 12% drop in the total cash costs. Construction of the Recovery
Enhancement Project is on time and on budget.

Tropicana produced 73,000oz at a total cash cost of $661/oz compared to 70,000oz at a total cash cost of $550/oz in the same quarter
last year. Production was boosted mainly by draw-downs in gold-in-circuit which offset the impact of weather-related mining delays.
Despite higher volumes, total cash costs increased due to unfavourable inventory movements and a reduction in the waste mining
costs capitalised.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Update on Company Leadership Change and CEO Search
On 16 April 2018, AngloGold Ashanti announced the resignation of Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan (Venkat), who after 18 years with the
Company, with the last five years as Chief Executive Officer, has accepted an offer to become CEO of Vedanta Resources Plc, the
diversified resources group. Venkat will remain in his current role until 30 August 2018. A global search for the new CEO is underway,
with a sub-committee of the Board formed to evaluate internal and external candidates. It is the Board's intention that a successor will
have been identified before Venkat's departure.

Commenting on the search and AngloGold Ashanti's strategy, Chairman Sipho Pityana said: ""We remain steadfast in our commitment
to building a self-sustaining gold company in a disciplined fashion, with tight capital control, uncompromising focus on the creation of
long-term value and the highest ethical standards. The Board will search globally for a candidate with the requisite experience and
breadth of expertise, who will be committed to maintaining the discipline and value focus that has become a hallmark of this
business.""

Legislation changes in Tanzania
In July 2017, AngloGold Ashanti noted the enactment by the Republic of Tanzania's Parliament and publication in the Country's official
Government Gazette of three pieces of new legislation that purport to make a number of changes to the operating environment for
Tanzania's extractive industries, including those in its mining, and oil and gas sectors. For more detail on the legislation, please see
https://thevault.exchange/?get_group_doc=143/1501167539-PR20170713Geita.pdf. On 10 January 2018, the Government of
Tanzania published its new Mining Regulations, 2018, which contain, amongst others, the implementation provisions of the amended
Mining Act. AngloGold Ashanti's subsidiaries are seeking a constructive dialogue with the Government of Tanzania, to gain
assurances that the Geita Gold Mine in Tanzania will not be affected by these legal and fiscal changes, given the Mine Development
Agreements which guarantee fiscal and regulatory stability as well as agreement between all parties before material legal and
regulatory changes are made. In these circumstances, the company's subsidiaries have, however, had no choice but to take the
precautionary step of safeguarding its interests by commencing international arbitration proceedings as first announced in July 2017.
AngloGold Ashanti has, throughout this period, sought constructive dialogue with the Government of Tanzania, which has indicated
its willingness to engage. The parties will work toward a mutually agreeable time for those discussions to take place.

DRC regulatory update
The DRC has recently announced a new mining code that purports to make a number of changes to the operating environment for
the DRC's extractive industries, including those in its mining, and oil and gas sectors. These changes may impact on the protections
enjoyed by AngloGold Ashanti's joint venture (the Kibali gold project), located in north-eastern DRC. The project is operated by
Randgold Resources and is owned by Randgold Resources (45%), AngloGold Ashanti (45%) and Société Minière de Kilo-Moto SA
(SOKIMO) (10%). Engagement is currently ongoing between mining industry representatives in the DRC and the country's Ministry of
Mines, ahead of the publication of the Regulations that will govern the implementation of the new mining code, to address concerns 
about the recently revised mining code, in particular, the protection to be afforded to title holders benefiting from a 10-year stability 
under the 2002 Mining Code.  These representatives comprise more than 85% of the DRC's copper, cobalt and gold production and most 
significant development projects. Please refer to the press release of 29 March 2018, titled ""Mining industry submits code proposal to 
DRC Government"" on www.anglogoldashanti.com.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS
Mponeng Phase 1 project
The Mponeng mine experienced safety stoppages following the fatal accidents that occurred during the last quarter of 2017.
Resultantly, this led to a delay in Mponeng Phase 1 project construction and ramp-up. The project completion is now anticipated in
the third quarter of the year. Work on various infrastructure was affected, including the water management infrastructure and ore
handling infrastructure, as well as additional scope items, namely the ventilation hole from 116 level to decline 3 to service the
additional ventilation requirements of the project, and the reef pass between 123 and 126 levels, to overcome congestion on 123 level
tramming.

The revised geological resource model associated with the Ventersdorp Contact Reef has been finalised and is incorporated into the
business planning cycle.

Update on Obuasi redevelopment
Obuasi remained in care and maintenance phase during the quarter whilst awaiting the parliamentary ratification, by the Ghana
government, of the fiscal and development agreements for its redevelopment. The recruitment and mobilisation of the project team 
has commenced. Detailed execution planning and preparation for the early works contracts is in progress.

Kibali at 100%
At Kibali, the underground ore tonnes continue to ramp following commissioning of the underground materials handling system and ore
hoisting via the shaft. Total underground ore tonnes mined for the quarter were 768kt, of which 489kt was hoisted. In addition, Kibali
completed 2.2km of development from the declines during the quarter. The construction of Azambi, the third hydropower station is
expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2018. Construction of the next phase of tailings storage facility was initiated at the
end of 2017, and is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018.

Siguiri Combination Plant
The project remains on schedule, with start-up of the mill still scheduled for year-end, following commissioning planned for July
2018. About 30% of hard material with higher grades is planned to be processed through the new combination plant mill, at the
expected start-date of the end of the year.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry,
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, productivity improvements, growth prospects and
outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain
of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti's liquidity and capital resources and
capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements
regarding AngloGold Ashanti's operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be
given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors,
changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions,
including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational risk management. For
a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual reports on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors are not necessarily
all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable
factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti
undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its
behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

NEWS RELEASE
WORKING GROUP STATEMENT: Settlement of the Silicosis and TB class action

Johannesburg, 3 May 2018 - Richard Spoor Inc, Abrahams Kiewitz Inc and the Legal Resources Centre
– representing claimants in the silicosis and tuberculosis class action litigation - and the Occupational
Lung Disease Working Group - representing African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold
Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwater – are pleased to announce that they have reached
a settlement in this matter. For full announcement, visit www.oldcollab.co.za.

The companies last year announced amounts that each has provided for, as the estimated cost to each
of the settlement, based on actuarial assessments. These amounts total approximately R5 billion. As
the Working Group statement indicates, the agreement is still subject to ratification by the High Court.

We look forward to the successful conclusion of that process. Once that and certain other conditions
precedent are concluded, it will be possible fully to withdraw the appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal
of the Johannesburg High Court’s class certification judgment delivered in May 2016.

AngloGold Ashanti welcomes the settlement which represents a fair outcome for claimants and a
sustainable outcome for the companies.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Company Leadership Change and CEO
Search

(Press Release) – The Board of AngloGold Ashanti (“the Board”) today announces the
resignation of Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, who after 18 years with the Company, with the last
five years as Chief Executive Officer, has accepted an offer to become CEO of Vedanta
Resources Plc, the diversified resources group. He will remain in his current role until 30
August 2018.

A global search for the new CEO is underway, with a sub-committee of the Board formed to
evaluate internal and external candidates. It is the Board’s intention that a successor will have
been identified before Venkat’s departure.

Commenting on the search and AngloGold Ashanti’s strategy, Chairman Sipho Pityana said:
“We remain steadfast in our commitment to building a self-sustaining gold company in a
disciplined fashion, with tight capital control, uncompromising focus on the creation of long-
term value and the highest ethical standards. The Board will search globally for a candidate
with the requisite experience and breadth of expertise, and who will be committed to
maintaining the discipline and value focus that has become a hallmark of this business.”

Venkat assumed the role of CEO in May 2013, soon after the gold price fell by nearly a third.
Under his leadership, AngloGold Ashanti achieved a 16%* reduction in all-in sustaining costs,
a 30%* reduction in all in costs, a two-thirds reduction in overhead expenditure, a one-third
reduction in debt, successful completion of two new mining projects, and five consecutive
years of either meeting or beating its market guidance metrics. Productivity over the five years
increased by 26%, from 7.66oz per total employee costed in 2012 to 9.66oz/TEC in 2017. This
was all achieved whilst setting new benchmarks for safety performance and environmental
stewardship, and without the issue of equity thereby avoiding dilution to shareholders.

 “I offer my heartfelt thanks to Venkat for his exceptional contribution over almost two decades,
and in particular the last five years at the helm,” Pityana said. “He has embedded a culture of
consistency and accountability in the business, and has created the ability for the Company
to thrive in a range of market conditions. But more than that, Venkat has led by example,
always displaying the highest standard of ethical and empathetic leadership in creating the
enabling atmosphere for our efforts to improve safety, environmental stewardship and the
overall sustainability of our business. He leaves behind a very strong foundation for us to take
the Company forward. We wish him the very best in his new endeavour.”

Commenting on his departure, Venkat said: “It has been a singular honour to lead a world-
class team at AngloGold Ashanti over the past five years. Together, we have achieved a great
deal by fostering a culture of respect, discipline and accountability throughout the organisation,
in our effort to define a sustainable, long-term model for the gold industry. The Company has
an excellent portfolio of assets, exciting new opportunities and a strong, deep bench of talent
that will take it forward under its new leadership. I’d like to extend sincere thanks to the Board,
my colleagues in the executive team and all employees at the Company, for their individual
and collective guidance and support over nearly two decades. My special thanks to the
Chairman, Sipho Pityana, for his courageous leadership, and expert guidance every step of
the way.”

*Calculated from FY 2012 to FY 2017.

NEWS RELEASE
Mining industry submits code proposal to DRC Government

(PRESS RELEASE) -- Mining industry representatives* in the Democratic Republic of
Congo have submitted a formal proposal to the country’s Ministry of Mines that is
designed to address concerns about the recently revised mining code as well as the
government’s revenue needs.

Among other things, it proposes linking a sliding scale of royalty rates to the prices of
the key commodities, which industry representatives believe would be a more effective
mechanism than the windfall tax introduced in the new code and at current prices
would immediately give the government a higher share of revenues than what is
provided in the new code. It also deals with stability arrangements, state guarantees
and mining conventions.

Along with the stability afforded to convention holders, enshrined in the 2002 mining
code is a 10 year stability clause which provides that the holders of mining and
exploration titles will continue to be governed by the terms of the 2002 mining code in
the event of the implementation of any new law for such period.

Article 276:
“The State guarantees that the provisions of the present Code can only be modified
if, and only if, this Code itself is the subject of a legislative amendment adopted by
Parliament.

The rights attached to or deriving from an exploration licence or mining exploitation
licence granted and valid on the date of the enactment of such a legislative
modification, as well as the rights relating to or deriving from the exploitation licence
subsequently granted by virtue of such an exploration licence, including among
others, the tax, customs and exchange regimes set forth in this Code, remain
acquired and inviolable for a ten-year period from the date of:
    a) the entry into force of the legislative modification for the valid exploitation
       licences existing as of that date;
    b) the granting of the exploitation licence subsequently granted by virtue of a
       valid exploration licence existing on the date of entry into force of the
       legislative modification.

However, the proposal accepts 76% of the articles in the 2018 code and suggests
changes to the rest only to ensure the effectiveness and legality of the code. The
mining industry representatives believe these changes will resolve issues with the
code and contractual relationships while giving the DRC and its people increased
participation in the proceeds of mining.

* Issued on behalf of members of the DRC mining industry representing more
than 85% of the DRC’s copper, cobalt and gold production and most
significant development projects: Randgold Resources, Glencore, Ivanhoe
Mines, Gold Mountain International/ Zijin Mining Group, MMG Limited, Crystal
River Global Ltd and China Molybdenum Co, Ltd (CMOC), AngloGold Ashanti.

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the
economic outlook for the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs,
cost savings and other operating results, productivity improvements, growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations,
individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations
of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture
transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential
or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding
AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, economic performance and financial condition.

These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold
Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such
forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes
in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory
environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome
of pending or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational risk management.

For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2016, which
was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors
that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other
unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions
to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold
Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

Mining Industry Ready for Engagement with the DRC Government


(PRESS RELEASE) -- A legal and technical team representing the major mining companies
operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) has arrived in Kinshasa for
engagement with the government on its new mining code. This follows the meeting on
7 March 2018 where His Excellency President Kabila gave an assurance that the questions
raised by the industry would be resolved through transitional arrangements, mining regulations
and in respect of agreements and guarantees that need to be considered after the new code
was signed into law. In the meeting, the parties were requested to meet for a 30-day period
starting 14 March 2018.

As agreed with His Excellency the President, a matrix of the industry’s issues and proposals
regarding the mining code has been delivered to the Minister of Mines. The companies are
now awaiting an appointment with the Minister of Mines to discuss a programme of
engagement with his working group. The companies in their meeting with the President did
confirm their willingness to negotiate additional royalties and changes to other taxes as part
of this process.

The companies said they expected this process will start soon and that it will give priority to
the recognition of the stability clauses contained in Article 276 of the 2002 mining code and
certain mining conventions. Most notably, Article 276 provided for 10 years of stability after
changes are made to the mining code, and formed the basis of many investment decisions in
DRC. This period of stability resulted in over US$10 billion in direct investments by the mining
industry which created over 20,000 full time jobs in the DRC.

In the meantime, Randgold Resources and AngloGold Ashanti’s Kibali mine, Glencore’s
Mutanda Mine and Kamoto Copper Company, the Kamoa-Kakula mine, the Kinsevere mine
and the Tenke Fugureme mine have resigned from the FEC, the Congolese Chamber of
Commerce, with immediate effect. These mines, which represent more than 85% of the DRC’s
copper, cobalt and gold production, said the FEC does not adequately represent their
interests.

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Updates on DRC Mining Code Discussions


(PRES RELEASE) -- On Wednesday the 7th March 2018, a meeting took place between His
Excellency President Joseph KABILA KABANGE of the Democratic Republic of Congo and
representatives of the mining industries at their request.

The purpose of the meeting was to clarify certain aspects of the new Mining Code adopted by the two
chambers of the Congolese parliament, which will be promulgated soon.

The representatives of the mining industry raised questions pertaining to their operations. The
President gave assurances that the questions raised will be resolved through discussions with the
Government, in the mining regulation to be adopted by the Government.

After a constructive debate, the mining operators agreed to continue discussions with the Government
on issues existing in the current agreement once the new Mining Code has been signed into law.

AngloGold Ashanti is in full support of Randgold Resources, our partner and the operator in the Kibali
joint venture. Randgold Resources will continue the engagement with DRC Government
representatives next week.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Declares 1.8Moz Maiden Ore Reserve (Attrib.) for Gramalote

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce the
Maiden Ore Reserve for the Gramalote project, consisting of attributable 63.7Mt @ 0.86 g/t
gold and contained metal content of 1.8Moz. This is a Joint Venture between AngloGold (51%
and manager) and B2Gold (49%). The Gramalote project is located on the eastern flank of the
Cordillera Central near the towns of Providencia and San Jose del Nus in the municipality of
San Roque, in the north-west of the Antioquia Department. It is approximately 230km north-
west of Bogota and 124km north-east of Medellin.

The enhanced Pre-Feasibility study was completed in September 2017 and approved
by the board to proceed to Feasibility Study. The project will now undergo a full
feasibility study, during which all metrics, including capital and costs, will be optimised.
No capital for development of the project has been committed.

“We are developing this as a good long-term option in our pipeline, and will be working hard
to optimise all of its key elements – including capital -- during the feasibility study phase,”
Ludwig Eybers, AngloGold Ashanti’s Chief Operating Officer-International said. “While we are
a long way from committing any capital to this project, it represents good value that we will
realise over time.”

The Project has several strengths, both externally and intrinsic to the ore and the orebody
itself.
External factors are:
•       Reliable water supply – high rainfall region.
•       Adjacent to a national highway, which connects to a river and seaports.
•       Proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low-cost power and stable record of
hydro-electric power.
•       Technically capable workforce within Colombia.
•       Community support due to mining tradition and the opportunity to bring prosperity to
the area if the project is developed.

Factors intrinsic to the ore and orebody are:
•      Relatively low strip ratio of 2.5:1.
•      Amenability to grade streaming to increase early cash flow.
•      Strong metallurgical response, resulting in low process operating costs and high
       recovery, compared to a typical hard rock gold mine using whole ore leach.

Mining will be by open pit methods commencing in the high-grade portion of the main
Gramalote Pit and progressing through a series of cut-backs in Gramalote and in the two
satellite pits, Trinidad and Monjas West. The total rock movement is expected to rise to just
under 60 Mtpa in the second year of operation, and remain at that level until the ninth year
before declining. The total material moved is expected to include material rehandled from the
stockpiles.

The project concluded that a SAG-Ball mill circuit along with flotation and leaching is expected
to provide the best economics. The Gramalote ore will be treated using a simple circuit and is
expected to perform extremely well metallurgically.

    -   The sulphide and oxide ores will be treated through separate grinding and flotation
        circuits, optimising operational performance.
    -   The plant nameplate feed rate will be 11 Mtpa of sulphide ore and 4 Mtpa of oxide.
        After oxide ore is depleted in the ninth year of production, 15 Mtpa of sulphide ore will
        be fed.
    -   The process for both ores will involve floating the gold into a low-mass concentrate
        which is leached, while the benign flotation tails are placed in a Tailings Management
        Facility (TMF).
    -   The sulphide ore is expected to achieve close to 95% overall gold recovery with a very
        coarse grind size, minimising costs.
    -   Recovery from the oxide ore is anticipated to be roughly 82%, but the process is still
        expected to be more profitable than a whole ore leach process.

Key infrastructure highlights include:

    -   Existing port facilities, including sea (Cartagena at 640km, Barranquilla at 768km) and
        river ports (73 km), and a national highway.
    -   On-site facilities to be constructed include the TMF, a creek diversion, a residential
        camp and offices.
    -   A high voltage power line, 26 km long, will be required to connect to the national grid.
        This will be constructed and operated by a major Colombian power distribution
        company.

The project aims at producing a total of 4.22Moz of gold over the life of the mine at a rate of
between 300 and 450koz for the first eight years, at attractive AISC levels over the life of
foreseeable mining operations.

publication of the Gramalote Ore Reserve on Table 1 in terms of the SAMREC code and the

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Reaches Accord with Ghana Over Obuasi Investment Framework

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that it
has signed the regulatory and fiscal agreements with the Government of Ghana that will
provide the framework for the redevelopment of the Obuasi Gold Mine into a modern,
productive mining operation.
The Government of Ghana and AngloGold Ashanti have put in place several agreements
including a Development Agreement, Tax Concession Agreement, Security Agreement and a
Reclamation Security Agreement. The Environment Impact Assessment process has been
completed and the permits are expected shortly.
Two documents – the Tax Concession Agreement (TCA) and the Development Agreement
(DA) – must now both be ratified by Ghana’s Parliament to be made effective.
Obuasi Gold Mine has been in limited operating phase since 2014, and the Government’s
support will go a long way to enabling it to restart as a modern, productive, long-life high
margin operation. This will benefit the local, regional and national economies of Ghana
through taxes, job creation, communal development expenditure and local procurement
opportunities.
“Redevelopment of the Obuasi mine will establish Obuasi as a world class operation
rejuvenating the proud gold mining history of the Ashanti region in Ghana,” AngloGold
Ashanti Chief Executive Officer, Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said. “Obuasi now has the
mine and labour plan, geological understanding and social model to match its world-class,
high-grade ore body. The project metrics show a high-return, long-life project that not only
brings ounces to account quickly and profitably, but also offers attractive returns on our
investment.”
AngloGold Ashanti has conducted a feasibility study into the redevelopment of the Obuasi
Gold Mine. The study tested the viability of redeveloping the high-grade Obuasi ore body,
which has 5.8Moz of Ore Reserves and 34Moz in Mineral Resource, to create a safe, long-
life mining operation that is productive and profitable. The outcomes of the TCA and DA
have been applied to the feasibility study.
The redevelopment will establish Obuasi as a mechanised underground mining operation. The
approach to redeveloping the Obuasi mine is a fundamental departure from how the mine was
operated in the past. The redevelopment makes use of automation and controls for improved
operational efficiencies and consistency in performance.
The project implementation will be undertaken in two distinct phases, with stage one
comprising project establishment, mine rehabilitation and development, plant and
infrastructure refurbishment to enable production at a rate of 2,000t per day for the first
operating year. This is expected to take roughly 18 months, with the first gold pour expected
in the third quarter of 2019.

The second phase includes refurbishment of the underground materials handling system,
shafts and ventilation; and construction of the primary crusher, the SAG/Ball circuit, carbon
regeneration, a new gold room and tailings storage facility. This expected to take a further 12
months and enable the operation to climb to 4,000t per day. The operation is then expected
to ramp up to 5,000t per day, over the following three years.

Mine production for the first 10 years will be focussed on the upper ore bodies and is
expected to average 350,000oz to 450,000oz at an average head grade of 8.1g/t. In the
second 10 years, production averages 400,000oz to 450,000oz. Total cash costs are
expected to average between $590/oz to $680/oz, while All-in Sustaining Costs are
expected to be between $750/oz to $850/oz.

The project delivers internal rates of return of between 16% and 23% at real gold prices of
between $1,100/oz and $1,240/oz, and is highly leveraged to the gold price.

Initial project capital expenditure anticipated over the first two and half years is expected to be
between $450m to $500m, excluding pre-production capital of $64. After the completion of
phase two, extended project capital expenditure of $94m is expected to continue through to
year six, covering the development of the Obuasi Deeps Decline to the lower level of the mine,
refurbishment of the KMS shaft, installation of new underground pump stations and
construction of the flotation tailings storage facility.
It envisages a smaller but skilled workforce that can operate in a mechanised/automated
operation with a strong sense of accountability. The operation is expected to create between
2000 to 2,500 jobs. Additional roles will be required during the construction phase of the
project.

The footprint of the mine has been significantly simplified. The lease area has been reduced
from 475Km2 to 201Km2. The operational footprint has been simplified and is concentrated in
a fenced location in the south, allowing for tighter security, access control and the demarcation
of the mine from the neighbouring community.
“We would like to thank His Excellency President Nana Akufo-Addo and his team, and in
particular the Honourable Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, John-Peter Amewu, for
the professional manner in which this negotiation was undertaken,” Venkat said.
Notes to Editors
AngloGold Ashanti has a 100% interest in Obuasi, which is located in the Ashanti region of
Ghana, 200 kilometres north west of Accra. The Obuasi mine was acquired by AngloGold in
the merger with Ashanti Goldfields in 2004. The falling gold price in 2013 overtook
restructuring efforts to improve the profitability of the operation.
The Obuasi Mine has embarked on a fundamental restructuring programme since 2014. This
became necessary because the mine had been operating at significant losses for a prolonged
period. Underground production was suspended at the end of 2014, and the entire workforce
was retrenched.
The mine entered a Limited Operating Phase (LOP), through an Amendment of Programme
of Mining Operations (APMO) which was approved by the Government of Ghana. The focus
during the LOP was the clean-up and processing of tailings at Diewuoso, continued
construction of the Obuasi Deeps Decline, the maintenance of surface and underground
infrastructure, water treatment and meeting environmental obligations and social
commitments. In parallel, a feasibility study for the redevelopment of the Obuasi Mine was
conducted.
The feasibility study underwent several iterations and optimisation to define the best
configuration of project design, capital and operating cost and cash flow for the
redevelopment.

portfolio and advanced its brownfield projects according to plan – all whilst generating $125m in free
cash flow before growth investment. Its outlook for 2018 sees improvements across key metrics and
also a decision to move ahead with redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine in Ghana, subject to
Parliamentary ratification.

Production rose to 3.755Moz at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,054/oz in the 12 months through to
December 31, 2017, from 3.628Moz at $986/oz in the previous year, despite restructuring in South
Africa. Stronger year-on-year operating performance from the International Operations helped to more
than offset a lower output from South Africa, where an agreement was reached to sell the Moab
Khotsong and Kopanang mines, and where TauTona is undergoing an orderly closure process.

“We delivered a strong production and cost performance, which ultimately funded our reinvestment and
restructuring programme,” Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “In ensuring we
maintain focus on our long-term strategy, our portfolio improvement projects were again executed on
time and on schedule, and we continued to make progress on improving safety.”

The strong operating and financial performance in 2017 has further strengthened the foundation for
AngloGold Ashanti’s future. The slate of high-return projects - all with attractive payback periods - is
expected to deliver higher-margin production, extend lives and improve predictability at key assets.
Production from operations is set to improve in 2018, as are all-in sustaining costs, while capital
expenditure is expected to fall despite the decision to reinvest at Obuasi.

Headline earnings for the year were $27m, or 6 cents per share, compared with $111m, or 27 cents per
share in 2016. Headline earnings for 2017 includes the impact of retrenchment provisions in the South
Africa region of $71m (post-tax) and the provision for silicosis claims of $46m (post-tax). Excluding the
impact of the abnormal items, headline earnings would have increased from $27m to $144m.

BALANCE SHEET

The balance sheet remains robust with strong liquidity and long-dated maturities providing significant
financial flexibility. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA) of $1,483m in 2017 decreased by $65m, or 4% from the previous year, resulting in a 34%
Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA for the year excludes the impact of the South African
redundancy costs and impairments but includes the impact of the estimated silicosis provision..

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2017 was 1.35 times compared with 1.56 times
at the end of June 2017 and 1.24 times at the end of December 2016. Management has successfully
maintained financial flexibility by remaining at or below targeted leverage levels, and well below the
covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under the Company’s revolving credit agreements.

Net debt increased marginally by 4% to $2bn at 31 December 2017, from $1.92bn at the end of 2016.
However, net debt fell by $150m from the level of $2.15bn reported at mid year.

SAFETY

The Company’s All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the
quarter ended 31 December 2017 was 6.67 per million hours worked, a 6% improvement from 7.08 in
the previous quarter. Yatela, Siguiri, Obuasi, La Colosa, Gramalote, Quebradona and Growth and
Exploration achieved an injury free quarter. The AIFR for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 7.53
compared to 7.71 for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Prior to a fatality occurring in July 2017, the Company recorded three consecutive fatality-free quarters
for the first time in its history, with the South African ultra-deep mines, achieving 349 fatality-free days.
The International Operations set a record of 495 days without a fatality.

Regrettably, the strong start to the year was marred by seven fatalities in the second half, four of which
were seismic-related, two were caused by falls-of-ground and one occurred during rail-bound transport
operations. Significant effort is being expended to not only understand the cause of each of these
incidents, but also the root cause of other high potential incidents that could have resulted in fatalities.

SECOND HALF

Free cash flow of $162m was generated in the second half of 2017, a 5% decrease on the prior year’s
second half. Higher operating costs impacted by stronger local currencies, inflation and the payment of
the South African redundancy costs, as well as unfavourable working capital movements and higher
taxes, were partially offset by higher gold sold. Free cash flow pre-growth investment was $231m, 4%
lower than the previous year.

Production for the second half of 2017 was 2.007Moz, a 15% improvement on the first half of the year
and a 7% increase on the six months ended 31 December 2016. Strong performances in the
International portfolio, notably in Continental Africa at Siguiri and Geita and in Australia at both Sunrise
Dam and Tropicana, offset production losses in South Africa due to the orderly closure of Tau Tona and
Savuka as well as safety stoppages.

AISC for the second half of 2017 was $1,038/oz, lower than the $1,058/oz reported for the second half
of 2016, reflecting an increase in gold sales, offsetting the stronger local currencies as well as the impact
of lower sustaining capital expenditure on a per ounce basis.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the group achieved an AISC of $1,006/oz, a 4% improvement over
the fourth quarter of 2016.


OUTLOOK**

Production guidance for 2018 year is estimated to be between 3.325Moz and 3.450Moz (includes three
months production from Moab and Kopanang at ~30koz per month). Total cash costs are estimated to
be between $770/oz and $830/oz and AISC between $990/oz and $1,060/oz at average exchange rates
against the US dollar of 12.79 (Rand), 3.20 (Brazil Real), 0.78 (Aus$) and 19.61 (Argentina Peso), with
oil at $62/bl average for the year, based on market expectations. Capital expenditure is anticipated to
be lower at between $800m and $920m (which includes $200m to $250m for growth capital).

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti continued to make considerable enhancements to the quality of its portfolio during the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Company advanced the restructuring of its South African portfolio; executed, according to plan, the key self-funded brownfield projects
to sustainably improve mine lives and margins; and achieved its annual cost, production and capital guidance for the fifth consecutive
year, despite the asset sales and restructuring in South Africa.

Management again demonstrated its key strengths in the areas of safety, project execution, planning, and financial and risk management.
New safety benchmarks were set during the year, with the Company recording three consecutive, fatality-free quarters for the first time in
its history and posting 349 days in South Africa without an operating fatality. The International Operations set a record of 495 days without
a fatality on 28 January 2018.

AngloGold Ashanti also delivered a strong exploration result, with most of the year's production replaced given success across a broad
front. The group Ore Reserve at the end of 2017 was 49.5Moz, from 50.1Moz in December 2016. During the year, additions from
Gramalote in Colombia, where a maiden reserve was declared, AGA Mineração in Brazil, Tropicana in Australia, Obuasi in Ghana and
Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina, mostly offset the total depletion of 4.3Moz.

The strong operating and financial performance in 2017 has further strengthened the foundation for AngloGold Ashanti's future. The slate
of low capital, high-return brownfields projects – all with attractive payback periods - are expected to deliver further improvements to cash
flows over time. This inward investment improves predictability at key assets, and despite stronger local currencies and increased
investment, AngloGold Ashanti has maintained a relatively stable cost structure, highlighting the optionality within its portfolio and the
quality of its operating teams.

""We delivered a strong production and cost performance, which ultimately allowed us to self- fund our reinvestment and restructuring
programme,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""In ensuring we maintain focus on our long-term strategy, our
portfolio improvement projects were again executed on time and on schedule, and we continued to make progress on improving safety.""

A strong performance during the fourth quarter of the year at the International Operations in particular, is a clear indication of the efforts
to sustainably improve cash flows. Whilst the last quarter tends to be seasonally stronger, improvements on most key metrics resulted in
a 27% increase in Adjusted EBITDA over the prior year quarter and free cash flow of $74m, an increase of 90% over the same period a
year earlier.

FULL YEAR REVIEW

Production for the year of 3.755Moz exceeded the top end of guidance and was 4% higher than the previous year's production of 3.628Moz
despite the orderly closure of TauTona and Savuka. Stronger year-on-year operating performance across the International Operations
helped to more than offset the lower output from South Africa. In Australia, Sunrise Dam and Tropicana saw the benefits of mine
optimisation initiatives resulting in solid performances throughout the year. In Continental Africa, higher grades at Geita and Siguiri
contributed to the region's 10% increase in production over the previous year. In the Americas, a solid operating performance was
bolstered by improved production from AGA Mineração. The strong performance across the portfolio, particularly in the fourth quarter,
demonstrated continued cost and operating discipline and improvements through internally-funded, low-capital, high return brownfields investments.

Total cash costs for the full year of $792/oz were 6% higher than the previous year's $744/oz, and within the guidance range of $750/oz-
$800/oz. Costs were negatively impacted by inflation, stronger local currencies and the expensing of certain capital costs at the South
African operations as they underwent orderly closure. The South African rand averaged 9% stronger versus the dollar in 2017 compared
with 2016, and the Brazilian real averaged 8% stronger, contributing to the 21% year-on-year increase in total cash costs in South Africa
and 10% increase in the Americas region. In contrast, cash costs remained relatively flat in Continental Africa and declined by 6% in
Australia despite a 3% stronger Australian dollar. All-in sustaining costs came in at the bottom end of the guidance range at $1,054/oz,
7% higher than the previous year AISC of $986/oz due to higher planned sustaining capital expenditure levels in addition to the stronger
local currencies.

Cash flow from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2017 declined 16% when compared to 2016, reflecting tighter margins,
working capital lockups, and payments for redundancies in South Africa, offsetting a 1% increase in the gold price received and a 5%
increase in gold sales. Free cash flow of $1m for the year, compared to $278m in 2016, reflects the higher planned capital expenditure
and was helped by a strong second half which delivered free cash flow of $162m. Free cash flow for the year, before taking growth capital
into account, was $125m versus $394m a year earlier, impacted by 19% higher sustaining capital expenditure of $829m compared to the
previous year of $695m, South African retrenchment costs paid of $49m and higher cash costs.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) was $953m, at the lower end of the market guidance of between
$950m - $1,050m, and included project capital expenditure of $124m invested in growth projects at Siguiri and Kibali in Continental Africa
and Mponeng in South Africa. Sustaining capital increased 19% to $829m, compared to $695m in 2016, reflecting increased investment
at Geita in Tanzania and in Australia. This higher level of spend was largely aimed at improving mine lives and margins across the portfolio.
Capital expenditure in Continental Africa increased by $109m (including equity accounted investments), with higher expenditure on
underground development at Geita and the cutback at Iduapriem's Teberebie pit, which extends the life of the operation by about a
decade. In Australia, expenditure at Tropicana increased to $91m as mine optimisation work and additional stripping costs, geared to
improve the medium- and longer-term profitability of the mine, progressed.

Adjusted Headline Earnings for the year were $9m, or 2 cents per share, compared with $143m, or 35 cents per share in 2016. Adjusted
headline earnings for 2017 include the impact of retrenchment provisions in the South Africa region of $71m (post-tax) and the provision
for the settlement of the silicosis class action claims and related expenditure of $46m (post-tax).

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) of $1,483m in 2017 decreased by $65m, or 4%
from the previous year, resulting in a 34% Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA for the year excludes the impact of the South
African redundancy costs and impairments but includes the impact of the estimated provision in respect of the silicosis class-action law
suit of $46m (pre-tax: $63m). The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2017 was 1.35 times compared with 1.56
times at the end of June 2017 and 1.24 times at the end of December 2016. Management has successfully maintained financial flexibility
by remaining at or below targeted leverage levels, and well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under our revolving credit
agreements.

Net debt increased marginally by 4% to $2bn at 31 December 2017, from $1.916bn at the end of 2016. During 2017, AngloGold Ashanti
increased its ZAR RCF facilities from R3.4bn to R5.7bn. The balance sheet remains robust, with liquidity comprising $1,050m available
on the $1.1bn US dollar RCFs at the end of December 2017, A$290m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately
R2.95bn available from the South African RCF and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $205m at the end of December 2017.
The nearest bond maturities are in 2020 and 2022.

SECOND HALF YEAR REVIEW

Production for the second half of 2017 was 2.007Moz, a 7% increase on the same period a year earlier. Strong performances in the
International portfolio, notably in Continental Africa at Siguiri and Geita and in Australia at both Sunrise Dam and Tropicana, offset
production losses in South Africa due to the orderly closure of TauTona and Savuka as well as safety stoppages.

Total cash costs of $787/oz, up 1% year-on-year, reflect an exceptionally strong fourth-quarter performance which saw costs at $768/oz
offset mainly by strengthening currencies. Cash costs in the second half of the year also include the impact of a reclassification of certain
capital costs to operating expenses at the South African operations undergoing orderly closure. The Continental Africa region saw costs
decline year-on-year by 3%, reflecting significant improvements at Iduapriem, Siguiri, and Sadiola. At Geita in Tanzania, despite a 19%
increase in production versus the prior year, cash costs increased by 15% to $647/oz as a result of an increase in higher-cost underground
mining activities. In Australia, costs fell 8% to $717/oz when compared to the prior half year period. In Brazil, at AGA Mineração, a solid
operating performance was weighed down by a stronger Brazilian Real and lower underground grades when compared to a year earlier
and the first half of 2017.

AISC for the second half of 2017 was $1,038/oz, lower than the $1,058/oz reported for the second half of 2016, reflecting an increase in
gold sales, offsetting the stronger local currencies, as well as the impact of lower sustaining capital expenditure on a per ounce basis.
During the fourth quarter of the year, the group achieved an AISC of $1,006/oz, a 4% improvement over the same period a year earlier.

Free cash flow of $162m was generated in the second half of 2017, a 5% decrease on the prior year period. Higher operating costs
impacted by stronger local currencies, inflation and the payment of the South African redundancy costs, as well as unfavourable working
capital movements and higher taxes, were partially offset by higher gold sold. Free cash flow pre-growth capital was $231m, 4% lower
than the previous year.

Adjusted EBITDA rose by 14% to $872m from $767m the previous year. The period benefitted from higher gold sales and gold price, and
lower exploration costs. The gains were partially offset by higher operating costs, inflationary pressures and stronger currencies.

Adjusted headline earnings for the second half of 2017 of $101m or 24 cents per share, were significantly higher than the previous year
which recorded a loss of $16m. The increase is attributable to higher ounces sold, partly offset by stronger local currencies, higher cash
costs resulting mainly from inflationary increases, and retrenchment and silicosis provisions in the South Africa region.

Capital expenditure in the second half of 2017 was $499m (including equity accounted entities) compared to $493m in the second half of
2016. Of the capital spent, non-sustaining capital expenditure during the period amounted to $70m, in line with the same prior period and
primarily related to the Siguiri hard rock project.

SAFETY UPDATE

Employee safety – our first value - remained a key focus for the year. Prior to a fatality occurring in July 2017, the Company recorded
three consecutive fatality-free quarters for the first time in its history, with the South African ultra-deep mines, achieving 349 fatality-free
days. In the West Wits region, TauTona achieved a year without a fatality, whilst Mponeng recorded 2 million fatality-free shifts during
October 2017 for the first time in the mine's history. In the Vaal River region, Moab Khotsong recorded 500,000 fatality-free shifts during
November 2017, while Kopanang mine and South Africa Surface Operations respectively achieved one and two million fatality-free shifts.
During the year, the South Africa region received an award, the MineSafe's highest ranking prize, recognising AngloGold Ashanti as a
mining company with the most improved safety performance year-on-year. MineSafe is an industrial body representing a collaborative
effort between mining companies, employee bodies and the South African Department of Mineral Resources.

This safety performance improvement is a result of a progressive implementation and integration into daily work routines of the group
safety strategy. The main areas of the strategy include focus on fatality risks by ensuring every employee understands and manages
hazards and associated risks on a continuous basis, that critical controls remain in place with compliance to set work routines, and that
there is diligent reporting of high potential incidents, which are addressed whilst making optimal use of technology.

The strong start to the year was marred by seven fatalities in the second half, four of which were seismic-related, two were caused by
falls-of-ground and one occurred during rail-bound transport operations.

The group All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the quarter ended 31 December 2017 was
6.67 per million hours worked, a 6% improvement from 7.08 in the previous quarter. Yatela, Siguiri, Obuasi, La Colosa, Gramalote,
Quebradona and Growth and Exploration achieved an injury free quarter. The AIFR for 2017 was 7.53 compared to 7.71 in 2016.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations produced 903,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,085/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared
to 967,000oz at a total cash cost of $896/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,245/oz for the
year ended 31 December 2017 compared with $1,081/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Tonnes mined were affected by a poor
start up to the year at all operations, whilst the decision to stop the loss-making operations in the third quarter further impacted full-year
production. Underground yield dropped 8% to 6.93 g/t as a result of lower feed grades as well as higher dilution year-on-year. This was
mainly due to an increase in waste tonnes at Moab Khotsong, mining moving out of higher grade areas at Mponeng, and the reclamation
of the tailing storage facilities at the West Wits Surface Sources. The final blast took place at TauTona on 15 September and the Section
189 process continued at Kopanang together with the pending disposal of the mine - subject to conditions precedent - as announced in
October. Total cash costs increased due to lower production volumes, inflationary pressures and a stronger local currency against the US
dollar, compared with same period in 2016.

For the six months ended 31 December 2017, the region produced 467,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,079/oz compared to 481,000oz
at a total cash cost of $984/oz for the comparable period in 2016.

At West Wits, production was 315,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,311/oz for the year ended December 2017 compared to 399,000oz at
a total cash cost of $914/oz the previous year. At Mponeng, production decreased year-on-year from 254,000oz to 224,000oz, mainly as
a result of mining at lower grade areas as planned, face time constraints with mining occurring further away from shaft stations, and three
separate seismically induced fatal accidents. By the last quarter of the year, the improvement of Mponeng's yield which averaged 8.54g/t,
was offset by safety related stoppages due to the fatal incidents in the last quarter of the year.

At the Vaal River Operations production was 386,000oz at a total cash cost of $958/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared
to 371,000oz at a total cash cost of $875/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. At Moab Khotsong production increased due to fewer
safety related disruptions as well as improved efficiencies, and despite higher dilution and a lower mine call factor. At Kopanang,
production remained flat year-on-year, impacted by safety-related interruptions following the fall-off-ground fatal incidents that occurred in
the fourth quarter.

Surface Operations produced 192,000oz at a total cash cost of $969/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to 186,000oz
at a total cash cost of $899/oz. At Mine Waste Solutions, production was 18% higher when compared with the same period in 2016 as a
result of a 17% increase in feed grades due to higher grades from the Sulphur paydam and East tailing storage facilities (TSF), coupled
with improvements in recovery. The yield increase is as expected from the Sulphur Paydam which is normally associated with higher reef
values, together with higher volumes of floor cleaning material reclaimed. Gold recovery efforts showed improvements in the latter part
of the second half in 2017. This yielded about 7% improvement after reagent suite optimisation and improved carbon management,
resulting in improved production. Operations at the flotation and uranium circuit remain suspended as investigations into improved
water reticulation continue.

Hard rock production was lower when compared with the previous year. This drop is attributable to lower tonnage throughput, and a lower
recovery due to the increased amount of clean-up material which is refractory in nature. The sticky nature of the material processed
through the Surface Sources' plants impacted negatively on the metallurgical efficiencies. Production was also affected by the suspension
of Kopanang marginal ore dumps and the low mill availability at the Kopanang gold plant.

The Continental Africa region delivered 1.453Moz at a total cash cost of $720/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to
1.321Moz at a total cash cost of $717/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Production increased significantly year-on-year as almost
all operations delivered increased production driven mainly by higher recovered grades at Siguiri, Iduapriem and Geita, together with
higher tonnages in Mali. AISC were $953/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to $904/oz the year ended 31 December 2016.

For the six months ended 31 December 2017 the region produced 788,000oz at a total cash cost of $720/oz compared to the 702,000oz
at a total cash cost of $742/oz for the same period in 2016. Total cash costs decreased due to increased production, boosted by higher
grades and tonnages.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased 7% to 228,000oz at a total cash cost of $823/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017,
compared to 214,000oz at a total cash cost of $908/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Production increased due to the 8% higher
recovered grade from mining deeper higher grade areas in the current period, partly offset by a decrease in tonnage treated.

In the Republic of Guinea, Siguiri's production increased 24% to 324,000oz at a total cash cost of $725/oz for the year ended
31 December 2017 compared to 260,000oz at a total cash cost of $784/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. The production
improvement was due to a 29% increase in recovered grade as a result of the mining of higher grade areas, which included the new
Seguelen pit, compared to the previous period, partly offset by a decrease in tonnes treated. Total cash costs for the year decreased by
8%, mostly as a result of higher gold production, partly offset by the stockpile utilisation cost compared to additions in the previous year,
and the once-off benefit of a favourable settlement of contractor charges in the previous period.

In Mali, Morila's production increased 27% to 28,000oz at a total cash cost of $974/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared
to 22,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,123/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Production increased as a result of a 45% increase
in tonnage throughput compared to the same period in 2016 driven by consistent plant availability, the treatment of softer ore, and the
resumption of limited mining in the latter part of the current year. This improvement was partly offset by a 10% decrease in recovered
grade as the operation continued treatment of marginal lower grade and tailings ore. Total cash costs consequently decreased by 13%.

At Sadiola, production was 63,000oz at a total cash cost of $900/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to 70,000oz at a
total cash cost of $991/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Production decreased as a result of a 10% decrease in recovered grade
due to the limited availability of the remaining oxide ore, partly offset by an increase in tonnes treated. Total cash costs however decreased
by 9% as a result of additions of full grade ore stockpiles compared to stockpile utilisation in the previous period.

In Tanzania, Geita's production was 539,000oz at a total cash cost of $608/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to
489,000oz at a total cash cost of $530/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. The increase in production was due to a 13% increase
in recovered grade from mining higher grade ore at Nyankanga cut 7 and cut 8, in line with the mining plan. Increased production is also
supported by higher underground tonnes in the current period as the underground ramp up continues, reaching 493,000 tonnes for the
year. These factors were partly offset by a decrease in plant throughput. Total cash costs however increased mainly as a result of
increased underground mining activity and higher associated costs compared to the previous period.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kibali achieved 268,000oz (attributable) at a total cash cost of $784/oz for the year ended 31
December 2017 compared to 264,000oz at a total cash cost of $740/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Higher tonnes treated and
mined contributed to the higher production, notably in the fourth quarter with the commissioning of the underground materials handling
systems and beneficial use of the shaft, facilitating the increase in higher grade ore from underground. The plant operated for extended
periods on 100% sulphide ore achieving design recovery and above design throughput.

The Americas region produced 840,000oz at a total cash cost of $638/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to 820,000oz
at a total cash cost of $578/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. AISC were $943/oz, compared to $875/oz achieved in the same
period in 2016. Production volumes reflected stronger year-on-year contributions from both Brazil and Argentina, attributable to operational
improvements and an increase in tonnes treated. Total cash costs for the region were higher compared to the same period in 2016 mainly
due to inflationary pressures and the strengthening of the Brazilian Real against the US dollar.

For the six months ended 31 December 2017, the region produced 447,000oz at a total cash cost of $652/oz compared to 431,000oz at
a total cash cost of $604/oz for the same period in 2016. Total cash costs increased due to decreased production. AISC were $922/oz,
compared to $929/oz achieved in the same period in 2016.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia production was 283,000oz at a total cash cost of $522/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared
to 281,000oz at a total cash cost of $563/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. The mine achieved its highest production level in 18
years, boosted by operational and metallurgical improvements and an increase in tonnes treated at the plant. Total cash costs decreased
considerably, assisted by increased production, higher by-product sales, and favourable stockpile movements. Various cost savings
initiatives focused on efficiencies and production improvements in the underground mine expansion, increasing mill throughput and silver
recovery, and capital savings, amongst others. These positive factors were partially offset by the inflationary pressures, particularly related
to salary increases agreed on in October, as well as the elimination of Patagonia ports rebates at the end of 2016, ending a 10%
reimbursement benefit that was derived during the same period last year.

In Brazil production was 557,000oz at a total cash cost of $693/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to 538,000oz at a
total cash cost of $580/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. Total cash costs were mainly impacted by lower feed grades, inflationary
pressures and local currency effects due to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US dollar during the year. Production
increased as a result of improved geological modelling at Mineração which assisted the recovery from geotechnical challenges faced at
the start of the year at Córrego do Sitio. At Serra Grande, production was driven by higher tonnes treated supported by crushing and
milling efficiencies and more efficient leaching following the implementation of the Carbon-In-Leach project, this despite lower feed grades.
This is a result of the Operational Excellence initiatives which improved levels of ore mined, offsetting lower open pit production.

The Australia region produced 559,000oz at a total cash cost of $743/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017 compared to 520,000oz
at a total cash cost of $793/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016. AISC were $1,062/oz for the year ended 31 December 2017,
compared to $1,067/oz achieved in the same period in 2016. Production improved due to higher mill throughput and feed grade, and a
significant increase in metallurgical recovery at Sunrise Dam and higher feed grade and mill throughput at Tropicana. Total cash costs
decreased on the back of improved production and favourable inventory movements. Higher head grades and improved metallurgical
recovery contributed to a 5% increase in production at Sunrise Dam in 2017. Tropicana production was 10% higher for the year compared
to 2016 due mainly to a 10% increase in mill throughput.

For the six months ended 31 December 2017 the region produced 305,000oz at a total cash cost of $717/oz compared to 269,000oz at a
total cash cost of $781/oz for the same period in 2016. On 7 December 2017, the Tropicana joint venture partners announced a
commitment to the Long Island mining strategy and approval of an additional ball mill to lift plant throughput and gold recovery, adding
2.1 million ounces of gold production to the Tropicana business plan. A scoping study on the potential for underground mining at Boston
Shaker is underway. It is anticipated that a pre-feasibility study will begin in 2018 in conjunction with infill drilling programmes.

CORPORATE UPDATES

South Africa Asset Sales and Restructure

On 28 June 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced that it would restructure its South African Operations to safely return the business to 
profitability, whilst mitigating job losses. This included placing TauTona and Savuka into care and maintenance, to be followed by 
orderly closure later in this year.

On 19 October 2017 AngloGold Ashanti announced the sale of the Kopanang Mine and related infrastructure to Heaven-Sent SA Sunshine 
Investment Company Limited (Heaven-Sent). Under the sale agreement, one of the conditions precedent was for the new owners to conclude 
an agreement with AngloGold Ashanti and the employees' organised labour representatives to determine the number of existing employees 
who would continue to work at the operations after the change in ownership comes into effect. This agreement was concluded on 16 November 2017. 
It is anticipated that about 3,000 employees, of the total workforce of 3,638, will transfer to the new owner Heaven-Sent. AngloGold Ashanti 
will honour its undertaking to pay accrued severance packages to all affected employees at Kopanang immediately following the conclusion of 
the sale transaction.

The Kopanang sale transaction is conditional upon certain conditions precedent being fulfilled, many of which, including Section 11 and 102 and 
Competition Commission approval, have been achieved. Completion of the Kopanang sale transaction is anticipated imminently.
 
Additionally, on 19 October 2017 the conclusion of the sale agreement for the disposal of the Moab Khotsong and Great Noligwa mines and related 
infrastructure to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony), was announced. This transaction is also subject to conditions precedent, all of which, 
including Section 11 and 102 approvals, Competition Commission and Tribunal approval, Harmony shareholder approval, as well as the release of 
AngloGold Ashanti from the management and rehabilitation liabilities of underground water in the KOSH basin, have been achieved. Consequently, 
the Moab Khotsong and Great Noligwa sale transaction is expected to close shortly.
 
Following the above asset sale transactions, AngloGold Ashanti will have no underground mining operations in the Vaal River region in South Africa. 
AngloGold Ashanti will retain the long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings retreatment operation, as well as the surface rock-dump reclamation 
operations that will continue to be treated through the Kopanang gold plant, which will also be retained by AngloGold Ashanti. These two operations 
in the Vaal River region, together with the long-life Mponeng mine in the West Wits region, will form AngloGold Ashanti's operating base in 
South Africa and contribute 13% of the group's production on a proforma basis.

Work is now underway to ensure that all surface and off-mine costs are appropriate for the new production base and efforts are underway in the 
South Africa region to return it to positive cash flow generation in the second half of 2018.

Maiden Ore Reserve for Gramalote

AngloGold Ashanti announced the maiden Ore Reserve for the Gramalote project of 63.7Mt @ 0.86 g/t gold comprising contained metal content 
of 1.8Moz, on an attributable basis. Gramalote represents a long-term option for AngloGold Ashanti, and all avenues to realise value 
from this important asset remain open. Work will continue to optimise all aspects of the project during its feasibility phase, 
which is currently under way. 

AngloGold Ashanti announced the maiden Ore Reserve for the Gramalote project of 63.7Mt @ 0.86 g/t gold comprising contained metal
content of 1.8Moz, on an attributable basis. Gramalote is a Joint Venture between AngloGold Ashanti (51% and manager) and B2Gold
(49%). The project lies on the eastern flank of the Cordillera Central near the towns of Providencia and San Jose del Nus in the municipality
of San Roque, in the north-west of the Antioquia Department. It is approximately 230km north-west of Bogota and 124km north-east of
Medellin.

The enhanced Pre-feasibility study was completed in September 2017 and the board has conditionally approved its progression to a full
Feasibility Study. The project has several strengths, both externally and intrinsic to the ore and the orebody itself.

-  Relatively low strip ratio of 2.5:1

-  Ability to implement grade streaming to increase early cash flow

-  Exceptionally good metallurgy, resulting in low processing costs and high recovery

-  Adjacent to a National Highway, which connects to a river and seaports

-  Close to the national electricity grid with ample low-cost power

-  Technically capable workforce

-  High levels of community support from an area with an established mining culture

-  Located in a high-rainfall area with good water supply

Mining will be conducted via open pits, starting in the high-grade portion of the main Gramalote Pit and progressing through a series of
cut-backs in Gramalote and in the two satellite pits, Trinidad and Monjas West. Total rock movement rises close to 60Mtpa in the second
year of operation, and remains at that level until the ninth year, before declining. Total material moved includes stockpile re-handling.

The project envisages a SAG-Ball mill circuit along with flotation and leaching, with test work showing the ore performing extremely well
metallurgically. Sulphide and oxide ores will be treated through separate grinding and flotation circuits, optimising operational performance.
The process for both ores involves floating the gold into a low-mass concentrate which is leached, and the benign flotation tails discarded.
The sulphide ore achieves close to 95% overall gold recovery with a very coarse grind size, minimising costs. Recovery from the oxide
ore is about 82%, and remains more profitable than a whole ore leach process.

On-site facilities to be constructed include: a tailings management facility; a creek diversion; residential camp and offices and a 26km high
voltage power line to the National grid, expected to be built and operated by a major Colombian power distribution company.

The project aims at producing a total of 4.22Moz of gold over the life of the mine at a rate of between 300koz and 450koz for the first eight
years, at attractive AISC levels.

AngloGold Ashanti's management is currently in discussions with the Joint Venture partner on how to further progress the project.

Silicosis Class Action Litigation

The settlement negotiations between the Occupational Lung Disease Working Group and class action legal representatives have reached
an advanced stage. The Working Group represents African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields,
Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwater. The class members are represented by Richard Spoor Inc, Abrahams Kiewietz Inc and the Legal
Resources Centre. On 10 January 2018, in response to a request from all parties involved in the appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal
(SCA) in respect of the silicosis and tuberculosis class action litigation, the Registrar of the SCA postponed the hearing date of the appeal
until further notice.

Legislation changes in Tanzania and Democratic Republic of the Congo

Tanzania regulatory update:

In July 2017, AngloGold Ashanti noted the enactment by the Republic of Tanzania's Parliament and publication in the Country's official
Government Gazette of three pieces of new legislation that purport to make a number of changes to the operating environment for
Tanzania's extractive industries, including those in its mining, and oil and gas sectors. For more detail on the legislation, please see
https://thevault.exchange/?get_group_doc=143/1501167539-PR20170713Geita.pdf. On 10 January 2018, the Government of Tanzania
published its new Mining Regulations, 2018, which contains, amongst others, the implementation provisions of the amended Mining
Act. AngloGold Ashanti's subsidiaries are seeking a constructive dialogue with the Government of Tanzania, to gain assurances that our
Geita Gold Mine in Tanzania will not be affected by these legal and fiscal changes, given their Mine Development Agreements which
guarantee fiscal and regulatory stability as well as agreement between all parties before material legal and regulatory changes are
made. In these circumstances, our subsidiaries have, however, had no choice but to take the precautionary step of safeguarding their
interests by commencing international arbitration proceedings as first announced in July 2017. AngloGold Ashanti has, throughout 
this period, sought constructive dialogue with the Government of Tanzania, which has subsequently indicated its willingness 
to engage. The parties will work toward agreeing a mutually agreeable time for those discussions to take place.

DRC regulatory update:

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has recently announced a new mining code that purports to make a number of changes to
the operating environment for the DRC's extractive industries, including those in its mining, and oil and gas sectors. These changes may
impact on the protections enjoyed by AngloGold Ashanti's joint venture (the Kibali gold project), located in north-eastern DRC. The project
is operated by Randgold Resources and is owned by Randgold Resources (45 percent), AngloGold Ashanti (45 percent) and Société
Minière de Kilo-Moto SA (SOKIMO) (10 percent). For more detail on the new mining code, please refer to the following press release
issued by our partner Randgold Resources on 4 February 2018, titled ""Randgold to engage at top level with Congolese government on
new mining code"". The new mining code is yet to receive presidential assent needed for it to be passed into law. AngloGold Ashanti, as
part of an industry initiative, is lobbying against the passage of the legislation of the code in its current form. We are currently assessing
the impact of the new mining code on our joint venture.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Approved

Agreements has been reached with the government of Ghana for the redevelopment of Obuasi Gold mine in Ghana, subject to ratification by 
Ghana's parliament of the relevant fiscal and development agreements. These agreements have been signed by the Government and ratification 
is scheduled during the current parliamentary sitting. The board therefore approved interim funding of $31m to cover the first 6 months, 
for the purpose of project team establishment, project set-up and front end engineering and design, so as not to delay the project.

""We are confident that we have the right redevelopment plan, the strongest possible technical team and a very strong level of support
from the Government of Ghana, which together will help make the project a success, with attractive capital investment for an operation of
this size and returns well in excess of our hurdle rates,"" Graham Ehm, Executive Vice President of Group Planning & Technical said.
""Obuasi will rank among the largest contributors to the company's global production with costs below our current average and will generate
substantial cash flows from the second year of operations, when we see production approaching a rate of 400,000 oz per annum.""

The study into Obuasi's redevelopment has been completed with improvements in returns and payback period. This was achieved with
an improved geological model, an earlier start to production, phasing of capital expenditure and governmental support.

The redevelopment will establish Obuasi as a long-life, modern, mechanised underground mining operation, which is a fundamental
departure from the previous operating method used at the mine. The redevelopment will deliver a mine that makes use of automation
and controls for improved operational efficiencies and consistency in performance. It envisages a smaller, but more skilled workforce that
can operate in a mechanised/automated environment with a strong sense of accountability.

The detailed feasibility study covers every aspect of the mine, including operational methods, systems and processes, environmental
management and mine rehabilitation, organisational design, human resource strategy and social responsibility, among others.

The project implementation will be undertaken in two distinct phases.

- Phase 1 includes project establishment, mine rehabilitation and development, plant and infrastructure refurbishment to enable production
at a rate of 2,000 tons per day for the first operating year. This will take approximately 18 months from the project's commencement, with
the first gold pour expected in the third quarter of 2019.

- Phase 2 includes refurbishment of the underground materials handling system, shafts and ventilation, construction of the primary
crusher, the SAG/Ball circuit, carbon regeneration and a new gold room and tailings storage facility. This will take a further 12 months and
enable the operation to climb to 4,000tpd. The operation will then ramp up to 5,000tpd over the following 3 years.

Mine production for the first 10 years will be focussed on the upper ore bodies and is expected to average 350,000 to 400,000oz at an
average head grade of 8.1g/t. Total cash costs are expected to average between $590/oz-$680/oz, while AISC are expected to be between
$795/oz-$850/oz. Mine production for the second 10 years increases to 400,000 -450,000oz per annum, as the mine deepens into higher
grade ore. AISC is then expected to improve to between $750/oz -$800/oz.

The project delivers internal real rates of return of between 16% and 23% at real gold prices of between $1,100/oz and $1,240/oz, and is highly
leveraged to the gold price.

Initial project capital expenditure anticipated over the first 2.5 years is expected to be between $450m -$500m, excluding pre-production
capital of $64m. After the completion of phase 2, extended project capital expenditure of $94m will continue through to year six, covering
the development of the Obuasi Deeps Decline (ODD) to the lower level of the mine, refurbishment of the KMS shaft, installation of new
underground pump stations and construction of the flotation tailings storage facility.

The project has a current life of more than 20 years. Opportunities exist to further optimise the plan and to extend life by targeting the
mine's significant additional mineral endowment, particularly with down-plunge extensions of the ore body into the Adansi Deeps area
below 50 Level.

The redevelopment of the mine will be led by Executive Vice President Graham Ehm, who led the turnaround of the Geita mine in 2009-
2010. Graham also oversaw the successful development of the Tropicana mine in Australia, which was completed in 2013 on time and on
budget, and has continued to meet all of its operating, geological and financial milestones in the years since. Graham will be assisted by
senior members of the Tropicana project team, including the Senior Vice President of Project Implementation Massoud Massoudi, as well
as senior members of our Ghanaian team, led by Eric Asubonteng, Managing Director of the Obuasi mine, who assisted in bringing the
mine to limited operations status and has been instrumental in negotiations with the Government of Ghana.

Kibali
At Kibali, the underground materials handling system and ore hoisting via the shaft were commissioned and ramp up is progressing well
and according to plan. The paving on the central haulage level was completed during the year, allowing haulage from the ore passes into
the underground crushers to the shaft system. It is expected that the mine will see a significant increase in production once the ramp up
has been completed. Underground produced 505,000t of ore from the declines in the last quarter of the year. In addition, Kibali completed
2.7km of development from the declines during the quarter. Total underground ore tonnes mined for the year were 1.787kt.

The only major capital project remaining is construction of the third hydropower station at Azambi which is expected to be commissioned
in the second half of 2018.

Construction of the next phase of tailings storage facility was initiated during the quarter, providing additional capacity for carbon in leach
(CIL) tails and is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018.

Mponeng Phase 1 and 2 project
AngloGold Ashanti is extending the life of its Mponeng mine initially through the Phase 1 project which aims to access deeper, higher-
grade ore through the development of a decline below the current secondary shaft. The completion of the Mponeng Phase 1 project is
expected around mid 2018. An additional ventilation hole is being created from decline 3 to 116 level to create more ventilation capacity,
along with an ore pass down to 126 level to ease ore handling logistics on 123 level.

The completion of the water management infrastructure on 127 level was delayed during the quarter due to flooding of the emergency
pump station and pump station panels. The emergency pump station is still under construction in the bottom of the decline system. Full
commissioning is expected in the second half of 2018.

The construction and commissioning of the ore handling infrastructure to 126 level is expected to be completed by the end of the first half
of 2018. The ramp-up to steady state of ore reserve development is continuing. The revised geological resource model associated with
the Ventersdorp Contact Reef is currently under review.

Phase 2, under evaluation, would deepen the secondary shaft to further extend its life. The Phase 2 feasibility study for the Mponeng life
of mine project has recommenced, after being interrupted at the end of May 2017 to allow for the completion of a geotechnical study to
determine the most appropriate position of the infrastructure relative to tolerable levels of rock stress.

Sadiola Sulphides project
At Sadiola, AngloGold Ashanti and joint-venture partner IAMGOLD Corporation are evaluating a project to add sulphide-ore processing
capability to the plant. Discussions with the Government of Mali continue regarding the Sadiola Sulphides project. Despite our efforts and
the benefits the project would generate locally and to the Government of Mali, there has been no resolution around the terms critical to
moving the project forward. Although we remain committed to the project, failing to reach an agreement, the operation will enter a restricted
exploitation phase and then at a later stage, when stockpiles are exhausted, it will enter a phase of suspended exploitation (care and
maintenance).

Siguiri
At Siguiri, AngloGold Ashanti is investing about $115m over approximately two years to add a hard-rock plant to the current processing
infrastructure, providing the ability to develop the significant sulphide-ore potential that exists on the current concession. The company is
also building a new power plant at an additional cost of $43m, to provide electricity to the new facility. During 2017, $67m was spent on
the project and a total of $145m has been committed to date. The project remains largely on schedule and the final costs are currently
being reviewed as all major commitments have now been concluded. The mill shells arrived on site in September, and off-site fabrication
and sourcing of electrical and instrumentation equipment and cabling, continued during the quarter. Major contractors have mobilised on
site and transition to a new mining contractor is set to commence in February 2018.

Technology and Innovation
In June 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced a decision to put the TauTona and Savuka operations in orderly closure. In view of this, all
aspects of the technology work conducted were suspended with the exceptions of Thermal Spalling, and High Strength Backfill for
Mponeng Mine.

Thermal Spalling will continue with testing in 2018. In support of the Phakisa industry initiative for mining, AngloGold Ashanti would avail
technologies for future redeployment and continued development by interested parties associated with the Phakisa process.

EXPLORATION UPDATE

Generative Exploration

During the second half of 2017, generative exploration activities were undertaken in Australia, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina and the USA,
completing 41,117m of drilling globally. Total expenditure for the second half of 2017 was $17m.

In Australia, exploration activity was focussed on the Butcher Well and Lake Carey farm-in (""AngloGold Ashanti"" earning 70%), within the
Laverton district. The Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond Drilling (DD) at Butcher Well was completed in early June. 68 RC/DD holes
were completed for 16,000m in the second half of 2017. During this period, the Camp Zone, discovered by AngloGold Ashanti has returned
multiple intercepts of strong mineralisation over 500m of strike and 400m down plunge and is open at depth and to the south. This new
discovery begins at approximately 300m below the surface and has underground potential. In addition, 15 RC holes were completed at
Mt Minnie and defined a zone of gold mineralisation over a 600m strike at shallow depth. Five fences of RC holes spaced at 150m returned
gold intersections at shallow depth, suggesting open pit potential.

At the Oak Dam project, within the Tropicana belt, a large scale geochemical sampling programme was completed. Two significant gold
in soil anomalies were delineated both situated along major structures. A follow up aircore programme is planned for 2018.

In the USA, the reconnaissance rotosonic drill programme at the Celina project in Minnesota, which is 100% AngloGold Ashanti (AGA)
owned, returned no significant results from basal till sampling. AGA has been awarded ~380km2 of new exploration leases in Minnesota
via the annual State Nonferrous Metallic Mineral public lease sale which overlie a prospective geological setting within the Wawa Sub-
province. Passive seismic geophysical surveys were completed. Additional reconnaissance rotasonic drilling is planned for the first quarter
in 2018.

At the Silicon project in Nevada (a 100% earn-in option agreement with Renaissance Gold) surface geochemical, geological and spectral
mapping were completed with a total of 174 samples collected. DD of the main low-sulphidation vein target is scheduled for the first quarter
of 2018.

In Brazil, work concentrated on the Tromai project which covers a ~2,000km2 tenement package (AGA earning 70% from Equinox Gold
Corp; formerly Trek Mining). DD and RC drilling continued (3,112m DD and 3,466m RC the second half of 2017) over known structures
associated with artisanal mining and soil geochemistry. New targets were generated from the aeromagnetic and airborne Electromagnetic
surveys, with further drilling planned for the first quarter in 2018.

In Argentina and Tanzania early stage generative exploration programmes progressed well.

Brownfields Exploration

During the second half of 2017, brownfields exploration activities were undertaken across the globe. Over the period, brownfields
exploration completed 262,468m of drilling for a total expenditure of $34m (capital) and $28m (expensed).

South Africa: The surface exploration drilling activities in operation at the start of the year have been completed and both drill sites
UD58A and UD60 have been rehabilitated and signed off by the respective landowners. The Ventersdorp Contact Reef was successfully
intersected in both surface holes. Piloting of UD63 has commenced and percussion drilling to 400m has been completed. Site
establishment is underway and the foundations have been completed. Percussion drilling at UD61 has been completed to 511m.

Tanzania: Exploration drilling at Geita concentrated on Mineral Resource development drilling programmes at Matandani, Geita Hill
underground Blocks 1 & 2, Nyankanga Block 5 and Star & Comet Cuts 2 & 3 Underground projects, exploratory drilling to test the
Nyankanga 3D Seismic Targets 1 & 5 and reconnaissance drilling at the Selous Satellite target. 200 drill holes totaling 25,262m were
completed.

Significant intersections were reported from Matandani BST, Nyankanga Block 5 and Star & Comet Underground projects, Geita Hill-Lone
Blocks 1 & 2 and the Selous satellite target.

Guinea: At Siguiri, exploration consisted of drilling in Block 1 and Block 2 mine license areas, soil sampling in the Saraya West license
area and the collection of geometallurgical measurements. Total drilling amounted to 26,837m. A total of 6,314m of the Seguelen and
2,663m of Foulata core was XRF scanned for the Geometallurgical study.

Ghana: At Iduapriem, drilling (2,139m) at Block 1W / Nueng continued with field mapping conducted at Nkyemia and Ajopa NW.

Democratic Republic of the Congo: Drilling at Kibali to test the folded BIF model of the main KCD orebody has supported the down
plunge continuity of mineralised system for approximately 600m. A new domain (12000 lode) below the known 9000 lode was intersected
and is interpreted to be the down plunge projection of Sessenge SW some 2.6km up plunge. Mineralisation in this lode is associated with
pyrite and arsenopyrite on the contacts of the BIF. Wide-spaced drilling from underground will begin to test the 12000 lode model.

Near mine exploration activities were focused around the Kombokolo, Makoke, Rhino-Agbarabo, KZD, Kalimva, Ikamva, Ndala North and
the South KZ areas in the second half, drilling a total of 10,251m. Field work was undertaken at Ndala North and the South KZ areas with
the objective of making new discoveries.

Republic of Mali: A total of 8,122m of RC drilling was completed at Sadiola South, Tambali West, Dogofile South, Timbabougouni,
Voyager West, Tabakoto West and Lakanfla. Significant intersections were returned at Sadiola South and anomalous values were
returned at Dogofile south. Both targets were followed up with the Dogofile South results showing no improvement while the results for
the Sadiola South are awaited.

A total of 2,607m DD was completed at FE3, Tambali and Sadiola North focusing on shallow and deep transitional and sulphide potential.
Significant results were obtained from FE3, FE4, and Tambali deep drilling, Sadiola North, Sadiola South and Voyager West.

In Argentina, a total of 2,725m RC was drilled in 26 holes on 12 different structures at CVSA. RC was used for shallow drilling and
scouting in poorly known areas. A DD programme was carried out using two rigs to drill a total of 8,524m in 38 holes covering 10 veins.

An important trenching programme was completed to define new 2018 drilling targets and channel sampling is ongoing. A total of 15,345m
were excavated in 124 trenches and 2,172m of sampling was cut in 71 channels. Trenching was focused in four areas: Antonio, Laura,
Sonia, Vanguardia2 and Vanguardia3 in the NW of the district; Cuncuna and Sandra veins in the East; Serena Sur in the main central
part; and Teresa, El Palo, Laguna del Mineral, Ariadna and Patricia veins in the southern, silver-rich sector of the district. A ground
geophysics programme designed to search for shallow blind structures is also ongoing and will continue in 2018.

In Brazil, at Cuiabá, exploration was focused on underground drilling for ore body extension, Mineral Resource conversion and the testing
of conceptual targets. Deep drilling moved up from L28-30 to L24 to reach the northern hinge of the Cuiaba structure. Regional mapping
and sampling continued around Cuiaba at the Pompeu target. 45% of the soil sampling programme was completed with 582 samples
collected.

At Lamego exploration focused on Carraguem SW ore body where drilling is being undertaken from a hanging wall drive. The results are
promising, especially on the normal limb where the Carraguem ore body shows continuity along with Carraguem SW. Mineral Resource
modelling is in progress.

Córrego do Sítio exploration included underground Mineral Resource conversion drilling at CDSI, and surface Mineral Resource
conversion drilling at Rosalino (CDSI), Pinta Bem (CDSII) and Anomalia I (CDSIII) and Mineral Resource addition drilling at Cachorro
Bravo and Laranjeiras (CDSI). Blue sky exploratory drilling was limited to Anomalia I target. A total of 36,403m were drilled by the
contractor and 12,319m by AGA.

At Serra Grande, a total of 14,557m was drilled. Exploration focused on extensions and infill of known orebodies related to the mining
areas, this included drilling at Orebody IV, Structure III, Inga, Pequizao, Palmeiras and Mangaba. Field work continued on regional leases
and CA's were signed with interested parties.

In Colombia, at Gramalote no drilling took place. Field based exploration focused on rock chip sampling and soil sampling at San Javier,
Santa Barbara, and Encarnaciones targets to continue delineation of the quartz vein system identified in the area. At La Colosa, no
exploration occurred.

At Quebradona, no drilling took place during the second half and work mainly focused on supporting the Pre-Feasibility Study with field
activities, core relogging and geotechnical logging.

In Australia, at Sunrise Dam drilling targeted Vogue Deeps, Carey Shear, Dolly Porphyry, Cosmo, Cosmo East and Elle orebodies, the
Western Area of Vogue 1800, 1600 and 1400 Blocks, down dip extensions to Cosmo, Carey Shear, Elle and Astro North. A total of
45,870m were drilled in the second half.

At Tropicana, extensional drilling at Boston Shaker to evaluate underground potential down dip of the Long Island pit design and minor
infill drilling at Crouching Tiger took place. A total of 9,045m RC and 14,805m of DD, for a total of 23,850m, was completed.

Regional brownfields exploration completed 16,936m of AC, 8,291m RC and 2,993 DD drilling, for a total of 28,220m. A number of
significant intercepts were returned from follow-up RC/DDH drilling at the New Zebra prospect and will be followed up in 2018. AC drilling
was completed at Chocolatini and Don Pedro prospects with no significant results returned. Meanwhile several encouraging results were
reported from AC drilling at Angel Eyes which will be followed up in 2018.

See the Exploration Update document on the Company website: www.anglogoldashanti.com for more details on both Brownfields and
Generative exploration programmes conducted during the year ended 31 December 2017.

DIVIDENDS

In February 2017, the Board approved a dividend policy which provides for an annual dividend to be based on 10% of the free cash flow,
before capital growth expenditure, generated by the business for that financial year. Furthermore, this is subject to the Board exercising
its discretion on an annual basis, after taking into consideration the prevailing market conditions, balance sheet flexibility and future capital
commitments of the group.

Consequently, the quantum of the dividend payout is expected to be volatile as it is based on a free cash flow metric that is subject to
market conditions and is impacted by the level of funding of sustaining capital expenditure. In 2017, due to the significant capital
reinvestment that the company has made at its existing operations, sustaining capital expenditure increased by 19% to $829 million when
compared to the prior year. In line with the approved dividend policy, the board has applied its discretion in adjusting the 2017 free cash
flow, pre-growth capital expenditure metric for the $49m abnormal South African retrenchment costs paid and has approved a dividend of
ZAR 70 cents per share (approximately 6 US cents per share). (Refer to note 19).

The Board is satisfied that subsequent to the dividend declaration, the Company has adequate balance sheet flexibility and sufficient
funding facilities available to withstand market volatility. The continuation of the dividend reflects capital discipline and management's
commitment to improving shareholder returns.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE

The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve for AngloGold Ashanti Limited (AngloGold Ashanti) are reported in accordance with the minimum
standards described by the South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (The
SAMREC Code, 2016 edition), and also conform to the standards set out in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results,
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).

The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Ore Reserve component unless otherwise stated. In complying with revisions to the SAMREC
code the changes to AngloGold Ashanti's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve have been reviewed and it was concluded that none of the
changes are material to the overall valuation of the Company. AngloGold Ashanti has therefore once again resolved not to provide the
detailed reporting as defined in Table 1 of the code, apart from the maiden Ore Reserve declaration for Gramalote. The Company will
however continue to provide the high level of detail it has in previous years in order to comply with the transparency requirements of the
code.

AngloGold Ashanti strives to actively create value by growing its major asset – the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve. This drive is based
on active, well-defined brownfields and generative exploration programmes, innovation in both geological modelling and mine planning
and continual optimisation of the asset portfolio.

GOLD PRICE

The following local prices of gold were used as a basis for estimation in the December 2017 declaration:

forecasts which are prepared in-house.

MINERAL RESOURCE
The AngloGold Ashanti Mineral Resource reduced from 214.7Moz in December 2016 to 208.2Moz in December 2017. This gross annual
decrease of 6.6Moz includes depletion of 4.8Moz. The balance of 1.8Moz reductions in Mineral Resource, results from an increase due
to exploration and modelling changes of 1.9Moz and a reduction due to other factors of 0.4Moz, whilst changes in economic assumptions
resulted in a 3.3Moz reduction. The Mineral Resource has been estimated at a gold price of $1,400/oz (2016: $1,400/oz).

Rounding of numbers may result in computational discrepancies.

SALE OF ASSETS

AngloGold Ashanti announced on 19 October 2017 that it was selling various assets in the Vaal River region of its South African operations.
The sales processes are still underway and therefore do not affect the stated Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve for 2017. However, on
conclusion of the sales the following reductions are expected:

Kopanang:           Mineral Resource                3.02Moz
                    Ore Reserve                     0.36Moz
Moab Khotsong:      Mineral Resource               16.30Moz
                    Ore Reserve                     4.87Moz

BY-PRODUCTS

Several by-products will be recovered as a result of processing of the gold Ore Reserve. These include 40.4kt of uranium oxide from the
South African operations, 0.37Mt of sulphur from Brazil and 21.8Moz of silver from Argentina.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

AngloGold Ashanti has established a Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Steering Committee (RRSC), which is responsible for setting
and overseeing the Company's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve governance framework and for ensuring that it meets the Company's
goals and objectives while complying with all relevant regularity codes. Its membership and terms of references are mandated under a
policy document signed off by the Chief Executive Officer.

Over more than a decade, the Company has developed and implemented a rigorous system of internal and external reviews aimed at
providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The following operations were subject to an external
review in line with the policy that each operation project will be reviewed by an independent third party on average once every three years:

-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Mponeng
-   Mineral Resource at Obuasi
-   Ore Reserve at Obuasi
-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Tropicana
-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Gramalote
-   Mineral Resource at Kibali

The external reviews were conducted by AMEC, Aranz Geo, Snowden, Optiro, SRK and Optiro respectively. Certificates of sign-off have
been received from the companies conducting the external reviews to state that the Mineral Resource and/or Ore Reserve comply with
the SAMREC and JORC Codes.

In addition, numerous internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve process reviews were completed by suitably qualified Competent
Persons from within AngloGold Ashanti and no significant deficiencies were identified. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve are
underpinned by appropriate Mineral Resource Management processes and protocols that ensure adequate corporate governance. These
procedures have been developed to be compliant with the guiding principles of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).

AngloGold Ashanti makes use of a web based group reporting database called the Resource and Reserve Reporting System (R3) for the
compilation and authorisation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting. It is a fully integrated system for the reporting and
reconciliation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve that supports various regulatory reporting requirements including the SEC and the
JSE under SAMREC. AngloGold Ashanti uses R3 to ensure a documented chain of responsibility exists from the competent persons at
the operations to the Company's RRSC.

AngloGold Ashanti has also developed an enterprise-wide risk management tool that provides consistent and reliable data that allows for
visibility of risks and actions across the group. This tool is used to facilitate, control and monitor material risks to the Mineral Resource
and Ore Reserve, thus ensuring that the appropriate risk management and mitigation plans are in place.

COMPETENT PERSONS

The information in this report relating to exploration results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is based on information compiled by or
under the supervision of the Competent Persons as defined in the SAMREC or JORC Codes. All Competent Persons are employed by
AngloGold Ashanti, except for Kibali and Morila, and have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit
under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. The legal tenure of each operation and project has been verified to the
satisfaction of the accountable Competent Person and all Ore Reserves have been confirmed to be covered by the required mining permits
or there exists a realistic expectation that these permits will be issued. This will be detailed in the 2017 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
document.

Accordingly, the Chairman of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Steering Committee, Vaughan Chamberlain, MSc (Mining
Engineering), BSc (Hons) (Geology), MGSSA and FAusIMM, assumes responsibility for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve processes
for AngloGold Ashanti and is satisfied that the Competent Persons have fulfilled their responsibilities. Vaughan Chamberlain has 30 years'
experience in exploration and mining and is employed full-time by AngloGold Ashanti and can be contacted at the following address: 76
Rahima Moosa Street, Newtown, 2001, South Africa.

A detailed breakdown of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve and backup detail will be provided on the AngloGold Ashanti website
(www.anglogoldashanti.com) and www.aga-reports.com.

Independent auditor's review report on the condensed consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended
31 December 2017 to the shareholders of AngloGold Ashanti Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti Limited (the 'company') contained in the
accompanying preliminary report on pages 18 to 36, which comprise the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2017, the condensed consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income,
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the twelve months then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' Responsibility for the condensed consolidated financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated financial statements. We conducted our review in
accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information
performed by the independent auditor of the entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical
requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily
consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and
evaluating the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements of the company for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

1   Basis of preparation
    The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings
    Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings Requirements require
    preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and the recognition requirements
    of International Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements
    as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim
    Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms
    of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are consistent with those applied in the consolidated annual financial
    statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. No new standards were adopted in 2017.

(1) Impairment and derecognition of assets includes the following:

The group reviews and tests the carrying value of its mining assets when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.

During June 2017, due to a change in mine plans to restructure the South African operations, Kopanang mine, TauTona mine including
Savuka section and the West Gold Plant section of the Surface operations in South Africa were fully impaired as they were not expected to
generate future economic benefits.

On 19 October 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced the sale of various assets in the Vaal River Region including the Moab Khotsong Mine
to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (""Harmony"") for a cash consideration of US$300 million. Moab Khotsong Mine was accordingly
transferred to held for sale and written down to the fair value less cost to sell. Refer to note 10 - Non current assets and liabilities held for
sale.

Goodwill has been allocated to its respective CGU's where it is tested for impairment as part of the CGU on an annual basis. Following the
impairment review, goodwill to the value of $9m at First Uranium SA was impaired utilising a real pre-tax discount rate of 9.2% during 2017.
The discount rates for 2017 were determined on a basis consistent with the 2016 discount rates.

Impairment calculation assumptions as at 31 December 2017 – goodwill, tangible and intangible assets

Management assumptions for the value in use of tangible assets and goodwill include:
-  the gold price assumption represents management's best estimate of the future price of gold. A long-term real gold price of $1,240/oz
   (2016: $1,212/oz) is based on a range of economic and market conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the assets.

Annual life of mine plans take into account the following:

-  proved and probable Ore Reserve;
-  value beyond proved and probable reserves (including exploration potential) determined using the gold price assumption referred to
   above;
-  In determining the impairment for each cash generating unit, the real pre-tax rate was derived from the weighted average cost of capital
   (WACC) using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (""CAPM"") to determine the required return on equity with risk factors consistent with the
   basis used in 2016. At 31 December 2017, the derived group WACC was 7.50% (real post-tax) which is 20 basis points higher than in
   2016 of 7.30%, and is based on the industry average capital structure of the major gold companies considered to be appropriate
   peers. In determining the WACC for each cash generating unit, sovereign and mining risk factors are considered to determine country
   specific risks. In certain instances, a specific risk premium was added to large projects being undertaken or the turnaround nature of a
   specific mine to address uncertainties in the forecast of the cash flows;
-  foreign currency cash flows translated at estimated forward exchange rates and then discounted using appropriate discount rates for
   that currency;
-  cash flows used in impairment calculations are based on life of mine plans which range from 2 years to 42 years; and
-  variable operating cash flows are increased at local Consumer Price Index rates.

Litigation claims - Class action
Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti, the
Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 1993
does not cover an ""employee"" who qualifies for compensation in respect of ""compensable diseases"" under ODMWA. This judgement
allows such qualifying employee to pursue a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the Constitutional Court
decision, AngloGold Ashanti and members of the working group (discussed below) have been subject to numerous claims relating
to silicosis and other Occupational Lung Diseases (OLD), including several potential class actions and individual claims.

In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold Mining Company and Sibanye-
Stillwater formed an industry working group on OLD to address issues relating to compensation for OLD in the gold mining industry
in South Africa. The working group now also includes African Rainbow Minerals (""ARM""). The working group remains of the view
that achieving a comprehensive solution which is both fair to past, present and future employees, and sustainable for the sector, is
preferable to protracted litigation. The working group will continue with its efforts – which have been ongoing for more than two
years – to find common ground with all stakeholders, including government, labour and the claimants' legal representatives.

AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold
Mining Company, DRDGold, Randgold and Exploration Company, and Sibanye-Stillwater, were served with a consolidated class
action application on 21 August 2013. The companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they
are defending these. They do, however, believe that they should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining
industry legacy issue.

On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, among other things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising
current and former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and
(b) a tuberculosis class comprising current and former mine workers who have worked on the mines for a period of not less than
two years and who have contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and the dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary
tuberculosis; and (2) that the common law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages
and subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant.
The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: (i) a determination of common issues, on an opt-out basis, and
(ii) the hearing and determination of individualised issues, on an opt-in basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the
claimants. The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought by the Claimants. The amount of
damages has not yet been quantified for any of the class representatives in the Consolidated Class Application or for any other
members of the classes.

AngloGold Ashanti and the other respondents believed that the judgement addressed a number of highly complex and important
issues, including a far-reaching amendment of the common law, that have not previously been considered by other courts in South
Africa. The High Court itself found that the scope and magnitude of the proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that
the class action would address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The respondents applied for leave to appeal against the
judgement because they believed that the court's ruling on some of these issues is incorrect and that another court may come to a
different decision.

On 24 June 2016, the South Gauteng High Court granted the mining companies leave to appeal against the finding amending the
common law in respect of the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused leave to appeal on the certification of silicosis
and tuberculosis classes. On 15 July 2016, AngloGold Ashanti and the other respondents each filed petitions to the Supreme Court
of Appeal (SCA) for leave to appeal against the certification of the class action for silicosis and pulmonary tuberculosis. On 21
September 2016, the SCA granted the respondents leave to appeal against all aspects of the class certification judgement of the
South Gauteng High Court delivered in May 2016. The appeal hearing before the SCA was scheduled to be heard from 19 – 23
March 2018. On 10 January 2018, in response to a request from all parties involved in the appeal to the SCA in respect of the
silicosis and tuberculosis class action litigation, the Registrar of the SCA postponed the hearing date of the appeal until further
notice.

Provision raised

As a result of the progress made by the working group since 31 December 2016 on a variety of issues, management is now in a
position to reliably estimate within an acceptable range the AngloGold Ashanti share of a possible settlement of the class action
claims and related costs. As a result, AngloGold Ashanti has provided for this obligation and recorded an expense of $63m for the
year ended 31 December 2017. The ultimate outcome of these negotiations and the court sanction of the agreement remains
uncertain and accordingly the provision is subject to adjustment in the future.

     Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through
     a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly
     probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed
     to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
     
     Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount
     and fair value less costs to sell.

     Borrowings
     The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing market values at the reporting date (fair value
     hierarchy – level 1) which results in the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining borrowings is reset on

     Fair Value hierarchy

     The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:

     Level 1:    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
     Level 2:    inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)
                 or indirectly (derived from prices); and
     Level 3:    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

     Environmental obligations

     Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and rehabilitate
     the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence, AngloGold Ashanti is required in some
     circumstances to provide either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or provide
     guarantees issued by the operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or such other government department with
     responsibility for environmental oversight in the respective country to cover the potential environmental rehabilitation obligation in
     specified amounts.

     In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are required
     to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.

     In South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti has established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.39bn and guarantees of ZAR 1.52bn
     issued by various banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 1.15bn. In Australia, since 2014, the group has paid an
     amount of AUD $4m into a Mine Rehabilitation Fund for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $113.2m. At Iduapriem the
     group has provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $9.8m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $35.9m issued
     by Ecobank Ghana Limited and Barclays Ghana Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $44.3m. At Obuasi the group
     has provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.3m with a further bank guarantee amounting to $30m issued by
     Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $211m. In some circumstances, the group may be required to post
     further bonds in future years which will have a consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the providers of the
     reclamation bonds.

     Liquidity and capital resources

     To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash resources,
     cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

     Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to
     foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In
     addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

     The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that
     external borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to
     meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that
     sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

     Litigation claims

     (1)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors
           Limited's (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling agreement
           at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation agreement on
           8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a demand issued by MBC claiming a total of $97m.
           In December 2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC submitted the
           matter to arbitration.

     (2)   Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that they
           were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by emission
           and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the Pompora Treatment
           Plant (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory infections, skin diseases
           and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions, but AGAG intends to allow
           some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On 24 February 2014, executive
           members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves and on behalf of their members
           (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic hardships as a result of constant failure
           of their crops. This matter has been adjourned indefinitely. AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have
           the matter struck out for want of prosecution. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a
           liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation in either matter.

     (3)   Litigation - On 19 October 2017, Newmont Mining Co. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District
           of New York against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties, alleging that AngloGold Ashanti and such parties did not
           provide Newmont with certain information relevant to its purchase of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company in 2015
           during the negotiation- and-sale process. AngloGold Ashanti believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously
           defend against it. The matter is proceeding. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability,
           no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

     Tax claims

     (4)   Tax disputes - AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various disputes with tax authorities. These
           disputes involve federal tax assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions, VAT and annual property tax. In
           December 2017, new VAT assessments of $14 million were received. Collectively, the possible amount involved is
           approximately $24m (2016: $15m). Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.

     (5)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office (DIAN)
           that it disagreed with the Company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income and equity tax returns. On 23
           October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax of
           $21m (2016: $21m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes are expected
           to be $129m (2016: $120m). The Company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC
           subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal of
           Cundinamarca (the trial court for tax litigation). Closing arguments on the tax disputes were presented in February and June
           2017 and judgement is pending.

     (6)   Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority (AFIP)
           requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of $6m (2016: $7m) relating to the non-deduction of tax
           losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not be considered as
           hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of hedging contracts.
           Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $21m (2016: $22m). CVSA and AFIP have
           corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are not payable,
           the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives. CVSA filed an appeal with the Tax
           Court on 19 June 2015, and the parties submitted their final reports in July 2017. The matter is pending with the Tax Court.

     Other

     (7)   Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations, which
           have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal studies
           have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable remediation solutions.
           The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated that Monitored Natural
           Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances. Furthermore, literature
           reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use of phyto-technologies can
           address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the technology being a proven
           remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

     (8)   Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep
           groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999
           to understand this potential risk. In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed solution
           needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and Petroleum
           Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine Closure Strategy
           to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate
           estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

18   Impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial
     Instruments

     IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
     during May 2014. AngloGold Ashanti is mandatorily required to apply IFRS 15 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
     1 January 2018.

     Management has assessed the potential impact of IFRS 15 on the financial statements of the group and concluded that the group
     does not sell product based on multiple-element arrangements and it does not sell product on a provisional or variable pricing basis
     and as such the new standard does not have a significant impact on the timing or amount of the group's revenue recognition.
     However, the adoption of IFRS 15 will result in the presentation of by-product revenue in Revenue from product sales where
     previously by-product revenue was included in cost of sales. Revenue from product sales includes gold income and by-product
     revenue. This change in classification results in a corresponding increase in costs of sales, and therefore will not have an impact
     on previously reported gross profit.

     IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
     The Group's financial assets include debt instrument, cash restricted for use and cash and cash equivalents which will be subject
     to IFRS 9 expected credit loss model as they are to be carried at amortised cost. We have evaluated the possible impact of the 
     expected credit loss model and we do not expect the adoption of the IFRS 9 to have a significant impact on total assets, total
     liabilities or the results of the group.

     The accounting policy for listed equity investments will depend on the nature of the listed investment. Listed investments which are
     held to meet rehabilitation liabilities in future will be classified as fair value through profit and loss. Listed investments held for other
     purposes will be classified as fair value through other comprehensive income.

Non-GAAP disclosure

From time to time AngloGold Ashanti Limited may publicly disclose certain ""Non-GAAP"" financial measures in the course of its financial
presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. Set out below are measures extracted from financial information
regularly presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee).

The group uses certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in managing the business and may provide users of this financial
information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. The Non-GAAP financial
measures are used to adjust for fair value movements on the convertible bonds as well as the highly volatile marked-to-market movements
on unrealised non-hedge derivatives and other commodity contracts, which can only be measured with certainty on settlement of the contracts.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or any other
measure of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures that other companies use.

NEWS RELEASE

ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER
2017

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the year ended 31 December 2017 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 20 February 2018.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Operational performance
Full year production is 3.755Moz for the period compared to 3.628Moz for the year ended 31 December
2016 (“comparative period”). Notably, the Company achieved a stronger performance in the second
half of 2017, producing 2.007Moz compared to 1.748Moz in the first half, an increase of 15%. All-in
sustaining costs and capital expenditure for the year remain well within the market guidance provided
for 2017.

Expected headline earnings and basic loss

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that the headline earnings for the
period are expected to be between $16 million and $38 million, with headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) of between 4 cents and 9 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period
were $111 million and 27 cents, respectively.

The basic loss for the period is expected to be between $180 million and $200 million, resulting in a
basic loss per share of between 43 cents and 48 cents. Basic earnings and earnings per share (“EPS”)
for the comparative period were $63 million and 15 cents, respectively.

The expected overall decreases in headline earnings and basic earnings for the period compared to
the comparative period were primarily due to the following reasons, which were previously disclosed to
the market during the course of 2017:

-         non-cash impairment and derecognition of certain of the South African assets and goodwill,
          largely as a result of the restructuring and disposal of the related assets, affecting only basic
          earnings by an amount of $221 million (post-tax) or 53 cents per share (refer to the explanatory
          note below);
-         retrenchment costs relating primarily to the restructured South African operations of $71 million
          (post-tax) or 17 cents per share (cash impact of $49 million); and
-         a once-off non-cash provision in respect of the estimated costs of the settlement of the silicosis
          class action claims and related expenditure, of $46 million (post-tax) or 11 cents per share.

Explanatory note - Impairments of assets and goodwill in the South African region

In the interim results for the half year ended 30 June 2017, the Company reported impairments relating
to the restructuring of certain of its South African business units of $86 million (post-tax). Subsequently,
on 19 October 2017, the Company announced the sale of various assets in the Vaal River region,
including the Moab Khotsong Mine (“the sale interests”), to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited for
a cash consideration of $300 million. As a result of the conclusion of the sale agreements, the Company
reclassified the carrying values of the sale interests in the Company’s financial statements to assets
held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations. Consequently, the carrying values of the sale interests were impaired to the fair value of
the sale consideration at the end of December 2017, which resulted in an impairment charge of
$110 million (net of deferred tax) or 26 cents per share.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

   -     Additional ball mill approved to lift plant throughput and gold recovery
   -     2.1 million ounces of gold production added to the Tropicana business plan

   -     Underground mining potential enhanced by encouraging Boston Shaker drilling results


Tropicana partners AngloGold Ashanti and Independence Group commit to Long Island

(Perth) -- AngloGold Ashanti Australia Ltd (AGAA) is pleased to announce that the Tropicana Joint
Venture has approved Phase One of the Long Island strategy, increasing production from the mine in
the medium term and extending mine life.

Long Island has been driven by developing a more cost-effective way to mine waste. It involves using
a strip-mining approach that minimizes waste haulage distances by using in-pit backfill, rather than
trucking the material long distances to surface waste dumps.

The Tropicana Gold Mine, located 330 kilometers east-northeast of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, is
owned by AGAA (70% and manager) and Independence Group NL (30%).

Phase One of Long Island comprises mining of the Havana South pit and a cutback of the Boston
Shaker pit, which utilizes the completed Tropicana pit as the first backfill location.

The full Long Island strategy adds 2.1 million ounces to Tropicana’s business plan, extending mine life
by approximately seven years to 2027. The project value has been enhanced by the decision to install
a 6MW ball mill in the processing plant, enabling throughput to be matched to the increased mining
rate and improving gold recovery by up to 3% to approximately 92%.

Grade streaming, which prioritizes the processing of higher-grade ore and stockpiling lower-grade
material for processing at a later date, has resumed at Tropicana and will continue through 2018 and
2019. Gold production (100%) is forecast to be between 478,000oz and 492,000oz next year and
between 530,000oz–548,000oz in 2019.

“This project is in line with our approach of developing cost-effective brownfield projects with attractive
payback periods that extend life and improve margins,” said Michael Erickson, AngloGold Ashanti’s
Senior Vice President Australia. “The project validates the innovative ideas developed by our site
team and technical specialists, and also gives us an excellent base from which we can investigate
adding additional value through underground mining opportunities and regional exploration.”




                                                                                                          1
Gold production over Tropicana’s remaining life of mine is now forecast to be about 4Moz. This does
not include potential future underground production from mineralization at the Boston Shaker ore
body, which remains open at depth. A scoping study will lead into a pre-feasibility study on
underground mining in 2018.

The Long Island strategy is underpinned by continued exploration success, evidenced by another
increase in the Ore Reserve to 66.59 Mt grading 1.91 g/t for a total of 4.08 Moz. This represents an
increase of 280,000oz over the past year, even after depletion of about 550,000oz is taken into
account.

Including gold produced to date, Tropicana has delivered a 72% increase in Ore Reserves since the
Tropicana project was approved in November 2010. (Full Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource
information can be found in Appendix B).

Long Island strategy

As part of the cost-effective strip mining approach, waste haulage distances are reduced by using in-
pit backfill. After initially considering mining a starter pit at Havana South to act as a void for waste
from the proposed pit cutbacks, it became apparent from drilling that because there was limited
upside beneath the Tropicana pit, it would provide significant value as a backfill location.

As previously reported, the Long Island concept provides optionality and flexibility, with eight mining
stages and three decision points (see Figure 1 in the full announcement on the AngloGold Ashanti
website: http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/investors/announcements/) giving the opportunity to adjust
to changing economic conditions. If all three phases are implemented mine life will be extended to
2027.

Mining rates at Tropicana have been successfully increased over the past year to more than 90 Mtpa
with the addition last year of a 600 tonne face shovel, de-risking the increase to the Long Island
mining rate of between 95-107 Mtpa. The mining rate will peak at 107 Mtpa in 2019 and continue at
that rate for about four years until the bulk of the Havana pit is mined.

To achieve the additional material movement increase, a second 600t shovel with up to five additional
Caterpillar 793 trucks and supporting ancillary equipment, will be added to the fleet. The capital
expenditure related to Long Island will be approximately A$18 million, primarily for expansion to the
accommodation camp and heavy vehicle workshop infrastructure.

The additional fleet will be provided by Macmahon Holdings as part of the mining contract at the site.

Productivity improvements through AGA’s Operational Excellence programme have resulted in a
reduction in mining costs at Tropicana over the past two years to A$3.07/t using conventional mining
methods. It is anticipated that ongoing mining efficiencies will further reduce mining costs by 5-10%
during Phase One.




Boston Shaker drilling and underground PFS




                                                                                                            2
Diamond drilling beneath the Boston Shaker pit in the second half of 2017 has returned encouraging
intercepts including: 18m at 6.58 g/t from 587m depth (BSD087W1), 37m at 6.49 g/t from 509m
(BSD088); and 20m at 5.82 g/t from 609m (BSD089AW2). See Figure 2 and Figure 3 and detailed
table of intercepts in Appendix A of the full announcement on the AngloGold Ashanti website:
http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/investors/announcements/.

Step out holes BSD090 and BSD091A have confirmed mineralisation up to 1,000m down dip of the
Long island pit design.

Evaluation of open pit grade control drilling shows strong grade continuity in the Boston Shaker
southern ore shoot. This, combined with the thick zones of high-grade mineralisation identified in
recent exploration drilling, suggests the Boston Shaker ore zones will be amenable to underground
mining.

Following a scoping study, which is currently underway, a pre-feasibility study will be carried out in
2018 to investigate potential for underground mining at Boston Shaker with the aim of defining an
underground Ore Reserve by the end of the calendar year. The PFS will include infill drilling and
mining studies.

Successful development of an underground mine at Boston Shaker has the potential to contribute
high grade ore to the processing plant from 2021 onwards.


Approval of additional ball mill

The installation of a second ball mill in the Tropicana processing plant grinding circuit has been
approved. The 6MW ball mill will enable the annual throughput rate to be lifted to approximately
8.1Mtpa and through a reduction in grind size, baseline metallurgical recovery will be improved by up
to 3%, to approximately 92%.

The increased throughput will efficiently match processing capacity to the Long Island mining rate,
and effectively bring forward gold production delivering the best production profile for the operation.
The improved recovery rate will add approximately 160,000 oz to recovered gold over the life of mine.

Total capital expenditure is anticipated to be A$28 million (100%) including equipment, construction
cost and spares, and the new mill is scheduled to be commissioned in Q4 2018. The site has
adequate power generation capacity to cater for the additional mill and no further infrastructure is
required.

Based on mill throughput of 8.1 Mtpa and a recovery improvement of 2.7% in the first year the
payback period will be less than a year.

The additional ball mill follows a range of expansion and optimization projects that have lifted the
throughput rate at commissioning from a nameplate 5.8 Mtpa to approximately 7.6 Mtpa by the end of
2017.

A fines pulping circuit was commissioned in November this year, further improving efficiency and
throughput by minimizing downtime during maintenance shutdowns.



Regional Exploration




                                                                                                         3
Regional exploration at Tropicana in 2017 has been guided by new thinking and work completed
through 2016.

Palinspastic reconstruction and a geological review have provided an updated understanding and
revised interpretation of the regional geology and prospectivity in the belt. The evolution of this work
continues, with inputs from current exploration drilling and further specialist and academic work.

In 2017, a balanced strategy was adopted, comprising resource development at Tropicana, and early-
to-advanced stage exploration regionally.

Advanced exploration continued to evaluate existing prospects (Madras, Voodoo Chile, Angel Eyes,
Springbok) and test the New Zebra anomaly identified through aircore drilling in late 2016. Early stage
aircore drilling was carried out at Chocalatini, Iceburg, Caprioska and Watchtower.

Following highly encouraging results at Boston Shaker in 2017, priority was given to resource
development drilling to evaluate underground potential. This focus will continue in 2018 along with
regional exploration to test new targets identified as a result of the palinspastic reconstruction.


Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource update

As part of the Long Island study a total of 193,554 metres of drilling was carried out between 2015
and 2017 to test the down-dip extent of the Tropicana Mineral Resource at Havana South, Tropicana
and Boston Shaker.

This delivered an increased Mineral Resource which formed the foundation of the Long Island study.

The Ore Reserve (as at 31 December 2017) has increased by 820,000 oz, net of depletion, since 31
December 2016 as a result of the incorporation of Boston Shaker 03, Boston Shaker 04 and the
revised Havana South.

           Criteria                                                                           Commentary
 Sampling techniques                     - AngloGold Ashanti Australia (AngloGold) has used drilling and sub-sampling of the cuttings or cores as the data
                                           basis for the Mineral Resource estimates of the Tropicana deposit. Details are given in the following subsection.
                                         - Drill hole spacing ranges from 25m×25m grids to 100m×100m grids, with most of the drilling of the Open Pit
                                           Mineral Resources on a 50m×50m spacing with 25m×25m testing the starter pits of the Tropicana and Havana
                                           initial pits, and the southern end of the Boston Shaker deposit.
                                         - A 100m×100m area of Havana was drilled out on a 10m×10m grid to validate the resource model and optimise
                                           the grade control sample spacing.
                                         - The Underground Mineral Resource down-plunge extensions of Havana Deeps is tested using a 100m×100m
                                           grid. Deep +800m deep step-out holes have been drilled on nominal ?200m×100m to test the high-grade
                                           mineralisation of Havana Deeps.
                                         - All holes are drilled plunging towards the west to intersect the east dipping mineralised zones


 Drilling techniques                 - Reverse circulation (RC) percussion drilling using face-sampling bits (5 ¼ inch or 133 mm diameter) has been
                                       used to collect samples from the shallower (up-dip) part of the deposits with a nominal maximum RC depth of
                                       150m.
                                     - Diamond core drilling has been used for deeper holes, with diamond tails drilled from RC pre-collars. To
                                       control the deviation of deep DD holes drilled since 2011, many of these holes were drilled from short ? 60m
                                       RC pre-collars or using 63.5mm (HQ) diameter core from surface.
                                     - Diamond core drilling for Mineral Resource definition is predominantly 47.6mm (NQ) diameter core, with a
                                       lesser number of holes drilled for collection of metallurgical and/or geotechnical data using 63.5mm (HQ2,
                                       HQ3) or 85mm (PQ) core diameters.
                                     - In fresh rock, cores are oriented wherever possible for collection of structural data. Prior to 2009, core
                                       orientations are made using the EzyMark tool with the Reflex Ace Tool replacing the system in later drilling
                                       programmes.

        Criteria                                                          Commentary
Drill sample recovery     -   RC recovery
                               o Prior to 2008 semi-quantitative assessment was made regarding RC sample recovery with recovery
                                   visually estimated as 25%, 50%, 75% of 100% of the expected mass volume of a 1m drilling interval.
                               o Since 2008, AngloGold has implemented quantitative measure on every 25th interval where the masses
                                   of the sample splits are recorded and compared to the theoretical mass of the sampling interval for the
                                   rock type being drilled.
                               o AngloGold found that overall recovery in the regolith was >80% and total recovery in fresh rock.
                          -   DD Recovery
                               o DD recovery has been measured as percentage of the total length of core recovered compared to the
                                   drill interval.
                               o Core recovery is consistently high in fresh rock with minor losses occurring in heavily fractured ground
                                   or for DD drilling in the regolith.
                          -   The main methods to maximise recovery have been recovery monitoring as described above and diamond
                              core drilling below ? 150m depth.
                          -   No relationships have been noted between sample recovery and grade and sample biases that may have
                              occurred due to the preferential loss or gain of fine or course material are considered unlikely.


Logging                   -   RC cuttings and DD cores have been logged recording geological and geotechnical characteristics with
                              reference to AngloGold’s logging standard library, to levels of detail that support Mineral Resource estimation,
                              Ore Reserve estimation and metallurgical studies.
                          -   Qualitative logging includes codes for lithology, regolith, and mineralisation for both RC and DD, with sample
                              quality data recorded for RC such as moisture, recovery, and sub-sampling methods.
                          -   DD cores are photographed, qualitatively structurally logged with reference to orientation measurements
                              where available.
                          -   Geotechnical quantitative logging includes QSI, RQD, and matrix and fracture characterisation.
                          -   The total lengths of all drill holes have been logged.

                          -   RC – Primary splitting
Sub-sampling techniques
and sample preparation         o   Prior to 2007 RC samples were collected from the cyclone stream using a tiered riffle splitter. From
                                   2007 a static cone splitter was introduced and replaced riffle splitters on all rigs.
                               o   The RC sampling interval is generally 1m but from 2016 2m intervals were introduced for RC pre-
                                   collars.
                               o   The splitters collected a ? 12% split from the primary lot with two 12% splits collected – the first for
                                   laboratory submission and second as a reference or replicate. Most samples were collected dry with
                                   <2% of samples recorded as being split in moist or wet state.
                               o   The main protocol to ensure the RC samples were representative of the material being collected was
                                   monitoring of sample recovery and collection and assay of replicate samples.
                          -   DD – Primary sample
                               o   DD cores are collected of intervals determined by geological boundaries but generally targeting a 1m
                                   length
                               o   All NQ cores have been half-core sampled with the core cut longitudinally with a wet diamond blade.
                               o   A small amount of DD whole cores have been sampled from HQ3 cores drilled to twin RC holes in the
                                   regolith or for geotechnical or metallurgical testing.
                               o   In 2005, some 1,150m of cores drilled in the oxide zone were chisel split rather than wet cut but this
                                   poorer sub-sampling represents <0.01% of the core drilled.
                          -   Laboratory preparation
                               o   Sample preparation has taken place at three laboratories since commencement of Mineral Resource
                                   definition drilling including SGS Perth (pre- 2006), Genalysis Perth (2006 to April 2016) and Tropicana
                                   site laboratory (2015 Boston Shaker samples and post-April 2016 samples)
                               o   RC samples were over dried then pulped in a mixer mill to a PSD of 90% passing 75 microns before
                                   sub-sampling for fire assay.
                               o   SGS prepared DD half-core samples by jaw-crushing then pulverisation of the whole crushed lot to a
                                   particle size distribution (PSD) of 90% passing 75 microns. A 50g subsample of the pulp was then
                                   collected for fire assay.
                               o   Genalysis prepared the samples in a Boyd crusher rotary splitter combo with nominally 2.5kg half-core
                                   lots crushed to <3 mm then rotary split to ? 1 kg before pulverisation and sub-sampling for fire assay.
                               o   Samples less with mass <800g submitted to Tropicana laboratory are pulped in a LM2 mill to a PSD of
                                   75 microns before sub-sampling for fire assay. Samples with larger masses are crushed in a Boyd
                                   crusher to a PSD of 90% passing 2mm then subsampled using a linear sample divider.
                               o   From May 2016, a jaw crusher has been used to crush half-core samples to a PSD of 100% passing 6
                                   mm.
                          -   Quality controls for representative sampling:
                               o   SGS inserted blanks and standards at a 1:20 frequency in every batch with a duplicate pulp collected
                                   for assay every 20th sample. Further repeats were also completed at a 1:20 frequency in a random
                                   manner. Sieve checks were completed on 5% of samples to monitor PSD compliance.

        Criteria                                                             Commentary
                                 o    Genalysis inserted blanks and standards in every batch and a duplicate pulp was collected for assay on
                                      every 25th sample and 6% of each batch was randomly selected for replicate analysis. Sieve checks
                                      were completed on 5% of samples to monitor PSD compliance.
                                 o    Tropicana laboratory used barren basalt and quartz to clean equipment between routine samples
                            -   Sample size versus grain size
                                  o   No specific heterogeneity tests have been carried out but the sample sizes collected are consistent with
                                      industry standards for the style of mineralisation under consideration.
                                  o   A 2008 sampling variability study found that 72% of the gold in the samples tested was in size fraction
                                      <300 microns, and that repeated sampling of the same lot have very low variance between replicates.


Quality of assay data and   - No geophysical tools were used to determine any element concentrations material to the Mineral Resource
laboratory tests              estimate.
                            - All Mineral Resource prepared pulps have undergone 50g fire assay which is considered a total assay for
                              gold
                            - As discussed above all laboratories have used industry standard quality control procedures with standards
                              used to monitor accuracy, replicate assay to monitor precision, blanks to monitor potential cross
                              contamination and sieve tests to monitor PSD compliance.
                            - AngloGold has also used other ‘umpire’ laboratories to monitor accuracy including Genalysis Perth (prior to
                              November 2006), SGS (from November 2006 to August 2007) and ALS Perth (since August 2007), with these
                              check assaying campaigns coinciding with each Mineral Resource update.
                            - AngloGold has reviewed the quality sample results on a batch by batch and monthly basis and has found that
                              the overall performance of the laboratories used for Mineral Resource estimation samples is satisfactory.


Verification of sampling    -   Significant intersections of mineralisation are routinely verified by AngloGold senior geological staff and have
and assaying                    also been inspected by several independent auditors as describe further below.
                            -   Twin holes have been drilled to compare results from RC and DD drilling with the DD results confirming that
                                there is no material down-hole smearing of grades in the nearby RC drilling and sampling.
                            -   All logging and sample number data is captured digitally in the field using Field Marshall Software (upgrade to
                                Micromine Geobank in 2016). Data is downloaded daily to the Tropicana exploration server and checked for
                                accuracy, completeness and structure by the field personnel.
                            -   Assay data is merged electronically from the laboratories into a central Datashed database, with information
                                verified spatially in Vulcan software. AngloGold maintains standard work procedures for all data
                                management steps.
                            -   An assay importing protocol has been set up to ensure quality samples are checked and accepted before
                                data can be loaded into the assay database
                            -   All electronic data is routine backed up to AngloGold’s server in Perth and provided to IGO via FTP transfer.
                            -   There have been no adjustments or scaling of assay data other than setting below detection limit values to
                                half detection for Mineral Resource estimation work.


Location of data points     -   All early drill hole collar locations of surface holes have been surveyed using RTK GPS equipment, which was
                                connected to the state survey mark (SSM) network.
                            -   The grid system is GDA94 Zone 51 using AHD elevation datum.
                            -   Prior to 2007, drill hole path surveys have been completed on all holes using Eastman single shot camera tools,
                                with down-hole gyro tools used for all drilling post 2007
                            -   A digital terrain model was prepared Whelan’s Surveyors from aerial photography flown in 2007, which has
                                been supplemented with collar data surveyed using RTK GPS. This model is considered to have centimetre-
                                scale accuracy.


Data spacing and            -  The drill hole spacing nominally ranges from 25mN×25mE to 100mN×100mE (local grid) over most of the
distribution                   Mineral Resource area with a small area of 10mN×10mE used for grade control calibration work.
                            - Most of the Open Pit Mineral Resources has been tested on a 50mN×50mE grid with closer spaced
                               25mN×25mE patterns in the upper parts of the deposit within initial open pit designs.
                            - The Havana Deeps area has been drilled on a 100mN×100mE pattern.
                            - Down-hole sample intervals are typically 1m with 2m compositing applied for Mineral Resource estimation work.
                             - The Competent Person considers that data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and
                               grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedures applied, and
                               the JORC Code classification applied.


Orientation of data in      -   Most drill hole are oriented to intersect the shallowly east dipping mineralisation at a high angle and as such,
relation to geological          a grade bias introduced by the orientation of data in relation to geological structure is highly unlikely.

                             - Samples were collected in pre-numbered calico bags, which are then accumulated into calico bags for
                               transport from the collection site. The accumulated samples are then loaded into wooden crates and road
                               hauled to the respective laboratories (Perth or Tropicana).
                             - Sample dispatches are prepared by the field personnel using a database system linked to the drillhole data.
                             - Sample dispatch sheet are verified against samples received at the laboratory and any missing issued such
                               as missing samples and so on are resolved before sample preparation commences.
                             - The Competent Person considers that the likelihood of deliberate or accidental loss, mix-up or contamination
                               of samples is considered very low.


 Audits or reviews           - Field quality control data and assurance procedures are reviewed on a daily, monthly and quarterly basis by

 Mineral tenement and        -  The Tropical Gold Mine Mineral Resources are located wholly within WA mining lease M39/1096, which
 land tenure status             commenced on 11 Mar 2015 and has a term of 21 years (expiry 10 Mar 2036).
                             - Tropicana Gold Mine in a joint venture between AngloGold (70%) and IGO (30%) with AngloGold as manager.
                             - Gold production is subject to WA State royalties of 2.5% of the value of gold value.
                             - There are no material issues relating to native title or heritage, historical sites, wilderness or national parks, or
                                environmental settings
                              - The tenure is secure at the time of reporting and there are no known impediments to exploitation of the
                                Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve and on-going exploration of the mining lease.



 Exploration done by other   -   AngloGold entered in to a JV with IGO in early 2002 with the main target of interest being a WMC gold soil
 parties                         anomaly of 31ppb, which was reporting in a WA government open file report. Prior to the JV, the WMC soil
                                 sampling program was the only known exploration activity and the only dataset available were WA government
                                 regional magnetic and gravity data.


 Geology                     -   The Tropicana Gold Mine is on the western margin of a 700km long magnetic feature that is interpreted to the
                                 collision suture zone between the Archean age Yilgarn Craton to the west and the Proterozoic age Albany-
                                 Fraser Origan to the east of this feature. The gold deposits are hosted by a package of Archean age high
                                 metamorphic grade gneissic rocks.
                             -   Four distinct structural domains have been identified – Boston Shaker, Tropicana, Havana and Havana
                                 South, which represent the same mineral deposit offset by NE striking faults that post-date the mineralisation.
                             -   The gold mineralisation is hosted by a shallowly SW dipping sequence of quartz-feldspar gneiss, amphibolite,
                                 granulite and meta-sedimentary chert.
                             -   The gold mineralisation is concentrated in a ‘favourable horizon’ of quartz-feldspar gneisses, with a footwall of
                                 garnet gneiss, amphibolite or granulite.
                             -   Mineralisation is characterised by pyrite disseminations, bands and crackle veins within altered quartz-
                                 feldspar gneiss. Higher grades are associated with close-spaced veins and sericite alteration
                             -   Mineralisation presents as stacked higher grade lenses within a low-grade alteration envelope. Geological
                                 studies suggest the mineralisation is related to shear planes that post-date the development of the main
                                 gneissic fabric and metamorphic thermal maximum.

 Drill hole Information      -   A summary of the all drillholes used to prepare the Mineral Resource estimate is not practical for this public

 Database integrity          - AngloGold captures field data and drill hole logging directly in to handheld devices or laptop computers using
                               Field Marshall and Geobank software.
                             - The drillhole data is managed in DataShed software, which is an industry recognised system for management
                               of geoscientific drillhole information. Logging, assays and survey information is loaded directly into
                               Datashed using data import routines, with loading procedures incorporating quality control checking.
                             - Data is validated following loading through visual inspection of results on-screen both spatially and using
                               database queries and cross section plots. Typical checks carried out against original records to ensure data
                               accuracy include items such as overlapping records, duplicate records, missing intervals, end of drillhole
                               checks and so on.


 Site visits                 -   The Competent Person makes regular site visits to Tropicana to review the data collection procedures and
                                 discuss the geology and mineralisation of the deposit prior to any Mineral Resource update.


 Geological interpretation   - To control the Mineral Resource estimation process, three dimensional digital solids were prepared in LeapFrog
                               software for the mineralised zones, dykes, shears and garnet (mostly hanging wall) gneiss.
                             - Mineralised solids were prepared using a nominal 0.3g/t AU drill hole cut-off grade to encompass the gold
                               mineralisation targeted for Mineral Resource estimation. The dykes, shears and garnet gneiss solids were
                               prepared from geological logging codes. Regolith units were prepared as digital surfaces below topography
                               based on the geological logging.
                             - The resulting models encompass the mineralisation, the post-mineralisation barren dykes, and the shears
                               controlling higher grade mineralisation and the main waste rock units that are the footwall and hanging wall to

Estimation and modelling   -   The Open Pit Mineral Resource:
techniques
                                o   Has been estimated from the drill hole data available to 16 January 2017, which included 3,666 drill
                                    holes for a total of 702,961 m of drilling of which, 1,101 holes were DD for 387,191 m and 2,421 holes
                                    were RC for 278,683 m. A further 144 holes of RC with DD holes totalled 37,087 of drilling.
                                o   The December 2017 update included 279 new holes (170 RC and 109 DD) for an additional 54,753 of
                                    drilling compared to the prior estimate.
                                o   The drill hole data was composited to 2m lengths within geological estimation domains using Vulcan
                                    software.
                                o   No grade top-cut or caps were applied to the composites, but high-grade estimation limits were applied
                                    to limit the spatial spread of high grades.
                                o   The composite data was declustered in each estimation domain using cell declustering commensurate
                                    with the drill spacing (25mE×25mN or 50mE×50mN and planned kriging panel height (10 m for Havana
                                    and Tropicana, 7.5 m for Boston Shaker)
                                o   Gold continuity was interpreted for each estimation domain and grades for large panels were estimated
                                    using ordinary block kriging in Isatis, with estimation panel dimension 30mE×45mN×10mElv used for
                                    Havana and Tropicana, and panels of 15mE×30mN×7.5mElv for Boston Shaker.
                                o   Sample searches were oriented down dip with a 160mX×160mY×30mZ search used for mineralised
                                    domains and 120mX×120mY×30mZ search in waste domains. A minimum of 8 (or 4 for Boston
                                    Shaker) and maximum of 32 samples were required for a panel grade to be estimated. A second pass
                                    search was then applied to address blocks with >1% negative kriging weights with the maximum
                                    number of samples reduced to 12.
                                o   Selective Mining Unit (SMU) grades were then estimated for each panel using the Local Uniform
                                    Conditioning method, where the SMU grade distribution within each panel is estimated through a
                                    change of support then the SMUs are localised using kriging so the distribution within the panel reflects
                                    the local grade trends in nearby data. The information effect of 12mE×12mN grade control information
                                    was accommodated in the change of support from panels to SMUs
                                o   The SMU dimensions were set to prepare 36 SMUs per panel with SMU dimensions of
                                    10mE×15mN×3.33mElv for Havana and Tropicana and 5mE×7.5mN×2.5mElv for Boston Shaker. The
                                    elevation heights nominally match the mining flitch heights applied at each area.
                                o   The estimate model was validated by comparing (input) data declustered means for each domain to the
                                    respective (output) block estimated grades both globally within each domain and locally using moving
                                    window ‘swath-plot’. On screen visual inspections were also completed in plan and section to ensure
                                    that the grade trends observed in the data were acceptably reproduced in the estimates without over
                                    extrapolation in areas of sparse drilling.
                                o   Comparison of the Open Pit estimate forecasts to mine production indicates acceptable forecasting
                                    performance for monthly, quarterly and annual recompilation periods.

                           -   Eventual prospects of economic extraction for the Open Pit resource have been assessed through pit
                               optimisation studies and reporting the Mineral Resource within pit designs and an optimisation shell.
                           -   Eventual prospects of economic extraction for the Underground Resource have been demonstrated in the 2013
                               study, albeit the project development is not currently economical attractive at current metal prices and costs.

                              in the estimation database with 131,000 from fresh rock and the remainder in the regolith or cover.
                           - Measurements are collected over 1m to 5 m intervals targeting intervals that are deemed representative of key
                              lithology in fresh rock. Density has been collected on core within the regolith from ‘core-from-surface’ drill holes,
                              with the measurement method accounting for voids.

Classification             -   The basis of classification of the Tropicana estimates into different JORC Code confidence categories is drill
                               hole spacing as follows:
                                 o   Measured Mineral Resources: average 25mE×25mN collar spacing.
                                 o   Indicated Mineral Resources: average50mE×50mN collar spacing.
                                 o   Inferred Mineral Resources: average 100mE×100mN collar spacing (or less) when evidence of
                                     geological or grade continuity is sufficient to support grade estimation.

                               ±15% on tonnage or grade on a quarterly production basis, with Indicated Resources have the same confidence
                               but applicable on an annual production basis.
                           -   The Competent Person considers this classification takes in to account all relevant factors such as data
                               reliability, confidence in the continuity of geology and grades, and the quality, quantity and distribution of the
                               data.
                           -   The classification reflects the view of the Competent Person reporting the estimate with the same methodology
                               applied to both the Open Pit and Underground estimates.

                            Australia.
                          - Sensitivity studies have been completed on inputs such a mining and processing costs, gold price
                            and discount rate. NPV has the greatest sensitivity to gold price with an estimated 30,000 ounces
                            lost from the Ore Reserve for a 10% reduction in gold price.

Social                   - Tropicana Gold Mine has all necessary agreements in place with key stakeholders and matters
                           leading to social licence to operate.

Other                    - There are no material naturally occurring risks associated with the Tropicana operation.
                         - There are no material legal agreements or marketing arrangements not already discussed in prior
                           sub sections.
                         - All necessary government and statutory approvals are in place.
                         - There are no unresolved third-party matters hindering the extraction of the Ore Reserve.

Classification           - The Ore Reserve has been classified into Proved and Probable Ore Reserve JORC Code classes
                           based on the underlying MRE classification in the MRE model, with Measured Mineral Resources
                           converted to Proven Ore Reserves, and Indicated Mineral Resources converted to Probable Ore
                           Reserves.
                         - The classifications applied to the estimate are consistent with the opinion of the Competent Person
                           reporting the Ore Reserve.
                         - There is no portion of Probable Ore Reserves derived from Measured Mineral Resources

Audits or reviews        - A Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audit was completed in 2017 and no material recommendation
                           came from the audit
                         - The current Ore Reserve estimate has been reviewed internally by AngloGold personnel

Discussion of relative   - AngloGold has carried out simulation to quantify the confidence in the Ore reserve – refer to the
accuracy/ confidence       commentary at the end of Section 3 above.
                         - The main driver of accuracy and confidence is the spacing of the pre-production drilling, which is
                           captured in the Mineral Resource JORC Code classifications underpinning the Ore Reserve
                           estimates.
                         - Confidence in Ore Reserve inputs is generally high given the mine is operation and costs, prices,
                           recoveries and so on are well understood.

       Criteria                                                  Commentary
                       - The Ore Reserve estimates are considerate to have sufficient local accuracy to support mine
                         planning and production schedules with Proved Ore Reserves considered a reliable basis for
                         quarterly production targeting and Probable Ore Reserves reliable for annual production targets.
                       - Confidence in the mine design and schedule are high as mining rates and modifying factors are
                         based on actual site performance. Mine designs are consistent with what has been effective
                         previously.
                       - The mine to mill reconciliation data to date indicates the forecast precision of the estimates is good
                         with the Ore Reserve estimate slightly conservative.

Tropicana partners AngloGold Ashanti and Independence Group commit to Long Island

(Press Release) -- AngloGold Ashanti Australia Ltd (AGAA) is pleased to announce that the
Tropicana Joint Venture has approved Phase One of the Long Island strategy, increasing production
from the mine in the medium term and extending mine life.

Long Island has been driven by developing a more cost-effective way to mine waste. It involves
using a strip-mining approach that minimizes waste haulage distances by using in-pit backfill, rather
than trucking the material long distances to surface waste dumps. The completed Tropicana pit will
be used as the first backfill location.

Phase One of Long Island comprises mining of the Havana South and Boston Shaker pits ahead of
the next decision point in 2020, on whether to start stripping the Havana Main pit, and the third
decision point in 2022, on whether to commence with the final stages of the Havana Main pit. The
phased approach provides optionality and the flexibility to adjust to prevailing economic conditions.

The full Long Island strategy adds 2.1 million ounces to Tropicana’s business plan, extending mine
life by approximately seven years to 2027. The project value has been enhanced by the decision to
install an additional 6MW ball mill in the processing plant, enabling throughput to be matched to the
increased mining rate and improving gold recovery by up to 3% to approximately 92%.

Grade streaming, which prioritizes the processing of higher-grade ore and stockpiling lower-grade
material for processing at a later date, has resumed at Tropicana and will continue through 2018 and
2019. Gold production (100%) is forecast to be between 478,000oz and 492,000oz next year and
between 530,000oz–548,000oz in 2019.

“This project is in line with our approach of developing cost-effective brownfield projects with
attractive payback periods that extend life and improve margins,” said Michael Erickson, AngloGold
Ashanti’s Senior Vice President Australia. “The project validates the innovative ideas developed by
our site team and technical specialists, and also gives us an excellent base from which we can




                                                                                                        1
investigate adding additional value through underground mining opportunities and regional
exploration.”

Gold production over Tropicana’s remaining life of mine is now forecast to be about 4Moz. This does
not include potential future underground production from mineralization at the Boston Shaker ore
body, which remains open at depth. Following a scoping study, which is currently underway, a pre-
feasibility study on underground mining will begin in 2018.

Tropicana lies about 330km east-northeast of the Western Australian town of Kalgoorlie. AGAA,
which manages the mine, owns a 70% stake and Independence Group NL has the remaining 30%.

The Long Island strategy is underpinned by continued exploration success, evidenced by another
increase in the Ore Reserve to 66.59 Mt grading 1.91 g/t for a total of 4.08 Moz. This represents an
increase of 280,000oz over the past year, even after depletion of about 550,000oz is taken into
account.

Including gold produced to date, Tropicana has delivered a 72% increase in Ore Reserves since the
Tropicana project was approved in November 2010. (Full Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource
information can be found in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd’s ASX Release dated 7 December 2017, on
http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/investors/announcements/).

Mining rates at Tropicana have been successfully increased over the past year to more than 90 Mtpa
with the addition last year of a 600 tonne face shovel, de-risking the increase to the Long Island
mining rate of between 95-107 Mtpa. The mining rate will peak at 107 Mtpa in 2019 and continue at
that rate for about four years until the bulk of the Havana pit is mined.

To achieve the additional material movement increase, a second 600t shovel with up to five
additional Caterpillar 793 trucks and supporting ancillary equipment, will be added to the fleet. The
capital expenditure related to Long Island will be approximately A$18 million, primarily for expansion
to the accommodation camp and heavy vehicle workshop infrastructure.

The additional fleet will be provided by Macmahon Holdings as part of the mining contract at the site.

Productivity improvements through AGA’s Operational Excellence programme have resulted in a
reduction in mining costs at Tropicana over the past two years to A$3.07/t using conventional mining
methods. It is anticipated that ongoing mining efficiencies will further reduce mining costs by 5-10%
during Phase One.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Free Cash Flow Jumps to $88m on Strong Q3 Production

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti generated free cash flows of
$88m in the third quarter of this year, following strong production and cost containment across its
portfolio, as it remained on track to meet its full-year guidance.

Third-quarter all-in sustaining costs (AISC) were unchanged from the same period a year ago at
$1,071/oz, despite inflationary pressure, planned higher capital reinvestment expenditures and
stronger currencies. Production of 997,000oz during the quarter was 11% higher than the same
period a year earlier, and was 9% higher than the previous quarter this year.

“Our strong production performance resulted in good free cash flow generation, despite our
planned reinvestment programme and a flat gold price,” Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan
Venkatakrishnan said. “We expect a strong finish to the year at our key international operations
and continued delivery to tight timelines and budgets on our portfolio-improvement projects.”

AngloGold remains on track to meet full-year guidance and to deliver on its restructuring objectives
in South Africa, where it has taken steps to stem unsustainable losses at some of its operations.
The Company has announced the sale of some South African assets and has earmarked the
proceeds for debt reduction. It will also place loss-making South African operations on care and
maintenance, and is investing in a slate of high return and low capital brownfields projects in its
International Portfolio to extend mine lives and improve margins. These projects remain on
schedule and on budget.

The Company announced last month the $300m sale of its Moab Khotsong mine and related
assets to Harmony Gold Mining Co. and also the sale of its Kopanang Mine and West Gold Plant
to Heaven-Sent SA Sunshine Investment Company Limited, which controls the local Village Main
Reef operation, for R100m, with the proceeds to be applied to reduce debt. The sales remain
subject to certain conditions precedent. Once these sales are complete, and the loss-making
TauTona mine is placed on care and maintenance, an estimated 13% of the Company’s total
production will come from its remaining operations in South Africa.
Production

The South African operations delivered a 10% production volume improvement from the previous
quarter, and a 32% uplift when compared with the first quarter of the year. The International
Operations delivered another strong performance with an 11% increase in production compared
with the third quarter of 2016, driven by stronger contributions from both mines in Australia, AGA
Mineração in Brazil and Siguiri and Geita in Continental Africa.

Safety

The All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR) of the group, the broadest measure of workplace safety, for
the quarter ended September 2017 was 6.98 per million hours worked, a 6% improvement from
7.42 in the second quarter of the year. Sadiola, Yatela, Siguiri, Iduapriem, Obuasi, La Colosa,
Gramalote, Quebradona and Greenfields Exploration achieved an injury-free quarter.

During the quarter, all the South African operations had passed one million fatality-free shifts. The
International Operations recorded 375 days without a fatal accident, as at the end of the quarter.

“Safety is, and always will be, our first priority. We have made strides to improve safety in recent
years – and in particular the past 15 months – but the fatal accidents since the end of the quarter
at our South African Operations, have demonstrated again that victory can never be declared in
this regard. We will be focusing closely on our safe production strategy and also intensifying our
search for continuous improvement,” Venkatakrishnan said.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

The balance sheet remains robust with strong liquidity and long-dated maturities providing
significant financial flexibility. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) was $399m for the quarter, up from $395m in the third quarter of 2016, and 35% more
than the $296m recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Net debt as at the end of the quarter was
$2.063bn, up from $1.972bn at the end of the third quarter of 2016 but lower than the $2.151bn
posted at the end of the second quarter of 2017.

Total sustaining capital expenditure, as a result of planned reinvestments, increased by 18% to
$219m for the quarter, compared to $186m for the third quarter of 2016. Sustaining capital
expenditure for the International Operations increased by 34% to $186m, compared to $140m for
the third quarter of 2016. Sustaining capital projects include a new power plant and underground
development at Geita, increased underground development at Kibali as the new underground mine
ramps up, capitalised stripping at Iduapriem at the cut-back of the Teberebie pit, and the recovery
improvement initiatives at Sunrise Dam. It is anticipated that the sustaining capital expenditure will
peak in the last quarter of the year, in line with the plans.

The outlook for the full year remains unchanged with production of between 3.6Moz to 3.75Moz,
at an AISC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz and capital expenditure between $950m and
$1,050m*.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
Third quarter overview
AngloGold Ashanti delivered $88m of free cash flow for the third quarter of 2017 following a strong operating performance from the
group, with production 11% higher compared with the same period last year and 9% more than the previous quarter. Each of the
operating regions showed improved production over both periods. The group remains on track to meet full-year production, cost and
capital guidance as well as to deliver on its restructuring objectives in South Africa. Our slate of brownfields projects to extend life
and improve margins, remains on track and on budget.

Production rose to 997,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,071/oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2017 compared to
900,000oz for the quarter ended 30 September 2016. All-in sustaining costs were unchanged despite inflationary pressure on costs,
stronger currencies and the group proceeding with planned higher reinvestment expenditures, which were offset by lower
rehabilitation costs, corporate costs and exploration costs. AISC levels for the quarter were driven mainly by higher capital
expenditure levels, which are reflective of the implementation of the Company's inward investment programme.

""Our strong production performance resulted in good free cash flow generation, despite our planned reinvestment programme and a
flat gold price,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""We expect a strong finish to the year at our key international
operations and continued delivery to tight timelines and budgets on our portfolio-improvement projects.""

For the third quarter of 2017, improved production performances were delivered in all regions when compared with the same quarter
in 2016, with the core South African assets continuing their improving trajectory, showing promising operating recoveries from the
prior year's interruptions. The International Operations delivered another strong performance, driven by contributions from both mines
in Australia, AGA Mineração in Brazil and Siguiri, Geita and Iduapriem in Continental Africa. Kibali had improved margins relative to
the previous quarter, but saw lower production compared with the third quarter of 2016, due to lower tonnes treated following conveyor
downtime and issues experienced with the crusher.

Free cash flow generation was $88m for the third quarter of 2017, compared with an outflow of $41m during the second quarter of
this year, and an inflow of $131m in the third quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the quarter was affected by the lower gold price
received, higher operating costs with some currency impact, indirect VAT receivables lock-up principally in Tanzania and the DRC
where this continues to be a challenge, and the planned increase in reinvestment capital expenditure levels.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (""Adjusted EBITDA"") stood at $399m for the quarter, up from
$395m in the third quarter of 2016, and increased by $103m, or 35%, from $296m for the second quarter of 2017.

Net debt as at 30 September 2017 was $2.063bn, up from $1.972bn at the same time last year, but lower than the $2.151bn posted
at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Accordingly, net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.49 times as at
30 September 2017, compared with 1.26 times as at 30 September 2016, but slightly lower than the 1.56 times as at the end of the
last quarter. The current net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio remains well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times under our revolving
credit facilities (""RCFs"").

The balance sheet remains robust with strong liquidity and long-dated maturities providing significant financial flexibility. Undrawn
facilities as at 30 September 2017 comprise approximately $910m available under the $1bn US dollar RCF, A$250m undrawn on the
A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R1.335bn available from South African facilities, and cash and cash equivalents at the
end of the quarter of $177m compared to $276m, at the end of the third quarter of 2016.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) increased by $40m during the third quarter, from $211m for the
third quarter of 2016 to $251m for the third quarter of 2017. Project capital expenditure during the quarter amounted to $32m, up
from $25m during the third quarter of 2016. Capital expenditure is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter, in line with past
trends due to timing of the expenditures.

Total sustaining capital expenditure increased by 18% to $219m for the quarter, compared to $186m for the third quarter of 2016.
Sustaining capital expenditure for the International Operations increased by 33% to $186m, compared to $140m for the third quarter
of 2016. Sustaining capital projects include the planned new power plant and underground development at Geita, increased
underground development at Kibali as the new underground mine ramps up, capitalised stripping at Iduapriem at the cut-back of the
Teberebie pit, and the recovery improvement initiatives at Sunrise Dam. It is anticipated that the sustaining capital expenditure will
peak in the last quarter of the year, in line with the plans.

The outlook for the full year remains unchanged as follows:
-  Production between 3.6Moz and 3.75Moz;
-  Capital expenditure between $950m and $1,050m;
-  Total cash costs between $750/oz and $800/oz; and
-  AISC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz.

Assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of 13.20ZAR (Rand), 3.20BRL (Brazil Real), 0.77AUD (Aus$) and 16.75ARS

Both production and cost estimates assume no labour or other interruptions, or changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines and
have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on
our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been
correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December
2016, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

The underlying operational performance in the third quarter of 2017 was stronger than the same quarter last year, but in 2016 the
group benefitted from inter-alia the following four factors namely: a higher US dollar gold price; much weaker currencies notably the
SA Rand and Brazilian Real and lower capital spend as compared to a high reinvestment year like 2017. In addition, free cash flow
for 2017 was adversely impacted by the VAT lock-ups at both Geita and Kibali.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

Safety Update
The All-Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR) of the group, the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the quarter ended September 2017
was 6.98 per million hours worked, a 6% improvement from 7.42 in the second quarter of the year. Sadiola, Yatela, Siguiri, Iduapriem,
Obuasi, La Colosa, Gramalote, Quebradona and Greenfields Exploration achieved an injury free quarter.

Regrettably, there was a fatality in the South Africa region during the quarter. This fatality was a result of medical complications that
followed a serious injury sustained earlier in the year.

During the quarter, all the South African operations had passed one million fatality-free shifts. The International Operations recorded
375 days without a fatal accident, as at the end of the quarter.

On 1 September 2017, AngloGold Ashanti was awarded South Africa's most prestigious safety accolade at the annual MineSAFE
Conference, for the Mining Company with the best safety improvements, achieved at its ultra-deep mines. The Company's West Wits
gold plants were also recognised as Best in Class in the processing plants category.

""Safety is, and always will be, our first priority. We have made strides to improve safety in recent years – and in particular the past 
15 months – but the fatal accidents since the end of the quarter at our South African Operations, have demonstrated again that victory
can never be declared in this regard. We will be focusing closely on our safe production strategy and also intensifying our search for
continuous improvement,"" Venkatakrishnan said.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
The South Africa region produced 261,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,088/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 235,000oz
at a total cash cost of $997/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Total cash costs increased year-on-year due to inflationary pressures,
mainly from increases in consumables and power costs, lower grades, stronger currencies and unfavourable gold in-process
movements. These were partially compensated by higher volumes and cost efficiencies, which included efficient power consumption
and business improvement initiatives.

In West Wits, production was 93,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,337/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 86,000oz at a total
cash cost of $1,106/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production increased as Mponeng's performance improved by 10% due to higher
tonnages treated, in part reflecting recovery from safety-related production interruptions experienced in the same quarter in 2016.
Following the plan to restructure the South African mines, TauTona's performance was negatively impacted by the downscaling of
operations in anticipation of the transition to care and maintenance, with the final blast occurring on 15 September 2017.

At Vaal River, production was 114,000oz at a total cash cost of $942/oz for the third quarter of 2017, compared to 100,000oz at a total
cash cost of $889/oz in the same quarter in 2016. Production increased from strong performances at both Moab Khotsong and
Kopanang as the mines recovered from safety related production interruptions in the same quarter in 2016. Moab Khotsong, which
delivered improved tonnages year-on-year, was the lowest cash cost producer for the South African region during the quarter at
$757/oz. At Kopanang, the quarter was dominated by proceedings of the Section 189 process along with the potential disposal of the
mine as was announced on 15 September 2017.

Surface Operations produced 51,000oz at a total cash cost of $963/oz for the third quarter of 2017, compared to 47,000oz at a total
cash cost of $1,026/oz in the same quarter in 2016. The production increase was driven by Mine Waste Solutions which, during the
month of September, achieved its highest production level since its acquisition by us in 2012. Tonnages processed increase by 6%
year-on-year, with improved volumes reclaimed across all the respective sites. Studies to improve current trends in gold recoveries
are continuing and operations remain suspended at the flotation and uranium circuit.

The Vaal River surface sources suffered a decline in production as a result of the suspension of the processing of the Kopanang
Marginal Ore Dump (MOD) due to the low grade received and low mill availability, as well as challenges experienced at the Mispah
Gold Plant resulting from the sticky nature of the MOD material. West Wits Surface Sources also saw a slight reduction in MOD tonnes
treated.

The Continental Africa region produced 380,000oz at a total cash cost of $696/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 333,000oz
at a total cash cost of $760/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production increased by 14% compared with the third quarter of 2016,
driven by strong contributions from Geita and Siguiri and a solid performance by Iduapriem.

At Siguiri, production was 83,000oz, up 32% compared with production of 63,000oz the third quarter of 2016 driven by higher ore
tonnes treated given the softer nature of the ore, higher plant utilisation, and 26% higher average recovered grades from mining the
new Seguelen pit which commenced in the first quarter this year. Geita's production was up 21% compared with the same quarter of
last year, mainly driven by higher grades mined, supported by the underground ore. Iduapriem's production increased by 5%, driven
by higher volumes treated from higher plant utilisation, whilst production at Kibali decreased compared with the same quarter of last
year. Kibali's production was impacted by lower plant throughput resulting in 6% lower tonnes treated during the quarter compared to
the same period last year, due to conveyor downtime and challenges experienced with the crusher which are being addressed. The
final commissioning of Kibali's underground operations and the integration and automation of the vertical shaft in the last quarter of
this year, remains on a tight schedule and is key for Kibali to achieve its production target of 610,000oz (100%).

Total cash costs dropped mainly due to the increased production in the region. At Iduapreim, total cash costs were lower than the
prior year quarter as deferred stripping activities at the Cut 3 Teberebie and pre-stripping activities at the Cut 1 Teberebie pit were
undertaken. At Siguiri, the higher recovered grades impacted positively on cash costs as mining was undertaken in the Seguelen pit
in the current quarter.

The Americas region produced 213,000oz at a total cash cost of $673/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 211,000oz at a
total cash cost of $588/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production improvement in the region is attributable to higher tonnes mined
and treated at AGA Mineração. Total cash costs were impacted by the end of the rebate programme on Argentina's Patagonia ports
and lower feed grades in Argentina and some mines in Brazil.

Cerro Vanguardia's production was flat at 71,000oz at a total cash cost of $566/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to a total
cash cost of $529/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Despite higher tonnes treated and higher heap-leach tonnes placed during the
quarter compared to same period last year, lower grades impacted negatively on production due to the variability of the mining model.
The by-product income was lower for the quarter ended 30 September 2017 because of the lower average silver price. Total cash
costs were higher compared to same period last year mainly due to cessation of the rebate programme on Argentina's Patagonia
ports in December 2016. Costs were also impacted by inflationary pressures. These negative effects on costs were partially offset by
favourable stockpile movements due to higher volumes of stockpile inventory, and a weaker exchange rate reflecting the peso's
depreciation against the dollar.

Brazil produced 142,000oz at a total cash cost of $715/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 139,000oz at a total cash cost of
$614/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production was higher due to higher volumes treated, despite lower grades at AGA Mineração.
Total cash costs in Brazil increased reflecting lower feed grades and costs related to higher volume treated, inflation related increases
as well as the unfavourable exchange rate.

AGA Mineração produced 112,000oz at a total cash cost of $692/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 107,000oz at a total
cash cost of $609/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production increased mainly due to a higher production from the Córrego do Sítio
complex, with higher tonnes and higher grades from both oxide and sulphide mining, in line with the revised mine plan. Total cash
costs were higher compared to same period last year due to higher tonnes treated as well as lower grades from the Cuiaba complex.
Cuiaba complex experienced operational challenges, which included geotechnical problems and delays in development that
prevented access to high grade areas. These are being addressed and will translate into improvements in the forthcoming quarters.

At Serra Grande, production was 30,000oz at a total cash cost of $799/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 32,000oz at a
total cash cost of $628/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production decreased for the quarter reflecting operational issues, unplanned
lower feed grades from the open pit, higher underground dilution, model changes and rock mechanical problems.

On 19 October 2017, Newmont Mining Co. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties, alleging that AngloGold Ashanti and such parties did not provide Newmont
with certain information relevant to its purchase of the Cripple Creek and Victor Gold Mining Company in 2015 during the negotiation-
and-sale process. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against it.

The Australia region produced 143,000oz at a total cash cost of $825/oz for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 121,000oz at a
total cash cost of $864/oz for the same quarter in 2016. Production increased by 18% compared to same period last year driven by
higher mill throughput; increased grades and metallurgical recoveries. Total cash costs decreased assisted by the production increase
together with lower maintenance and processing costs at Sunrise Dam, partially offset by the impact of deferred waste adjustments
at Tropicana.

Sunrise Dam's production was 63,000oz, up 24% compared to production of 51,000oz during the same period last year as a result of
higher mill throughput, increased grades, and improved metallurgical recoveries. Strong production is anticipated in the last quarter
as high-grade stopes are mined in the Cosmo ore zone. Tropicana's production was driven by the mill throughput which increased by
15% during the quarter due to plant de-bottlenecking. Capital spend is expected to be higher in the last quarter at both Sunrise Dam
and Tropicana as construction advances on the Recovery Enhancement Project and a wall raise on the tailings facility is undertaken
at Sunrise Dam. At Tropicana, the increase will be driven by the Fines Pulping Project in the processing plant and expansion of the
village to support Long Island. Work on the Long Island Study is expected to be completed in the latter part of the year.

CORPORATE UPDATE
Section 189 and South Africa Asset sales
On 28 June 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced it would embark on a restructuring of its South African business to stem unaffordable
losses by placing some operations on care and maintenance and affecting as many as 8,500 people. The statutory consultation
process with labour unions relating to the restructuring of its South African business, was concluded on 28 August 2017. During –
and subsequent to - this process, job loss avoidance measures were explored, including Voluntary Severance Packages, transfers,
and sale of assets, among others. A dignified and respectful engagement with the affected employees is currently underway, and we
anticipate concluding the bulk of the current restructuring process at TauTona and Savuka by the end of the fourth quarter, as
planned. A summary of the number of employees affected will be provided once this difficult process is complete. Kopanang Mine
and the West Gold Plant have been suspended from the Section 189 restructuring process pending conclusion of the agreed sale to
Heaven-Sent SA Sunshine Investment Company Limited, which controls the local Village Main Reef operation, as announced on 19
October 2017 (""the Kopanang Disposal"").

Following the conclusion of the disposal of the Moab Mining Sale Assets to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, as announced
on 19 October 2017, and the Kopanang Disposal, AngloGold Ashanti will cease to have underground mining operations in the Vaal
River region in South Africa. AngloGold Ashanti will retain the long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings retreatment operation, as well
as the surface rock-dump reclamation operations in the Vaal River region, which will continue to be treated through the Kopanang
gold plant, which will also be retained by AngloGold Ashanti. These two operations in the Vaal River region together with the long-
life Mponeng mine in the West Wits region will form AngloGold Ashanti's operating base in South Africa.

Once the restructuring and the asset sales are completed, AngloGold Ashanti anticipates that about 13% of its production will come
from its South African assets. The proceeds from the sale will be applied to reduce debt, further improving the company's balance
sheet flexibility as it invests in the high-return brownfield projects that will improve the overall quality of its portfolio.

Legislation changes in Tanzania
At the end of June 2017, the Government of Tanzania (GoT), enacted the Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty)
Act, No 5 of 2017, the Natural Wealth and Resources Contract (Review and Re-Negotiation of Unconscionable Terms) Act, No 6 of
2017 and the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No 7 of 2017. AngloGold Ashanti's subsidiaries continue to seek a
constructive dialogue with the GoT, and its agencies, to gain assurances that Geita Mine will not be affected by these legal and fiscal
changes.

On 13 July 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its subsidiaries in Tanzania made a decision to take the precautionary step of
safeguarding their interests under the Mine Development Agreement (MDA), by commencing arbitration proceedings under the rules
of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as provided for in the MDA.

For the full release, please refer to the announcement on the Company's Web site.

Despite the dispute over the legal basis for the increased royalty rate, from 4% to 6%, and the imposition of 1% clearing fee for the
export of gold, Tanzanian officials have insisted upon receipts of such payments as a condition of the release of exports. Whilst our
subsidiaries in Tanzania do not accept that they are bound to pay either new levy, these royalties and fees are being paid under
protest to ensure continued processing of export shipments. The impact of these additional royalties and levies currently is
approximately $20m on an annualised basis. The lack of input VAT refunds has resulted in approximately $40m increase in working
capital for the first nine months of the year. The company continues to engage with the revenue authorities to secure the refunds
due.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi
AngloGold Ashanti remains in advanced and constructive talks with the Government of Ghana with respect to a
Development and other agreements, that will create the necessary regulatory and fiscal certainty required before a decision can be made on
whether and how to proceed with the development of its high-grade Obuasi gold deposit into a modern, mechanised and highly
productive gold-mining operation.

Siguiri
At Siguiri, AngloGold Ashanti is investing about $115m over a little over two years to add a hard-rock plant to the current processing
infrastructure, providing the ability to develop the significant sulphide-ore potential that exists on the current concession. The company
is also building a new power plant at an additional cost of $43m, to provide electricity to the new facility.

As at the end of September, $58.5m has been spent on the project and a total of $141.9m committed. The project remains on
schedule and the costs are currently forecast within budget. All major commitments have now been concluded. The mill shells arrived
on site in September, and off-site fabrication and sourcing of electrical and instrumentation equipment and cabling, continued during
the quarter. Major contractors have mobilised on site and transition to a new mining contractor is set to commence in February 2018.

Kibali
At Kibali, the ramp up of the underground mine which will supplement, and eventually replace open-pit production is currently
underway. The underground operation and the integration and automation of the vertical shaft are proceeding to the final
commissioning and automation stage. It is expected that the mine will see significant increase in production once the final shaft
commissioning has been completed. The anticipated completion of the underground mine is in the fourth quarter of the year. The
vertical shaft construction progressed well during the quarter, completing the underground materials handling system. Paving of the
haulage level and automation development also progressed, targeting the full commissioning and ramp up of shaft ore delivery
system in the last quarter of the year.

Construction of the tailings return water detox facility was completed and commissioned during the quarter, facilitating better water
management. The only major capital project following the underground development would be the Gorumbwa resettlement project,
stripping activities mainly at the Pakaka and Kombokolo pits, and the third hydropower station, Azambi which is on schedule to deliver
its first power in the second quarter of 2018.

Sadiola Sulphide Project
At Sadiola, AngloGold Ashanti and joint-venture partner IAMGOLD Corporation are evaluating a project to add sulphide-ore
processing capability to the plant. Discussions with the Government of Mali continue regarding the Sadiola Sulphide Project. Despite
the benefits the project would generate locally and to the Government of Mali, there has been no resolution around the terms critical
to moving the project forward.

Mponeng Phase 1 and 2 Project
Anglogold Ashanti is extending the life of its Mponeng mine initially through the phase 1 project which accesses deeper, higher-grade
ore through the development of a decline below the current secondary shaft. Phase 2, under evaluation, would deepen the secondary
shaft to further extend life. The completion of the Mponeng Phase 1 project is expected in the second quarter of 2018. An additional

ventilation hole is being created from decline 3 to 116 level to create more ventilation capacity, along with an ore pass down to 126
level to ease ore handling logistics on 123 level.

The completion of the water management infrastructure on 127 level was delayed during the quarter due to flooding of the emergency
pump station and pump station panels. The emergency pump station is still under construction in the bottom of the decline system.
Commissioning is expected by year end.

The construction and commissioning of the ore handling infrastructure to 126 level is expected to be completed by the end of the first
half of 2018 after which the 126 level ramp-up to steady state ore reserve development will commence. The revised geological
resource model associated with the Ventersdorp Contact Reef is currently under review.

The feasibility study for the Mponeng life of mine project has recommenced, after being interrupted at the end of May 2017. The
interruption was planned in order to complete a geotechnical study to determine the most appropriate position of the infrastructure
relative to tolerable levels of rock stress. The study has resumed and the related revised schedule forecasts completion during the
first quarter of 2018.

For details on exploration work done during the quarter, see the Exploration Update document on the Company website.

The financial information, including any forward-looking information, set out in this market update report has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company's external auditors. Outlook data is forward-looking information which is further discussed on the back
cover of this document.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI ANNOUNCES THE DISPOSAL OF ITS KOPANANG MINE, THE WEST GOLD PLANT
AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE

AngloGold Ashanti informed shareholders in a press release on 28 June 2017 that it had entered into a
consultation process with employees in terms of section 189A of the Labour Relations Act (the “Labour
Process”) to restructure its South African operations with the aim of ensuring that this business could be
safely returned to profitability whilst mitigating job losses. This restructuring process included the Kopanang
Mine ceasing mining operations and transitioning to care and maintenance.

Following this announcement, AngloGold Ashanti received a number of unsolicited approaches from
interested parties seeking to acquire the Kopanang Mine, the West Gold Plant and related infrastructure (the
“Sale Assets”). The Sale Assets exclude the Kopanang gold plant and the Kopanang rock dump which will be
retained by AngloGold Ashanti. The Company subsequently embarked on a process to assess the potential
disposal of the Sale Assets. In a press release dated 15 September 2017, shareholders were advised that
AngloGold Ashanti had signed a memorandum of understanding with a selected party regarding the potential
sale of the Kopanang Mine.

AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to dispose of the Sale Assets
to Heaven-Sent SA Sunshine Investment Company Limited (“HSC”), a Chinese capital management company
headquartered in Hong Kong (the “Transaction”). The Sale Assets will be acquired and operated by a South
African subsidiary of HSC (the “Purchaser”). HSC currently holds a 74% interest in Village Main Reef Limited
(“VMR”) which owns and operates the Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in the Vaal River region.

The Transaction will become effective once all the conditions precedent have been fulfilled or, to the extent
possible, waived (the “Closing Date”). The purchase consideration will be settled on the Closing Date by a
payment of R100 million in cash and the transfer of certain gold bearing rock dumps from VMR to AngloGold
Ashanti. The rock dumps will complement AngloGold Ashanti’s existing surface rock dump reclamation
operations in the Vaal River region which are treated through the Kopanang gold plant. In addition, the
Company will transfer to the Purchaser all environmental obligations arising on, before or after the Closing
Date that relate to the Sale Assets.
As highlighted in AngloGold Ashanti’s press release of 15 September 2017, should the Transaction be
successfully concluded, this will have a positive impact on the restructuring its South African operations as
the Kopanang Mine would not be placed on care and maintenance but would continue to operate under the
ownership of the Purchaser albeit with a reduced workforce. Moreover, AngloGold Ashanti has nevertheless
agreed to pay severance packages to all employees employed at the Sale Assets on the Closing Date.

As part of the Transaction, the Purchaser will implement a Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”) transaction
to incorporate the ownership of historically disadvantaged South Africans, including entrepreneurs, the
community and employees of the Sale Assets in its ownership structure.

The Transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent including the following:
-   By no later than 18 November 2017, AngloGold Ashanti, the Purchaser and the relevant unions
    representing the employees of the Sale Assets entering into a Collective Employee Agreement in terms
    of which the parties thereto will, inter alia, agree on the list of employees that will transfer to the
    Purchaser on the Closing Date and a list of employees that will be retrenched as part of the Labour
    Process;
-   By no later than 18 November 2017, the Purchaser entering into agreements relating to its proposed
    BEE transaction;
-   All necessary consents being obtained from the Department of Mineral Resources of South Africa,
    including section 11 and section 102 approvals under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
    Development Act for the transfer of the mining right related to the Kopanang Mine; and
-   Securing the approval of the South African Competition Authorities.

All conditions precedent must be fulfilled or, to the extent possible, waived by no later than 28 February 2018
(the “Long Stop Date”). The Long Stop Date can be extended by the mutual consent of both AngloGold
Ashanti and the Purchaser. As a result of having entered into this agreement, the Labour Process in respect
of the Sale Assets has been suspended and AngloGold Ashanti will continue to operate the Sale Assets until
the Closing Date.

This Transaction is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and this
announcement is made on a voluntary basis.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI ANNOUNCES THE SALE OF VARIOUS ASSETS IN THE VAAL
RIVER REGION INCLUDING THE MOAB KHOTSONG MINE TO HARMONY



1. INTRODUCTION
AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that it has entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the
“SPA”), to dispose of various assets situated in the Vaal River region of South Africa to Harmony Gold
Mining Company Limited (“Harmony”) for a cash consideration of US$300 million (the “Transaction”).

The assets and related interests to be sold include the following:
-  The Moab Khotsong mine (which incorporates the Great Noligwa mine) and related infrastructure (the
   “Moab Mining Sale Assets”);
-  AngloGold Ashanti’s entire interest in Nuclear Fuels Corporation of South Africa Proprietary Limited
   (“Nufcor”); and
-  AngloGold Ashanti’s entire interest in Margaret Water Company NPC (“MWC”) (collectively, the “Sale
   Interests”)

“This transaction is in line with our capital allocation strategy and our aim to effect the improvement of our
global portfolio, through projects that extend mine lives, enhance margins and provide quicker cash turns on
investment,” AngloGold Ashanti Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “We are pleased
to have agreed the sale of the Moab assets on fair terms to a well-established mining company with plans to
secure its long-term future.”

Production from AngloGold Ashanti’s remaining South African operations, comprising the long life Mponeng
mine and Mine Waste Solutions (“MWS”) surface operation, will constitute less than 15% of the Company’s
estimated annual production.



2. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION
AngloGold Ashanti is a global gold mining company with 17 operations in nine countries spread across three
continents. AngloGold Ashanti’s operations in South Africa currently comprise the following:
-   The Mponeng and TauTona mines, situated in West Wits region;
-   The Moab Khotsong mine (incorporating the Great Noligwa mine) and the Kopanang mine situated in the
    Vaal River region;
-   The MWS tailings retreatment operation situated in the Vaal River region; and
-   The surface rock dump reclamation operations located primarily in the Vaal River region.

AngloGold Ashanti’s global portfolio contains a number of brownfields and greenfields development options,
including:
-  The life extension project at the Mponeng mine;
-  The redevelopment of the Obuasi mine and the mine-life extension at Iduapriem in Ghana;
-  The hard-rock project at the Siguiri mine in Guinea;
-  The Long Island project at the Tropicana mine in Australia;
-  The transitioning of the Kibali mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Geita mine in
   Tanzania from predominantly open pit to a combination of open pit and underground production; and
-  The Greenfields development projects in Colombia including the Gramalote and Quebradona projects.

The Moab Khotsong mine also includes a brownfields mine-life extension option (“Project Zaaiplaats”),
currently at pre-feasibility stage, which indicates a potential extension of the life of operations by more than
15 years.

AngloGold Ashanti has a large portfolio of operating assets and a range of attractive brownfields and
greenfields development options with high returns and relatively short payback periods. The Company has a
clear strategy to optimise returns and generate sustainable free cash flow, whilst maintaining balance sheet
flexibility. Given these strategic imperatives and the range of options it has, there is a possibility that
AngloGold Ashanti may not proceed with the development of Project Zaaiplaats in the medium term.
AngloGold Ashanti therefore deemed it prudent, in line with its capital allocation strategy, to sell Moab
Khotsong whilst it still has remaining life from existing Ore Reserves, along with the optionality provided by
Project Zaaiplaats.

Earlier this year, AngloGold Ashanti indicated to its stakeholders that it would be reviewing its South African
mining operations given their under-performance leading to heavy, and ultimately unsustainable, losses
being incurred. On 28 June 2017 AngloGold Ashanti issued an announcement advising that it would be
restructuring the South African operations to ensure their viability. This restructuring would include:
-   Placing on care and maintenance the Kopanang mine and the Savuka section of the TauTona mine; and
-   Evaluating the feasibility of integrating elements of the TauTona mine into the neighbouring Mponeng
    mine;
    (collectively the “South African Restructuring”).

Subsequent to this announcement and based on unsolicited expressions of interest received from a number
of parties, AngloGold Ashanti initiated a process to assess the sale of the Kopanang mine. This process has
been successfully concluded with the announcement today that AngloGold Ashanti had entered into an
agreement in terms of which Heaven-Sent SA Sunshine Investment Company Limited (“HSC”), a Chinese
capital management company headquartered in Hong Kong, will acquire the Kopanang mine, the West Gold
Plant and the related infrastructure (the “Kopanang Disposal”). HSC currently holds a 74% interest in
Village Main Reef Limited which operates the Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in the Vaal River region. The Kopanang
Disposal is still subject to a number of conditions including securing the requisite regulatory approvals. Once
these conditions are fulfilled and this transaction closes, the Kopanang mine will not be placed on care and
maintenance but would continue to operate under the ownership of HSC.

Following the sale of the Moab Mining Sale Assets and the Kopanang Disposal, AngloGold Ashanti will
cease to have underground mining operations in the Vaal River region in South Africa.

AngloGold Ashanti will retain the long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings retreatment operation, as well as the
surface rock-dump reclamation operations in the Vaal River region, which will continue to be treated through
the Kopanang gold plant which will be retained by AngloGold Ashanti. These two operations in the Vaal
River region together with the long-life Mponeng mine in the West Wits region will form AngloGold Ashanti’s
operating base in South Africa.
The table below highlights the pro forma effect on the Company’s South African Mineral Resource and Ore
Reserve as at 31 December 2016 assuming the Transaction, the Kopanang Disposal and the remaining
South African Restructuring had been implemented on 31 December 2016:

3. OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS UNDERLYING THE SALE INTERESTS
The Moab Mining Sale Assets consist of gold and uranium mining operations in the Vaal River region of the
Witwatersrand goldfields, in South Africa.

The primary mining asset, forming part of the Transaction package, is the Moab Khotsong mine, one of the
newer deep-level shafts in South Africa, with development having commenced in 1993. This mine is a
potentially long-life, deep level mine having produced 280,000oz of gold during the year ended 31 December
2016 at an AISC of US$884/oz. As at 31 December 2016, the Moab Khotsong mine had an Ore Reserve of
5.0 Moz and a Mineral Resources of 17.5 Moz which includes Project Zaaiplaats which represents 3.3 Moz
of the total Ore Reserve and 6.8 Moz of the Mineral Resource.

Also forming part of the Transaction package is the Great Noligwa mine, a shaft which has been placed on
care and maintenance in recent years with existing infrastructure utilised to service the Moab Khotsong
mining operations. The Ore Reserve of the Great Noligwa mine is currently being extracted through the
Moab Khotsong mine.

Nufcor is the only uranium calcining facility in South Africa and processes uranium mined and recovered at
the Moab Mining Sale Assets and on behalf of third-party uranium producers.

MWC was established in 2007 by the mining operators in the Vaal River region at the time being AngloGold
Ashanti, Harmony and Simmer and Jack (now owned by Village Main Reef Proprietary Limited), to pump
underground water in order to prevent flooding and to ensure the sustainability of mining operations in the
Vaal River region. In addition, MWC is critical to managing and rehabilitating the underground water of the
Klerksdorp, Orkney, Stilfontein and Hartbeesfontein (“KOSH”) basin over the long term.



4. OVERVIEW OF HARMONY
Harmony is an independent, South African-domiciled gold mining company, which currently owns producing
gold mines located in the West Witwatersrand region and the Free State province of South Africa, as well as
in Papua New Guinea. In addition to these mining activities, Harmony owns and manages significant
extraction and processing facilities at its operations where gold-bearing ore is treated and processed before
it is refined. Harmony is also the joint venture partner with Newcrest Mining Limited on the Wafi Golpu project
in Papua New Guinea. In the financial year to June 2017, Harmony Gold produced c.1.1 Moz of gold at an
AISC of USD1 182/oz.



5. KEY TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION
5.1.   Transaction consideration and use of proceeds
Under the terms of the SPA, Harmony will acquire the Sale Interests from AngloGold Ashanti for US$300
million (the “Transaction Consideration”), which will be settled in cash upon the Transaction becoming
unconditional and closing (the “Closing Date”). The Transaction was classified as a Category 2 transaction
in terms of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements.

The Transaction Consideration received will be utilised by AngloGold Ashanti to further reduce debt and
strengthen the Company’s balance sheet. This will afford AngloGold Ashanti greater strategic flexibility to
fund its growth initiatives including its development projects.


5.2.   Transfer of liabilities and environmental obligations
All of AngloGold Ashanti’s obligations and liabilities (including all employee and health and safety obligations
other than any claim related to Occupational Lung Disease for the period prior to the Closing Date), as well
as all environmental obligations related to the Mining Sale Assets arising on, before or after the Closing Date
will be transferred to Harmony.

Upon acquiring the Sale Interests, all of AngloGold Ashanti’s obligations related to Nufcor and MWC,
including in the case of MWC, all of AngloGold Ashanti’s obligations with regards to the pumping and
efficient management of the underground water in the Vaal River region (the “KOSH Water Directive”) will
be transferred to Harmony.


5.3.   Key conditions precedent and effective date
The Transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent, including but not limited to the following:
-  By no later than 15 January 2018, Harmony entering into agreements relating to its proposed BEE
   transaction as detailed in the Harmony announcement;
-  Harmony securing the approval of its shareholders for the Transaction and its proposed BEE transaction;
-  All necessary consents being obtained from the Department of Mineral Resources of South Africa
   (“DMR”) including section 11 and section 102 approvals under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
   Development Act for the transfer of the mining rights related to the Mining Sale Assets;
-  Securing the approval of the South African Competition Authorities;
-  Waiver by the financing providers of AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony, as required; and
-  AngloGold Ashanti being released from the KOSH Water Directive issued in relation to the KOSH basin,
   in terms of which AngloGold Ashanti is liable for the long-term management and rehabilitation of
   underground water in the KOSH basin.

The Transaction will become effective on the Closing Date which will follow the fulfillment or waiver, as the
case may be, of all the conditions precedent contained in the SPA. All conditions must be fulfilled or, to the
extent possible, waived by no later than six months following the signing of the Transaction (the “Long Stop
Date”). AngloGold Ashanti or Harmony will have the unilateral right to extend the Long Stop Date by three
months, and thereafter the Long Stop Date can only be extended by the mutual consent of both AngloGold
Ashanti and Harmony.



6. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION
Set out in the table below is the carrying value of the net assets, as well as the total comprehensive profit
attributable to the net assets, comprising the Sale Interests:

                                                    Six months ended                  Year ended
                                                      30 June 2017                 31 December 2016
                                                        (Reviewed)                     (Audited)
Total comprehensive profit (ZAR millions)                   214                           852
Net assets (ZAR millions)                                  3,032                         3,027



The estimated tax charge on the Transaction Consideration of US$300m, is approximately US$37m.

It is anticipated that the Sale Interests will be accounted for as assets held for sale in AngloGold Ashanti’s
balance sheet, once it is highly probable that the conditions precedent to the Transaction will be fulfilled, or
waived. As a consequence of this reclassification, the carrying value of the Sale Interests in AngloGold
Ashanti’s financial statements will be impaired to their fair value at that time, which would be determined by
reference to the fair value of the Transaction Consideration that will be received on the Closing Date.

Current estimates indicate that the Company would likely record a gross impairment charge of approximately
US$120m (on a pre-tax basis). However, this does not take account of the deferred tax credit relating to
these assets of approximately US$86m, which can only be recognised upon completion of the
Transaction. These non-cash items will be excluded from the calculation of the Company’s headline
earnings for the period to be reported on next.*

*These amounts are based on management’s best estimates and are based on a ZAR/$ exchange rate of
13.50, and are subject to change.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company’s external auditors.


7. BREAK FEE
In the event that the Transaction does not close due to Harmony failing to:
-    obtain the approval of its shareholders for the Transaction or its proposed BEE transaction; or
-    secure the section 11 consent on the grounds that in the opinion of the DMR, Harmony is not sufficiently
     empowered,

Harmony shall pay AngloGold Ashanti a break fee of US$3 million.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Announces Potential Disposal of Kopanang Mine

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti informed shareholders in a
press release on 28 June 2017 that it had started a consultation process to restructure its
South African operations, with the aim of ensuring that this business could be safely returned
to profitability, whilst mitigating job losses. (“Restructuring of AngloGold Ashanti’s South
African Operations to Ensure Their Viability”).

This restructuring process includes the Kopanang Mine ceasing operations and transitioning
to care and maintenance. Subsequent to this announcement and based on unsolicited
expressions of interest received from a number of parties, AngloGold Ashanti initiated a
process to assess the sale of the Kopanang Mine (the “Potential Sale”).

In this regard, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) has now been signed with a selected
party. This MOU could result in a sale agreement being concluded with the selected party.
Organised labour will be consulted as part of the Potential Sale.

Should the Potential Sale be successfully concluded, this will have a positive impact on the
restructuring referred to above. The Kopanang Mine would no longer be placed on care and
maintenance but would continue to operate under the ownership of the selected party. In
terms of the memorandum of understanding, it has been agreed that the severance benefits
due to all Kopanang employees will be paid out by AngloGold Ashanti on the closing of the
Potential Sale. Should the Potential Sale not proceed, the severance benefits will be paid to
employees on conclusion of the restructuring process announced on 28 June 2017 and the
Kopanang Mine will move to care and maintenance.

The Potential Sale, if concluded, would not be a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements. Whether an agreement to sell the Kopanang Mine is
concluded remains uncertain at this time and any such agreement will be conditional upon
securing a number of regulatory approvals. A further announcement will be made once the
disposal process is concluded.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Sees Strong Q2 Operating Recovery; Projects All on Track

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti achieved a strong second-
quarter operating recovery, set new safety records and kept all of its brownfield projects on
budget and on schedule, as it delivered gold production of 1.748Moz for the first half of the
year. The Company also maintained its full-year cost and production guidance.

“We saw an exceptionally strong operational recovery in the second quarter after a slow start
to the year, and we achieved that whilst setting new safety benchmarks across our portfolio,”
Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “Our brownfield projects are on
budget and on schedule, and we are working diligently to maintain this strong momentum
through the rest of the year. We continue to focus on our long-term strategy of improving the
underlying quality of our portfolio through investment in high-return projects and removal of
loss-making ounces.”

Production was 1.748Moz at a total cash cost of $796/oz for the six months ended 30 June
2017, compared to 1.745Moz at $706/oz in the first half of last year. All-in Sustaining Costs
(AISC) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were $1,071/oz compared to $911/oz in the
first half of last year, reflecting the impact of stronger operating currencies, lower grades, cost
inflation and the planned increase in sustaining-capital expenditure.

AngloGold Ashanti has significantly increased capital expenditure in the first half of 2017,
investing in a slate of self-funded, high-return brownfields projects at its International
Operations, to improve the quality of its portfolio by extending mine lives and improving
margins. The company has also taken steps to remove loss-making ounces from some of its
older mines.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) rose 43%, from $318m in the
first half of last year, to $454m for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The increase was
largely due to increased spend on asset improvements aimed at improving mine lives and
costs profiles across the portfolio.

For the first time ever, three back-to-back quarters passed with no fatal accident at any of the
Company’s operations, including its ultra-deep South African mines which registered 339 days
fatality-free at the end of June 2017. Every operation surpassed a million fatality-free shifts.
Yatela, Geita, Iduapriem, Obuasi, La Colosa, Gramalote, Quebradona and Greenfields
Exploration ended the second quarter with no injuries at all.

Group production in the first six months of 2017 was marginally higher than in the first six
months of last year. The slow production from the South African operations was offset by
another strong performance from the International Operations, with Siguiri achieving a 25%
increase in production due to higher grades. Iduapriem, Kibali, Tropicana and AGA Mineração
also reported solid performances. The Company recovered from the first quarter
underperformance, with second quarter production increasing 11% to 918,000oz, from
830,000oz in the first quarter.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) was
$610m for the first six months of 2017, down 22% from $781m for the first half of last year.
The Adjusted EBITDA excluded the impact of the South African redundancy costs and
impairments but included the impact of the estimated provision in respect of the silicosis class-
action and related costs of $63m. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 June 2017
was 1.56 times compared with 1.44 times at 30 June 2016. The current net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA ratio falls well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under the
company’s revolving credit facility agreements (RCFs), highlighting the success of AngloGold
Ashanti’s continued efforts to maintain financial flexibility.

Full-Year Guidance*

The guidance for the full year remains unchanged as follows:

     o      Production between 3.6Moz and 3.75Moz;
     o      Capital expenditure between $950m and $1,050m;
     o      Total cash costs between $750/oz and $800/oz; and
     o      AISC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz, assuming average exchange rates against
            the US dollar of 13.20ZAR (Rand), 3.20BRL (Brazil Real), 0.77AUD (Aus$) and
            16.75ARS (Argentina Peso), with oil at $48/bl on average for the year.

*Production, overhead and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions or power disruptions, nor changes to asset portfolio and/or operating
mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on
our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Please
refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
31 December 2016, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid first half ended 30 June 2017, reflecting a strong and safe operating recovery in the second quarter
from the first quarter of the year, particularly at its core South African operations. New safety benchmarks were set, with the company
recording three, consecutive fatality-free quarters for the first time in its history. The Company remains on track to meet full-year cost and 
production guidance provided at the beginning of the year in addition to advancing key brownfield projects that aim to improve mine lives and margins.

AngloGold Ashanti has continued its strategic focus on generating free cash flow on a sustainable basis, while ensuring it maintains
appropriate balance sheet flexibility. Having delivered significant achievements in improving its cost structure, balance sheet and portfolio
mix, the Company's management will continue to work to strengthen the foundation of the business by unlocking value at its existing
assets. The execution of its slate of high- return projects with relatively low capital expenditure and attractive payback periods will become
the next source of improved cash flows and portfolio quality enhancements.

""We saw an exceptionally strong operational recovery in the second quarter after a slow start to the year, and we achieved that whilst setting
new safety benchmarks across our portfolio,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""Our brownfield projects are on
budget and on schedule, and we are working diligently to maintain this strong momentum through the rest of the year. We continue to focus
on our long-term strategy of improving the underlying quality of our portfolio through investment in high-return projects and removal of loss-
making ounces.""

Production was 1.748Moz at a total cash cost of $796/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017, compared to 1.745Moz at $706/oz in the
first six months of 2016. Notably, total cash costs in the second quarter of the year improved to $781/oz compared to $813/oz in the first
quarter, as production over that period rose 11% to 918,000oz, from 830,000oz.

Lower grades and the slow production start to the year from the South African operations were offset by another strong performance from
the International operations, with a notable improvement from Siguiri where higher grades helped drive a 25% increase in production.
Iduapriem, Kibali, Tropicana and AGA Mineração also reported solid performances in the first half of the year. The stronger South African
rand and Brazilian real continued to weigh on margins, while the planned increase in capital expenditure on the brownfield project portfolio
also contributed to the higher AISC. The rand and real were both 14% stronger versus the dollar in the first half of 2017 compared with the
first half of last year, while the gold price was only 1% higher.

AISC increased by $160/oz, or 18%, from $911/oz in the six months ended 30 June 2016 to $1,071/oz in the six months ended 30 June
2017. Nonetheless, work is continuing across the portfolio to assess opportunities to reduce and/or prioritise capital spend across the group.

Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by $155m, or 33%, from $476m for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to $321m in the six
months ended 30 June 2017, reflecting higher operating costs and negative working capital movements, partially offset by a 1% increase in
the gold price and a 2% increase in gold sales.

The free cash outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was $161m ($119m outflow in the first quarter alone), with higher capital
expenditure, operating costs, and adverse working capital movements, resulting in a $269m decrease when compared to the six months
ended 30 June 2016. The lockup of VAT receivables in certain jurisdictions in Continental Africa continues to present a challenge, hampering
free cash flow generation.

Adjusted headline loss of $93m, or 23 cents per share was recorded in the first half of 2017, reflecting the South Africa redundancy provisions
of $47m (post-tax) related to potential outcome of the Section 189 process, and an estimated provision in respect of the silicosis class-
action law suit of $46m (post-tax). Excluding the impact of these non-cash provisions, the adjusted headline earnings would have been
neutral for the first half. As a consequence of the restructuring of certain of the South African business units, an impairment of $86m (post-
tax) was recorded in earnings for the period. These impairments are non-cash in nature and are included in the calculation of basic earnings,
but excluded from the calculation of headline loss and adjusted headline loss for the period.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) of $610m during the first half of 2017 decreased
by $171m, or 22%, from the $781m recorded during the same period in 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the South
African redundancy costs and impairments but includes the impact of the estimated provision in respect of the silicosis class-action
law suit of $63m (pre-tax). The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 June 2017 was 1.56 times compared with 1.44 times at 
30 June 2016. The current net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio falls well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under our revolving credit
facility agreements (RCFs), highlighting the success of AngloGold Ashanti's continued efforts to maintain financial flexibility.

Net debt rose by 3% to $2.151bn at 30 June 2017, from $2.098bn at the same time last year. Management remains focused on funding the
capital investment programme whilst paying down existing RCFs at a steady pace, as the opportunity arises. The balance sheet remains
robust, with liquidity comprising $880m available on the $1bn US dollar RCF at 30 June 2017, A$240m undrawn on the A$500m Australian
dollar RCF, approximately R1.5bn available from the South African RCF and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $164m at
30 June 2017.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) increased by $136m, from $318m for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to
$454m for the six months ended 30 June 2017. This increase was largely due to increased investment in asset improvements aimed at
improving mine lives and cost profiles across the portfolio. The capital expenditure in Continental Africa saw an increase of $80m with higher
spend at Geita and Kibali as underground development advances, and at Iduapriem as work continues on the main cutback. In Australia,
expenditure at Tropicana doubled to $48m as mine optimisation work, geared to improve the medium- and longer-term profitability of the
mine, progressed. It is expected that Group capital expenditure will increase in the second half of the year in line with past trends, whilst
remaining within the guided range.

SAFETY UPDATE
AngloGold Ashanti recorded its third, consecutive fatality-free quarter, a first in the history of the Company. This record includes the South
African ultra-deep mines, which have been fatality-free since 27 July 2016. At 30 June 2017, the South African operations recorded 339
days without a fatal accident, a remarkable milestone given the depth and challenging mining conditions that these operations face.

The South Africa region has now accumulated more than seven million fatality-free shifts, including the Kopanang mine which reached a
million fatality-free shifts on 21 July 2017. Moab Khotsong mine achieved 2 million fatality-free shifts and was awarded the 2016 AGA Global
Safety Award for achieving a progressive year-on-year improvement in Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for three consecutive years, a
progressive year-on-year improvement in All Injury Frequency Rate for six consecutive years and sustainable improvements in the
implementation of the Safety Management System over the previous two years. As of 30 June 2017, Moab Khotsong achieved 21
consecutive months without a workplace fatality.

This safety performance improvement is a result of a progressive implementation and integration into daily work routines of the group safety
strategy. The main areas of the strategy include focus on fatality risks by ensuring every employee understands and manages hazards and
associated risks on a continuous basis, that critical controls remain in place with compliance to set work routines, and that there is diligent
reporting of high potential incidents, which are addressed whilst making optimal use of technology.

The group's All Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR) for the quarter was 7.52, a 16% improvement from 8.92 in the first quarter of the year. The
AIFR in the South Africa region was 12.56 injuries per million hours worked, improving 14% compared to the first quarter, whilst International
operations improved by 15% compared to the first quarter.

Yatela, Geita, Iduapriem, Obuasi, La Colosa, Gramalote, Quebradona and Greenfields Exploration recorded an injury free quarter.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South Africa region produced 435,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,092/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to
486,000oz at a total cash cost of $809/oz in the same period last year.

The second quarter registered a recovery from a poor first quarter, whereby the poor adherence to mining schedules experienced in the
first two months of the year - which resulted in poor face-length availability and limited access to higher-grade areas - were largely remedied.
Notably, in the second quarter, there was a 17% increase in production at Moab Khotsong, a 107% increase in production at Kopanang,
and a 22% increase in the production contribution from MWS, in each case, over the first three months of the year. The turnaround at Moab
Khotsong was as a result of production efficiencies, in addition to infrastructure enhancements that led to improved material supply and
increased face time. At Kopanang, where improvements were due to the successful implementation of a revised work plan strategy, the
mine continues to face systemic challenges of a largely depleted ore reserve, low grades and poor efficiencies linked to the distances of
work places from central infrastructure. At MWS, the higher grades reclaimed across the sulphur pay dam and the upgrade to the pump
station boosted volumes.

For the six-month period ended 30 June 2017, the region faced various challenges that impacted negatively on volumes mined with lower
yields presenting the biggest challenge, dropping by an average of 9% year-on-year. TauTona and Mponeng mined in lower-grade areas
as planned, while Kopanang focused on clearing waste tonnes in the shaft ore-pass. AISC for the South African operations for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 were $1,259/oz, compared to $958/oz in the same period of 2016. Total cash costs were unfavourably impacted
by lower output, stronger local currency against the dollar, inflationary pressures mainly related to labour, consumables and power as well
as an unfavourable by-product contribution.

At West Wits, production was 163,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,255/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 214,000oz
at a total cash cost of $786/oz in the same period last year. TauTona's production was significantly lower following the challenges faced
during the first half of the year where fractured ground conditions and inefficiencies were exacerbated by the move into lower-grade areas
as the mine life nears its end. The Savuka section continued at lower volumes as available mining ground was reduced following a decision
to halt the re-opening up project on 116 level for safety and risk reasons. Additionally, the mine continues to suffer production challenges
as this section struggles to recover following the seismic incident that occurred in the second quarter of 2016.

Mponeng's production was lower compared to the same period last year due to changes in the orebody structure resulting in lower tonnes
milled, and was also impacted by the planned move from higher grade areas resulting in 11% lower yield year-on-year.

At Vaal River, production was 174,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,003/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 173,000oz
at a total cash cost of $843/oz in the same period last year. Moab and Kopanang delivered improved volumes in the second quarter after
the slow start to the year. Moab Khotsong's production for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was 3% higher compared to the same period
last year despite the production challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. The turnaround was driven by improved production
during the second quarter. Additionally, logistical improvements, which included enhancements on the chair-lift and material transportation,
resulted in improved material supply and increased face-time.

Kopanang's production was down for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to the same period last year, mainly due to reduced
face values resulting from a lower mining mix and dilution from clearing of waste tonnes in the ore-pass. The mine continued to produce
gold at AISC of $1,682/oz, well above the gold price.

Surface Operations produced 92,000oz at a total cash cost of $970/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017, compared to 93,000oz at a
total cash cost of $797/oz in the same period last year. The operations were impacted by poor performance from hard rock operations, and
constraints in getting material into the Kopanang and West Gold plants in the ore receiving section. Additionally, there was limited mill
availability due to plant shut-down for repairs. A number of measures have been identified which will improve the tonnage throughput at this
gold plant, including completing mill refurbishments by the end of the year.

Production at MWS was up 9% compared to the same period last year mainly boosted by 11% increase in yield from reclaiming higher-
grade areas across the sulphur pay dam and the recent upgrade to the pump station. MWS was the lowest cost producer for the South
African region during the six months at a total cash cost of $783/oz.

An initiative has commenced to correct the significant fall-off in gold reclaimed which occurred in the first quarter of 2017 through the two
circuits servicing the flotation plant. It is anticipated that the flotation and uranium circuits will be recommissioned during the third quarter of
2018.

The Continental Africa region produced 665,000oz at a total cash cost of $721/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to
620,000oz at a total cash cost of $690/oz in the same period last year. Production increased by 7%, mainly driven by stronger performances
from Siguiri and Iduapriem, which benefited from improved grade, whilst Kibali recovered from the prior year setback when production and
costs suffered during the test commissioning of the sulphide circuit. Continental Africa's AISC for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was
$966/oz, compared to $848/oz in the same period of 2016, driven largely by the 91% increase in sustaining capital expenditure, from $78m
to $149m.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kibali's production was 127,000oz at a total cash cost of $870/oz for the six months ended
30 June 2017 compared to 114,000oz at a total cash cost of $802/oz in the same period last year. Production was 11% higher than the
same period last year. Total cash costs increased on the same period last year mainly due to higher strip ratios in the Pakaka and
Komobokolo pits, 14% higher milled tonnes and a slightly lower grade. This was partly offset by a significant improvement is ore recovery
to 83% due to the additional fine grinding capacity and improved management of the various ore types. Power costs were also higher due
to a very low rainfall period resulting in a reduction in hydropower availability. AISC were higher due to sustaining capital expenditure
associated with off-shaft development, additional fine grinding and CIP capacity, and capitalised stripping.

 In Ghana, Iduapriem's production was 107,000oz at a total cash cost of $847/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to
99,000oz at a total cash cost of $931/oz in the same period last year. Production increased 8% as a result of higher recovered grades from
the base of the Ajopa pit, partly offset by a decrease in tonnages treated. Total cash costs decreased by 9% mainly due to the increased
production, also assisted by lower fuel and power prices as the mine benefited from a reduction in regulated fuel levies. Obuasi remained
on the care and maintenance phase while future operational options for the mine are being evaluated.

In Guinea, Siguiri's production was 157,000oz at a total cash cost of $712/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 126,000oz
at a total cash cost of $706/oz in the same period last year. The 25% increase in production was driven by increased recovered grade as
the mine accessed the Seguelen pit, though the cost benefit was partially offset by the longer haulage distance. Further, costs in the six
months ended 30 June 2016 reflected a once-off benefit for a favourable settlement of historical rate adjustment claims with the previous
mining contractor.

In Mali, Morila's production was 12,000oz at a total cash cost of $993/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 13,000oz at
a total cash cost of $965/oz in the same period last year. Production from processing lower-grade tailings storage material continued during
the quarter, partly boosted by an increase in tonnes treated due to the relatively soft ore material. Total cash costs consequently increased
as a result of lower-grade throughput.

At Sadiola, production was 31,000oz at a total cash cost of $862/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 36,000oz at a
total cash cost of $826/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased as the limited operational flexibility in the depleting oxide
material continued with a negative impact on recovered grade, partly offset by an increase in tonnes treated. Total cash costs increased
due to the lower production.

In Tanzania, Geita's production was maintained at 229,000oz at a total cash cost of $555/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017
compared to 229,000oz at a total cash cost of $496/oz in the same period last year. Production was in line with planned decrease in tonnage
throughput, offset by an increase in recovered grade. Total cash costs increased primarily due to higher fuel prices, higher mining and
processing cost per tonne compared to the previous period.

The Americas produced 393,000oz at a total cash cost of $622/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 388,000oz at a
total cash cost of $549/oz in the same period last year. Production was boosted by strong performances by Cerro Vanguardia and AGA
Mineração, both of which had plant improvements. AISC for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were $965/oz, compared to $816/oz in the
same period a year ago. The cost increase is attributable to lower grade and an unfavourable exchange rate.

In Brazil, production was 254,000oz at a total cash cost of $694/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to 252,000oz at a
total cash cost of $545/oz in the same period last year.

At AngloGold Ashanti Mineração, production was 197,000oz at a total cash cost of $642/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared
to 188,000oz at a total cash cost of $531/oz in the same period last year. Production increased by 5% as a result of higher underground
tonnages mined, coupled with improved plant performance at the Córrego do Sítio complex. Total cash costs were higher compared to same
period last year mainly due to the exchange rate impact from a stronger Real against the dollar and inflationary impact, in addition to higher
heap leach costs.

At Serra Grande, production was 57,000oz at a total cash cost of $876/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017, compared to 64,000oz
at a total cash cost of $584/oz in the same period last year. Production was affected by lower recovered grade as a result of a revised
production plan, partially offset by higher tonnage treated. The mine also faced cracking at the underground section of the mine which
necessitated a change in the sequencing at the rock face. Total cash costs were higher because of lower production, exchange rate impact
from a stronger Real against the dollar and higher operating costs.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 139,000oz at a total cash cost of $491/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared to
136,000oz at a total cash cost of $543/oz in the same period last year. Production increased mainly due to higher tonnes treated driven by
operational and metallurgical improvements at the plant together with higher grades resulting from the flexibility of the mining model.

Total cash costs were lower mainly as a result of a favourable stockpile movement due to higher volume of stockpile inventory derived from
higher tonnes mined. Costs also benefited from higher by-product volumes and the favourable exchange rate. These positive effects were
partially offset by an end to the Patagonia ports rebate programme, which ended in December 2016.

In Australia production was 255,000oz at a total cash cost of $775/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2017, compared to 251,000oz at a
total cash cost of $806/oz in the same period last year. Production was slightly higher due to an increase in gold output at Tropicana, which
more than offset a 5% drop in production at Sunrise Dam. The higher production at Tropicana also contributed to lower total cash costs for
the Australia Region for the period.

At Sunrise Dam, production was 107,000oz at a total cash cost of $977/oz compared to 113,000oz at a total cash cost of $858/oz in the
same period last year. Slightly lower mill throughput and a 5% lower mill-feed grade of 2.08 g/t were partially offset by a marginal increase
in metallurgical recovery. The lower head grade was in part due to a negative variance in mined grades in the Astro orebody. Astro is a
minor contributor to future production. A plan is in place to accelerate development and grade control drilling in the Vogue and Cosmo work
areas to lift the mined grade. Total cash costs were higher due to lower gold production and higher underground mining costs, with a 17%
increase in ore tonnes mined compared to the six months ended 30 June 2016. The EPC contract for construction of the Recovery
Enhancement Project was executed during the six months ended 30 June 2017.

At Tropicana (70%) production was 148,000 oz at a total cash cost of $575/oz compared to 137,000oz at $704/oz in the same period last
year. The higher production was due to a 12% increase in mill throughput following completion of the processing plant optimisation and
expansion project late in 2016. The increase in production contributed to lower total cash costs. Work continued during the six months ended
30 June 2017 on the Long Island Study, which is investigating cutback options to the Boston Shaker, Havana and Havana South open pits
utilising short-haul open pit options. These include using the completed Tropicana pit as a void into which waste will be backfilled, reducing
waste haulage costs. The study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Section 189

On 28 June AngloGold Ashanti announced the decision to restructure its South African operations to ensure the future viability of the balance
of its South African business. The company took the difficult decision to begin a consultation process with employees in terms of section
189 and 189A of the Labour Relations Act, with respect to restructuring certain of its South African business units. This follows a review of
the options to safely turn around the performance of these loss-making operations.

Some of our older mines in the South African region have reached the end of their economic lives, several decades after they started
production. These mines face systemic challenges, including near-depletion of ore reserves, increasing depth and distance from central
infrastructure, declining production profiles, and cost escalations that have continued to outpace both inflation and the gold price.

The cost performance of certain operations, notably TauTona and Kopanang, has been a clear demonstration of these challenges, with all-
in costs in the first-half of this year of $1,858/oz and $1,682/oz respectively. This compared with an average gold price over that period of
$1,236/oz. Both mines also sustained significant operating losses in 2016.

This consultation process has commenced with the organised labour groups, facilitated by the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration (CCMA). The consultations are aimed at safely returning the South African business to profitability, whilst mitigating job losses.
While AngloGold Ashanti will make efforts to limit the impact on employment, this restructuring contemplates some 8,500 roles across
AngloGold Ashanti's South African business.

Accounting provision on Silicosis

On 1 August 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced that it had raised an accounting provision in respect of the potential settlement of the
silicosis class action claims and related costs, as a result of the progress made by the Gold Working Group (GWG) on Occupational Lung
Disease (OLD) since 31 December 2016 on a variety of issues. For more information, refer to Note 5 - Special Items in the condensed
consolidated financial statements. The GWG includes AngloGold Ashanti, Anglo American South Africa, Gold Field, Harmony Gold Mining
Company and Sibanye Gold and was formed in November 2014 to address issues relating to compensation for OLD in the gold mining
industry in South Africa. African Rainbow Minerals have subsequently joined the working group.

Passage of New Legislation in Tanzania

AngloGold Ashanti noted the enactment by the Republic of Tanzania's Parliament and publication in the Country's official Government
Gazette of the Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty) Act, No 5 of 2017, the Natural Wealth and Resources Contracts
(Review and Re-Negotiation of Unconscionable Terms) Act, No 6 of 2017 and the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) 
Act, No 7 of 2017.

AngloGold Ashanti's indirect subsidiaries, Samax Resources Limited and Geita Gold Mining Limited (the Subsidiaries), are parties to a Mine
Development Agreement (MDA) in relation to the development and operation of the Geita gold mine in Tanzania (Geita Mine), which governs
the relationship between the Subsidiaries and the Government of Tanzania (GoT) in relation to Geita Mine. The MDA was instrumental in
the decision to make the significant investment in the development of Geita Mine, at a time of significantly lower gold prices and when
Tanzania was an untested jurisdiction for new mine development.

The three pieces of new legislation in question purport to make a number of changes to the operating environment for Tanzania's extractive
industries, including those in its mining, and oil and gas sectors. These changes include, among others: the right for the Government of
Tanzania (GoT) to renegotiate existing MDAs at its discretion; the provision to the GoT of a non-dilutable, free-carried interest of no less
than 16% in all mining projects; the right for the Government to acquire up to 50% of any mining asset commensurate with the value of tax
benefits provided to the owner of that asset by the GoT; removal of the refund of input VAT incurred; an increase in the rate of revenue
royalties from 4% to 6%; requirements for local beneficiation and procurement; and constraints on the operation of off-shore bank accounts.

AngloGold Ashanti's subsidiaries are seeking a constructive dialogue with the GoT, and its agencies, to gain assurances that Geita Mine
will not be affected by these legal and fiscal changes. On 13 July, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its subsidiaries in Tanzania made a
decision to take the precautionary step of safeguarding their interests under the Mine Development Agreement (MDA), by commencing
arbitration proceedings under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as provided for in the MDA.

For the full release see: http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/en/Media/news/Pages/20170713_Geita.aspx

Despite the dispute over the legal basis for the increased royalty rate, from 4% to 6%, and the imposition of 1% clearing fee for the export
of gold, Tanzanian officials have insisted upon receipts for such payments as a condition of the release of exports. Whilst our subsidiaries
in Tanzania do not accept that they are bound to pay either new levy, these are being paid under protest to ensure continued processing of
export shipments.

In addition to the abovementioned legislation, the Government amended the Minimum (Mining Shareholding and Public Offering) Regulations on 
24 February 2017, by publishing the Mining (Minimum Shareholding and Public Offering) (Amendment) Regulations, 2017 (as revised, the Mandatory 
Listing Regulations). This requires companies with a Special Mining Licence (SML) to float 30% of their total issued shares on the Dar es 
Salaam Stock Exchange in Tanzania by 24 August 2017. The regulations contemplate the possibility that a company may proceed with a listing 
and fail to secure the minimum local shareholding. In such circumstances the Minister of Energy and Minerals may at the request of the company 
and on the recommendation of the Capital Markets and Securities Authority grant a waiver to the minimum local shareholding requirement. 
 
The Subsidiaries' position is that the Mandatory Listing Regulations ought not apply to them for a number of legal and practical reasons, 
including being inconsistent with the provisions of the MDA. The Subsidiaries are in ongoing engagement with all levels of Government.

OBUASI UPDATE

On 8 April 2016, AngloGold (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) filed a request for arbitration against the Republic of Ghana (GoG). AGAG filed this
request with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an international arbitration institution headquartered in
Washington, D.C., which facilitates dispute resolution between international investors and host states. AGAG is seeking relief from GoG for
breaching the provisions of its Mining Lease by failing to restore law and order on its Mining Lease after the incursion of illegal miners. These
actions prevented AGAG from peaceful enjoyment of the areas covered under its Mining Lease. GoG may raise counterclaims against
AGAG in response to AGAG's request for arbitration.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Kibali

All four new Ultra Fine Grind mills and the pump-cell circuit have been commissioned and are now in operation. The second hydropower
plant at Amburau was commissioned in the first quarter taking hydropower capacity to 32MW. The third hydropower plant at Azambi remains
on schedule with first power expected in the second quarter of 2018.

The underground declines completed 2.5km of capital development, while the shaft material handling system progressed according to plan
during the quarter; commissioning is scheduled to begin in the third quarter. First ore from underground via the shaft is now scheduled for
the last quarter of the year.

The Gorumbwa resettlement programme is progressing on schedule, with the first phase of housing and community infrastructure already
handed over. A regional development plan, including health, education and infrastructure was also agreed with the Provincial Governor,
which will be rolled out in partnership with the state to improve living standards in the area.

Mponeng Phase 1 and 2

The Mponeng Phase 1 project infrastructure construction continued ahead of schedule. The commissioning of the MC3 conveyor belt was
completed during the second quarter. This is the main conveyor which is a component of the ore handling system that transfers onto existing
MC2 conveyor. The MC3 will transport the reef and waste from the lower production level - the 126 level - in the decline. Prior to the MC3
conveyor belt, the rock was transported by dump truck up to 123 level. The remainder of the project milestones pertaining to the construction
of ore handling infrastructure, as well as the water handling infrastructure, reef pass from 123 level, ventilation pass and secondary support,
remain ahead of schedule and are anticipated to be completed during the third quarter of 2017.

The ramp-up of ore reserve development on the eastern side of 126L has hit challenging ground conditions, requiring rehabilitation that has
delayed the ore reserve development schedule. The ramp-up on the western side, however, has continued according to
schedule. Production ramp-up from 126L is anticipated in early 2018.

The feasibility study for the life of mine extension project continues with an anticipated completion and Board ratification date set for Quarter
3 2018. Due to current capital constraints, the early work associated with the life of mine extension project (inclusive of the original Phase
2 early works) has been deferred and will continue upon project approval being granted post the completion of the feasibility study.

Siguiri Combination Plant

The project remains on schedule. All major goods and services required for the project have been sourced and contracted, and are in the
process of mobilisation and establishment in accordance with the project delivery timelines.

During the second quarter, the major contracts for the power plant construction, EPCM Services and Civil construction works were
adjudicated and awarded. The establishment of the on-site construction camp has also been completed.

The main mechanical contract has been adjudicated and will be awarded in the third quarter of 2017.

Sadiola Sulphide Project

At this time there has been no change in the status of the Sadiola Sulphide Project. Discussions with the Government of Mali continue. A
decision to move forward will be contingent upon the Government's renewal of the construction and operating permits, the power agreement
and fiscal terms related to the Project. In parallel, a review of the current life-of-mine plan is being undertaken.

GREENFIELDS

Greenfields exploration activities were undertaken in Australia, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, USA, and Tanzania during the first half of the
year. Greenfields exploration completed 21,502m of drilling globally during the six months ended 30 June 2017, with total expenditure
amounting to $14m.

In Australia, exploration activity was focussed on the Butcher Well and Lake Carey farm-in (AngloGold Ashanti earning 70%), within the
Laverton district. The RC and diamond drilling at Butcher Well was completed in early June. In first half of the year, 24 RC/diamond holes
were completed for 9,962m. The steeply west-dipping Enigmatic zone extends down-dip to a vertical depth beyond 400m. Intercepts of 
5m @ 4.15g/t Au from 322m in BWD022 and 17m @ 7.79g/t Au from 375 m in BWD023* define a thicker and higher-grade shoot within the
zone. These holes confirm the intersection of drill hole BWD013, which returned 20.7m @ 6.06g/t Au from 351m. A new mineralised zone
has been identified 200m East of the Southern part of the Enigmatic pit. Hole BWD018 intersected 14m @ 6.15g/t Au from 394m, 
10m @ 5.05g/t Au from 459m and 12m @ 4.08g/t Au from 475m, and hole BWD026 intersected 4m @ 5.90g/t Au from 300m. Hole BWD020 drilled
300m to the South intersected 8m at 5.4g/t Au from 342m. This discovery is named the Old Camp zone with these intersections open both
laterally and vertically.

The Mt Minnie aircore drilling programme started early in June. The Mt Minnie structure extends for 10km in a north-south orientation and
forms the northern extension of the Butcher well system. A total of 107 holes were drilled in the second quarter for 6,433m. A ground gravity
programme of approximately 15,000 stations at 100m spacing has been completed over the western part of the Butcher well district. At the
Oak Dam project, within the Tropicana belt (Tropicana JV with 70% AngloGold Ashanti), geochemical sampling, using vacuum drilling,
started in early June. A total of 768 holes have been completed, the remaining 1,400 holes should be completed by end of the third quarter.
Assay results are pending.

In the United States of America, a reconnaissance rotosonic drill programme was completed at the Celina Project in Minnesota 
(100% AngloGold Ashanti) with 29 holes drilled for 1,034m. Early in the first quarter, a regional magnetic airborne survey was also completed in
Minnesota at 17,687km, with 50,697km in total. An option to earn 100% of the Silicon Project in Nevada was signed with Renaissance Gold.
AngloGold Ashanti will have a 3-year option to acquire 100% of the property for a total consideration of $3m cash in staged payments and
a 2.5% NSR. Geological mapping and sampling were completed.

In Colombia at Nuevo Guintar (100% AngloGold Ashanti) activities are focused at reaching a decision point. Soil sampling, ground magnetic
and IP programmes were completed and a 1200m diamond drilling programme initiated in June with 553m completed. The principle target
is a 500m by 300m gold and multi-element soil geochemistry anomaly with an epithermal signature.

In Brazil, work concentrated on the Tromai Project which covers a large ~2,000km(2) highly prospective tenement package (AngloGold
Ashanti earning 70% from Trek Mining). Diamond and RC drilling was initiated (1,573m DD and 2,207m RC in the second quarter) over
known structures associated with artisanal mining and soil geochemistry. The aeromagnetic and radiometric data (38,000 line km) collected
in last quarter of 2016 and the first quarter in 2017 was processed and final products delivered. Geochemistry results from the first batch of
drill core were received with minor anomalous results so far. With significant areas of the land package covered by recent sediments, soil
or laterite, the objective is to use the geophysics to delimit well defined high priority exploration corridors within the large land package for
more detailed drill target definition and drill testing in the second half of the year.

In Argentina early stage Greenfields generative exploration programmes progressed.

Kombokolo-Rhino-Agbarabo, Sessenge-Sessenge Southwest, Aerodrome-Pamao-Megi, KCD-Kombokolo and Ikamva. Drilling from surface
and underground has shown potential for extensions of current underground reserves on the 3000 and 9000 up-plunge lodes.

Republic of Mali - RC drilling (2,460 m) was completed at Tambali West and Dogofile and DD (761 m) was completed at Tambali North,
SSP North and FN bc. In addition, a total of 1,195m of DD was conducted at FE3 and FE4 as part of the SSP to investigate the potential of
the main shear below the pits that are earmarked for in-pit tailings disposal. A total of 1,351m of sterilisation drilling was conducted at FE4
to assess the suitability for in-pit tailings deposition for SSP.

In Argentina, drilling started at Cerro Vanguardia for the year. Most of the drilling meters were focused on extensions of ore zones and
new targets. During the six months ended 30 June 2017, 4,370m were drilled in total within the Cerro Vanguardia tenements. The Claudia
JV earn-in was concluded ahead of the one year anniversary. Other work was completed to support target generation included trenching
and channel sampling programmes to refine drill targeting.

In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiaba, Lamego and Córrego do Sítio (CdS) production centers for AGABM with 47,115m drilled
during first half of the year from the combined surface and underground drilling programmes. Targets included ore body extension at Cuiaba
and CdS. Follow up infill drilling to support mine planning and Mineral Resource conversion was also completed.

At Serra Grande, 23,943m were drilled as part of the exploration and Mineral Resource conversion programmes. Drilling target generation
activities included mapping and soil sampling programmes.

In Colombia, the Gramalote JV completed 3,816m of drilling in total. Part of the programme was designed to support site and infrastructure
investigations. The saprolite infill drilling programme was completed to better define the thickness and gold mineralisation in the horizon.
Drilling continued on targets within the JV regional tenements outside the main resource area. Work to update and refine the geological
model progressed in the first half to support the pre-feasibility study and remains on track for completion by the end of 2017.

The Quebradona JV programme continued a drilling programme to support pre-feasibility study site investigation geotechnical and hydrology
data collection. A total of 2,132m were drilled. All drilling has been concluded at this stage of the programme.

In Australia, at Sunrise Dam drilling targeted Vogue Deeps, north extensions to Cosmo and Cosmo East, Hammerhead and down dip
extensions to Cosmo, Cosmo East and Dolly. Some of the holes drilled to target Vogue Deeps and Cosmo East down dip are within close
proximity to Carey Shear zone, therefore some of these holes have been designed to pass through the shear and into the footwall. A total
of 43,002m were drilled.
At Tropicana, during the period exploration drilling consisted of reverse circulation (RC), diamond core (DDH) and aircore (AC) drilling, for
a total of 41,412m drilled. RC (19,807m) and DDH drilling (2,872m) programmes targeted Sanpan, Zebra, New Zebra, Hat-Trick, Springbok

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
There have been no material changes as yet to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates as disclosed in the 2016 Ore Reserve
and Mineral Resource report. The process of estimating Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves is ongoing and only due for completion at the
end of the year. However, the recently announced changes to the South African operations and the Paramo declaration in Colombia may
well result in material changes. The impact of these is still being assessed.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review in
accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting
framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily
consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures and
evaluating the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements of the company for the six months ended 30 June 2017 do not present fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with

In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold Mining Company and Sibanye Gold formed
an industry working group on OLD to address issues relating to compensation for OLD in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working
group now also includes African Rainbow Minerals (""ARM""). The working group remains of the view that achieving a comprehensive solution
which is both fair to past, present and future employees, and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation. The working group
will continue with its efforts - which have been ongoing for more than two years - to find common ground with all stakeholders, including
government, labour and the claimants' legal representatives.

AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold Mining
Company, DRDGold, Randgold and Exploration Company, and Sibanye Gold, were served with a consolidated class action application on
21 August 2013. The companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they are defending these. They do,
however, believe that they should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue.

On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, among other things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising current
and former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and (b) a tuberculosis
class comprising current and former mine workers who have worked on the mines for a period of not less than two years and who have
contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and the dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary tuberculosis; and (2) that the
common law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and subsequently dies before close of
pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant. The progression of the classes certified will
be done in two phases: (i) a determination of common issues, on an opt-out basis, and (ii) the hearing and determination of individualised
issues, on an opt-in basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the claimants. The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on
the merits of the cases brought by the Claimants. The amount of damages has not yet been quantified for any of the claimants in the
Consolidated Class Application or for any other members of the classes.

AngloGold Ashanti and the other respondents believed that the judgement addressed a number of highly complex and important issues,
including a far-reaching amendment of the common law, that have not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa. The High
Court itself found that the scope and magnitude of the proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class action would
address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The respondents applied for leave to appeal against the judgement because they believed
that the court's ruling on some of these issues is incorrect and that another court may come to a different decision.

On 24 June 2016, the South Gauteng High Court granted the mining companies leave to appeal against the finding amending the common
law in respect of the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused leave to appeal on the certification of silicosis and tuberculosis
classes. On 15 July 2016, AngloGold Ashanti and the other respondents each filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to
appeal against the certification of the two separate classes for silicosis and tuberculosis. In an attempt to shorten any delay due to an appeal
process, it is permissible to request that the appeals be dealt with on an expedited basis. On 21 September 2016, the Supreme Court of
Appeal granted the respondents leave to appeal against all aspects of the class certification judgement of the South Gauteng High Court
delivered in May 2016. The appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal is scheduled to be heard from 19 - 23 March 2018.

Provision raised

As a result of the progress made by the working group since 31 December 2016 on a variety of issues, management is now in a position to
reliably estimate within an acceptable range the AngloGold Ashanti share of a possible settlement of the class action claims and related
costs. As a result, AngloGold Ashanti has provided for this obligation in the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2017 at a
discounted amount of $63m (undiscounted $77m). The ultimate outcome of these negotiations and the court sanction of the agreement
remains uncertain and accordingly the provision is subject to adjustment in the future.

      Liquidity and capital resources

      To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash resources,
      cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

      Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to
      foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In
      addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

      The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that
      external borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to
      meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that
      sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

    Borrowings
    The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing market values at the reporting date which results in
    the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and
    accordingly the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair value.

Derivatives
The fair value of derivatives is estimated based on ruling market prices, volatilities, interest rates and credit risk and includes all
derivatives carried in the statement of financial position.

Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position.

The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
Level 1:    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:    inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)
            or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3:    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following tables set out the group's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy:

Environmental obligations

Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and rehabilitate
the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence, AngloGold Ashanti is required in some
circumstances to provide either reclamation bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or provide
guarantees issued by the operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or such other government department with
responsibility for environmental oversight in the respective country to cover the potential environmental rehabilitation obligation in
specified amounts.

In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are required
to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.

In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.41bn and guarantees of ZAR 1.82bn issued by various
banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 1.16bn. In Australia, since 2014, we have paid into a Mine Rehabilitation
Fund an amount of AUD $3m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $105.6m. At Iduapriem we have provided a bond
comprising of a cash component of $9.8m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $33.9m issued by Ecobank Ghana Limited
and Barclays Ghana Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $43.1m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising
of a cash component of $20.2m with a further bank guarantee amounting to $30.0m issued by Nedbank Limited for a current carrying
value of the liability of $216.9m. In some circumstances, we may be required to post further bonds in due course which will have a
consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the providers of the reclamation bonds.

      Litigation claims
(1)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors
      Limited's (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling agreement
      at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation agreement on 
      8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a writ issued by MBC claiming a total of $97m. In December
      2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC submitted the matter to
      arbitration and the parties await the constitution of the tribunal.

(2)   Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that
      they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by
      emission and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the Pompora
      Treatment Plant (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory infections, skin
      diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions, but AGAG intends
      to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On 24 February 2014,
      executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves and on behalf of their
      members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic hardships as a result of
      constant failure of their crops. This matter has been adjourned indefinitely. In view of the limitation of current information for
      the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation in either matter.

      Tax claims
(3)   Tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining
      authority, issued a tax assessment against AngloGold Ashanti Brazil Mineração Ltda (AGABM) relating to the calculation and
      payment by AABM of the financial contribution on mining exploitation in the period from 1991 to 2006. The assessment
      (possible amount) is $9m (2016: $9m). AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various other disputes
      with tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions and
      annual property tax. The possible amount involved is approximately $10m (2016: $15m). Management is of the opinion that
      these taxes are not payable.

(4)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office
      (DIAN) that it disagreed with the company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income and equity tax returns.
      On 23 October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional
      tax of $21m (2016: $21m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes are
      expected to be $121m (2016: $120m). The company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC
      subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal
      of Cundinamarca (the trial court for tax litigation). Closing arguments on the tax disputes were presented in February and June
      2017 and judgement is pending.

(5)   Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority (AFIP)
      requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $7m (2016: $7m) relating to the non-deduction
      of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not be
      considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of
      hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $22m (2016: $22m). CVSA and
      AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are
      not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives. CVSA filed an appeal
      with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015, and the matter is proceeding.
     
      Other

(6)   Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations, which
      have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal studies
      have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable remediation
      solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated that Monitored
      Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances. Furthermore,
      literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use of phyto-
      technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the technology being
      a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(7)   Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep
      groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999
      to understand this potential risk. In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed solution
      needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and Petroleum
      Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine Closure Strategy
      to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate
      estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

17 Impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

    IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
    during May 2014. AngloGold Ashanti is mandatorily required to apply IFRS 15 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
    1 January 2018.

    Management has assessed the potential impact of IFRS 15 on the financial statements of the group and concluded that the group
    does not sell product based on multiple-element arrangements and it does not sell product on a provisional or variable pricing
    basis and as such the new standard does not have a significant impact on the timing or amount of the group's revenue recognition.
    The adoption of IFRS 15 will result in the recognition of by-product revenue in Revenue from product sales. Revenue from product
    sales includes Gold Income and by-product revenue. This change in classification results in a consequential increase in costs of
    sales, and therefore will not have an impact on previously reported Gross profit.

18 Announcements

   AngloGold Ashanti to restructure South African Operations to ensure their viability - AngloGold Ashanti has made the difficult
   decision to begin a consultation process with employees in terms of section 189 and 189A of the Labour Relations Act, with respect
   to restructuring certain of its South African business units. This follows a review of the options to safely turnaround the performance
   of these loss-making operations. While all efforts will be made to limit the impact on employment to the greatest extent possible, this
   restructuring contemplates some 8,500 roles across AngloGold Ashanti's South African business, which currently employs about
   28,000 people, including contractors. In order to safeguard the long-term sustainability of its South African business, AngloGold
   Ashanti is considering the following actions, subject to the outcomes of the consultation process:
         -    Place on care and maintenance the Kopanang mine, in the Vaal River region, and the Savuka section of the Tau Tona mine,
              in the West Wits region. Savuka mine has been in operation for 59 years, and has already been extended 10 years beyond
              its natural life. Kopanang mine produced its first gold in 1981, 36 years ago.
         -    Evaluate the feasibility of integrating elements of the 60-year old Tau Tona mine into the neighbouring Mponeng mine.

   Legislative changes in Tanzania - On 30 June 2017, AngloGold Ashanti announced that Tanzania's parliament published draft
   legislation amending the legal framework of its extractive industry, while also passing a Bill that levies a 1% 'clearing fee' on mineral
   exports from 1 July 2017. Subsequent to 30 June 2017, the Republic of Tanzania's parliament enacted and published, in the Country's
   official Government Gazette, The Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty) Act, No. 5 of 2017, The Natural Wealth
   and Resources Contracts (Review and re-negotiation of unconscionable terms) Act, No. 6 of 2017 and The Written Laws
   (Miscellaneous amendments) Act, no.7 of 2017. AngloGold Ashanti is in the process to analyse the impact of these laws, in the
   context of its Mine Development Agreement.

   On 13 July 2013, AngloGold Ashanti indicated that it is seeking a constructive dialogue with the Government of Tanzania, and its
   agencies, to gain assurances that Geita Mine will not be affected by these legal and fiscal changes. In the circumstances, the group,
   however, had no choice but to take the precautionary step of safeguarding its interests under the Mine Development Agreement, by
   commencing arbitration proceedings under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as clearly provided
   for in the Mine Development Agreement.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED
30 JUNE 2017

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the half year ended 30 June 2017 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 21 August 2017.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Expected headline loss and basic loss

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that the headline loss for the
period is expected to be between $80 million and $98 million, with a headline loss per share of between
19 cents and 23 cents. Headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the half year
ended 30 June 2016 (“comparative period”) were $93 million and 23 cents, respectively.

The basic loss is expected to be between $167 million and $185 million, with the basic loss per share
between 41 cents and 45 cents. Basic earnings and earnings per share (“EPS”) for the comparative
period were $52 million and 13 cents, respectively.

The expected overall decrease in headline earnings and basic earnings in the first six months of the
year relative to the comparative period were primarily due to:

-      impairment of certain of the South African assets affecting basic earnings amounting to
       $86 million (post-tax) or 21 cents per share;
-      once-off non cash provisions arising from the potential retrenchment costs relating to the South
       African operations of $47 million (post-tax) or 11 cents per share and the estimated costs of the
       settlement of silicosis class action claims and related expenditure (see below), which amounted
       to $46 million (post-tax) or 11 cents per share;
-      higher operating costs due primarily to the impact of stronger local currencies in South Africa
       and Brazil, inflation and changes in inventories; and
-      lower income from associates and joint ventures.

Operational performance

Production is expected to be 1.748 Moz for the period compared to 1.745 Moz in the prior period.
Notably, the Company achieved a stronger production performance in the second quarter of the year
of 918,000 oz compared to the 830,000 oz in the first quarter, an increase of 10.6%.

Section 189 process in the South African region

During the period, AngloGold Ashanti made the difficult decision to begin a consultation process with
employees in terms of section 189 and 189A of the Labour Relations Act, with respect to restructuring
certain of its South African business units, in order to ensure the viability of its South African business
as a whole. This follows a review of the options to safely turn around the performance of these loss-
making operations.

As a consequence, the Company has recorded an impairment of certain of its South African assets
amounting to $86 million (post-tax) or 21 cents per share. These impairments are non-cash in nature
and are included in the calculation of basic earnings and EPS, but excluded from the calculation of
headline earnings and HEPS for the period.

Silicosis provision

Class action

Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs.
AngloGold Ashanti, the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation
for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 1993 does not cover an “employee” who qualifies for
compensation in respect of “compensable diseases” under ODMWA. This judgement allows such
qualifying employee to pursue a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the
Constitutional Court decision, AngloGold Ashanti and members of the working group (discussed below)
have been subject to numerous claims relating to silicosis and other Occupational Lung Diseases
(“OLD”), including several potential class actions and individual claims.

In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields Limited, Harmony
Gold Mining Company Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited formed an industry working group on OLD to
address issues relating to compensation for OLD in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The
working group now also includes African Rainbow Minerals (“ARM”). The working group remains of the
view that achieving a comprehensive solution which is both fair to past, present and future employees,
and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation. The working group will continue with
its efforts – which have been ongoing for more than two years – to find common ground with all
stakeholders, including government, labour and the claimants’ legal representatives.

AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM,
Gold Fields Limited, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Randgold and
Exploration Company Limited, and Sibanye Gold Limited, were served with a consolidated class action
application on 21 August 2013. The companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the
claims brought, and they are defending these. They do, however, believe that they should work together
to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue.

On 13 May 2016, the South African South Gauteng High Court (“High Court”) ordered, among other
things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising current and former mine
workers who have contracted silicosis and the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis;
and (b) a tuberculosis class comprising current and former mine workers who have worked on the mines
for a period of not less than two years and who have contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and the
dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary tuberculosis; and (2) that the common
law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and
subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate
of the deceased claimant. The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: (i) a
determination of common issues, on an opt-out basis, and (ii) the hearing and determination of
individualised issues, on an opt-in basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the claimants.
The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought by the claimants.
The amount of damages has not yet been quantified for any of the claimants in the Consolidated Class
Application or for any other members of the classes.

AngloGold Ashanti and the other respondents believed that the judgement addressed a number of
highly complex and important issues, including a far reaching amendment of the common law, that have
not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa. The High Court itself found that the
scope and magnitude of the proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class action
would address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The respondents applied for leave to appeal
against the judgement because they believed that the court’s ruling on some of these issues is incorrect
and that another court may come to a different decision.

On 24 June 2016, the High Court granted the mining companies leave to appeal against the finding
amending the common law in respect of the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused leave
to appeal on the certification of silicosis and tuberculosis classes. On 15 July 2016, AngloGold Ashanti
and the other respondents each filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal
against the certification of the two separate classes for silicosis and tuberculosis. In an attempt to
shorten any delay due to an appeal process, it is permissible to request that the appeals be dealt with
on an expedited basis. On 21 September 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal granted the respondents
leave to appeal against all aspects of the class certification judgement of the High Court delivered in
May 2016. The appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal is scheduled to be heard from 19
– 23 March 2018.

Provision raised

As a result of the progress made by the Gold Working Group since 31 December 2016 on a variety of
issues, management is now in a position to reliably estimate within an acceptable range the Company’s
share of a possible settlement of the class action claims and related costs. As a result, the Company
has provided for this obligation in the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2017 at a discounted
pre-tax amount of $63 million ($46 million post-tax) (pre-tax undiscounted amount of $77 million). The
ultimate outcome of these negotiations and the court sanction of the agreement remains uncertain and
accordingly the provision is subject to adjustment in the future.


The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Comments on Passage of New Legislation in Tanzania

(PRESS RELEASE ? JOHANNESBURG) -- AngloGold Ashanti notes the enactment by the
Republic of Tanzania?s Parliament and publication in the Country?s official Government
Gazette of the Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty) Act, No 5 of 2017, the
Natural Wealth and Resources Contracts (Review and Re-Negotiation of Unconscionable
Terms) Act, No 6 of 2017 and the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No 7 of
2017.

AngloGold Ashanti?s indirect subsidiaries, Samax Resources Limited and Geita Gold Mining
Limited (the Subsidiaries), are parties to a Mine Development Agreement (MDA) in relation
to the development and operation of the Geita gold mine in Tanzania (Geita Mine), which
governs the relationship between the Subsidiaries and the Government of Tanzania (GoT) in
relation to Geita Mine. The MDA was instrumental in the decision to make the significant
investment in the development of Geita Mine, at a time of significantly lower gold prices and
when Tanzania was an untested jurisdiction for new mine development.

Since starting production almost two decades ago, Geita Mine has been a source of significant
benefit to all stakeholders, yielding more than $1 billion in monetary benefit to the GoT. Last
year alone, a total of $130 million in taxes was paid (borne and taxes collected on behalf of
Government) by Geita Mine.

The three pieces of new legislation in question purport to make a number of changes to the
operating environment for Tanzania?s extractive industries, including those in its mining, and
oil and gas sectors. These changes include, among others: the right for the GoT to renegotiate
existing MDAs at its discretion; the provision to the GoT of a non-dilutable, free-carried interest
of no less than 16% in all mining projects; the right for the Government to acquire up to 50%
of any mining asset commensurate with the value of tax benefits provided to the owner of that
asset by the GoT; removal of the refund of input VAT incurred; an increase in the rate of
revenue royalties from 4% to 6%; requirements for local beneficiation and procurement; and
constraints on the operation of off-shore bank accounts.

For a more detailed reading of the legislative provisions included in the new laws,
please see http://www.parliament.go.tz/bills-list.

AngloGold Ashanti?s subsidiaries are seeking a constructive dialogue with the GoT, and its
agencies, to gain assurances that Geita Mine will not be affected by these legal and fiscal
changes. In the circumstances, the Subsidiaries have, however, had no choice but to take the
precautionary step of safeguarding their interests under the MDA, by commencing arbitration
proceedings under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,
as clearly provided for in the MDA.

Geita Mine employed an average of 3,748 people last year in permanent and contractor
provisions. The mine, which continues to operate normally, exports gold in the form of dore
bars and contributed an estimated $593 million in revenue to the output of the country as
measured by the gross domestic product in 2016.

About Geita Gold Mine
Geita Gold Mine produced 489 000oz at an all-in-sustaining cost of $844/oz in Tanzania in
2016, which amounted to 14% of AngloGold Ashanti?s total production.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti to Restructure South African Operations to Ensure Their Viability

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti has made the difficult decision to begin
a consultation process with employees in terms of section 189 and 189A of the Labour Relations Act,
with respect to restructuring certain of its South African business units. This follows a review of the
options to safely turn around the performance of these loss-making operations.

This consultation with organised labour groups, facilitated by the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration (CCMA), will be aimed at safely returning the South African business to profitability, whilst
mitigating job losses.

AngloGold Ashanti signalled to stakeholders earlier this year that it would review its South African gold-
mining operations in light of heavy, and ultimately unsustainable, losses they have incurred. The
restructuring of the company’s production and cost base is necessary to protect the overall viability of
its South African business over the long-term, and to safeguard employment at viable business units in
the West Wits and Vaal River regions. The company is committed to transparency and will make the
plans and assumptions arising from this review available for scrutiny by an independent third-party,
during the CCMA process.

While all efforts will be made to limit the impact on employment to the greatest extent possible, this
restructuring contemplates some 8,500 roles across AngloGold Ashanti’s South African business, which
currently employs about 28,000 people, including contractors.

Systemic Challenges

Some of our older mines in the South African region have reached the end of their economic lives,
several decades after they started production. These mines face systemic challenges, including near-
depletion of ore reserves, increasing depth and distance from central infrastructure, declining
production profiles, and cost escalations that have continued to outpace both inflation and a subdued
gold price.

The cost performance of certain operations, notably TauTona and Kopanang, has been a clear
demonstration of these challenges, with all-in sustaining costs in the first-quarter of this year of
$1,737/oz and $2,399/oz respectively. This compared with an average gold price over that period of
$1,216/oz. Both mines also sustained significant operating losses through 2016.

In order to safeguard the long-term sustainability of its South African business, AngloGold Ashanti has
decided to embark on the following actions, subject to the outcomes of the consultation process:

    o   Place on care and maintenance the Kopanang mine, in the Vaal River region, and the Savuka
        section of the TauTona mine, in the West Wits Region. Savuka has been in operation for 59
        years, and has already been extended 10 years beyond its natural life. Kopanang Mine
        produced its first gold in 1981, 36 years ago;
     o  Evaluate the feasibility of integrating elements of the 60-year old TauTona mine into the
        neighbouring Mponeng mine;

As a consequence of these changes, we are also reviewing the associated costs at the regional level,
particularly with respect to support services and overheads.

“This is a difficult decision which follows a period of significant and – ultimately – unsustainable losses,
and also the evaluation of the options available to return our South African business to profitability,”
AngloGold Ashanti Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said. “It is critical that we act
to protect the long-term sustainability of this business and the majority of our workforce. We are mindful
of the sensitivity that this situation demands, and are committed to supporting all our employees
throughout this process.”

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Sets New Safety Benchmark; Maintains Full-Year Guidance

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti said it has set new safety
records and achieved its first ever March quarter without a fatal accident, as it reported
operating results for the three months to 31 March 2017. The company also maintained its
full-year guidance.

AngloGold Ashanti, which operates the world’s deepest mines, has passed 282 days without
a fatal accident in South Africa, surpassing a previous record of 242 days, set in 2014.
Sadiola, Yatela, Siguiri, Iduapriem, Obuasi, and Sunrise Dam ended the March quarter injury
free, and the South African Operations have now exceeded five million consecutive shifts
without a fatality.

Production was 830,000oz at an average total cash cost of $813/oz, compared to
861,000oz at $702/oz in the first quarter of 2016, with costs pushed higher by lower grades
and significantly stronger currencies in key operating regions. The company’s International
Operations, which account for almost three-in-four of its gold ounces mined, delivered
another good quarter according to their plans, whilst the South African Operations, with the
exception of Mponeng, had a poor production performance in the seasonally weak first
quarter.

“Our International Operations have again delivered a strong result, with our brownfields
investments proceeding to plan,” Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer of
AngloGold Ashanti, said. “On the back of the strong safety result, we are closely scrutinising
the underperforming areas of our South African Operations to restore margins. Remedial
steps taken to ensure they recover from a difficult start to the year are already bearing fruit.”

This year, AngloGold Ashanti is re-investing in high-return, brownfields projects to improve
the overall quality of its portfolio and extend mine lives. The company has in recent years
rebuilt its balance sheet without diluting shareholders, through tight cost management,
efficiency improvements and debt reduction, all while making significant improvements to
safety.

Net debt improved by 3% from the first quarter of last year to $2.05 bn. Balance sheet
flexibility was also maintained, with net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation remaining within its own target of 1.5 times, through the
business cycle, and well below its debt covenants of 3.5 times. AngloGold Ashanti has
ample liquidity of $1.46bn, with no near-dated maturities, and sufficient covenant headroom.

Production from the International Operations was 632,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz
for the first quarter of 2017, up from 625,000oz at a total cash cost of $674/oz in the
corresponding period last year. This increase reflected solid performances across the
portfolio, with exceptional performances from Siguiri, Iduapriem, Kibali and Cerro
Vanguardia. All-in sustaining costs (AiSC) for the first quarter were $963/oz, up from $822/oz
for the first quarter of 2016, with the increase attributable to the impact of stronger local
currencies, lower average grades and the planned increase in sustaining capital
expenditure.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) during the first quarter of 2017
was $216m, up from $128m for the first quarter of 2016. Total capital expenditure included
$186m of sustaining capital expenditure and $30m of project capital expenditure. Capital
expenditure is expected to increase in the remaining three quarters of the year, in line with
historical seasonal trends.
The added focus on a safe start-up contributed to an unusually slow ramp-up in South
Africa, after the year-end break. This was compounded by more lower-grade areas mined at
some operations than planned, fractured ground in areas currently being mined at TauTona
and Moab Khotsong and instances of unwarranted deviations from mining plans. Steps
taken to address the poor adherence to mining plans, management work routines and to
improve productivity have already resulted in an improvement in mineable face length,
leading to production volume recoveries in the second half of the first quarter of 2017.
These improvements will also contribute to the forecast for an overall increase in production
rates over the remainder of the year.

Full-Year Guidance

Adjusted EBITDA was $314m for the first quarter of 2017, down from $378m for the first
quarter of 2016 .The guidance for the full year remains unchanged as follows:
- Production between 3.6Moz and 3.75Moz;
- Capital expenditure between $950m and $1,050m;
- Total cash costs between $750/oz and $800/oz; and
- AiSC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the
US dollar of 14.25ZAR (Rand), 3.40BRL (Brazil Real), 0.75AUD (Aus$) and 16.50ARS
(Argentina Peso), with oil at $58/bl on average for the year.

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions or power
disruptions, nor changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been
reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have
material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any
expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Please refer
to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year
ended 31 December 2016, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission.

The financial information, including any forward-looking information, set out in this news
release has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

First quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti achieved key safety records, with its first ever fatality-free March quarter, and achieved two consecutive fatality free
quarters for the second time in its history. The South Africa region reached a new milestone of 247 fatality-free days (exceeding
its previous record set in 2014 of 242 days). Moab Khotsong has passed 20 months without a fatality, a new record, whilst the region
has exceeded five million fatality-free shifts. Given the challenging conditions of ultra-deep mining operations, the entire team, in
cooperation with a broad group of stakeholders, must be commended for delivering this critical objective in line with AngloGold
Ashanti's commitment to safe production.

The Company remains on track to deliver full-year production guidance. Production was 830,000oz at an average total cash cost of
$813/oz for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 861,000oz at $702/oz for the first quarter of 2016, with the increase in costs per
ounce driven largely by the stronger operating currencies in South Africa and Brazil (the Rand and the Brazilian Real gained 16% and
19% against the US dollar respectively), as well as lower volumes produced.

All-in sustaining costs (AiSC) for the period were $1,060/oz, up from $860/oz for the first quarter of 2016, with the increase being
driven by the 16% rise in cash costs year-on-year, as well as the planned 71% increase in sustaining capital expenditure to reach
$186m during the first quarter of 2017, up from $109m for the first quarter of 2016. The higher capital expenditure levels are reflective
of a strategic inward investment programme which is focused on securing medium to long term operating improvements, principally
at the International operations, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital expenditure with the overall goal of delivering
sustainable free cash flows through the cycle. The focus areas include a new power plant and underground development at Geita,
increased underground development at Kibali and Cuiabá, with the latter aiming at improving flexibility related to geotechnical
conditions, and capitalised stripping at Iduapriem and Tropicana. It is anticipated that the sustaining capital expenditure will peak in
2017 based current plans. All-in costs were $1,137/oz for the first quarter of 2017, up from $924/oz for the first quarter of 2016.

Production from the International operations was 632,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz for the first quarter of 2017, up from
625,000oz at a total cash cost of $674/oz in the corresponding period last year. This increase reflected solid performances across the
portfolio, with exceptional performances from Siguiri, Iduapriem and Cerro Vanguardia. AiSC for the first quarter of 2017 was $963/oz,
up from $822/oz for the first quarter of 2016, with the increase attributable to the impact of stronger local currencies, lower average
grades and the planned increase in sustaining capital expenditure.

South Africa had a difficult production quarter, as an added focus on a safe start-up contributed to an unusually slow ramp-up after
the year-end break. This was compounded by: continued recovery from last year's interruptions, particularly in the fourth quarter; a
poor mining mix, whereby lower-grade areas dominated volumes at some operations; more fractured ground than previously
anticipated in areas currently being mined at TauTona and Moab Khotsong; and unwarranted deviations from mining plans,
particularly in the first half of the quarter. Steps have been taken to address the poor adherence to mining plans and management
work routines, to improve productivity. These steps have already resulted in an improvement in mineable face length, leading to
volume recoveries in the second half of the quarter, and into the current quarter. These improvements will also contribute to our
forecast for an overall increase in production rates over the remainder of the year.

During the seasonally weaker first quarter of 2017, the Company maintained good balance sheet flexibility with net debt to adjusted
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) ratio at 1.38 times. Net debt at 31 March 2017 was
$2.05bn, down from $2.13bn at 31 March 2016, and remained at comfortable levels despite the planned increase in capital
expenditure, which was $216m for the first quarter of 2017, up from $128m for the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in net debt
was due to the redemption of the high yield bond using a combination of the group's USD Revolving Credit Facility and free cash
flow generated during 2016. Subsequent to 31 December 2016, net debt increased by $137m from $1.92bn to $2.05bn due mainly
to the free cash outflow for the quarter of $119m.

Cash inflow from operating activities during the first quarter of 2017 was $93m, down from $227m for the first quarter of 2016, with
the decrease mainly due to adverse movements in working capital ($76m), and the dual impact of lower production and increased
cash costs ($60m). This was partly offset by the higher gold price received.

Free cash outflow was $119m, compared to the $70m free cash inflow reported in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting higher costs, the
negative impact of working capital movements and the planned increase in sustaining capital expenditure levels. This was only
partially offset by a reduction in taxes paid and a slightly higher price received during the quarter.

""Our International operations have again delivered a strong result, with our brownfields investments proceeding to plan,"" Srinivasan
Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti, said. ""On the back of the strong safety result, we are reviewing our
South African operations to restore their margin and ensure they recover from a difficult start to the year.""

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) during the first quarter of 2017 was $216m, up from $128m for the first
quarter of 2016. Total capital expenditure included $186m of sustaining capital expenditure and $30m of project capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase in the remaining three quarters of the year, in line with historical seasonal trends.

Adjusted EBITDA was $314m for the first quarter of 2017, down from $378m for the first quarter of 2016 .The outlook for the full year
remains unchanged as follows:

- Production between 3.6Moz and 3.75Moz;
- Capital expenditure between $950m and $1,050m;
- Total cash costs between $750/oz and $800/oz; and
- AiSC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of 14.25ZAR (Rand), 
3.40BRL (Brazil Real), 0.75AUD (Aus$) and 16.50ARS (Argentina Peso), with oil at $58/bl on average for the year.

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions or power disruptions, nor changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material
adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
31 December 2016, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE
AngloGold Ashanti recorded its first ever March quarter without a fatal accident. This achievement comes as the Company delivered
two, consecutive fatality-free quarters at its operations, including the ultra-deep South African mines, which reached a new milestone
of 247 days without a fatality. All of the South African operations, with the exception of Kopanang, have now achieved one million
fatality-free shifts, with the region as a whole now exceeding five million shifts.

Sadiola, Yatela, Siguiri, Iduapriem, Obuasi, Sunrise Dam, the projects of Gramalote and Quebradona, and also the Greenfields
Exploration unit recorded an injury free quarter. The All-Injury Frequency Rate for the International operations improved by 5%, whilst
the Group saw a regression to 8.85 injuries per million hours worked during the first quarter of 2017, from 8.44 for the first quarter of
2016.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations produced 198,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,158/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 compared
to 236,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2016. AiSC for the first quarter of 2017 ended at $1,327/oz,
up from $919/oz, for the first quarter of 2016.

As detailed above, production in the region was lower year-on-year, hindered by an unusually slow start up after the Christmas
holidays, lower recovered grades across all its operations and efficiency constraints encountered in obtaining sufficient face time at
key operations. Costs were heavily impacted by the lower production volumes and by the strengthening of the Rand against the U.S.
dollar, with an average appreciation of 16% of the Rand against the dollar compared to the first quarter of 2016.

At the West Wits Operations, production was 77,000oz, down from 97,000oz during the first quarter of 2016 due to an anticipated
reduction in grades (11% lower at Mponeng) and also poor equipment availability. Ground conditions were also more fractured
than originally anticipated at TauTona, causing increased dilution and necessitating additional off-reef mining and underground
support. A 3.2 magnitude seismic event at the 85 cross-cut on 115 Level at TauTona also caused mining to halt to allow
rehabilitation of the area. TauTona saw inadequate face-length availability caused by poor adherence to mining plans. Remedial
steps have been taken (see First quarter overview).

At the Vaal River Operations, production was 74,000oz, down from 90,000oz for the first quarter of 2016. Kopanang and Moab
experienced sub-optimal grade-mix and both struggled to build production volumes after the year-end break, given the deviation from
operating plans, which resulted in poor face-length availability. At Moab, off-reef mining was higher than planned in order to ensure
greater geological stability, in addition to ore-pass lock-up and channel sequencing challenges. At Kopanang, clearing of waste
tonnes in the ore pass contributed to a 35% reduction in yields. To mitigate the lack of face length build-up, primarily due to safety
stoppages experienced in 2016, a revised service work strategy and schedule has been established to help increase immediate
mineable face length.

At Surface operations, despite higher tailings throughput, production volumes from the marginal ore dumps were below plant capacity
given low availability at the Kopanang Gold Plant, and logistical challenges getting material into the plant. Remedial steps have been
identified to recover plant throughput.

Mine Waste Solutions' (MWS) performance was hampered by unusually heavy rains during the first quarter, which had caused
periodic suspension of operations. This was compounded by a significant fall-off in gold reclaimed through the two circuits servicing
the flotation plant. Grades, recoveries and consequently gold production are expected to improve given a recent upgrade to the sulphur
pay dam pump station.

In the Continental Africa region, production increased to 314,000oz at a total cash cost of $759/oz for the quarter ended
31 March 2017, up from 305,000oz at a total cash cost of $719/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2016. AiSC for the first quarter of
2017 was $939/oz, up from $815/oz for the first quarter of 2016.

At Kibali, in the DRC, production of 63,000oz was 7% higher than the first quarter of 2016, when the operation experienced lower
recoveries while commissioning the sulphide circuit. Total cash costs at $881/oz was up $107/oz, or 14%, from $774/oz for the first
quarter of 2016, as a result of higher fuel costs due to increased open-pit mining during the period.

In Tanzania, production from Geita decreased by 7% to 105,000oz following a planned 6% drop in recovered grade as a result of
mining different benches in Nyankanga. Total cash costs increased by 12% or $67/oz, to $615/oz, primarily due to the lower
production, stockpile and gold in process movements and higher fuel prices relative to the previous period.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased by 7% to 49,000oz as a result of a 23% increase in recovered grades which, was partially
offset by the lower tonnes treated. Total cash costs decreased by 7% to $920/oz, mainly due to the higher gold production, lower cost
of grid power and fuel compared to the corresponding period last year. Obuasi remained in care and maintenance with no production
anticipated for 2017, with partial rehabilitation activities undertaken during the quarter while future operational options for the mine are
being evaluated.

In Guinea, production at Siguiri increased by 13,000oz or 21% to 75,000oz as a result of access to higher grade ore sources at the
Area 1 mining zone secured in the third quarter of last year. Total cash costs at $695/oz were 7% lower than the first quarter of last
year as a result of the higher production, partly offset by higher mining costs.

In Mali, production from Sadiola decreased by 16% to 16,000oz as operational flexibility becomes limited due to the depletion of oxide
operations. This had a negative impact on recoveries, though this was partly offset by a 5% increase in tonnes treated. Total cash
costs increased by 26% or $199/oz to $971/oz, due to the lower production together with a relatively high fixed cost base.

In the Americas, production was 191,000oz at a total cash cost of $631/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 compared to
196,000oz at a total cash cost of $516/oz for the same quarter in 2016. AiSC for the first quarter of 2017 ended at $954/oz, compared
to $723/oz, for the first quarter of 2016.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia´s production was 67,000oz, up 3% year-on-year, mainly due to higher tonnes treated at the plant
driven by operational and metallurgical improvements, partially offset by lower grades. Silver production increased by 16% compared
to the first quarter of 2016 in accordance with plans. Total cash costs were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same
period last year, mainly as a result of the elimination of Patagonia ports rebates by the end of December 2016. These negative effects
were partially attenuated by favourable stockpile movements due to higher volumes of stockpile inventory derived from higher tonnes
mined.

In Brazil, at AGA Mineração, production was 95,000oz, down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to planned lower
grades. Serra Grande was affected by lower feed grade consistent with plan, partially off-set by higher tonnes treated. Total cash costs
in Brazil were impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real relative to the U.S. dollar, lower production volumes, and inflationary pressures
including higher costs for labour, materials and services. Costs were also impacted by stockpile and gold in process movements
at Serra Grande.

The Australia region produced 127,000oz at a total cash cost of $734/oz for the first quarter of 2017, up from 124,000oz at a total
cash cost of $814/oz for the first quarter of 2016. AiSC for the first quarter was $1,045/oz, compared to $994/oz in the same quarter
a year ago.

At Sunrise Dam, production was slightly higher than the corresponding quarter last year with a 4% increase in mill feed grade and a
4% increase in metallurgical recovery offsetting slightly lower mill throughput. Sunrise Dam achieved its first injury-free quarter on
record in the March quarter. At Tropicana, production was similar to the first quarter of 2016, with the lower head grade - due to
the end of grade streaming - offset by 16% higher mill throughput.

Total cash costs at Sunrise Dam of $885/oz were 5% higher than total cash costs for the first quarter of 2016. This was mostly due to
the AUD/USD exchange rate, with cash costs in Australian dollar terms less than 1% above the corresponding quarter last year. At
Tropicana, total cash costs were 24% lower at $550/oz, compared to $728/oz for the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter of 2017
included a larger amount of capitalised mining costs, related to mining the early stages of the Havana 3 and Tropicana 2 pits.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Kibali
The ultra-fine grind (UFG) capacity increased during the quarter, with commissioning of four new UFG mills. This enables the
processing of increased floatation concentrate volumes, improving grind and recoveries, as well as providing flexibility in ore treatment.

Ambarau, the second hydropower station, was also completed and commissioned during the first quarter, taking Kibali's total hydro
generation capacity to 32MW.

The underground produced 323kt (100%) of ore from the declines during the quarter. In addition, Kibali completed 3.2km of
development from the declines during the quarter. The shaft material handling system progressed during the quarter with the first ore
bins completed and the underground crusher installed, while 617m of development from the shaft was completed, 6% ahead of plan.

Siguiri Combination Plant
The project remains on schedule. All major equipment for the new combination plant has been ordered, whilst orders for the power plant
will be completed during the second quarter. The owner's team has been established on site and the EPCM team is expected to be at
full strength before mid-year, in parallel with site mobilisation of the civils and earthwork contract, which has also been awarded. Hard
rock mining is planned to commence in December 2017.

Mponeng Phase 1 and 2
The Phase 1 project continued ahead of schedule during the first quarter, as construction of ore and water handling infrastructure
remain ahead of schedule for completion this year. Activities related to secondary support are also progressing according to plan. The
126 level ramp-up to steady state ore reserve development, and subsequent gold delivery, are expected to commence during the third
quarter of 2017, once the ore handling infrastructure is commissioned.

During the quarter, work undertaken included the inter level ice hole equipping, the construction of the 116 level substation as well as
the water handling infrastructure complex on 121 level. The electrical and water reticulation infrastructure construction remains behind
schedule, though none of these activities directly affects the critical path of the project.

Colombia update
Following the outcome of the plebiscite held on 26 March 2017 in the Colombian Municipality of Cajamarca, which hosts the company's
La Colosa exploration site, we have taken the decision to pause much of the current fieldwork around the project whilst we study the
impact of the decision on future investment. We will, in the meantime, continue the necessary engagement with all stakeholders to
build consensus around the creation of a modern, environmentally responsible gold-mining industry in Colombia. This will unfortunately
result in significantly reduced expenditure related to the project, with a consequent impact on employment and our investment in the
Tolima region, whilst this process is underway.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry,
expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, productivity improvements, growth prospects and
outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain
of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti's liquidity and capital resources
and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking
statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti's operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance
can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other
factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions,
including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational risk management. For
a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual reports on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors are not necessarily
all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable
factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti
undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its
behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

NEWS RELEASE

CHANGE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX RATE AND IMPACT ON
CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service on
21 February 2017 in which they were advised, inter alia, that the Board of Directors of AngloGold
Ashanti had resolved to declare a gross cash dividend to shareholders recorded in the register of the
company on 24 March 2017.

Shareholders are now advised that, consequent to the announcement by the South African Minister of
Finance, Pravin Gordhan of an increase in the South African dividend withholding tax (“DWT”) rate
from 15% to 20%, in his budget speech of 22 February 2017, the DWT applicable to the gross cash
dividend per ordinary share of 130 South African cents to be paid to shareholders is 20%, with effect
from 22 February 2017.

The net dividend amount per ordinary share is accordingly 104 South African cents and not 110.50
South African cents as previously announced.

The salient dates and times and other information provided in respect of the dividend declaration
announced on 21 February 2017 remain unchanged.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Resumes Dividends on Free Cash Flow Jump

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti said it would resume dividend payments following a
hiatus of more than three years, after lower operating and interest costs helped it nearly double free cash
flow to $278m. The company declared a dividend of approximately 10 US cents a share for 2016.

Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) were $143m, or 35 U S cents per share, compared with $49m, or 12 US
cents per share in 2015. The sharp improvements in free cash flow and earnings were achieved through strong
ongoing focus on cost and capital discipline, as well a higher gold price.

AngloGold Ashanti has since 2013 used ‘self-help’ measures including asset sales and efficiency improvements
to reduce debt and improve balance sheet flexibility without diluting shareholders. It has, at the same time,
improved safety and cash-flow margins across its 17-mine portfolio. The company has prioritised inward
investment in high-return brownfield projects over acquisitions, as it seeks to improve the quality of its
production base and extend mine lives.

“Production from our operations delivered a strong turn around in the second half of the year. We have
again generated strong cash flows despite a volatile gold price, which has further strengthened our balance
sheet and improved flexibility,” Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “We will continue to
deliver on our strategy through the development of high-return, brownfield projects in order to continue to
improve the underlying quality of our portfolio.”

All in Sustaining Costs (AISC) came in within revised guidance range at $986/oz, up from $910/oz in 2015. The
AISC reflects continued cost discipline and weaker local currencies in some jurisdictions, offset by an increase
in sustaining capital expenditure and inflation.

Production of 3.6Moz was within the original guidance for the year ended 31 December 2016 at a total cash
cost of $744/oz, compared to 3.8Moz (excluding discontinued operations) at $712/oz in the prior year.
Production was negatively impacted by weaker output from the South Africa mines due mainly to safety-
related stoppages, lower grades from Kibali, a planned decrease in head grades at Tropicana and Geita, and no
production contribution from Obuasi.

Both Mponeng and Moab Khotsong in South Africa delivered increased production over the prior year, along
with Iduapriem and Siguiri in the Continental Africa Region, and Sunrise Dam in Australia. Mponeng delivered
the best improvement, with a 16% increase in production and a 14% decrease in AISC year-on-year.
SECOND HALF

AngloGold Ashanti delivered a steady operating and financial performance in the second half of 2016, with
production coming in at 1.9Moz compared to 2.0Moz in 2015. This operating result was achieved despite
safety-related stoppages that impacted output by roughly 60,000oz in SA, planned lower grades at Geita and
Tropicana, and the Obuasi mine having been on care and maintenance for last year. These negative
production factors were partly offset by continued focus on tight cost control, a 14% higher realised gold
price, and weaker currencies in some jurisdictions.

AISC for second half of 2016 was $1,058/oz, higher than the $897/oz for the second half of 2015 due mainly
to lower gold ounces sold, higher overall cash costs, higher brownfields exploration costs, and increased
sustaining capital expenditure.

Adjusted EBITDA of $767m, increased by 13% in the second half of 2016 compared to $679m in the second
half of 2015, due to the 14% increase in the average gold price received which was partially offset by a 5%
reduction in ounces sold over this period.

Proven and probable gold reserves at year end of 50.1Moz, substantially offsets depletion during the year.

SAFETY

The number of fatal accidents across the Group’s operations reduced by more than a third compared with
2015. Regrettably, however, six operating fatalities were recorded in South Africa during 2016 and another in
Brazil. Despite these setbacks, significant safety milestones were achieved last year including a fatality free
fourth quarter across all business units; one million fatality-free shifts at Mponeng, Kopanang and Moab
Khotsong; as well as two-million fatality-free shifts for the Vaal River Region. Notably, Moab Khotsong
achieved a full calendar year without a fatality in September and the Surface Operations unit achieved a full
year with no lost-time injury.

While these milestones demonstrate relative success in the implementation of our safety strategy, we remain
vigilant to ensure further gains in this most important area of the business.

There is no higher priority for AngloGold Ashanti than the safety of every one of its employees. We believe
that through close cooperation among stakeholders and fair application of regulations with due regard to
proportionality, as well as continued vigilance in an unpredictable operating environment, we can further
improve safety performance.

OUTLOOK

Production guidance for 2017 year is estimated to be between 3.6Moz and 3.755Moz. Total cash costs are
estimated to be between $750/oz and $800/oz and AISC between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz at average
exchange rates against the US dollar of 14.25 (Rand), 3.40 (Brazil Real), 0.75 (Aus$) and 16.50 (Argentina
Peso), with oil at $58/bl average for the year, based on market expectations.

Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $950m and $1,050m, with reinvestment at: Cuiaba, in Brazil,
where a greater rate of ore reserve development is expected to improve mining flexibility hampered by
geotechnical challenges in recent years; Iduapriem in Ghana, to strip waste rock from the Teberebie ore body
to extend mine life, and lower cash costs; Geita, in Tanzania, to replace the mine’s original 20-year old power
plant to ensure reliable electricity supply, and also continue the ramp-up of underground production in
advance of depletion of open-pit ore in future; at Sunrise Dam, in Australia, where investment in plant
modifications are expected to improve gold recoveries; and at Kibali, in the DRC, where additional ore reserve
development will be conducted ahead of a ramp-up in underground production

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions or power disruptions, nor
changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors.
Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no
assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold A shanti will prove to have been
correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year
ended 31 December 2015, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Financial and Operating Report
FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti's strong production and financial performance for the second-half and year ended 31 December 2016 reflects
delivery on its strategy to improve cash flows and returns on a sustainable basis, with an increase in positive annual free cash flow year
on year. In addition, through its continued self-help measures, AngloGold Ashanti has again reduced its debt significantly over this
period, improved balance-sheet flexibility with good liquidity levels and no material near-dated debt maturities, while continuing to
develop optionality within the business.

The improved earnings and free cash flow were achieved through strong ongoing focus on cost and capital discipline, and also a higher
gold price.

""Production from our operations delivered a strong turn around in the second half of the year. We have again generated strong cash
flows despite a volatile gold price, which has further strengthened our balance sheet and improved flexibility,"" Chief Executive Officer
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""We will continue to deliver on our strategy through the development of high-return, brownfield
projects in order to continue to improve the underlying quality of our portfolio.""

The Company's strategy remains on track with a focus on generating free cash flow on a sustainable basis. Having delivered certain
production improvements, significant achievements in addressing our cost structures, balance sheet, and portfolio mix of
AngloGold Ashanti, management will continue to work to strengthen the foundation of the business by unlocking value at its
existing assets. The extraction of value through high return, low capital projects with relatively accelerated payback periods will
become the next source of improved cash flows and portfolio quality enhancements. These in turn will assist in sustainable cash
generation from the business.

FULL YEAR REVIEW
Free cash flow for 2016 was $278m, nearly double the $141m achieved in 2015, after meeting $30m in once-off costs to redeem the
high- yield bond, helped by a strong turn-around in the production performance in the second half of the year, the higher gold price and
lower interest payments.

Cash inflow from operating activities for 2016 was $1,186m, $47m more than the $1,139m in 2015, despite a 5% drop in production
from continued operations and higher operating costs. The gold price received was up 8% year-on-year.

Production of 3.628Moz, from continuing operations, was within the original guidance for the year ended 31 December 2016 at a total
cash cost of $744/oz, compared to production of 3.830Moz at a cash cost of $712/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015. Production
was negatively impacted by weaker production from the South African operations largely as a result of safety-related stoppages, lower
grades from Kibali, a planned decrease in head grades at Tropicana and Geita as noted earlier in the year, and
Obuasi being in care and maintenance for all of 2016. However, Mponeng and Moab Khotsong in South Africa delivered increased
production for the year together with Iduapriem and Siguiri in the Continental Africa region, and Sunrise Dam in Australia. Mponeng
delivered the best improvement, with a 16% increase in production and a 14% decrease in AISC year-on-year.

AISC came in at $986/oz, up from $910/oz in 2015. The AISC reflects continued cost discipline and weaker currencies in some
jurisdictions, offset by an increase in capital expenditure, inflation and exploration costs, all against the backdrop of a 15% decline in
grade and safety-related stoppages in South Africa, which led to lower year-on-year production levels.

Earnings improved sharply in 2016 from the previous year. Adjusted Headline Earnings were up to $143m, or 35 cents per share,
compared with $49m, or 12 cents per share in 2015. Net profit attributable to equity shareholders during 2016 was $63m compared with
a net loss from continuing operations of $85m a year earlier. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the higher gold price
received, weaker operating currencies in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, continued focus on cost control, interest savings and a
lower effective tax rate, and was partially offset by reduced income from associates and joint ventures.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) of $1,548m in 2016 increased by $76m, or 5%
from the $1,472m recorded in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 37.9% in 2016, from 36.7% in 2015. The ratio of net
debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2016 was 1.24 times compared with 1.49 times at the end of December 2015,
highlighting the success of AngloGold Ashanti's continued efforts to improve financial flexibility as the current net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA ratio falls in well below the covenant ratio of 3.5 times which applies under our revolving credit agreements.

Net debt fell by 13% to $1.916bn in 2016, from $2.190bn at the end of 2015. At the end of July 2016, AngloGold Ashanti redeemed the
$503m outstanding on 8.5% bonds due in 2020 by drawing down $330m from the US dollar $1bn revolving credit facility (RCF) and the
balance from cash on hand. The redemption was executed with the purpose of eliminating the company's highest-cost debt, and
reducing both interest payments and the concentration of debt maturities in 2020, while improving free cash flow and introducing
additional balance-sheet flexibility. Management has since focused on paying down existing RCFs at a steady pace.

The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising $950m available on the $1bn US dollar RCF at the end of December
2016, A$265m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R2.2bn available from the South African RCF and other
facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $215m as at the end of December 2016.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) fell within the guidance given earlier in the year at $811m for the year
ended 31 December 2016 compared to $799m for the year ended 31 December 2015 (from continuing operations). This increase was
largely due to increased spend on asset improvements in Australia and Brazil as planned, partially offset by lower spend in South Africa
and the Continental Africa region. The capital expenditure in Continental Africa was mainly impacted by the cessation of work on the
underground decline access at Obuasi in Ghana and a reduction in spending at Kibali. In the South Africa region, although spending
remained relatively stable year-on-year in rand terms, there was lower capital spend than initially planned, mainly due to the impact of
safety stoppages and exchange rates.

SECOND HALF YEAR REVIEW
Free cash flow of $170m was generated in the second half of 2016, after accounting for the once-off $30m bond redemption cost paid
on settlement of the remaining $1.25bn bonds. The second-half free cash flow improvement was boosted by a receipt of $28m cash,
from the sale of metal from Argentina which was delayed in the first half of 2016 and received in the first week of the second 
half of 2016.

The second half of 2016 reflected a steady operating and financial performance, despite safety-related stoppages that impacted
production by about 60,000oz in SA, planned lower grades at Geita and Tropicana, and the Obuasi mine having been on care and
maintenance for the 2016 year. These negative production factors were offset by continued focus on fundamental cost management, a
14% higher realised gold price, and weaker currencies in some jurisdictions.

AISC for second half of 2016 was $1,058/oz, higher than the $897/oz for the second half of 2015 as a result of the lower gold ounces
sold, higher overall cash costs, higher brownfields exploration costs, and increased sustaining capital expenditure. AISC were also
favourably impacted by weaker currencies in South Africa and Argentina, which was partially offset by the strengthening of the Brazilian
Real and the Australian dollar against the US dollar.

Despite the reduction in net finance costs and an increase in the gold price, the second half of 2016 saw an adjusted headline loss of
$16m, compared to a loss of $12m in the second half of 2015 due to an increase in net income tax and lower earnings from equity 
accounted investments.

Adjusted EBITDA of $767m, increased by 13% in the second half of 2016 compared to $679m in the second half of 2015, due to the
increase in the average gold price received, and despite a 5% reduction in ounces sold over this period.

Capital expenditure in the second half of 2016 (including discontinued operations and equity accounted investments) was $493m
compared to $430m (include $10m for discontiued operations) in the same period of 2015. Of the total capital spent, project capital 
expenditure during the period amounted to $71m. Total capital expenditure was 55% higher in the second half of 2016 compared to the 
first half mainly due to normal seasonalspending patterns at our operations.

SAFETY UPDATE

There is no higher priority for AngloGold Ashanti than the safety of every one of its employees. It is a commitment that the company will
continue to demonstrate across its global portfolio, including the world's deepest mines that it operates in South Africa. Over the past
decade, AngloGold Ashanti has reduced operating fatalities by more than 80%. Over the same period, it has improved its all injury
frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace injuries, by more than two-thirds. We will not relent in our endeavours to
prevent harm to employees.

The improvements of the past decade have come through a focus on improved operating and safety systems and technologies, as well
as an emphasis on ensuring that every person in the company places a greater focus on identifying and avoiding risk. In an
environment where minor missteps can have catastrophic consequences, it is critical that we not only are relentless in identifying and
eliminating hazards, but that we instill a culture that prizes safety above all else. We have made encouraging strides in that regard and
will continue to look for ways to improve.

Like in any heavy industry, and especially in a company like ours that employs more than 50,000 people globally, human error remains
among our greatest challenges. This is an aspect of the business that we continue to work hard to mitigate in cooperation with a broad
group of stakeholders.

As has been reported, six operating fatalities were recorded in South Africa during 2016 and another in Brazil.

There have, however, been important gains. In our efforts to deal with this challenge, the fourth quarter of 2016 passed without a fatality
in any business unit, and at year-end the South Africa business unit reached fatality-free 158 days. Whilst this demonstrates some
successes in the implementation of our safety strategy, we must remain vigilant to ensure that we continue to make gains in this most
important area of the business.

The AIFR improved to 7.02 per million hours worked for the quarter ended 31 December 2016 compared to 7.25 per million hours
worked for the quarter ended 31 December 2015. Significant safety milestones recorded during the year include one million fatality free
shifts at Mponeng, Kopanang, Moab Khotsong and the Regional Services Department, two-million fatality-free shifts for the Vaal River
Region as a whole; Moab Khotsong achieved a full calendar year without a fatality in September and the Surface Operations unit
achieved a full year with no lost-time injury. The Savuka gold plant won South Africa's coveted JT Ryan award for operating without a
fatality since 1961. In Continental Africa, Siguiri and Iduapriem passed the second half 2016 with no injuries whatsoever, whilst the
Americas had 46 injuries of which 15 were lost time injuries and Australia had 18 injuries of which 10 were lost time injuries.

As AngloGold Ashanti has continually demonstrated, we value close cooperation with all role players in this industry, including our
employees and our partners in organised labour, and also our regulator in the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR). We believe it is
crucial to the wellbeing of every employee that this relationship is not only professional and respectful, but also tightly bound by the laws
and regulations that govern the industry.

We continue to seek dialogue with the DMR at every level, with the primary aim of improving safety and ensuring fair and proportional
application of applicable safety legislation. Where there is disagreement, we will continue - as we have done - to use the proper appeal
mechanisms and legal remedies available under the Mine Health and Safety Act and associated legislation.

We believe that through close cooperation among stakeholders and fair application of regulations with due regard to proportionality, as
well as continued vigilance in an unpredictable operating environment, we can further improve on the safety gains made in 
the past decade.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations produced 967,000oz at a total cash cost of $896/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016 compared to
1,004,000oz at a total cash cost of $881oz for the year ended 31 December 2015. The decline in production was mainly due to lower
underground volumes and grades over the period, with the most significant decrease at TauTona. The operational performance in 2016
was predominantly impacted by a range of safety-related stoppages across all operations resulting in an estimated loss of 104,000oz,
with TauTona, Moab Khotsong and Kopanang most affected.

The benefit of the weaker exchange rate compared with the corresponding period a year earlier largely offset the impact of lower
production volumes and inflationary pressures on total cash costs, which rose 2%. Inflationary pressures included annual power tariff
increases and salary adjustments. AISC at $1,081/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016 reflected a decline from $1,088/oz
achieved for the year ended 31 December 2015.

For the six months ended 31 December 2016 the region produced 481,000oz at a total cash cost of $984/oz compared to the
505,000oz at a total cash cost of $867/oz for the same period in 2015. AISC were $1,205/oz for the six months ended 31 December
2016, compared to $1,079/oz achieved in the second half of 2015. Lower grades and inflationary pressures had a significant impact on
unit costs in the second half of 2016.

At the West Wits, Mponeng delivered the best performance in the region for the year, with a 16% increase in production and a 14%
decrease in AISC year-on-year, mainly through successful implementation of the 'de-risk mine plan' formulated to improve safety at the
mine. The subsequent move out of higher grade areas was augmented by high-quality mining practices and an improved mining mix,
whilst the mine had fewer safety related disruptions in 2016 compared to the previous year.

At TauTona, production for 2016 decreased due to four main issues:
  -   early in the first quarter the need for modified secondary support standards for all development ends was identified, delaying
      some development during implementation;
  -   a seismic event occurred in the Savuka section in April, leading to the suspension of the majority of mining in that section for
      safe rehabilitation;
  -   a fatal underground locomotive accident in third quarter suspended operations whilst remedial actions were taken; and
  -   lower face-grades, compounded by off-reef mining due to underground geological structures.

At the Vaal River, Moab Khotsong delivered a production increase of 10% year-on-year. This was as a result of an increase in volume
mined, with additional face length and a 5% increase in Mine Call Factor, while the underground mined grade increased by 3% given
the areas mined.

At Kopanang, production for the year was dampened by lower volumes mined and a 6% drop in mined grade year-on-year as well as
plagued by safety related stoppages throughout the year. Lower volumes mined were a result of lower efficiencies brought about by
face time constraints due to mining in the extremities. The mining cycle has been changed to mitigate this going forward, allowing for
the most efficient use of the limited face time.

Surface Operations for the year ended 31 December 2016 produced 187,000oz at a total cash costs of $899/oz, compared to
193,000oz at a total cash cost of $912/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015. At Mine Waste Solutions (MWS), production ended
relatively flat year-on-year with a 7% increase in tonnage throughput for 2016, offset by lower feed grades and lower recoveries. The
uranium plant was recommissioned in the second half of 2016 and the first uranium was produced in August. Additionally, the
optimisation of the plant circuit continues so as to improve the recoveries going forward.

The Continental Africa region delivered 1.321Moz at a total cash cost of $717/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016 compared to
1.435Moz at a total cash cost of $678/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015. The region has maintained its record of consistent and
solid delivery despite no contribution from Obuasi (currently under care and maintenance) and operational challenges at Kibali
encountered during first half of 2016. Production was also impacted by planned lower recovered grades at Geita whilst Morila, in closure
phase, is now treating lower grade marginal and tailings grade ore. AISC were $904/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016
compared to $815/oz the year ended 31 December 2015.

For the six months ended 31 December 2016 the region produced 702,000oz at a total cash cost of $742/oz compared to the
716,000oz at a total cash cost of $681/oz for the same period in 2015. Total cash costs increased due to lower production,
grades and inefficiencies. AISC were $958/oz for the six months ended 31 December 2016, compared to $822/oz achieved in the same
period in 2015.

In Ghana, production at Iduapriem increased 11% as a result of mining in deeper, higher-grade areas, and a 9% increase in tonnage
treated from higher plant utilisation, compared to the previous year when the plant had an extended major shutdown upgrading the SAG
mill. Total cash costs decreased with production uptake partly offset by increased mining activity and associated costs.

In the Republic of Guinea, production at Siguiri increased as a result of a 3% increase in tonnes treated as the mine plan improved
compared to the previous year, partly offset by a planned decrease in recovered grade. Total cash costs decreased by 5%, mostly as a
result of increased production due to the improved mine plan.

In Mali, Morila has fully transitioned to treat lower grade marginal and tailings ore, although the decrease in recovered grade has been
partly offset by a 23% increase in tonnage throughput compared to the previous year as a result of consistent plant availability and
treatment of softer ore.

Sadiola delivered the planned 5% year-on-year increase in recovered grade, partly offset by a 3% decrease in tonnage throughput as a 
result of an increase in the treatment of transitional material.

In the DRC, Kibali's attributable production was 264,000oz for 2016, having increased significantly in the second half relative to the 
first half of 2016 by 32%, due to much improved plant performance and recovery, and increased production from the underground mine.

In Tanzania, Geita's 7% decrease in production was due to a planned 12% decrease in recovered grade in line with the mining plan,
partly offset by a 5% increase in plant throughput from treatment of softer ore, improved plant availability and consistent operations.
Total cash costs increased as a result of the decrease in production year-on-year. The mine has seen a good transition from the Star &
Comet pit to underground. Permitting for underground mining at Nyankanga has been granted in full. The mine will now commence the 
evaluation of additional underground options to increase resource and production, and extend mine life.

The Americas region produced 819,000oz for the year ended 31 December 2016 at a total cash cost of $578/oz compared to
831,000oz at a total cash cost of $576/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015. AISC were $875/oz, compared to $792/oz achieved in
the same period in 2015. Production volumes were impacted by lower year-on-year contribution from Brazil.

For the six months ended 31 December 2016 the region produced 431,000oz at a total cash cost of $604/oz compared to 454,000oz at
a total cash cost of $529/oz for the same period in 2015. Total cash costs increased due to decreased production. AISC were $929/oz,
compared to $745/oz achieved in the same period in 2015.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia achieved the highest annual production for the past 17 years; producing 281,000oz for the year ended
31 December 2016 at a total cash cost of $563/oz compared to 278,000oz at a total cash cost $625/oz for the year ended 31 December
2015. The production increase was attributable to the higher tonnes treated at the plant following operational and metallurgical
improvements, partially offset by lower grades due to variability in the mining model. Total cash costs were 10% lower mainly due to
local currency devaluation, higher by-product income helped by volume and price improvements, partially offset by annual 
salary increases.

Brazil commenced 2016 facing production challenges caused by geotechnical, licensing and geological modelling issues. The mine
plan at Mineração was revised accordingly, delivering improved production which helped offset the shortfall from the first half of 2016.
The revised mine plan comprised the treatment of additional ore from lower grade zones, partially compensating the production gap with
higher tonnage treated. Serra Grande experienced a delay in receiving permits required for the open pit as well as the geotechnical
challenges at the ramp to access high grade areas at underground Mina Nova, in the Pequizao orebody.

AISC were $923/oz for the year ended 31 December 2016 compared to $748/oz for same period in 2015, mainly due to higher capital
expenditure, inflation pressures, local currency appreciation, and lower gold produced. The higher capital expenditure is attributable to
higher ore reserve development and work done to increase mine flexibility at all operations, as well as tailings dam raises and
conversion of metallurgical leaching process.

The Australia region produced 520,000oz for 2016 at a total cash cost of $793/oz compared to 560,000oz at a total cash cost of
$702/oz for 2015.

For the six months ended 31 December 2016 the region produced 269,000oz at a total cash cost of $781/oz compared to 278,000oz at
a total cash cost of $704/oz for the same period in 2015. Total cash costs increased due to a weaker Australian dollar, planned lower
production at Tropicana (70%) and increased mining spend at Sunrise Dam, where an extra jumbo was added to the fleet to set up new
mining areas and carry out decline development, lifting mined ore tonnes. AISC was $1,115/oz for the six months ended 31 December
2016, compared to $873/oz achieved in the same period in 2015.

Production for 2016 in Australia was impacted by lower contribution from Tropicana, mainly due to the first phase of grade
streaming coming to an end in December 2015. However, processing plant throughput was 13% higher for the period following
completion of the Plant Optimisation Project, and the plant was operating at an annualized rate of more than 7.5 mtpa by the end of H2.

Production at Sunrise Dam increased due to 4% higher mill throughput and a 15% increase in head grade as the large Dolly stope was
brought into production.

CORPORATE UPDATES

In December 2016, AngloGold Ashanti reported an improved production outlook at the Tropicana Gold Mine in Western Australia, based
on higher mining and processing rates along with a 45% increase in the mine's Ore Reserve estimate. See the updated Mineral
Resource and Ore Reserve below.

Chief Operating Officer - International
Ron Largent, who has had a distinguished career within AngloGold Ashanti since 1994 and more than 30 years' experience in
international mining operations and project management, will be retiring with effect from 30 June 2017. During his period of service with

initiatives and assumed safety, production, costs and project accountabilities from Ron during 2017. Ludwig will replace Ron on
AngloGold Ashanti's group executive committee effective 22 February 2017 and will continue to work with Ron to complete the 
well advanced transition.

Board of Directors
In accordance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, AngloGold Ashanti wishes to inform shareholders 
of changes to its board of directors (""the Board"") and Board committees. 

Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu (73) has notified the Board of his intention to retire as an independent non-executive director at the 
company's forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on 16 May 2017, after eight years of distinguished service, and will thus 
not stand for re-election on such date. 

During his tenure, Professor Nkuhlu, a Chartered Accountant, was the deputy chairman of the Board and an invaluable member of its 
Audit and Risk, Investment, Nominations, and Remuneration and Human Resources committees. 

The Board wishes to thank Professor Nkuhlu for his significant contribution to the Company during his tenure and wishes him all the 
very best on his retirement from the Board.

""We greatly value the insight, incisiveness and independence that Wiseman has brought to the Board of AngloGold Ashanti for close to 
a decade,"" Chairman Sipho Pityana said. ""He has added value to the Board and the Company and we wish him well in any and all of his 
future endeavours.""

In addition, on 2 December 2016 AngloGold Ashanti announced the appointment of Sindiswa Zilwa as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 1 April 2017.

Sindi Zilwa will be appointed as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee, Remuneration and Human Resources Committee and Investment
Committee, and Maria Richter will be appointed as a member of the Nominations Committee from May 2017.


OBUASI UPDATE

In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced area of the Obuasi mine site, AngloGold
Ashanti was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew all employees performing non-essential functions.
At its peak, an estimated 12,000 illegal miners operated across the previously fenced-off area of the site. A directive to clear the site of
illegal mining by 10 October 2016 was given by the Minerals Commission which, along with a multi-stakeholder committee it
established, prepared alternative sites off the company lease for the miners to relocate to.

On 18 October 2016, the Security Task Force took the first concerted steps to start to restore safety and security at 
the Obuasi concession.

At each step along the way, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana was at pains to petition authorities to ensure that the process of clearing illegal
mining activity from site should be done with the least amount of force and with full deference to the Voluntary Principles on Security
and Human Rights.

As of 13 February, 2017, all areas within our fenced operational area have been cleared of illegal miners, and all identified illegal mining
holes within the fence have been closed. Following a review of the safety, surface and underground conditions we have notified the
Ghanaian authorities that the circumstances that led to the declaration of force majeure no longer exist and as such lifted the force
majeure with effect from 13 February 2017.

Note, however, there remains further work to be undertaken in relation to the removal of the illegal mining activities outside of the
fenced area but within the Obuasi concession area. Only once that process is complete, and the feasibility study for the redevelopment
of the mine has been updated with the relevant information, will the company be in a position to outline its plans for Obuasi.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Mponeng project
The Phase 1 project is in the production build up phase. Infrastructure development on 123 level has progressed to schedule with four
raise lines holed in total during 2016. The construction of the capital infrastructure, execution of ore reserve development, as well as the
improvement of logistical efficiency ran on schedule during 2016. The ramp up to steady state ore reserve development is expected to
commence in second half of 2017 after the ore handling infrastructure has been commissioned.

On Phase 2, commissioning of the surface sub-station was completed by Eskom at the end of 2016. Other activities continued during
the quarter, including the inter-level ice-hole equipping, the construction of the 116 Level sub-station as well as the water handling
infrastructure complex on 121 Level.

Siguiri
Following the successful ratification of the Convention by the government of the Republic of Guinea, construction for the expansion and
conversion of the processing plant infrastructure will commence, which will facilitate the processing of harder sulphide ore thereby
extending mine life, increasing production and lowering unit costs, whilst also improving the exploration potential in the area surrounding
the mine. In addition, a further $43m has been approved for the construction of an owner build power station which will provide cost benefits.

Sadiola
The updated feasibility study for the mining and treatment of harder sulphide ore at Sadiola, that will increase processing plant
throughput, lower unit costs and extend mine life, has been completed together with IAMGOLD, our joint venture partner. Further work
on the project is subject to achieving requisite government approvals, agreements and permits. Discussions are currently underway with
ministries of the government of the Republic of Mali with a view to expeditiously achieve these approvals. Capital costs are now expected
to be $410m (100% of the project).

Kibali
The shaft sinking has reached the shaft bottom at the completed depth of 751.2m and equipping of shaft has been completed. The
focus for the quarter was on the off shaft development, with 780m of development achieved. The underground development during
the latter part of 2016 totalled 3,503m. First ore from the shaft is expected in the third quarter in 2017.

At the Ambarau hydro power plant, construction continued during the quarter, with first power having been rescheduled to the first
quarter of 2017. The Azambi hydro power plant, the third hydro power plant to be constructed, is still on plan to be completed in 2018.
The construction work has commenced, with focus on site establishment and soft excavations to allow for the temporary berm work to
start.

The project to expand the mine's ultra-fine grinding capacity to improve full sulphide feed recoveries, continued according to schedule,
with commissioning planned for the first quarter of 2017.

Technology and Innovation
The progress that the Technology Innovation Consortium made in 2016 and the highlights of the project are set out below:

1.   Reef Boring
1.1  Small range:
In 2016 the Sandvik/Cubex machine was commissioned at the Savuka section of the mine but due to challenges faced during the stage
gate reviews, the program had to be discontinued and the machine will be decommissioned.

1.2  Medium Range:
The medium range uses the MKIV Machine and MKIII machines. During the year, the MKIV machine was commissioned in the test
site and has drilled 23 holes, with four holes drilled in the fourth quarter of 2016. It was determined that the quality of the holes
regressed due to the self-pinning cylinders failing during the drilling cycle. The MKIV is now designated for research and development
trials and to ensure that design targets are met on this proto-type machine.

The MK III Machines were used in the Carbon Leader Reef (CLR) and Ventersdorp Contact Reef proto type sites. Drilling continued in
the CLR block, totalling 33 holes in the first half of 2016. At the end of the second quarter 2016, geotechnical concerns resulted in a
revised extraction strategy that resulted in the loss of some current mining ground and consequently the reduction of one machine.

Another MK III machine was installed in the VCR site and drilling commenced in third quarter of 2016 after commissioning, ending the
year with a total eight holes drilled. The usual teething problems associated with a commissioning process were resolved. Work will
continue at both sites in a stage gate approach, with the aim of achieving consistent performance to prove the economic viability 
of the project.

2.   Ore body Knowledge and Exploration
The year started with the aim to improve on the final accuracy trial on the Sandvik/Cubex machine. The analysis indicated that the
drilled holes followed a similar trend, implying that a correction factor could be applied to ensure an accurate end point is reached. The
drilling trials with the Bohrmeister fit-for-purpose drill rig commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 after it's commissioning at TauTona
mine. The first stage gates were met after drilling four holes at the set drilling target rate (8m/hr) and hole depth (100m) at different
inclinations.

3.   Ultra-High Strength Backfill (UHSB)
To date two plants were successfully commissioned; one plant at the CLR site and the other at the VCR site at TauTona mine. The
plants are in full operation and have the capabilities of mixing the dry tailings underground with the other ingredients, thereafter
pumping the final product at 4m³/hour over a distance of 600m.

Engineering construction and equipping of the Savuka CLR plant and the TauTona Below 120 plant will commence as soon as
the site excavation is completed in the first half of 2017.

Construction of the surface solution plant was completed in the fourth quarter. This plant is expected to allow for pumping the
UHSB solution (UHSB product excluding cement) from surface to the Below 120 plant underground.

Mponeng extraction ratio improvement project product development is in progress. A range of designs have been tested and the
characteristics have been modelled. Final results are pending before a suitable product can be identified.

EXPLORATION UPDATE

Greenfields Exploration

During the second half of 2016, greenfields exploration activities were undertaken in Australia, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, USA,
Guinea, and Tanzania. Greenfields Exploration completed 1,173m of RC/diamond drilling and 39,555m of aircore drilling in Australia.
Total expenditure for the second half of 2016 was $16m.

In Australia, the Butcher Well and Lake Carey farm-in agreement was signed between AngloGold Ashanti and Saracen Mineral
Holdings Limited. AngloGold Ashanti has acquired earn-in rights for 340 km(2) of tenements on and along the western margin of Lake
Carey in the Laverton district of Western Australia. The first phase of drilling at Butcher Well is expected to commence 
in February 2017.

Elsewhere in the Laverton district, AngloGold Ashanti completed aircore drilling over 100% AngloGold Ashanti-held targets with 526
holes drilled for a total of 34,977m. Results were received from drilling at Ahab, Nemo, Poseidon and Pioneer and included several
encouraging results from both Ahab and Pioneer. These positive aircore samples from Pioneer were followed-up by a six RC holes with
three diamond tails (702m/471m) and results of this drilling will be available in the first quarter of 2017.

At the Strawbridge Project, the planned aircore drilling programme was completed with 61 aircore holes drilled for a total of 4,738m in
the third quarter. Results from the aircore drilling and geochemical sampling completed in 2016 were disappointing, with no significant
results returned. The project is currently under review.

In Colombia, a re-evaluation of the regional geology at Guintar led to identifying subtle multi-element epithermal signatures in gravels
associated with N-S trending graben structures to the east. Follow-up on this target, Nuevo Guintar, indicates a potentially preserved,
epithermal target. Detailed mapping, soil sampling and ground geophysics is underway delineating the drill target.

In Brazil, work concentrated on the Tromai Project which covers the large tenement package (~2,000km(2)) covered by the JV Agreement
with Luna Gold. Regional mapping and soil sampling programmes are underway, as is a high resolution aeromagnetic and radiometric
survey (11,200km completed). This data is being compiled and interpreted to prioritize drill targets. In parallel, considerable effort has
also been placed on obtaining environmental permits for planned drilling expected to start in the first quarter of 2017.

In Tanzania, Guinea, Argentina, and the USA early stage Greenfields evaluation and reconnaissance programmes progressed.

Brownfields Exploration

Brownfields exploration activities were undertaken across the globe in the second half of 2016. Brownfields Exploration completed 327
601m of diamond drilling for a total expenditure for the second half of 2016 of $34m (capital) and $31m (expensed).

At Mponeng in South Africa, Borehole UD59 was successfully completed and site rehabilitation is complete. Borehole UD60 intersected
the VCR at a depth of 3650m and yielded a significant gold value. The short deflection drilling programme has been completed and a
total of six reef intersections obtained. Borehole UD58A intersected moderate grade VCR at a depth of 3794m. Short deflection drilling
is underway. The hole remains on target to complete deflection drilling and demobilisation by May 2017.

At Geita in Tanzania, exploration activities included Mineral Resource conversion drilling at Nyankanga Block 5, Star & Comet
Underground drilling (Cut 2 and 3), Mineral Resource delineation at Star & Comet Cut 2 NW, Cut 3 and Matandani as well as
reconnaissance exploration drilling at Prospect 30 and completion of a drillhole at Geita Hill East as part of the 3D seismic survey
programme. 90 holes totalling 18,200m were completed for both surface and underground exploration drilling programmes.
Interpretation and targeting continues on the 3D seismic data.

At the Siguri in Guinea, a total of 27,483m were drilled. Exploration activities included infill drilling at Seguelen PB2, Seguelen PB2 East,
Silakoro, Tubani and Kami and reconnaissance drilling at Silakoro.

At Iduapriem in Ghana, exploration focused on drilling at Block 7&8, Nueng and Block 1W, as well as concluding of the soil
geochemistry programme across the western lease. A total of 6,467m drilling was completed, consisting of 4,497m Diamond Drilling
(DD) and 1,970m reverse circulation (RC) drilling.

At Kibali in the DRC, near mine exploration took place at the Rhino-Agbarabo-Kombokolo area, Sessenge Southwest, Pamao, Kanga
Sud, Ndala Village and Aerodrome, while regional exploration was focused on the Kalimva-Ikamva targets in the north and Aindi Watsa-
Dilolo-Zambula in the south. A total of 15,506m was drilled (14,096m RC and 1,410m DD).

At Sadiola, in Mali, a total of 9,667m drilling, comprising 8,955m RC and 712m DD, was completed across SSP North, FNa, FNb-c,
Tambali and Voyager East.

In Argentina, drilling continued at Cerro Vanguardia. Most of the drilling meters continuing to be completed at the nearby Claudia JV.
During H2, 10,657m were drilled, including 3,889m at the Claudia JV. Other work completed to support target generation included
trenching and channel sampling programmes to refine drill targeting and an HLEM geophysical survey at the Claudia JV.

In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiaba, Lamego and CdS production centers for AGABM with 74,107m drilled from the combined
surface and underground drilling programmes. Targets included ore body extension at Cuiaba and CdS. Follow up infill drilling to
support mine planning and Mineral Resource conversion was also completed.

At Serra Grande, 33,177m were drilled as part of the exploration and Mineral Resource conversion programmes. Drilling target
generation activities included mapping and soil sampling programmes. A ground magnetic EM geophysical survey was also completed
to support drill target generation.

In Colombia, the Gramalote JV completed 4,441m of drilling to support site and infrastructure investigations. The saprolite infill drilling
programme continued to better define the thickness and gold mineralisation in the horizon. Work to update and refine the geological
model progressed to support the pre-feasibility study, which remains on track for completion by the end of 2017. Drilling started on
targets within the JV regional tenements outside the main project area.

At La Colosa, 1,639m were drilled as the site investigation geotechnical and hydrology drilling programmes continued. A geophysical
survey to support the site infrastructure designs was completed.

The Quebradona JV programme completed conceptual study work and began field work and a drilling programme to support pre-
feasibility study site investigation geotechnical and hydrology data collection.

In Australia, exploration drilling at Sunrise Dam focused on resource extension and infill of the underground resource. Drilling targeted
the Vogue South and Vogue Deeps domains, northern extensions to Cosmo and Cosmo East, Cosmo East down-dip, Elle, Midway
Shear and Sunrise Shear. A total of 36,778m were drilled.

At Tropicana, the Long Island 100m x 100m drilling programme to test the strike extent and down-dip extensions of the known
mineralised system was completed. In the period, additional closer spaced drilling was undertaken at Boston Shaker to deliver an
Indicated Mineral Resource, and minor infill drill programmes were completed at Tropicana, Havana and Havana South. A total of
18,948m of RC and 20,821m of DD holes were completed.

See the Exploration Update document on the company website: www.anglogoldashanti.com for more details on both Brownfields and
Greenfields exploration programmes conducted during the year ended 31 December 2016.

DIVIDENDS

The Board has approved the resumption of the payment of an annual dividend by the Company. The dividend policy now provides for
an annual dividend to be based on 10% of the free cash flow generated by the business for that financial year, before growth capital
expenditure. The Board will exercise its discretion on an annual basis, taking into consideration the prevailing market conditions,
balance sheet flexibility and future capital commitments of the group.

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions or power disruptions, nor changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material
adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to
have been correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
31 December 2015, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve for AngloGold Ashanti are reported in accordance with the minimum
standards described by the South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources
and Mineral Reserves (The SAMREC Code, 2016 edition), and also conform to the standards set out in the
Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 
(JORC Code, 2012 Edition).

The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Ore Reserve component unless otherwise stated. In complying with
revisions to the SAMREC Code the changes to AngloGold Ashanti's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
have been reviewed and it was concluded that none of the changes are material to the overall valuation of
the Company. AngloGold Ashanti has therefore once again resolved not to provide the detailed reporting as
defined in Table 1 of the Code. The Company will however continue to provide the high level of detail it has
in previous years in order to comply with the transparency requirements of the Code.

AngloGold Ashanti strives to actively create value by growing its major asset - the Mineral Resource and
Ore Reserve. This drive is based on active, well-defined brownfields and greenfields exploration
programmes, innovation in both geological modelling and mine planning and continual optimisation of the
asset portfolio.

The SAMREC and JORC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-
range commodity price forecasts which are prepared in-house.

MINERAL RESOURCE
The total Mineral Resource increased from 207.8 million ounces (Moz) in December 2015 to 214.7Moz in
December 2016. A gross annual increase of 11.3Moz occurred before depletion, while the net increase after
allowing for depletion is 6.9Moz. Changes in economic assumptions from December 2015 to December
2016 resulted in a 1.7Moz increase to the Mineral Resource, whilst exploration and modelling resulted in an
increase of 10.0Moz. Depletion from the Mineral Resource for the year totalled 4.4Moz. The Mineral
Resource has been estimated at a gold price of US$1,400/oz (2015: US$1,400/oz).

ORE RESERVE
The AngloGold Ashanti Ore Reserve reduced from 51.7Moz in December 2015 to 50.1Moz in December
2016. This gross annual decrease of 1.6Moz includes depletion of 3.9Moz. The balance of 2.3Moz additions
in Ore Reserve, results from changes in economic assumptions between 2015 and 2016 of 0.2Moz, whilst
exploration and modelling changes resulted in further additions of 2.3Moz. Other factors resulted in a 0.3Moz
decrease. The Ore Reserve has been estimated using a gold price of US$1,100/oz (2015: US$1,100/oz).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

AngloGold Ashanti has established a Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Steering Committee (RRSC),
which is responsible for setting and overseeing the company's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
governance framework and for ensuring that it meets the company's goals and objectives while complying
with all relevant regularity codes. Its membership and terms of references are mandated under a policy
document signed off by the Chief Executive Officer.

Over more than a decade, the company has developed and implemented a rigorous system of internal and
external reviews aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates.
The following operations were subject to an external review in line with the policy that each operation project
will be reviewed by an independent third party on average once every three years:

-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at South African Surface Operations
-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at AGA Mineração - Córrego do Sítio
-   Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Sadiola

The external reviews were conducted by AMEC, Optiro and Snowden respectively. Certificate of
competence documentation has been received for the first two audits from the companies conducting the
external reviews to state that the Mineral Resource and/or Ore Reserve comply with the SAMREC and
JORC Codes. A signed NI 43-101 report was provided in the case of Sadiola.

In addition, numerous internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve process reviews were completed by
suitably qualified Competent Persons from within AngloGold Ashanti and no significant deficiencies were
identified. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve are underpinned by appropriate Mineral Resource
Management processes and protocols that ensure adequate corporate governance. These procedures have
been developed to be compliant with the guiding principles of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).

AngloGold Ashanti makes use of a web based group reporting database called the Resource and Reserve
Reporting System (R3) for the compilation and authorisation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve
reporting. It is a fully integrated system for the reporting and reconciliation of Mineral Resource and Ore
Reserve that supports various regulatory reporting requirements including the SEC and the JSE under
SAMREC. AngloGold Ashanti uses R3 to ensure a documented chain of responsibility exists from the
competent persons at the operations to the company's RRSC.

AngloGold Ashanti has also developed an enterprise-wide risk management tool that provides consistent
and reliable data that allows for visibility of risks and actions across the group. This tool is used to 
facilitate, control and monitor material risks to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve, thus ensuring that the
appropriate risk management and mitigation plans are in place.

Independent auditor's review report on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016
to the Shareholders of AngloGold Ashanti Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti Limited (the company) contained in the
accompanying preliminary report on pages 18 to 31, which comprise the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position 
as at 31 December 2016, the condensed consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the financial statements, and the 
requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these preliminary financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with 
International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information performed by the independent
auditor of the entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
preliminary financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. 
This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily
consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and
evaluating the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these preliminary financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements of the company for the year ended 31 December 2016 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements 
of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 1 to the financial statements and the requirements of the 
Companies Act of South Africa.

        meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that
        sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

        Borrowings
        The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing market values at the reporting date which results
        in the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis
        and accordingly the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair value.

        Derivatives
        The fair value of derivatives is estimated based on ruling market prices, volatilities, interest rates and credit risk and includes all
        derivatives carried in the statement of financial position.
        Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position.
        The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
        Level 1:        quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
        Level 2:        inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
                        (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
        Level 3:        inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

        On 28 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, was
        compelling the surrender following the notice to buy back the remaining principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% high-yield bonds
        that mature in May 2020, as part of its strategy to reduce debt and lower finance charges. On 1 August 2016, the remaining
        portions of the notes were settled for a total consideration of $503m consisting of a $471m principal payment, a surrender
        premium of $30m and interest of $2m.

        Environmental obligations

        Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and
        rehabilitate the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence AngloGold Ashanti is required in
        some circumstances to provide either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or
        provide guarantees issued by the operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or such other government
        department with responsibility for environmental oversight in the respective country to cover the potential environmental
        rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.

        In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are
        required to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.

        In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.36bn and guarantees of ZAR 1.82bn issued by
        various banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 1.29bn. In Australia, since 2014, we have paid into a Mine
        Rehabilitation Fund an amount of AUD $3m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $98.9m. At Iduapriem we have
        provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $9.8m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $33.9m issued by
        Ecobank Ghana Limited and Barclays Ghana Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $43.9m. At Obuasi we have
        provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.2m with a further bank guarantee amounting to $31.7m issued by
        Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $216.2m. In some circumstances we may be required to post further
        bonds in due course which will have a consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the providers of the
        reclamation bonds.

      Litigation claims
(1)   Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti,
      the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases
      Act, 1993 does not cover an ""employee"" who qualifies for compensation in respect of ""compensable diseases"" under the
      Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act, 1973 (ODMWA). This judgement allows such qualifying employee to pursue
      a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the Constitutional Court decision, AngloGold Ashanti and members
      of the working group (discussed below) have been subject to numerous claims relating to silicosis and other Occupational
      Lung Diseases (OLD), including several potential class actions and individual claims.

      In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields Limited, Harmony Gold Mining Company
      Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited formed an industry working group on OLD to address issues relating to compensation and
      medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working group now also includes
      African Rainbow Minerals (ARM). The working group remains of the view that achieving a comprehensive settlement which is
      both fair to past, present and future employees, and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation.
      
      The companies are among respondent companies in a number of lawsuits related to OLD. The companies do not believe
      that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they are defending these. They do, however, believe that they
      should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue. The working group will continue
      with its efforts - which have been ongoing for more than two years - to find common ground with all stakeholders, including
      government, labour and the claimants' legal representatives.

      AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields Limited,
      Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Randgold and Exploration Company Limited, and Sibanye Gold
      Limited, were served with a consolidated class action application on 21 August 2013. On 13 May, 2016, the South Gauteng
      High Court of South Africa ruled in favour of the applicants and found that there were sufficient common issues to certify two
      industry-wide classes: a Silicosis Class and a Tuberculosis Class, each of which cover current and former underground
      mineworkers who worked in South African mines from 12 March 1965 and who have contracted the respective diseases (or
      the dependents of mineworkers who died of those diseases). The High Court ordered a two-stage process in the class
      action. The first stage is to resolve common issues and allow the individuals to opt out. The second stage will allow the
      individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies. The High Court also decided
      that claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life) will be transferable to the estate or
      executor of any deceased mineworker who dies after the date of filing of the certification application. On 3 June 2016,
      AngloGold Ashanti, together with certain of the other mining companies, filed an application with the High Court for leave to
      appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Arguments in the application for leave to appeal were heard on 23 June 2016. On 24
      June 2016, leave to appeal was (i) granted in respect of the issue of the transferability of deceased mineworkers' claims for
      general damages but (ii) denied in respect of all other orders of the High Court. On 15 July 2016 AngloGold Ashanti, along
      with several other respondent companies, filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) for leave to appeal such
      other orders of the High Court, and on 13 September 2016, the SCA granted the mining companies leave to appeal the entire
      High Court ruling to the SCA.

      It is possible that additional class actions and/or individual claims relating to silicosis and/or other OLD will be filed against
      AngloGold Ashanti in the future. AngloGold Ashanti will defend all current and subsequently filed claims on their merits.
      Should AngloGold Ashanti be unsuccessful in defending any such claims, or in otherwise favourably resolving perceived
      deficiencies in the national occupational disease compensation framework that were identified in the earlier decision by the
      Constitutional Court, such matters would have an adverse effect on its financial position, which could be material. Given the
      inherent legal and factual uncertainties with respect to the pending claims and other claims not yet filed against the company,
      no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(2)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors
      Limited's (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling
      agreement at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation
      agreement on 8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a writ issued by MBC claiming a total of
      $97m. In December 2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC
      submitted the matter to arbitration and the parties await the constitution of the tribunal.

(3)   Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that
      they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by
      emission and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the
      Pompora Treatment Plant (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory
      infections, skin diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions,
      but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On 24
      February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves and
      on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic
      hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter has been adjourned indefinitely. In view of the limitation of
      current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation 
      in either matter.

      Tax claims
(4)   Other tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining
      authority, issued a tax assessment against AngloGold Ashanti Brazil Mineração Ltda (AABM) relating to the calculation and
      payment by AABM of the financial contribution on mining exploitation in the period from 1991 to 2006. In 2016, a partial
      settlement with the Brazilian tax authority reduced this assessment to $9 million (2015: $11 million). AngloGold Ashanti
      Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various other disputes with tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax
      assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions and annual property tax. The amount involved is
      approximately $15 million (2015: $11 million). Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.

(5)   VAT disputes - Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (MSG) received a tax assessment in October 2003 from the State of Minas
      Gerais related to VAT on gold bullion transfers. The tax administrators rejected the company's appeal against the
      assessment. The company is now appealing the dismissal of the case to the State Court of Minas Gerais. The assessment is
      approximately $13m (2015: $11m).

(6)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office
      (DIAN) that it disagreed with the company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income tax returns. On 23
      October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax of
      $21m (2015: $20m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes are
      expected to be $120m (2015: $108m). The company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC
      subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal
      of Cundinamarca (trial court for tax litigation). On 8 July 2016, the tribunal held initial procedural hearings on the 2010 and
      2011 tax disputes, and the litigation is proceeding.

(7)   Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority
      (AFIP) requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $7m (2015: $8m) relating to the non-
      deduction of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not
      be considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of
      hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $22m (2015: $24m). CVSA and
      AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are
      not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives. CVSA filed an
      appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015, and the matter is proceeding.

      Other
(8)   Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations,
      which have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal
      studies have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable
      remediation solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated
      that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances.
      Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use
      of phyto-technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the
      technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(9)   Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep
      groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999
      to understand this potential risk. In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed
      solution needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and
      Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine
      Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for
      the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

      Contingent asset
(10)  Indemnity - As part of the acquisition by AngloGold Ashanti of the remaining 50% interest in MSG during June 2012, Kinross
      Gold Corporation (Kinross) has provided an indemnity to a maximum amount of BRL255m against the specific exposures
      discussed in item 5 above. At 31 December 2016, the company has estimated that the maximum contingent asset is $8m
      (2015: $7m).

17.   Announcements

      AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc announced satisfaction of the conditions for the redemption of all its outstanding

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Outlines Capital Allocation, Safety Philosophies at Mining Indaba

(PRESS RELEASE –CAPE TOWN) – AngloGold Ashanti’s Chief Executive Officer will this week
present to delegates at the Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town, outlining the company’s
capital allocation philosophy as it looks to invest in brownfield projects in its own portfolio. He will also
provide detail on the company’s ongoing efforts to improve safety across its mines.

“In line with our inward focus, we will prioritise investment in low-risk, high-return projects at our
existing operations, in jurisdictions and ore bodies we understand,” CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan
said. “Rather than looking first to M&A to improve our portfolio, we will use our much improved
balance sheet to increase reinvestment to extend mine lives and increase profitability at key assets.”

AngloGold Ashanti has since 2013 used ‘self-help’ measures including asset sales and efficiency
improvements to reduce debt and improve balance sheet flexibility without diluting shareholders, and
whilst improving the safety and cash-flow margins across its 17-mine portfolio. The company, which
emphasises margin growth over volume growth, will continue that philosophy this year as it focuses
on both sustaining and growth projects.

AngloGold Ashanti will post second-half and full-year 2016 financial and operating results on February
21, at which time it will provide its outlook for production, costs and capital expenditure for 2017. As
Venkat pointed out at the third-quarter results on November 14, capital expenditure will increase in
2017.

Higher sustaining-capital expenditure in 2017 is expected at:

    -   Cuiaba in Brazil, where a greater rate of ore reserve development will improve mining flexibility
        hampered by geotechnical challenges in recent years;
    -   Iduapriem in Ghana, to strip waste rock from the Teberebie ore body to extend mine life, and
        lower cash costs;
    -   Geita, in Tanzania, to replace the mine’s original 20-year old power plant to ensure reliable
        electricity supply, and also continue the ramp-up of underground production in advance of
        depletion of open-pit ore in future;
    -   Sunrise Dam, in Australia, where investment in plant modifications are expected to improve
        gold recoveries;
    -   Kibali, in the DRC, where additional ore reserve development will be conducted ahead of a
        ramp-up in underground production;

It is currently anticipated that sustaining capital will decline in 2018.

There will also be growth capital invested in the construction of a new plant at Siguiri, in Guinea,
which will process harder ore, extending mine life, lowering cost and increasing production, whilst also
improving exploration potential in the area surrounding the mine. At Sadiola, in Mali – subject to
receiving requisite government approvals, agreements, consents and permits -- AngloGold Ashanti
and joint venture partner IAMGold anticipate commencing a project to build a sulphide treatment plant
that will also increase output and extend mine life.

At Tropicana, in Australia, mining and processing is being optimised at minimal additional capital cost,
to increase production and lower costs. (See December 15, 2016 press release).

AngloGold Ashanti will continue to adopt its disciplined approach to future planning and capital
allocation, seeking returns in the mid-teens through the commodity cycle. The company will also
continue to measure its ore reserves at a gold price of $1,100/oz, well below current spot prices.
“We have a very careful process to evaluate and rank all of our capital allocation opportunities, and
this year we have a very compelling slate of projects from within our portfolio that we believe outranks
anything currently available out there in the market,” he said. “We factor in all aspects of risk and
demand a return in the mid- to high-teens before we approve these investments.”

Safety is the First Priority

AngloGold Ashanti has made significant improvements to its safety performance across its portfolio as
it has focused on embedding a more vigilant culture across its business, coupled with greater use of
the latest technologies available to monitor and mitigate risk. This includes, among a host of others,
the use of in-stope netting to mitigate against potentially fatal falls-of-ground, and automatic coupling
of rail cars, reducing another major hazard of underground work.

Like in any heavy industry, and especially in a company like ours that employs more than 50,000
people globally, human error remains among our greatest challenges. This is an aspect of the
business that we continue to work hard to mitigate in cooperation with a broad group of stakeholders.
Most recently, the company has been without an operating fatality across its South African portfolio for
more than six months.

“We are clear that safety remains our highest priority,” Venkat said. “We have made a step change in
safety in recent years, but will continue to look for the latest technology available to help us improve
further.”

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the year ended 31 December 2016 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 21 February 2017.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial
results for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding reporting period.

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings for the
period is expected to be between 242% and 262% higher and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”)
for the period is expected to be between 239% and 256% higher than for the year ended 31
December 2015 (“comparative period”). Headline earnings are expected to be between $104 million
and $118 million, with HEPS between 25 cents and 28 cents. Headline loss and headline loss per
share for the comparative period were $73 million and 18 cents, respectively.

Basic earnings for the period is expected to be between 164% and 184% higher and basic earnings
per share (“EPS”) is expected to be between 165% and 185% higher than the comparative period.
Basic earnings are expected to be between $54 million and $71 million, with EPS between 13 cents
and 17 cents. Basic loss and loss per share for the comparative period were $85 million and 20 cents,
respectively.

Full year gold production, total cash costs, all-in-sustaining costs and capital expenditure are all
expected to be in line with the guidance contained in the third quarter release of 14 November 2016,
as follows:

    *   Gold production: between 3.60Mozs and 3.65Mozs;
    *   Total cash costs: between $730/oz and $750/oz;
    *   All-in-sustaining costs: between $980/oz and $1,010/oz; and
    *   Capital expenditure: between $790 million and $820 million.
During the period, AngloGold Ashanti settled foreign denominated debt resulting in a recycling of
historic foreign exchange losses of $60 million (post-tax) from the Foreign Currency Translation
Reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity to the Income Statement. This amounts to a loss per
share of 15 cents. These losses are non-cash in nature and are added back for purposes of the
HEPS and adjusted HEPS calculations for the period.

The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings are primarily due to:

*      The higher gold price received, which averaged $1,249/oz for the year compared with
       $1,158/oz in the comparative period;
*      Weaker operating currencies in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa in the current period versus
       the comparative period;
*      Continued focus on cost control across the portfolio of 17 operations in nine countries
       especially considering the lower grades achieved by the group overall, which resulted in the
       group having to mine additional volumes to mitigate the drop in production;
*      Interest savings after a successful tender offer on 25 September 2015 to repurchase 8.5%
       bonds maturing 2020 (the “Notes”) with an aggregate face value of $779 million; and the
       redemption of the $471 million remaining Notes on 1 August 2016, resulting in an interest
       saving in the period of $67 million;
*      The positive effect of the translation of the deferred taxation balance in South America of
       $99 million due to a weaker local currency compared with the same period in 2015; and
*      The above increases are partly offset by reduced income from associates and joint ventures
       during the period of $77 million.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Lifts Tropicana Ore Reserve and Production Outlook

(PERTH) – AngloGold Ashanti Ltd is pleased to report an improved production outlook at the
Tropicana Gold Mine in Western Australia, based on higher mining and processing rates
along with a 45% increase in the mine’s Ore Reserve estimate.

Tropicana is a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti Australia Ltd (70% and manager)
and Independence Group NL (30%).

A strategy to address the planned decline in production following the end of grade streaming
last year has been successful with the throughput capacity of the processing plant lifting
from 5.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 7.5 mtpa and the introduction of a 600 tonne
shovel to accelerate mining rates.

Gold production is expected to increase to an annualized rate of between 450,000 – 490,000
ounce per annum from the second half of calendar 2017, with further increases anticipated,
depending on the outcome of the Long Island Study.

“We’ve adopted an innovative, holistic approach that demonstrates the quality of this asset
and the enhanced returns it will deliver to stakeholders,” Michael Erickson, AngloGold
Ashanti’s Senior Vice President Australia said. “The Tropicana mineralised system remains
open along strike and at depth and the recent exciting drilling results make us optimistic that
we can further improve the outlook.”

A programme of 161,000 metres of reverse circulation and diamond drilling carried out
during 2015 and 2016 to test the strike extent and down-dip extensions of the known
mineralised system has been highly successful, contributing to a 45% increase in Ore
Reserves and a 27% increase in the Mineral Resource, highlighting the significant upside
potential of the system.

Drilling is continuing as part of the Long Island Study, which is investigating large cutbacks
to the pits utilizing low-cost mining options including strip mining and backfilling to minimise
waste haulage costs.
The Ore Reserve estimate for Tropicana (100% project) has increased by 1.18 million
ounces of contained gold, with all of this increase in the Havana Pit. Further reserve growth
from Boston Shaker is anticipated in 2017, and in the longer term from Havana South, where
infill drilling programmes are still to be completed.

The Mineral Resource estimate for Tropicana (100% project) has increased by 1.73 million
ounces of contained gold, largely through significant additions in the Havana South and
Boston Shaker zones as a result of applying the Long Island mining methods and costs, and
through an increase to the underground Mineral Resource along the entire strike length of
the Tropicana mineralised system.

In contrast to previous Tropicana resource statements, the new resource reflects the
intention to backfill pits. Resources below pits that are proposed for backfilling are reported
on the basis of potential future extraction by underground mining. This approach contributes
to the large increase in the underground resource. As drilling and ongoing mining studies
are completed it is anticipated there will be a high conversion of open pit resources to
reserves over the life of the operation.

The details of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimate are provided in Table 1 and
Table 2. (Note 1) The location of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are outlined in Figure 1.
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource growth, after depletion, is captured in Figures 3 and 4.

Importantly, the updated Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates do not include recent
significant intersections from Boston Shaker, which are summarised in Figure 2.

Long Island Study and operational update

The Long Island Study is based on strip mining of the depth extensions of the Tropicana
mineralised system and using the completed Tropicana pit as an initial void into which waste
will be backfilled. The proposed backfilling the Tropicana Pit in conjunction with strip mining
will greatly reduce the cost of mining waste by introducing short, horizontal hauls instead of
the long uphill hauls out of the pit to surface waste dumps that would be required by
conventional mining.

The drilling programme to support the study is nearing completion and work is continuing on
aspects such as bench height, the grade control approach, the mining rate and the optimal
mining fleet configuration. It is anticipated that the study will be completed in Q2 2017 and
the new mine plan will be approved thereafter as part of the normal budget cycle.

If the mining method is implemented, the initial Long Island cutback would commence in
2019 when the Tropicana pit has been mined to full depth. Key milestones are illustrated in
Figure 5.


Note 1
The updated Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates are reported in accordance with

As such the reported increases relating to Tropicana require the additional supporting information set
out in this release and its appendices.
The Plant Optimisation Project, which aimed to lift throughput to 7.5 mtpa, has been
completed, with commissioning of two additional CIL tanks in October. The plant is now
operating above 7.5 mtpa and further tuning of the circuit is anticipated to achieve an
annualised throughput rate of up to 7.9 mtpa over the next 12 months.

A Caterpillar 6060 600-tonne class shovel has been introduced to the mining fleet to lift
mining rates, and to meet the higher throughput requirements of the processing plant. With
the introduction of the 6060 shovel, mining rates are expected to increase to 80 mtpa,
enabling the resumption of grade streaming for at least the next two calendar years.

Grade streaming involves the preferential treatment of higher grade ore and stockpiling of
low and medium grade ore. A grade streaming approach was adopted at Tropicana in its first
three years of operation.

The higher mining rate will enable grade streaming to be reintroduced from mid-2017. Gold
production (100% project) is expected to increase to an annual rate of between 450,000 oz –
490,000 oz from mid-2017. Tropicana produced 296,000 oz in the first nine months of 2016.

This compares favorably to an average production rate envisaged in the Tropicana Bankable
Feasibility Study of approximately 320,000 oz per year over this three year period. The
longer term mining rate and gold production profile will be determined as part of the Long
Island Study.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data

Criteria                 Commentary
Sampling techniques      AGA has carried out all the drilling within the Tropicana deposit, with sampling from Reverse
                         Circulation (RC) and diamond drilling predominantly from one metre sample intervals, for 50g
                         gold fire assay.
                         The sampling methodology with RC drilling has changed over time. Sample collection prior to
                         2007 was via a cyclone, dust collection system and multi-stage riffle splitter attached to the
                         drill rig. From the beginning of 2007 sample collection was via a cyclone, dust collection
                         system and cone splitter attached to the drill rig. RC samples are collected from one metre
                         intervals for resource definition drill-holes, with two metre sample intervals from RC pre-collar
                         drilling introduced in 2016. All NQ2 and HQ diamond holes have been half-core sampled over
                         prospective mineralised intervals determined by the geologist, where sample intervals are
                         generally one metre samples. In 2016 two metre samples were processed from un-
                         mineralised core to collect additional geometallurgical data (hyperspectral and XRF) for waste
                         rock characterisation.
                         Within fresh rock, core is oriented for structural/geotechnical logging wherever possible. In
                         oriented core, one half of the core was sampled over one metre intervals and submitted for
                         fire assay. The other half of the core, including the bottom-of-hole orientation line, was
                         retained for geological reference and potential further sampling such as metallurgical test
                         work. In intervals of un-oriented core, the same half of the core has been sampled where
                         possible, by extending a cut line from oriented intervals through into the un-oriented intervals.
                         The lack of a consistent geological reference plane, (such as bedding or a foliation),
                         precludes using geological features to orient the core.
Drilling techniques      Reverse Circulation drilling has been utilised to an average depth of 150m in the shallower,
                         up-dip, western portions of the resource and as pre-collars to diamond holes. All Reverse
                         Circulation drilling has been via face sampling hammer.
                         Diamond drilling has predominantly been NQ2 with limited HQ2, HQ3 and PQ in the upper
                         saprolite and for holes drilled for geotechnical and metallurgical purposes. The majority of
                         diamond holes have been drilled as tails to RC drilling, with NQ2 core produced for sampling
                         mineralisation. From 2011 many deeper holes were drilled with shorter RC pre-collars
                         (~60m), or HQ from surface to minimise deviation.
Drill sample recovery    The sample recovery is currently recorded on selected intervals to assess that the sample is
                         being adequately recovered during RC drilling. Prior to April 2008, no systematic assessment
                         of sample recovery data was made for RC drilling. A subjective visual estimate was used
                         where weights were recorded as 25, 50, 75 or 100%. Since April 2008 a systematic sample
                         recovery program has been implemented where for 1:25 intervals, the Primary (lab weight),
                         Secondary (archive weight) and Reject splits are weighed and recorded in the database.
                         These weights are combined and then compared to a theoretical recovery of the interval
                         based on the regolith and rock type of the interval being analysed.
                         For diamond drilling recovered core for each drill run is recorded and measured against the
                         expected core from that run. Core recovery is consistently very high, with minor loss
                         occurring in regolith and heavily fractured ground.
Logging                  All RC chips and diamond drill cores have been geologically logged for lithology, regolith,
                         mineralisation and alteration utilising AGA’s standard logging code library. RC sample quality
                         data recorded includes recovery, sample moisture (i.e. whether dry, moist, wet or water
                         injected) and sampling methodology. Diamond core has also been logged for geological
                         structure and geotechnical properties. Diamond drill-holes are routinely orientated,
                         photographed and structurally logged with the confidence in the orientation recorded.
                         Geotechnical data recorded includes QSI, RQD, matrix, and fracture categorisation.
                         Bulk density determinations have been routinely collected from diamond drill core over one to
                         five metre intervals using water immersion methods. A coherent segment of core (>10cm
                         length), representative of the metre interval is selected. Laboratory bulk density determination
                         is completed on selected ‘core from surface’ diamond holes to collect bulk density data for
                         oxide and transitional rock types, and from fresh rock types to ensure water immersion
                         methods used onsite are accurate.
                         All logging data is digitally captured via Field Marshall Software (upgraded to Micromine
                         Geobank platform 2016) and the data is validated in Vulcan prior to being uploaded to an

Sub-sampling            Since the commencement of exploration activities at Tropicana, sample preparation and
techniques and          analysis has been carried out by three laboratories, as detailed below:
sample preparation      Prior to November 2006 - SGS (formerly Analabs) Welshpool performed all gold and multi-
                        element analysis. SGS routinely prepared half-core diamond samples by crushing in a jaw
                        crusher followed by pulping in an LM5 to 90% passing 75µm. One metre RC samples are
                        pulped in an LM5 to 90% passing 75µm. 50-gram samples are then assayed by fire assay.
                        Sieve tests are carried out on 5% of samples.
                        November 2006 to 2014 – Genalysis Perth has performed all gold and multi-element
                        analyses.
                        Jan 2015 – June 2016 – Genalysis Perth has performed all gold, multi-element analyses and
                        hyperspectral scans.
                        The 2015 Boston Shaker infill drilling was analysed at the Tropicana onsite lab, with sample
                        preparation conducted by AGAA staff operating an automated circuit, and SGS conducting
                        the fire assay and analysis.
                        May 2016 to current, infill drilling has been analysed at the Tropicana onsite lab, with sample
                        preparation conducted by AGAA staff operating an automated circuit, and SGS conducting
                        the fire assay and analysis.
                        At Genalysis, half core samples weighing approximately 2.5kg are prepared via a robot. The
                        samples are then crushed to <3mm in a Boyd crusher and automatically split, down to a
                        sample of ~1kg for pulping and analysis. The remainder of the material was retained as a
                        coarse split for metallurgical test-work. One metre RC samples were pulped in a mixer mill to
                        90% passing 75µm. Wet sieve tests were carried out on 5% of the samples.
                        The Tropicana laboratory uses a linear automated process to prepare the samples. Samples,
                        from RC and diamond drilling, are loaded onto racks at the lab. Each sample bag has a
                        unique bar-code attached to the bag. Samples are dried and weighed. Small samples
                        (<800g) are manually pulverised in an LM2 mill to 90% passing 75µm. Acceptable weight
                        samples (>800g) are loaded into tubs and the samples passed under a Terraspec
                        Hyperspectral camera. Samples are then passed through a Boyd crusher, reducing the
                        particle size to 90% passing 2mm before being split via a Linear Sample Divider. Coarse
                        duplicates are assayed at a rate on 1 in 20 within the assaying of the batch. Primary samples
                        then get pulverised to 90% passing 75µm and the resultant product split into a 50g sample for
                        fire assay and a 500g sample. The 500g sample passes under a portable XRF scanner for
                        analysis of secondary elements (that are not used in the Mineral Resource estimate). The
                        500g sample is retained for check assay work. Standards are inserted into batches of
                        samples at a frequency of three standards in every hundred. Sieve tests are carried out on
                        5% of samples to achieve 90% passing 75 micron. Routinely, coarse blank samples are run
                        through the automated sample preparation system between assay jobs to ensure sample
                        hygiene, and quartz flushes are pulverized between each sample at the pulverizing stage.
                        Coarse blank samples are inserted as the first sample in each laboratory job. The purpose of
                        this sample is to check that laboratory crushing and grinding equipment is kept clean. Coarse
                        blanks samples are also inserted into the sequence of samples before each zone of
                        mineralisation.
Quality of assay data   At SGS 50-gram samples were assayed by fire assay. SGS inserted blanks and standards
and laboratory tests    (one in 20 samples) in every batch. Every 20th sample was selected as a duplicate from the
                        original pulp packet and then analysed. Repeat assays were completed at a frequency of
                        one in 20 and were selected at random throughout the batch. In addition, further repeat
                        assays were selected at random by the quality control officer, the frequency of which was
                        batch dependent. Analysis was by fire assay with similar quality assurance (QA) for RC and
                        half core samples.
                        Genalysis inserted internal standards and blanks randomly through each batch. Every 25th
                        sample was selected as a duplicate from the original pulp packet and then analysed at the
                        end of the batch. Finally, 6% of the batch was selected for re-analysis.
                        Internal laboratory checks and internal and external check assays such as repeats and check
                        assays enable assessment of precision. Contamination between samples is checked for by

assaying                 Analysis of twinned drill holes showed that no significant down-hole smearing was occurring
                         in RC holes when compared to the twinned diamond holes in Tropicana and Havana.
Location of data         All hole locations within the resource area to date have been pegged with a standard GPS, or
points                   by RTK GPS. Once the holes are drilled the collar location is then surveyed with an RTK
                         GPS.
                         A regional Digital Terrain Model was then created to cover the Tropicana JV tenement area
                         from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The data was sampled at 3 arc-
                         seconds, which is 1/1200th of a degree of latitude and longitude, or about 90 metres.
                         Eastman single shot instruments were used routinely for down-hole surveys prior to 2007.
                         From 2007, gyro surveying instruments have been used to complete downhole surveying.
Data spacing and         Drill-hole spacing on sections, and between sections, typically range from 25 x 25m to 100 x
distribution             100m. The majority of the Open Pit resource area has been drill tested at a nominal density
                         of 50 x 50m with the spacing closed up to 25 x 25m within the upper levels of the deposit.
                         The down-plunge extension of the Havana Deeps area is drilled at 100 x 100m or 100 x 50m
                         closer to the pit area.
                         1m samples are composited to 2m prior to Resource Estimation.
Orientation of data in   The majority of drilling is orientated to intersect normal to mineralisation. The chance of bias
relation to geological   introduced by sample orientation is thus considered minimal.

Sample security          Samples are sealed in calico bags, which are in turn placed in large poly-weave bulka-bags
                         for transport. Filled poly-weave bulk-bags are secured on wooden crates and transported
                         directly via road freight to the laboratory with a corresponding submission form and
                         consignment note.
                         Genalysis checks the samples received against the submission form and notifies AGA of any
                         missing or additional samples. Once Genalysis has completed the assaying, the pulp
                         packets, pulp residues and coarse rejects are held in their secure warehouse. On request,
                         the pulp packets are returned to the AGA warehouse on secure pallets where they are
                         documented for long term storage and retrieval.
Audits or reviews        Field quality control and assurance has been assessed on a daily, monthly and quarterly
                         basis.
                         Field QA/QC was assessed by Quantitative Group (QG) as part of their audits of the

Database integrity      AGA uses various software programs to collect the different forms of drilling data
                        obtained during exploration. The main packages are from Microsoft (SQL Server and
                        Access), Maptek Pty Ltd. (Vulcan), Micromine Pty Limited (Micromine, Field Marshall
                        and Geobank), Aranz Geo Limited (Leapfrog), Maxwell Services Limited (DataShed) and
                        Karjeni Pty Limited (dPipe).
                        The database is managed with Microsoft’s SQL Server and Maxwell’s DataShed.
                        DataShed was developed as a front end interface to MS Access or SQL Server.
                        DataShed was specifically created for the exploration and mining community and
                        contains special queries and data management utilities unique to the mining industry.
                        Many of these or additional processes have been modified or added to by AGA.
                        Drill-hole logging data is captured in the field and in core processing facility, directly into
                        handheld devices, for example Husky, LXE, Toughbook or laptop computers with Field
                        Marshall and Geobank software. Daily drilling forms (Plods) are completed by the driller
                        in hard copy and signed off by the geologist, and entered into DataShed. Sampling, bulk
                        densities, Hardness and Magnetic Susceptibility (MagSus) readings are also recorded
                        digitally into handheld devices.
                        Up to end of 2015, the merging of logging data into the database was semi-automated
                        via a file transfer program called dPipe. Karjeni Pty Limited developed dPipe to facilitate
                        the transfer of data from one format into another into SQL databases. This program has
                        the ability to read a file to split, composite and append data into the desired format.
                        From 2016, logging data is synchronised from Geobank directly into Datashed, and field
                        data, such as RTK collar coordinates and downhole surveys are loaded via DataShed
                        importers. Assay results received from the laboratories are emailed to geologists and
                        stored on the server. An invoice is mailed to AngloGold Ashanti along with a hard copy
                        or digital PDFs of the results. The hard copies are filed in folders and PDFs stored on
                        the network for future auditing purposes. Assay data files are loaded via DataShed
                        importers, and loading procedures include QA/QC checks to ensure standards and
                        blanks have returned acceptable results.
                        Rigorous data validation procedures are in place to identify data issues.

                          therefore are considered to have a high level of confidence in interpretation. The dykes
                          are locally important as they post-date mineralisation and are generally barren of
                          mineralisation. Modelling of the shears is critical to understanding geotechnical aspects
                          and assessing the spatial controls on the mineralisation. The Garnet Gneiss units are
                          important because they are generally found in the hanging wall and as a precursor to
                          mineralisation, as well as being the dominant waste rock unit.
Dimensions                The Open Pit Mineral Resource is reported within a combination of pit designs and an
                          A$1817 optimisation shell that is over 4km long, up to 1km wide, and approximately
                          450m deep.
                          The Underground Mineral Resource extends to a depth of approximately 1km below
                          surface.
Estimation and            The Mineral Resource is reported from open pit and underground Mineral Resource
modelling                 models, estimated with differing estimation techniques and with different cut-off grades
techniques                applied to each model. The Open Pit Mineral Resource have been estimated using the
                          geostatistical technique of Localised Uniform Conditioning using average drill hole
                          intercepts and is reported above a marginal (break-even) cut-off grade of 0.3g/t for oxide
                          material and 0.4g/t for transitional and fresh material. The Havana Deeps Underground
                          Mineral Resource has been estimated at a cut-off grade of 2.0g/t using the geostatistical
                          technique of Ordinary Kriging using average drill hole intercepts. The Underground cut-
                          off grade calculation is based on an underground Pre-Feasibility study completed in late
Criteria                Commentary
                        2013, and a gold price of US$1400 (A$1704).
                        2m down-hole composites are used for both estimates.
                        Gold is the only element modelled, as no other significant element has been detected in
                        sampling to date which would be deleterious to mine and mill performance.
                        The Open Pit Mineral Resource uses block sizes of 15m (X) by 30m (Y) by 10m (Z) with
                        an SMU of 5m (X) by 7.5m (Y) by 3.33m (Z) for Havana and Tropicana. Boston Shaker
                        uses an estimation panel size of 15m (X) by 30m (Y) by 7.5m (Z) with an SMU of 5m (X)
                        by 7.5m (Y) by 2.5m (Z).
                        The Underground Mineral Resource uses a block size of 10m (X) by 10m (Y) by 2m (Z),
                        with blocks dipping 30° to the (grid) east, parallel to the majority dip of the orebody, with
                        the resulting estimate filtered to remove isolated blocks that cannot be mined
                        individually.
                        Both Resource Estimates are compared to the input data using swath plots to check for
                        bias in the estimation – no bias was noted in the plots.
                        Mining has been ongoing since 2012 and reconciliations to date indicate that the Mineral
                        Resource model has reconciled well with grade control.
Moisture                Tonnage estimates are on a dry tonne basis.
Cut-off parameters      The Open Pit Mineral Resources use a cut-off grade of 0.3g/t for oxide material and
                        0.4g/t for transitional and fresh material, based on Long Island study mining costs,
                        budgeted processing and administration costs, and a gold price of US$1400 (A$1817).
                        The Underground Mineral Resource has been estimated at a cut-off grade of 2.0g/t. The
                        cut-off grade calculation is based on an underground Pre-Feasibility study completed in
                        late 2013, and a gold price of US$1400 (A$1704).
Mining factors or       Open Pit mining assumes selectivity of SMU’s of 5m (X) by 7.5m (Y) by 3.33m (Z) for
assumptions             Havana and Tropicana. Boston Shaker uses an SMU of 5m (X) by 7.5m (Y) by 2.5m (Z).
                        No external dilution accounted for in the Mineral Resource.
                        Underground mining is based on a modified Long-Hole Open Stope method, with 20m
                        vertical intervals between ore drives. The Mineral Resource is filtered based on the
                        average grade of surrounding blocks to remove isolated blocks from the Mineral
                        Resource total. No external dilution is included in the Mineral Resource Estimate.
Metallurgical factors   Metallurgical recovery is taken into account in the optimisation of both Open Pit and
or assumptions          Underground Resource optimisations, with an average project recovery of 90.0%
                        assumed, based on extensive metallurgical test work completed as part of the Feasibility
                        Study for the Havana Open Pit.
Environmental           Tropicana Gold Mine (TGM) operates under an environmental management plan that
factors or              meets or exceeds all environmental and legislative requirements. TGM holds the license
assumptions             to operate and valid for the life of the Ore Reserve. Environmental rehabilitation plans
                        are produced and cost of the rehabilitation work is accounted in the financial evaluation
                        model.
Bulk density            Dry Bulk Density (DBD) determinations have been routinely collected on the mineralised
                        zones in all DDH core at one-metre intervals using water immersion methods. A
                        coherent segment of core (>10cm length), representative of the metre interval, is
                        selected. The weight is measured dry, in air, then measured submerged in water. Core
                        was left to dry naturally on the core racks.
                        Dry Bulk Density has been estimated using Ordinary Block Kriging, with areas with
                        insufficient data to generate a kriged estimate being assigned the average measured
                        value for that lithology and regolith type. Density values within units show little variation.
Classification          The estimates of the Mineral Resource presented in this Report have been carried out in
                        accordance with the principles and guidelines of the Australian Code for Reporting of
                        Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, published in 2012 (JORC
                        Code).
                        Mineral Resources have been classified based on the 15% rule whereby a Measured
                        Resource should reconcile within plus or minus 15% over quarterly production volumes,
                        90% of the time, and an Indicated Resource should reconcile within plus or minus 15%
                        over yearly volumes, 90% of the time, as per internal AngloGold Ashanti guidelines.
                        This criterion defines a drill spacing of approximately 25 x 25 m to define a Measured
                        Resource, and 50 x 50 m to define an Indicated Resource. Inferred Resources are
                        defined when evidence of geological and grade continuity exists sufficient to generate an
Criteria              Commentary
                      estimated grade. The average data spacing for Inferred Resources varies, but is
                      generally 100 x 100m or less.
                      The Resource classification is consistent between the Open Pit and Underground
                      estimates, given that the underground mining will focus on large tonnage, low cost
                      methods and the resource is mined at a relatively low cut-off grade. Material defined by
                      relatively few drill-holes was manually recoded out of Resource classifications, and not
                      reported as part of the Tropicana Mineral Resource.
Audits or reviews     The Open Pit Mineral Resource has been audited previously as part of the BFS by
                      Quantitative Group (QG) between 2007 and 2009. An additional external review of the
                      Mineral Resource was also completed in 2011.
                      Golder Associates audited the 2015 Mineral Resource estimate, and supported the
                      estimate with some recommendations which have been adopted for the current update.
Discussion of         The relative accuracy of the Mineral Resource Estimates is reflected in the Resource
relative              Classification.
accuracy/confidence   A trial grade control pattern of ~100m by 100m was drilled during the BFS which
                      provided confidence that the Mineral Resource Estimate was accurate in that volume.
                      Reconciliations of the resource model to date indicate no significant flaws in the grade
                      estimate, with some additional lower grade material being mined than what was
                      predicted from the Resource.

Section 4 Estimation and Reporting of Ore Reserves

Criteria               Explanation
Mineral reserve        All Ore Reserves estimated for Tropicana Gold Mine are based on the Open Pit Mineral
estimate for           Resource model. No Ore Reserve exists outside of the Mineral Resource base. No
conversion to Ore      Underground Ore Reserve is reported.
Reserves
                       Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves.
Site visits            The Competent Person is based on site and it is part of his daily activities to inspect the
                         mining areas.
Study status             The Ore Reserves for Tropicana are based on an operating LOM plan and a pre-
                         feasibility level study. For the operating LOM plan, a Feasibility Study was completed in
                         2010, which determined a technically achievable and financially economic mine plan. The
                         pits that make up the operating LOM plan are Tropicana (TP02), Havana (HA03), Boston
                         Shaker (BS01) and Havana South (HS01). The Pre-Feasibility study is based on an
                         expansion of Havana (HA04). All Ore Reserves are estimated by reporting physicals
                         (volumes, tonnes, grades, material types, etc.) against the resource model within detailed
                         staged pit designs. Ore Reserve physicals are then put through a financial model for
                         economic evaluation.
                         Performance of the on-going mining activities has demonstrated that current mine plans
                         are technically achievable and economically viable considering the material modifying
                         factors.
Cut-off parameters       The cut-off grades are determined based on the net return from the gold produced at the
                         processing plant for each material type. Only the ore that has a grade above the cut-off
                         grades are included in the Ore Reserves.
Mining factors or        The Ore Reserves are reported within detailed operational designs that are developed
assumptions
                         based on the geological resource model, geotechnical studies and financial information.
                         The open pit mining method is based on using a combination of shovels and excavators
                         matched with a truck fleet system. The staged pit designs used for Ore Reserves are
                         generated as three dimensional designs considering operational requirements such as
                         equipment access. Mining operations at Tropicana Gold Mine started in July 2012 and
                         the operation has proven that the designs and plans are technically achievable; no issue
                         preventing access or pre-strip is experienced or envisaged for the Ore Reserves. The pit
                         expansion for Havana (HA04) is within the current approved mining area.
                         Overall pit slope angles for oxide and fresh rock types are assumed to be 36°and 60°,
                         respectively. External and internal Geotechnical studies carried out to evaluate the
                         operational designs have confirmed that the pit designs do not violate the geotechnical
                         guidelines developed during Feasibility study. Grade control drilling is completed prior to
                         ore mining on a 12 x 12m pattern using reverse circulation drill rigs.
                         The Mineral Resource model used to develop the Ore Reserves uses blocks in 15m x
                         30m horizontal dimensions and 10m (7.5m for Boston Shaker) vertical bench height that
                         are mined in 3 flitches (3.33m in average height and Boston Shaker 2.5m in average
                         height), with a mining SMU 5m x 7.5m x 3.33m (Boston Shaker 5m x 7.5m x 2.5m). The
                         grades within the resource model have been diluted to reflect the average grade of this
                         mineable block size. Therefore, no other mining dilution is applied.
                         Mining recovery factor used is 1.0.
                         In the designs, a minimum of 40m width is implemented for a pit base or some location
                         with only one bench height, where it is technically possible to access. In the design work,
                         a minimum of 80m mining width is implemented as a generic rule.
                         Inferred material is excluded from the Ore Reserves and treated as waste material, which
                         incurs a mining cost but is not processed and hence does not generate any revenue. The
                         total quantity of the inferred material is less than 1% the Ore Reserve. Hence the
                         reported Ore Reserve's financial outcome is not sensitive to the Inferred material within
                         the pit designs.
                         There is no infrastructure to be completed.
Metallurgical factors   The metallurgical process, which was proposed and is currently in operation, was
or assumptions
                        developed through a comprehensive series of test programs at scoping, pre-feasibility
                        and feasibility study levels. Test work was mostly at batch scale but, where considered
                        advisable, at pilot and demonstration plant scale.
                        The majority of the process uses highly mature technology. The sole exception is the
                        use of High Pressure Grinding Rolls to prepare ball mill feed. The equipment used for
                        this technology itself dates back over twenty years, and is mature. Developments for the
                        hard rock industry are more recent, but have now been successfully used in a number of
                        plants worldwide and this is the part of the process that was extensively tested in a range
                        of machines from pilot up to demonstration scale.
                        Metallurgical test work consisted of comprehensive testing of a number of composite
                        samples to develop the process design basis, and supplementary testing of a much
                        larger number of samples to establish variability. These variability samples were taken
                        on a grid pattern to ensure even coverage of the entire deposit. No metallurgical domains
                        have been recognised to date other than by regolith type and some minor variation in one
                        northern section of the deposit.
                        The ore is exceptionally free of deleterious elements and base metals. No allowances
                        have been made or are considered necessary.
                        Pilot scale test work utilised PQ diameter core. Whilst only a relatively small number of
                        PQ holes were drilled, their position was selected based on the prior variability test work
                        to provide samples considered to be adequately representative of the orebody as a
                        whole. The samples were also characterised by standard batch scale and
                        geometallurgical style tests so that results could be related to the wider orebody
                        As a gold mine, the product is not defined by specification. No problems are envisaged,
                        or have been encountered, in producing gold bars of saleable quality
Environmental           Tropicana Gold Mine (TGM) operates under an environmental management plan that
                        meets or exceeds all environmental and legislative requirements. TGM holds the license
                        to operate and valid for the life of the Ore Reserve. Environmental rehabilitation plans are
                        produced and cost of the rehabilitation work is accounted in the financial evaluation
                        model.
Infrastructure          Adequate infrastructure has been completed and sustaining cost of the infrastructure
                        (maintenance and replacement) is accounted in the financial model.
Costs                   Capital costs of removing waste over ore are included in the evaluations for the
                        applicable pits.
                        Mining operating costs are provided by the contractor Macmahon as rates from an
                        annual rate review conducted between AGA and Macmahon. Processing operating costs
                        have been derived from variety of sources including first principle estimates, metallurgical
                        test work results, budget quotations for consumables and vendors, consultant advice on
                        wear rates/component replacement frequency, baseline input parameters such as
                        exchange rates, power cost, labour numbers etc., AGA Australia Ltd advice, Lycopodium
                        and sub-consultants data and experienced based on similar sized operations.
                        No allowances have been made or are considered necessary.
                        Transportation cost for the produced gold doré is relatively small and charged on a
                        contract basis with the refinery.
                        The source of the treatment and refinery charges is the contract with refinery and there is
                        no specification and no penalty is considered for not meeting specifications.
                        Total royalty cost allowance is 2.5% of the total revenue
Revenue factors         The assumption made for the gold price is US$1,100/oz, A$1,500/oz and the exchange
                        rate is US$0.73 per Au$1.0.
                        The assumptions are derived after reviewing historic commodity prices and exchange
                        rates.
Market Assessment       Long term market assessments are provided by a number of independent companies.
                        AGA does not provide advice or endorsement for using a specific forecasting company.
Economic              Tropicana Gold Mine (TGM) is now operating with mining costs based on contractor
                      mining rates. Processing costs have been derived via comprehensive test work and
                      studies. TGM is therefore not highly exposed to uncertainty in, or to inaccuracy in
                      estimation of, mining or processing costs. The inflation rates assumed are based on prior
                      AGA Treasury guidance provided, whilst discount rates utilised at AGAA is derived from
                      the weighted average cost of capital for Australia.
                      Sensitivity studies are carried out on various parameters including mining cost,
                      processing cost, gold price and discount rate. Gold price is the most sensitive input for
                      NPV and a 10% reduction would eliminate about 30,000 ounces (~0.80%) from the
                      Reserves.
Social                Tenement status is in good standing.
Other                 There is no foreseeable TGM specific risk. There are typical risks of an open pit mine
                      operations such as heavy rain events and geotechnical risks. These risks are managed
                      through implementation of various risk management mechanisms as much as practical.
Classification        Exploration drill-hole spacing is the basis of the classification. Proven material is defined
                      for the areas drilled with 25m spacing and probable is defined on 50m drill spacing.
                      The methodology of classification is appropriate for the deposit
                      Proportion of the Proved Ore Reserves is a sub-set of Measured Mineral Resources.
                      Probable Ore Reserves are derived from Indicated Mineral Resources.
Audits or reviews     A Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audit was completed in 2015. No unexpected
                      results came from the audit.
Discussion of         As part of the Ore Reserve estimation process, a review is performed for the actual
relative              reconciled extraction against previous year’s reserve estimation
accuracy/confidence
                      Reconciliation of the Ore Reserves to actual mined during the last year showed that Ore
                      Reserve estimation is slightly conservative.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Says Third-Quarter Free Cash Flow Soars to $161m

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti announced a significant
jump in third-quarter free cash flow to $161m, further improving its net debt position despite
a decline in ore grades at some of its operations and a challenging operating environment
for its South African business.

Free cash flow was $161m, before the $30m once-off cost incurred for the early repayment
of its high-yield bond, the Company’s most expensive debt. The free cash flow generation for
the three months through September 30 was a significant improvement on the $50m outflow
in the third quarter of 2015, and 49% more than the $108m generated in the first half of this
year.

AngloGold Ashanti has for the past three years delivered on a range of self-help measures
to cut debt, using internally generated funds without diluting shareholders. Whilst it was
indicated previously that costs would be higher in the second half of the year, the increase
was exacerbated by a poor performance in South Africa, a delay in accessing higher grades
in Brazil, capital expenditure absorbed over fewer ounces, and strengthening currencies.

“We generated strong free cash flow in the third quarter, taking this year’s cumulative free
cash flow to nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, further reducing debt,” Chief Executive
Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “Work is already well advanced to turn around our
operating performance in the near term by improving volumes and accessing higher grades
as per our plans, and over the medium term by investing in our low-capital, high-return
brownfields projects.”

Production in the third quarter was 900,000oz compared to 974,000oz in the third quarter of
last year, which included a combined 32,000oz from Cripple Creek & Victor and Obuasi,
which have been sold and idled respectively. Moab Khotsong, Mponeng, Iduapriem, Siguiri
and Serra Grande delivered improved performances.

Total output from South Africa dipped 7% year-on-year to 235,000oz, mainly due to lower
average recovered ore grades from underground. The Company’s mines in South Africa
faced stoppages following three fatalities in July.
Lower production from the AngloGold Ashanti’s International Operations of 665,000oz,
compared with 702,000oz in the third quarter of last year, was mainly a result of lower ore
grades as planned, at both Tropicana and Geita, as well as delays in accessing high-grade
ore at its operation in Brazil.

For the first nine months of the year, all-in sustaining costs were $965/oz, an increase of 4%
compared to the same period the prior year.

Cash costs per ounce increased by 8% to $797/oz compared to $735/oz in the third quarter
of the previous year, mainly as a function of lower grades, lower units of production, and
inflation. All-in sustaining costs were $1,071/oz, a 14% year-on-year increase which reflects
the increase in total cash costs, exploration, corporate and marketing costs and a planned
increase in capital expenditure.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA)
rose by 36% to $395m in the third quarter, from $291m in the corresponding period of last
year. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ended the quarter at 1.26 times, lower than the 1.54
times recorded in the corresponding period last year. Debt levels remain well below the
covenant of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.5 times under our revolving credit facilities.

SAFETY

Regrettably, there were three fatalities in the South Africa region in July following falls-of-
ground and tramming-related incidents, and one in Brazil at Cuiabá following a heavy
mobile equipment accident that involved a contractor. Despite these setbacks, there were
notable successes, with Continental Africa region the stand out performer, while the Vaal
River Mines achieved two million fatality-free shifts during the quarter with Moab Khotsong
reaching one calendar year without a fatality on 4 September, and Kopanang achieving 1-
million-fatal-free shifts on 1 July. Our priority remains the successful execution of our safety
strategy to improve our underlying safety performance.

Production from the South African mines continues to be affected by safety-related
stoppages, predominantly those under Section 54 of the Mine Health and Safety Act. As
recommended by the Department of Mineral Resources, AngloGold Ashanti will continue to
pursue dialogue with the regulator around this issue and to use appropriate official channels
to address challenges with the application of Section 54 of the Act.


OUTLOOK

The outlook for production for the full year has been narrowed but remains within the original
guidance. The cost guidance has been revised primarily due to the strengthening of local
currencies.

The revised outlook is as follows: Production between 3.6Moz and 3.65Moz (previously
3.6Moz and 3.8Moz); Total cash costs between $730/oz and $750/oz; (previously $680/oz
and $720/oz); AISC between $980/oz and $1,010/oz; (previously $900/oz and $960/oz); and
the outlook for capital expenditure has been narrowed to between $790m and $820m, from
$790m to $850m previously.

(Assuming updated average exchange rates against the US dollar of 14.60 (Rand), 3.50
(Brazil Real), $0.75 (Aus$) and 14.80 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $43/bl average for the
year, based on achieved actual rates to date and market expectations for the next quarter).
Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions, power disruptions
and changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines. In addition, the cost guidance
includes the rebate of certain port duties in Argentina. Other unknown or unpredictable
factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

Third quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti delivered strong free cash flow generation of $161m (before taking into account the once-off $30m cost of redeeming
the remainder of the high-yield bond) for the third quarter ended 30 September 2016, helping further reduce net debt. The
performance reflects continued progress toward the key strategic objective of delivering sustainable improvements to free cash
flow and returns, whilst developing affordable, high-return brownfields project options.

Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 of $161m (before the once-off $30m bond redemption costs), represents a significant
improvement on the $50m outflow in the third quarter of 2015, and was 49% more than the $108m generated in the first half
of this year.

Cash inflow from operating activities for the third quarter of 2016 was $386m, was 59% more than the $243m in the
same quarter of 2015. The cash flow improvement was achieved despite lower production, and was attributable largely to the
higher gold price received year-on-year, and the timing of proceeds received on a metal shipment from Argentina.

""We generated strong free cash flow in the third quarter, taking this year’s cumulative free cash flow to more 
than quarter of a billion dollars, further reducing debt. Whilst we had previously indicated costs would be higher 
in the second half, the increase was exacerbated by a poor performance in South Africa, a delay in accessing higher 
grades in Brazil, capital expenditure absorbed over fewer ounces, and strengthening currencies,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said.  
""Work is already well advanced to turn this around in the near term by improving volumes and accessing higher grades as per our plans, and over the medium term 
by investing in our low-capital, high-return brownfields projects.""

Production in the third quarter of 2016 was 900,000oz compared to 974,000oz in the third quarter of 2015, which included
a combined 32,000oz from Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) and Obuasi, which have been sold and idled respectively.
Improved performances in the third quarter compared to the same quarter in 2015 were delivered by Moab Khotsong,
Mponeng, Iduapriem, Siguiri and Serra Grande. Production from South Africa dipped 7% year-on-year to 235,000oz, mainly
due to lower average recovered grades from underground of 7.34g/t, 8% lower than the prior year's 8.01g/t. Lower production
from the International Operations of 665,000oz in the third quarter of 2016 was mainly a result of lower grades, as planned, at
both Tropicana and Geita, whilst this was partially offset by Kibali's strong recovery from the previous quarter.

Overall production increased to 900,000oz in the third quarter, from 883,000oz the previous quarter, driven by improved
performances from Geita, Kibali and AngloGold Ashanti Mineração.

Cash costs per ounce increased by 8% to $797/oz compared to $735/oz in the third quarter of 2015, mainly as a function of lower
grades, lower units of production, and inflation.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) in the third quarter of 2016 were $1,071/oz, a 14% year-on-year increase which reflects the
increase in total cash costs, exploration, corporate and marketing costs and a planned increase in capital expenditure. All-in costs
were at $1,166/oz for the third quarter of 2016.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) rose by 36% to $395m in the third
quarter of 2016, from $291m in the third quarter of 2015. The improvement was mainly due to an increase in earnings following the
19% gain in the average gold price received year-on-year, from $1,123/oz to $1,334/oz, which was partially offset by strengthening
currencies in some jurisdictions.

At the end of the third quarter of 2016, net debt was lower at $1.972bn compared to $2.098bn in the previous quarter and
$2.291bn for the third quarter of 2015 mainly due to the strong improvement in free cash flow generation. The balance of the high
yield bond was redeemed in early August, resulting in a reduction in net finance costs. The reduction in net debt, along with
improved Adjusted EBITDA over the past 12 months, has resulted in a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.26 times, compared
with 1.54 times at the end of September 2015. Accordingly, debt levels remain well below the covenant of net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA of 3.5 times under our revolving credit facilities (RCF).

The balance sheet remains robust with strong liquidity and long-dated maturities providing significant financial flexibility. Undrawn
facilities comprise approximately $820m available under the $1bn US dollar revolving credit facility, A$210m undrawn on the
A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R3.4bn available from South African facilities, and cash and cash equivalents of
$276m, at the end of the third quarter of 2016.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) during the third quarter was $211m, compared with $197m in the
third quarter of 2015 (which excluded $10m for CC&V). Of the total capital spent, project capital expenditure during the quarter
amounted to $25m. Capital expenditure is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter, in line with past trends.

The outlook for production and capital expenditure for the full year has been narrowed but remains within the original guidance. The cost guidance has
been revised primarily due to the strengthening of local currencies. The revised outlook is as follows:
-   Production between 3.6Moz and 3.65Moz (previously 3.6Moz and 3.8Moz);
-   Total cash costs between $730/oz and $750/oz (previously $680/oz and $720/oz);
-   AISC between $980/oz and $1,010/oz (previously $900/oz and $960/oz); and
-   Capital expenditure between $790m and $820m (previously $790m and $850m).

(Assuming updated average exchange rates against the US dollar of 14.60 (Rand), 3.50 (Brazil Real), 0.75 (Aus$) and
14.80 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $43/bl average for the year, based on achieved actual rates to date and market expectations
for the next quarter).

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions, power disruptions and changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines. In addition, the cost guidance includes the rebate of certain port duties in Argentina. Other unknown or
unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results.

As in prior years, the fourth quarter earnings will be affected by year-end accounting adjustments including any reassessment of
useful lives and carrying value of mining tangible assets, inventory stockpile and investments, reset of environmental rehabilitation
provisions, redundancy provisions, and indirect and taxation provisions.

Safety Update
The all injury frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 7.80 per million hours worked for the
third quarter of 2016, compared with 7.60 the previous quarter. The International operations recorded an improvement in AIFR
over the quarter to 2.55 from 2.89 in the third quarter of 2015, with the Continental Africa region recording the most significant
improvement at 22% from the second quarter to third quarter of 2016. The Vaal River Mines achieved 2 million fatality-free shifts 
during the quarter with Moab Khotsong reaching one calendar year without a fatality on 4 September, and Kopanang achieving 1-million-fatal-free shifts on 1 July.

Regrettably, there were four fatalities during the quarter ended September 2016, three in July 2016 of the South Africa region following falls-
of-ground and tramming-related incidents, and one in Brazil at Cuiabá following a heavy mobile equipment-accident that
involved a contractor.

Production from AngloGold Ashanti's South Africa mines continues to be affected by safety-related stoppages, predominantly
those under Section 54 of the Mine Health and Safety Act. As recommended by the DMR, AngloGold Ashanti will continue to
pursue dialogue with the DMR around this issue and to use appropriate official channels to address challenges with the application
of Section 54 of the Act.

Operating highlights

The South Africa region produced 235,000oz at a total cash cost of $997/oz in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 253,000oz at
a total cash cost of $959/oz for the same quarter in 2015. The region's total cash costs per ounce were negatively affected by
lower grades and lower production volumes caused by safety-related stoppages and the resultant ramp-up periods following their
shutdowns and lower grades. Lost production as a result of safety-related stoppages amounted to 38,600oz. In addition, costs
were also adversely affected by inflationary pressures due to power and labour-cost increases.

Overall production increased more than 7% from the Vaal River operations in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same
quarter in 2015 as Moab Khotsong showed a strong recovery, increasing production by 14% following the safety-related
interruptions experienced during the third quarter in 2015. Moab Khotsong was the lowest-cost producer for the South African
region at a total cash cost of $736/oz during the quarter. Production at Kopanang was impacted by the fall-of-ground incident, lack
of face-length availability and a decrease in grades.

In the West Wits operations, whilst Mponeng improved production by 6% year-on-year, the region's quarterly performance was
hampered by the fatal incidents, a range of safety-related stoppages and lower grades. TauTona mine was most affected by
safety-related stoppages after operations were halted following the fatal incident on 26 July 2016. The Level 116 haulage, which
provides the access way to two new raise lines at the Savuka section of TauTona, remains closed following the seismic event in
April and will be inaccessible until the second quarter of next year.

At the Surface Operations, Vaal River Surface Sources production was lower in the third quarter of 2016 than in the third quarter
of 2015 as a result of decline in yield due to lower grade areas being reclaimed. In order to further improve grades at the
Moab marginal ore dump, a project was launched to screen and truck the Moab marginal ore to plant. Tonnages also fell slightly
due to the repairs to the West Wits gold plant. A blending strategy was initiated to mitigate the lower grades fed into the
Savuka Gold plant. Production from West Wits surface sources increased due to the addition of the Tailings Storage facility in
2016.

Mine Waste Solutions recommissioned the uranium plant, with limited production during the quarter.

In the Continental Africa region, production was 333,000oz at a total cash cost of $760/oz for the third quarter of 2016 compared
to 349,000oz at a total cash cost of $687/oz in the same quarter in 2015. Total cash costs were impacted mostly by lower
production year-on-year at Kibali and Geita.

The region's production decreased compared with the third quarter of last year, due to planned reductions from both Geita and
Kibali as well as the discontinuation of production from Obuasi, which contributed 13,000oz in the same period last year. This was
partly offset by the 12% increase in output from Iduapriem and the 21% increase from Siguiri in the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the same quarter in 2015.

The increased production at Iduapriem resulted from higher plant utilisation, together with improved grade. Siguiri mined higher
grade areas and also saw a gain in volumes treated compared to the same quarter in 2015.

Despite the 17% increase in plant throughput from improved plant availability and consistent operations at Geita, production fell
due to lower recovered grade ore mined from the Nayakanga pit, in line with the mining plan.

Kibali showed a strong recovery from the challenges faced in the first half of the year. Gold production improved by 24% quarter-
on-quarter with improved throughput and recovery. Problems encountered earlier in the year during trials ahead of a full crossover
to sulphide processing next year, are being resolved through modifications to the plant that will be completed in the first half of
2017.

Third quarter production in 2016 was lower than the same quarter in 2015 due to a change in ore source as mining moved from the
KCD open pit to other pits, with the different mineralogy causing lower metallurgical recoveries despite higher tonnages processed.
Higher reagent consumption was due to the change in the type of material fed into the plant and further inflated total cash cost
year-on-year. Construction of the underground crushing and materials handling system adjacent to the shaft remains on schedule.
Construction of the Amburau hydropower station is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Construction of the
Azambi hydropower station has commenced.

The Americas region produced 211,000oz at a total cash cost of $588/oz for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 219,000oz at a
total cash cost of $570/oz for the same quarter in 2015.

Brazil's overall production was affected by problems accessing high-grade areas due to geotechnical issues at the Cuiabá
complex, and a fatal accident in late September. At Serra Grande, production in the third quarter of 2016 was 28% higher
compared to the third quarter in 2015, due to higher feed grades from mining high-grade blocks of Mina III. The mine faced
operational difficulties accessing high-grade areas last year. Córrego do Sítio was affected by a deficit in secondary development
and a longer-than-planned stoping cycle resulting in a 13% decrease in production. The Argentina operations delivered a
stable performance with production subdued as operational and metallurgical improvements were offset by lower grades.

Total cash costs for the Americas region were negatively impacted by lower production coupled with inflationary pressures and a
strengthening Brazilian real relative to the dollar. Córrego do Sitio's total cash costs increased by 26% due primarily to lower
grades, a stronger local currency relative to the dollar and inflationary pressures. Serra Grande, in Brazil, saw a 22% improvement
in total cash costs compared to the same quarter in 2015 as a result of higher production. Cerro Vanguardia's total cash costs
improved by 16% mainly as a result of the peso's depreciation against the dollar, higher by-product credits, and a rebate of port
duties. The cost improvement was partially offset by unfavourable stockpile movements, lower heap-leach production and inflation
following a second wage settlement reached in July.

The Australia region produced 121,000oz at a total cash cost of $864/oz for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 134,000oz at a
total cash cost of $718/oz for the same quarter in 2015. Production was impacted by Sunrise Dam's lower metallurgical recovery
and lower mill feed grade despite 3% higher mill throughput, whilst at Tropicana the head grade was lower in the third quarter of
2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015, largely due to the mine's grade streaming strategy which ended in December 2015.

The Australia region's total cash costs increased due to lower production, the unfavourable impact of a stronger Australian dollar
relative to the US dollar over the quarter, higher underground costs at Sunrise Dam, together with increased mining expenditure
largely due to the addition of an extra jumbo to open up new mining areas with a specific focus initially on decline development. At
Tropicana, lower planned grades and a stockpile movement had an unfavourable impact on costs.

Obuasi update

In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced area of the Obuasi mine site,
AngloGold Ashanti Ghana (AGAG) was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew all employees
performing non-essential functions. Obuasi continues in care and maintenance phase whilst evaluating future options for
recommencing operations through optimisation of the feasibility study. In regard to the incursion of illegal miners onto the lease,
the Government of Ghana appointed a committee to direct and oversee their relocation to other areas off the lease. AGAG hopes
that the committee will assist in expediting the reinstatement of law and order at the mine. However, AGAG's arbitration against
the Government of Ghana, filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in April 2016, continues in
order for AGAG to protect its legal and equitable rights and to mitigate the damage that the incursion of illegal miners has already
caused.

AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields Limited,
Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Village Main Reef Limited, Randgold and Exploration Company
Limited, and Sibanye Gold Limited, were served with a consolidated class action application on 21 August 2013. On 13 May
2016 the South Gauteng High Court of South Africa ruled in favour of the applicants and found that there were sufficient
common issues to certify two industry-wide classes: a Silicosis Class and a Tuberculosis Class, each of which cover current and
former underground mineworkers who worked in South African mines from 12 March, 1965 and who have contracted the
respective diseases (or the dependents of mineworkers who died of those diseases). The High Court ordered a two-stage
process in the class action. The first stage is to resolve common issues and allow the individuals to opt out. The second stage
will allow the individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies. The High Court
also decided that claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life) will be transferable to the
estate or executor of any deceased mineworker who dies after the date of filing of the certification application. On 3 June 2016,
AngloGold Ashanti, together with certain of the other mining companies, filed an application with the High Court for leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Arguments in the application for leave to appeal were heard on 23 June 2016. 
On 24 June 2016, leave to appeal was (i) granted in respect of the issue of the transferability of deceased mineworkers' claims for
general damages but (ii) denied in respect of all other orders of the High Court. On 15 July 2016 AngloGold Ashanti, along with
several other respondent companies, filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal such other orders of
the High Court. On 14 September 2016, AGA together with the other respondent companies has been granted leave to appeal
the other orders of the High Court to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The application for leave to appeal suspends the operation
of the High Court's order. The appeal is likely to be heard mid-2017.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Trebles Free Cash Flow to $108m, Cuts Net Debt 32%

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti said it more than trebled free cash
flow generation in the first half of the year to $108m and lowered net debt by almost a third, as
costs fell and it took advantage of a higher gold price.

AngloGold Ashanti has delivered on a range of self-help measures over the past two years to
reduce debt using internally generated funds. In focusing on improving the quality of its production,
the Company has sold some mines, closed others and made significant reductions to all areas of
cost as it prioritises sustainable improvements to free cash flow and returns.

“We will continue to push hard to improve operational and cost performance, as well as our overall
balance sheet flexibility, regardless of the gold price environment,” Chief Executive Officer
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “Our focus remains to improve margins and grow cash flow and
returns on a sustainable basis.”

Net debt fell by 32% to $2.1bn as at June 30 of this year from $3.1bn at the end of June last year,
significantly lowering interest payments. On 1 August 2016, AngloGold Ashanti also completed the
redemption of the remaining 8.5%, seven year bonds outstanding, at a total cost of the $503m.
This extinguished the Company’s most expensive debt and fulfilled a key strategic objective by
further reducing its future interest payments.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) improved to an average of $911/oz in the six months through 30
June, compared with the $924/oz recorded in the first half of 2015. Production from continuing
operations was 1.745Moz, versus 1.878Moz in the comparable period last year given the
unforeseen challenges faced at the Kibali joint venture and planned reduction in output from the
Tropicana, Geita and Obuasi mines.

The Company’s International Operations produced 1.259Moz at AISC of $873/oz, accounting for
almost three in every four ounces mined. The performance benefited from weaker currencies
versus the dollar in Argentina, Australia and Brazil. There were especially strong cost
performances from Sunrise Dam and Cerro Vanguardia, which posted significant efficiency gains
during the first half of 2016.

A number of brownfield expansion or mine-life extension projects are under way, including at
Siguiri in Guinea, Sadiola in Mali, Tropicana in Australia and Geita, in Tanzania. Pre-feasibility
studies of two key projects in Colombia are expected to be completed next year, potentially adding
significant new reserves to the Company’s mineral inventory.



                                                 1
AngloGold Ashanti’s South African operations delivered 486,000oz of production at AISC of
$958/oz, a 13% cost reduction from the first six months of last year. Mponeng, the largest of the
local mines, continued its recovery with a 25% jump in output and a 28% reduction in AISC to
$893/oz. Tragically, there were three work-related fatalities at the South African operations during
the period under review, overshadowing safety improvements that have been made across the
balance of the portfolio. The South African operations continue to face significant challenges due
to safety-related stoppages, which have continued throughout the year.

Adjusted headline earnings were $159m, or 39 cents per share in the first half of 2016, compared
with $61m, or 15 cents per share, in the first half of 2015. Net profit attributable to equity
shareholders during the first half of 2016 was $52m compared with a net loss from continuing
operations of $23m a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA)
decreased by $12m, or 2% from $793m in the six month period ended 30 June 2015 to $781m in
the six months ended 30 June 2016. The lower production year-on-year was largely offset by cost
improvements over the same period. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of June
2016 was 1.44 times, compared with the 1.47 times recorded at the end March 2016, and 1.95
times at the end of June 2015, highlighting the success of AngloGold Ashanti’s continued efforts to
deleverage and sustainably improve cash flow.

Forward-Looking Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry,
expectations regarding gold prices, production, cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth prospects
and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain
of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and
capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements
regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, economic performance and financial condition.

These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to
differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ
materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and
operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of
pending or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational risk management.

For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2015, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any
person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.
The financial information contained in this news release has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company's external auditors. This communication may contain certain “Non-GAAP” financial
measures. AngloGold Ashanti utilises certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in managing its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an
alternative for, the reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies may use. AngloGold Ashanti posts information that is important to investors on the main page of its website at

Financial and Operating Report

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid operating and financial performance for the first half of 2016, continuing to execute on its strategy
to improve cash flows and returns on a sustainable basis and to develop optionality within the business. The results show improved
earnings and free cash flow given strong ongoing focus on cost and capital discipline, and the rising gold price.

 ""We will continue to push hard to improve operational and cost performance as well as our overall balance sheet
flexibility, regardless of the gold price environment,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""Our focus remains to
improve margins and grow cash flow and returns on a sustainable basis.""

Production was 1.745Moz at a total cash cost of $706/oz for the six months to 30 June 2016, compared to 1.878Moz at $726/oz in the
first six months of 2015, from continuing operations. The decrease in production from continuing operations was led by weaker
production from Kibali and a planned decrease in head grades at Tropicana, as noted earlier in the year. AISC improved by $13/oz
over the first half of last year, decreasing from $924/oz to $911/oz. The improvement in AISC reflects continued cost discipline
throughout the group, weaker currencies and lower capital expenditure. Our portfolio of assets continued to deliver strong and
consistent performance as a whole.

Free cash flow of $108m was recorded for the half year, more than triple the $31m for the first half of 2015, resulting in 3
consecutive quarters of free cash flow generation. Free cash flow was affected by negative working capital movements which will
unwind in the second half of the year, specifically $28m from the sale of metal from Argentina which was delayed until the week
immediately following half year.

This overall improvement in free cash flow, however, was driven by continued efforts to contain costs and improve efficiencies, weaker
currencies in key operating jurisdictions, $33m in interest savings, and a 1% higher gold price received.

Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by $37m, or 7%, from $513m in the six months ended 30 June 2015 to $476m in the
six months ended 30 June 2016, reflecting a 7% drop in production from continuing operations and negative working capital
movements, which included timing of gold shipments from Argentina, and movements in VAT receivables in South Africa.

AHE were $159m, or 39 cents per share, compared with $61m, or 15 cents, in the first half of 2015. Net profit attributable to equity
shareholders during the first half of 2016 was $52m compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $23m a year earlier. During
the six months ended 30 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti settled foreign denominated debt resulting in a recycling of historic foreign
exchange losses of $60m from the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve to the Income Statement. This was added back for headline
earnings. In addition, the effective tax rate reduced from 113% to 46% as the tax charges decreased from $115m in the six months
ended 30 June 2015 to $51m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. This was largely due to the currency impact on the translation of
the deferred tax balance in South America.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) decreased by 12m, or 2% from $793m in the
six month period ended 30 June 2015 to $781m in the six months ended 30 June 2016. The lower production year-on-year was largely
offset by cost improvements over the same period. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2016 was 1.44 times,
compared with the 1.47 times recorded at the end March 2016, and 1.95 times at the end of June 2015, highlighting the success of
AngloGold Ashanti's continued efforts to deleverage and sustain improvements in cash flow.

Net debt fell by 32% to $2.098bn, from $3.076bn at the end of June 2015, mainly as a result of the proceeds received on the sale
of Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) for $819m which was concluded last year, as well as continued strong cost management, which
saw improvements across most cost areas.

The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising $1.0bn available on the US dollar revolving credit facility (RCF) at
the end of June 2016, A$190m undrawn on the A$500m Australian dollar RCF, approximately R3.2bn available from the South African
RCF and other facilities and cash and cash equivalents of $470m as at the end of June 2016.

This strong liquidity position allowed AngloGold Ashanti to draw down $330m from the US dollar RCF at the end of July to partially fund
the redemption of the $503m outstanding in 8.5% bonds due in 2020. The remainder was funded by cash on hand. The redemption
was executed on 1 August 2016 at a predetermined price of 106.375 cents on the dollar, thereby eliminating the company's highest-
cost debt, and reducing both interest payments and the concentration of debt maturities in 2020, improving free cash flow and
introducing additional balance-sheet flexibility by reducing the company's hardened debt levels. This will reduce interest charges by
$40m on an annualised basis.

The South African operations reported a 3% drop in production year-on-year to 486,000oz, alongside a 13% improvement in
AISC which declined to $958/oz, from $1,098/oz in the same period last year. Mponeng delivered the standout performance in the
region, with a 25% increase in production and a 28% decrease in AISC year-on-year. However, whilst the weaker rand benefitted
costs, production continued to be hampered by increased safety-related stoppages which have become a feature of the country's
underground mining industry. The frequent and unpredictable nature of Section 54 stoppages and mass compliance audits by the
Department of Mineral Resources has created an element of risk to production levels from the region, given the resultant downtime and
production ramp-up periods.

The International operations delivered production of 1.259Moz at an AISC of $873/oz, compared with 1.378Moz at an AISC of
$840/oz in the same period last year. These mines, all outside South Africa, accounted for 72% of AngloGold Ashanti's total
production, and benefited from weaker currencies in Argentina, Australia and Brazil. There were especially strong cost performances
from Sunrise Dam and Cerro Vanguardia, which posted significant efficiency gains during the first half of 2016. As indicated at the
beginning of the year, production was lower in accordance with the plans at Geita and Tropicana, whilst Kibali continued to face
challenges encountered in mining and processing different ore types, and the first attempt during the first quarter to test the transition to
a sulphide processing circuit.

Capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities) was $318m for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to $426m
(including discontinued operations) in the same period last year. This reduction was partially due to favourable exchange rate
movements, impediments in reaching investment targets caused by ongoing safety stoppages in South Africa, and the cessation of
work on the underground decline access at Obuasi in Ghana. It is expected that capital expenditure will increase in the second half of
the year in line with past trends.

SAFETY UPDATE

The all injury frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, was 8.03 per million hours worked in the first half,
from 7.51 in the same period last year, a 7% regression mainly due to the South Africa region, while the International operations
recorded AIFR at 2.19, a 31% improvement from 3.17 reported last year. Regrettably, there were three fatalities in this period, a fall of
ground fatal in TauTona and two fatalities which occurred in seismic events at the Savuka section of TauTona, with the largest
measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.

In South Africa, work on the execution of the Safe Production Strategy which focuses on improving skills, behaviour and
attitude, planning work and protecting workers from risk continues. As a result, Moab Khotsong managed to achieve one million 
fatality free shifts on 10 May 2016, Mponeng achieved one million fatality free shifts during the first quarter of the year, 
whilst Kopanang achieved one million fatality free shifts on 14 June 2016 as well as one-year fatality-free on 1 July 2016.

The safe management of mobile equipment remains a key focus area across the International operations, especially in the Continental
Africa region. Training programmes aimed at improving competence of equipment operators and supervisors are being implemented to
reduce the risks associated with mobile equipment. High potential incident audits are conducted regularly to mitigate safety challenges
across the group, which include fall of ground and heavy mobile equipment incidents.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations produced 486,000oz at a total cash cost of $809/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared
to 500,000oz at a total cash cost of $894/oz in the same period last year. Safety stoppages resulted in approximately 44,085oz of lost
production, given the downtime and resultant ramp-up period. Costs benefitted from the weaker exchange rate despite these lower
production volumes, inflationary pressures on labour and power, and the court-ordered re-instatement of the 542 employees dismissed
in 2013.

At West Wits, production was 214,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
207,000oz at a total cash cost of $910/oz in the same period last year. Production was affected by the fall-of-ground incident in
January at TauTona, and a seismic-related fatal accident at the Savuka section of the same mine in April. Both incidents led to
prolonged stoppages, impacting negatively on production and development. Work is underway to revise the production plan to further
improve access to working areas. This was more than offset by the strong production performance from Mponeng, which showed
recovery from the safety- related production interruptions encountered in the six months ended 30 June 2015. Mponeng was one of
the lowest cost producers for the South African region in the first half of 2016 at a total cash cost of $692/oz reflecting an
improvement of 25% year-on-year.

Vaal River production was 173,000oz at a total cash cost of $843/oz for the six months ended June 2016, compared to 191,000oz at a
total cash cost of $861/oz in the same period last year. Production was negatively impacted by safety-related stoppages, with Moab
Khotsong most affected.

Production at Surface Operations was 93,000oz at a total cash cost of $797/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016, compared to
97,000oz at a total cash cost of $925/oz in the same period last year. The most significant impact on production was a decline in
yield from the reclamation of the lower grade Tailings Storage Facilities at the West Wits section. The Vaal River section saw
improved grades from the success of the screening initiative to upgrade the Kopanang marginal ore dumps. Production at Mine
Waste Solutions improved as a result of an improved reclamation strategy and from the commissioning of the East Pump Station in
the third quarter of 2015. The flotation plant was recommissioned in June and it is expected that the Uranium plant will be fully
operational during the third quarter of this year, which is expected to result in improved gold and uranium recovery.

In the Continental Africa region, production was 620,000oz at a total cash cost of $690/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016
compared to 719,000oz at a total cash cost of $675/oz in the same period last year. Costs were impacted by overall low production
volumes, despite strong ongoing cost control. Production was affected by the planned lower production from Geita, a
disappointing performance from Kibali, and the cessation of tailings retreatment at Obuasi.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kibali's production was 114,000oz at a total cash cost of $802/oz for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 compared to 148,000oz at a total cash cost of $588/oz in the same period last year. The lower production was
due to lower throughput, recovery and grade while the operation manages the complexity of several different surface and
underground ore types. Ahead of commissioning of the shaft in the second half of 2017 and an increase in the proportion of sulphide
ore, a plant trial was undertaken on 100% sulphide. The trial highlighted a number of areas where improvements will be
needed including fine grinding and sulphide concentrate leaching. To provide improved flexibility two high-grade satellite pits are
being developed in the current year and in 2017. Development of the underground mine is progressing on schedule with shaft
equipping completed, and off- shaft development and integration with the decline system in progress.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased 13% to 99,000oz at a total cash cost of $931/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016,
compared to 88,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,037/oz in the same period last year. The production improvement was driven by a 6%
higher recovered grade as well as a 6% increase in tonnage treated as a result of improved plant utilisation compared to the
same period last year when throughput was impacted by an extensive plant shutdown. Total cash costs consequently decreased
mainly a s a result of higher production together with the once-off benefit of a reversal of contractor mining costs for the settlement of
historical claims with the previous mining contractor.

At Obuasi, the first half of 2016 has been dominated by the incursion of illegal miners onto the operating area. Despite extensive
engagements with the authorities at all levels to re-establish law and order, illegal miners continue to occupy the lease area. The mine
has been placed on care and maintenance, with only essential dewatering, ventilation and water treatment activities being underta
ken. Meanwhile, future options for recommencing operations continue to be evaluated.

At Siguiri in Guinea, production was 126,000oz at a total cash cost of $706/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared
to 132,000oz at a total cash cost of $837/oz in the same period last year. Production was lower due to a planned 7% decrease
in recovered grade, partly compensated by a 2% increase in tonnage throughput given the increased plant availability. Total cash costs
were lower as a result of weaker currency exchange rates, lower fuel prices, a once-off benefit of a reversal of the contractor
mining costs for the settlement of historical claims with the previous mining contractor, and favourable ore stockpile movements.

In Mali, Morila's production was 13,000oz at a total cash cost of $965/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
35,000oz at a total cash cost of $569/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased as the operation transitions to end-of-
life, treating marginal and tailings grade.

At Sadiola, production was 36,000oz at a total cash cost of $826/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to 36,000oz at
a total cash cost of $840/oz in the same period last year. Production was maintained, while total cash cost decreased due to lower
fuel prices and good cost management.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 229,000oz at a total cash cost of $496/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
250,000oz at a total cash cost of $487/oz in the same period last year. Production decreased as a result of a planned 11%
reduction in recovered grade from mining lower grade ore in the Nyankanga pit compared to the same period last year. This was
partly compensated for by a 3% increase in plant throughput as a result of consistent plant operations. The focus for Geita over the
next few quarters will be toward improving mining efficiencies in the new underground development and step-up productivity to planned
levels.

In the Americas, production was 388,000oz at a total cash cost of $549/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared
to 377,000oz at a total cash cost of $632/oz in the same period last year. The AISC at $816/oz compared to $849/oz this period last
year, were due to good cost controls, weaker exchange rates, and higher by-product sales in Argentina, partially tempered by high
inflation, particularly in Brazil.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 136,000oz at a total cash cost of $543/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016
compared to 135,000oz at a total cash cost of $641/oz in the same period last year. Total cash costs were 15% lower than in the same
period last year, helped by the local currency devaluation and a 35% increase in by-product sales of silver. These were partially offset
by inflationary pressures which included initial salary increases following a wage settlement reached in February. It is expected
that a second round of negotiations will take place early in the second half of the year. Unfavourable stockpile movements resulted
from lower tonnes mined during a short, unprocedural strike in January. Free cash flow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was
negatively impacted due to a delay in the receipt of cash from gold and silver sales of $28m.

In Brazil, production was 252,000oz at a total cash cost of $545/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to 242,000oz a
total cash cost of $627/oz in the same period last year. AISC were $857/oz compared to $816/oz for same period last year. The lower
costs reflect higher capital expenditure partially offset by higher gold sold, lower operating expenditure and favourable exchange rates
in the current period.

At AngloGold Ashanti Mineração, production was 188,000oz at a total cash cost of $531/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016
compared to 181,000oz at a total cash cost of $598/oz in the same period last year. Production increased due to higher tonnage at
both the Cuiabá and Córrego do Sítio complexes together with higher grades from the latter. The improvement was due to increased
developed reserves at the beginning of the year at Cuiabá, in addition to better operational performance at both the mine and plant
in the Córrego do Sítio complex. Production at the Cuiabá complex was slightly affected, where access to higher grade areas -

some as high as 20g/t - was delayed due to geotechnical issues. However, changes in the mining plan have already been made and it
is expected that production will improve in the second half of the year. Total cash costs were 11% lower compared to same period last
year mainly due to higher production, continued cost saving initiatives and the weaker currency, partially offset by higher inflation.

At Serra Grande production was 64,000oz at a total cash cost at $584/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
61,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz in the same period last year. Production increased as a result of higher recovered grade and
tonnage treated, reflecting operational improvements in the plant. Total cash costs were 18% lower due to higher gold produced, cost
saving initiatives from labour and primary development credits, and local currency devaluation, partially impacted by higher inflationary
impacts including power costs. Drilling ahead of our retreat mining development has revealed areas in the Minas III ore body where
mineralised material extends significantly further than anticipated. This will result in a longer-than-anticipated development period,
compensated for with additional ounces in the production profile. We are working on improving this outcome in future by looking at
augmenting existing exploration budgets.

In Australia, production was 251,000oz at a total cash cost of $806/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared to
282,000oz at a total cash cost of $703/oz in the same period last year. Production was down despite better mill throughput due to
lower grades at both operations. A plant optimisation and upgrade project at Tropicana to lift throughput to 7.5 Mtpa is expected to be
completed by the end of September.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 113,000oz at a total cash cost of $858/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared
to 115,000oz at a total cash cost of $958/oz in the same period last year. Production was impacted by lower grades and marginally
lower metallurgical recovery, despite a 6% increase in mill throughput. Total cash costs decreased with the impact of lower grades
more than offset by favourable ore stockpile movements together with good cost controls. The efficiencies were derived from
reduced mining, processing and maintenance costs and reduced underground mining costs, whereby the cost per tonne mined was
11% lower than in the same period last year when there was a higher ore stock drawdown. Ore production at Sunrise Dam has now
increased to an annualised rate of 2.8 Mt, almost doubling underground volumes since 2012, and continuing to displace mill-feed
from low-grade stockpiles with higher-grade underground material.

At Tropicana, production was 137,000oz at a total cash cost of $704/oz for the six months ended 30 June 2016, compared to
167,000oz at a total cash cost of $476/oz in the same period last year. Production was lower due to the planned end to grade
streaming in December 2015, which meant the head grade was 27% lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the corresponding
period in 2015. Total cash costs increased compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower production and inventory
movement, with 19% more ore mined. The plant optimisation project remains on schedule for completion in September and the plant
achieved a record throughput rate of 7.28 Mtpa in May and June. The Long Island Study, which has been considering innovative, low
cost approaches to mining the depth extensions of the Tropicana mineralised system, has advanced, supported by extensive
drilling. An updated Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimate is expected at the end of the year and the study is expected to be
completed in the first half of 2017.

PERSONNEL

A number of key personnel changes have been made across our operations. These changes highlight the strength and depth of our
internal talent pool, an area on which we have spent considerable time, expertise and resources over the past several years. These
changes are also consistent with our commitment to timeous succession planning in all roles across the business.

Ludwig Eybers, who has been with the company for five years, and has led the remarkable turnaround of our Continental Africa
portfolio since 2013, has been appointed Deputy Chief Operating Officer: International. Ludwig, who has had extensive experie nce
working across a number of international jurisdictions over a 20-year career, has overseen an increase in productivity for the
Continental Africa region, along with an improvement in safety. He will work closely with Ron Largent on budgeting and business
planning, as well as on the execution of Operational Excellence initiatives.

Ludwig replaces Helcio Guerra, who has decided, for personal reasons, to take early retirement at the end of December, after a
distinguished mining career of almost four decades, the past eight years of which were spent with AngloGold Ashanti. Helcio was
most recently the Deputy COO: International following his position as Senior Vice President: Americas. Helcio has been a key
member of our operational management team and contributed to the transformation of the International Portfolio over the past three
years in particular. He has mentored a world-class team in Argentina and Brazil, and leaves behind a suite of assets with an exciting
range of future options for AngloGold Ashanti. We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

Sicelo Ntuli, who has for the past three years led the turnaround of the Iduapriem mine in Ghana, where costs have decreased, will
replace Ludwig as Senior Vice President: Continental Africa. Sicelo, a mining engineer, has extensive operating experience across
the group's open pit and deep underground assets, as well as in business planning and strategy roles over his career for more than
20 years spent with AngloGold Ashanti. He will work closely with Ludwig as he transitions into his new role. (Sicelo will be replaced
at Iduapriem by Jasper Musadaidzwa, currently the operations manager at Siguiri Mine).

Lowe Billingsley, Vice President of Planning and Strategy, in the International business unit, will assume the role of Senior Vice
President: Americas. In his most recent post he had oversight of strategy implementation and long-range planning for the Americas
portfolio. Lowe is a trained geologist who has also held several important posts during his 26 years with the company, including
General Manager of the Cripple Creek & Victor Mine during its successful mine-life extension project. He will work closely with Helcio
as he transitions into his new role.

Moses Madondo, general manager of the Moab Khotsong mine, will assume a broader suite of responsibilities as he assumes his
new role of Senior Vice President of the Vaal River Region in South Africa. Moses, a mining engineer who has extensive experience
spanning strategy, planning and operations, will continue to work closely with Chris Sheppard, COO: South Africa, and his executive
management team in South Africa, as they continue their work to safely improve productivity in the region.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

At Mponeng, in Phase 1: 126 level, the implementation of the secondary support strategy continued to produce positive results
during the second quarter. The ore handling infrastructure at 126 level, which includes the sinking of reef and waste silos, remains
ahead of schedule. This project is scheduled for completion in July 2018.

In Phase 2, critical execution activities continued, including the construction of the surface substation which was completed during
the second quarter, which is now awaiting commissioning from Eskom, along with the continuation of equipping the ice pipe and
other associated activities. The balance of Phase 2 is scheduled to commence in January 2018 and a pre-feasibility is being
conducted on the Carbon Leader ore body extension.

At Kibali, remedial work on the Ambarau hydro power station was completed, following the river flood event in November 2015.
Construction is back on track, and commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2016. Early works have commenced on the third hydro-
power station at Azambi.

At Siguiri, AngloGold Ashanti plans to invest about $115m over a little over two years to add a hard-rock plant to the current 
processing infrastructure, providing the ability to develop the significant sulphide-ore potential that exists on the current concession. 
during the first half of the year the company reached an agreement with the Government of Guinea on the Convention de Base, a legal and 
fiscal framework covering the life of the project. The accord will now progress through the mandatory legal and parliamentary ratification processes.

At Sadiola, AngloGold Ashanti and joint-venture partner IAMGOLD Corporation are completing a final optimisation of the Sadiola Sulphides Project, 
ahead of an investment decision later this year. The project, to add sulphide-ore processing capability to the plant, was suspended in 2013 after 
the precipitous decline in the gold price that year. Whilst the technical and financial aspects of the optimised project look promising, it is 
important that the Government of Mali – itself an owner of a 18% stake in the mine – provide assurances around the renewal of the construction and 
operating permits, power agreement and fiscal terms relating to the project, as previously negotiated, before an investment commitment can be made. 
The early timing of these assurances and renewals from the Government are especially important in order for the upgraded plant to be fully operational 
before all existing sources of oxide ore are depleted. The project aims to significantly extend the life of the project, with increased production and 
lower operating costs from the current levels.

Colombia remains an area of long-term focus for us, particularly given its attractive and under-explored geological potential, AngloGold Ashanti's first-mover 
advantage in the country and its significant exploration success to date. Whilst bearing in mind that we remain in an environment in which financial 
resources are constrained, we have committed to completing the update of the pre-feasibility studies for the Gramalote and La Colosa projects by the end 
of next year. We anticipate that the successful completion of these studies will enable the declaration of reserves to take place.

Technology and Innovation update

1. Reef Boring

1.1 Small range:

Commisioning of the Sandvik/Cubex machine commenced at Savuka Mine earlier in the quarter with operational readiness having
been the key focus during this period. Training of operators will continue during the third quarter with the first cycle of operational test
results expected soon thereafter.

1.2 Medium Range:

With a blue print cycle time of 72 hours/hole, the 3 MK III machines in the Carbon Leader site at TauTona mine have drilled a total of
16 holes during the quarter. Overall performace for the quarter has improved to just over 82 hours/hole as opposed to the previous
quarters performance of 96 hours/hole. As is the case with the MK IV machine, machine availability/reliability is an issue, but is
receiving attention. As planned, an additional MK III machine was successfully commissioned in the VCR site during the quarter.

The MK IV machine has for the second consecutive quarter performed at just above the 92 hour/hole mark. Key issues affecting the
performance remain rock handling and more importantly machine availability where dedicated resources have been deployed to
assist in resolving these issues.

All sites were affected by mine wide safety stoppages as well as a geotechnical incidence resulting in the total number of holes
completed being lower than planned for the quarter.

2. Ore body Knowledge and Exploration

The first prototype drill rig was delivered to TauTona mine during the quarter and after a number of surface commisioning challenges
were resolved, was moved into position at the drill site late in the second quarter. Underground commissioning will commence early
in the third quarter, upon which our first prototype machine tests will commence focussing on deflection optimisation trials.

3. Ultra High Strength Backfill (UHSB)

Construction of the surface solution plant at TauTona mine is still ongoing and on schedule.

Site development for the permanent UHSB plant at Savuka mine has been delayed due to safety stoppages. However, in the interim
period, the temporary plant has been used to fill all the drilled holes allowing testing of the small range reef boring machine to
continue.

Designs for the TauTona Below 120 (B120) plant has been finalised. The tendering process will commence in quarter three and
construction is planned to commence in the fourth quarter.

GREENFIELDS

During the first half of the year, Greenfields exploration activities were undertaken in Australia, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina,
USA, Guinea and Tanzania. The Greenfields exploration team completed 1,219m of diamond drilling in Colombia and 14,016m of
aircore drilling in Australia. Total expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was $10m.

In Australia, at the Tropicana Mine there was a formal hand-over to the mine-based team of the accountability for all tenements within
60kms of the mine. Further to the south in the Tropicana joint-venture on the Oak Dam tenement, the Greenfields team continued

to work with the traditional owners to determine where access for exploration would be allowed. In the Laverton District, aircore
drilling was completed over priority targets with 91 holes drilled for a total of 5,742m. At the Strawbridge Project (100% AngloGold
Ashanti) the field work comprised geological mapping, surface soil geochemical sampling and first pass aircore drilling. A total of
778 soil samples and 197 aircore holes for 8,274m were completed over priority target areas.

In Colombia, drilling was completed at the Guintar project (100% AngloGold Ashanti) situated 40km west of Medellin. Three holes
for 1,219m were completed in the first half of the year. Final compilation and review recommended that no further work is required.
Work has now shifted to the Margaritas project area 2kms to the south where mapping, rock and soil geochemistry has been
completed. Reconnaissance work was conducted in other locations within Antioquia province in the mid-Cauca belt.

Generative exploration occurred in Brazil, Argentina, USA, Guinea and Tanzania. In a significant development, the Greenfields
exploration team signed a new farm-in and joint-venture agreement with Luna Gold to explore approximately 2,000km 2 tenement
package located in the Maranhão state of Brazil. In Tanzania the Meia license applications (850km2) in the Lake Victoria
Greenstone Belt of Tanzania are pending and should be granted in the third quarter. The first phase of exploration was completed at
the Niandan license in Guinea (100km2, 90km from Siguiri) and 491 surface samples were collected. Early stage work is progressing
in Argentina and the USA.

BROWNFIELDS

During the first half of the year, Brownfields exploration activities were undertaken across the globe. Brownfields exploration,
including equity accounted joint-ventures, completed 285,877m of diamond drilling at a total expenditure for the six months ended
30 June 2016 of which $27m was capitalised and $33m was expensed.

was completed, including 501m RC and 1,955m DD, with some encouraging assay results returned. Within the southern area at Block
7&8, a total of 796m were drilled during the quarter with some encouraging results. The programme is ongoing.

Democratic Republic of the Congo: At Kibali, exploration focused on Kombokolo, the Agbarabo-Rhino-Pakaka corridor, Tete
Bakangwe, Sessenge SW and the KCD super pit. The forecast production shortfall has resulted in an emphasis on projects
with potential to deliver oxide ounces to the plant in the relatively short term. Regional targets explored include Aindi Watsa,
Memekazi Ridge and Zambula. A total of 7,953m was drilled near mine and 3,519m was drilled on regional targets.

Republic of Mali – At Sadiola and Yatela, RC drilling totaling 11,716m was completed during the first half of the year. Drilling
focused on Sadiola North/FN (4,624m), FE2S (5,454m) and FE1W (1,638m).

In Argentina, drilling commenced at Cerro Vanguardia during Q2 after a delayed start with most of the drilling meters completed at the
nearby Claudia joint-venture. During the second quarter 4,174m were drilled in total, including 3,618m at the Claudia joint-venture.

In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiabá, Lamego and Córrego di Sítio production centers for AGABM with 61,221m drilled during
the quarter from the combined surface and underground drilling programmes.

At Serra Grande, 36,295m were drilled as part of the exploration and Mineral Resource conversion programmes. Surface exploration
continued as preparation to establish drilling targets.

In Colombia, the Gramalote joint-venture completed 1,279m of drilling to support site and infrastructure investigations as well as infill
drilling to better define the saprolite horizon. At La Colosa, 1,453m were drilled as the site investigation geotechnical drilling continued.

In Australia, at Sunrise Dam drilling targeted Vogue South, Vogue Deeps, north extensions to Cosmo and Cosmo East, Carey Shear,
Below Carey high grade zone and Ulu Steeps for a total of 28,758m.

At Tropicana, a 100m x 100m exploration drilling programme continues to test the along-strike and down dip extensions of the
Tropicana gold system to provide data for the Long Island Mining Study. Infill drilling was also carried out on the Havana South high
grade zone identified during the June quarter. A total of 16,670m of RC and 34,695m of DD drilling was completed in the first half of
2016. A Mineral Resource model update is in progress.

A new regional exploration group was set-up based at Tropicana to manage the TJV exploration tenements (excluding the mine
lease). In the first half of the year, regional exploration consisted of drilling and a ground-based geophysical survey. Aircore, RC and
DD totalled 13,360m.

OBUASI UPDATE

In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced area of the Obuasi mine site, AngloGold
Ashanti Ghana was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew all employees performing non-essential
functions. Until then, work had been underway to investigate the viability of investing in the redevelopment of the mine as a modern,
productive and long-life mining operation.

Since then, the remaining employees have been performing critical services related to the operation of underground water pumping,
environmental and potable water treatment, provision of medical services, and maintenance of facilities that provide power and water
to employees' homes and surrounding communities.

In its declaration of force majeure, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana explained that the current situation is precluding it from fulfilling certain
conditions of its Amended Programme of Mining Operations, which was agreed with the government in November 2014. In particular,
the presence of illegal miners on the mine's operational footprint, in its underground tunnels and in areas which host key infrastructure
at the mine is impacting directly on the company's ability to continue to perform even the most essential services.

Given inaction by the authorities with respect to bringing an end to the invasion and illegal occupation of the site, illegal mining has
continued to grow since the initial invasion and the miners are now estimated to number several thousand who work on the site on any
given day. Whilst there has been no impact on AngloGold Ashanti's production and all-in sustaining costs as the site was not forecast
to be in production for at least this year, the damage to the site infrastructure and ore body will have a direct impact on the mine's
future viability.

AngloGold Ashanti Ghana filed a Request for Arbitration against the Government of Ghana with the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on 8 April 2016. The case was registered on 2 May 2016. ICSID is an international arbitration
institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., which facilitates dispute resolution between international investors and host states. The
relevant authorities' in Ghana, including the Attorney General, have been duly notified of the commencement of proceedings.

On 3 June 2016, the company also asked ICSID to make an urgent order compelling the Government of Ghana to use its authority to,
among other things, reinstate military security and restore law and order to the Obuasi Mine for the protection of AngloGold Ashanti
Ghana's personnel and the preservation of AngloGold Ashanti Ghana's assets.

Discussions are ongoing with Ghanaian authorities in respect of their request to our local subsidiary, made after the end of the second
quarter, to post an additional bond of $150m by 31 August 2016 in respect of its environmental obligations at Obuasi Mine. The present
value of these obligations has already been provided for in the financial statements.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT

There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates as disclosed in the 2015 Ore Reserve
and Mineral Resource report.

OUTLOOK

The production guidance provided to the market for the 2016 full year remains unchanged. Gold production for the year is estimated
to be between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz. Estimated total cash costs are expected to remain between $680/oz and $720/oz whilst AISC are
expected to remain between $900/oz and $960/oz at average exchange rates of ZAR14.97/$, BRL3.51/$, $0.74/A$ and AP15.10/$,
and Brent Crude Oil at $42/bl average for the year. Capital expenditure for the full year is still expected to be between $790m and
$850m.

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions, power disruptions or changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results. Outlook data
is forward-looking information which is further discussed on the front cover of this document.

        Liquidity and capital resources

        To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash
        resources, cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

        Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to
        foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In
        addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

        The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that
        external borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to
        meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that
        sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

14.     Financial risk management activities

        Borrowings
        The $1.25bn bonds are carried at fair value. The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing
        market values at the reporting date which results in the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining
        borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and accordingly the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair
        value.

Derivatives
The fair value of derivatives is estimated based on ruling market prices, volatilities, interest rates and credit risk and includes all
derivatives carried in the statement of financial position.

Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position.

The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
Level 1:    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:    inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
            (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3:    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

On 28 June 2016, AngloGold Ashanti (""AGA"") announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc
(""AGAH""), is compelling the surrender following the notice to buy back the remaining principal amount of its outstanding 8.5%
high-yield bonds that mature in May 2020, as part of its strategy to reduce debt and lower finance charges. On 1 August 2016,
the remaining portion of the notes were settled for a total consideration of $503m consisting of a $471m principal payment, a
surrender premium of $30m and interest of $2m.

On 24 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, was offering
to buy back up to $810m in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% high-yield bonds that mature in 2020, as part of its
strategy to reduce debt and lower interest payment. On 25 September 2015, 62.34% of the notes were settled for a total
consideration of $850m consisting of a $779m principal payment, a tender premium, being the difference between the par value of
the bond and the redemption price of $58m and interest of US$13m. Included in the tender premium on the $1.25bn bond (note
5) was a realised fair value loss of $11.5m being the difference between the fair value on redemption date and the redemption
price.

Environmental obligations

Pursuant to environmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are obligated to close our operations and
rehabilitate the lands which we mine in accordance with these regulations. As a consequence AngloGold Ashanti is required in
some circumstances to provide either reclamations bonds issued by third party entities, establish independent trust funds or
provide guarantees issued by the operation, to the respective environmental protection agency or such other government
department with responsibility for environmental oversight in the respective country to cover the potential environmental
rehabilitation obligation in specified amounts.

In most cases, the environmental obligations will expire on completion of the rehabilitation although in some cases we are
required to potentially post bonds for events unknown that may arise after the rehabilitation has been completed.

In South Africa we have established a trust fund which has assets of ZAR 1.33bn and guarantees of ZAR 1.37bn issued by
various banks, for a current carrying value of the liability of ZAR 1.4bn. In Australia, since 2014, we have paid into a Mine
Rehabilitation Fund an amount of AUD $1m for a current carrying value of the liability of AUD $95.3m. At Iduapriem we have
provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $9.7m with a further bond guarantee amounting to $33.9m issued by
Ecobank Ghana Limited (expired on 31st May 2016 but renewal process is underway) for a current carrying value of the liability of
$43.8m. At Obuasi we have provided a bond comprising of a cash component of $20.1m with a further bank guarantee amounting
to $30m issued by Nedbank Limited for a current carrying value of the liability of $218.1m. In some circumstances we may be
required to post further bonds in due course which will have a consequential income statement charge for the fees charged by the
providers of the reclamation bonds.

      Litigation claims
(1)   Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti,
      the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases
      Act, 1993 does not cover an ""employee"" who qualifies for compensation in respect of ""compensable diseases"" under the
      Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act, 1973 (ODMWA). This judgement allows such qualifying employee to pursue
      a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the Constitutional Court decision, AngloGold Ashanti has been
      subject to numerous claims relating to silicosis and other Occupational Lung Diseases (OLD), including several potential
      class actions and individual claims.

      In November 2014, Anglo American South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields Limited, Harmony Gold Mining Company
      Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited formed an industry working group on OLD to address issues relating to compensation and
      medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working group now also includes
      African Rainbow Minerals (ARM). The companies believe that fairness and sustainability are crucial elements of any solution
      and have embarked on an extensive engagement process with all stakeholders to work together to design and implement a
      comprehensive solution that is both fair to past, present and future gold mining employees, and also sustainable for the
      sector.

      The companies are among respondent companies in a number of lawsuits related to OLD. The companies do not believe
      that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they are defending these. They do, however, believe that they
      should work together to seek a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue.

      The companies active in gold mining have been working for many years to try to eliminate the incidence of OLD. These
      efforts continue.

      These legal proceedings are being defended, and the status of the proceedings are set forth below.

      AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields Limited,
      Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, DRDGold Limited, Randgold and Exploration Company Limited, and Sibanye Gold
      Limited, were served with a consolidated class action application on 21 August 2013. On 13 May, 2016, the South Gauteng
      High Court of South Africa ruled in favour of the applicants and found that there were sufficient common issues to certify two
      industry-wide classes: a Silicosis Class and a Tuberculosis Class, each of which cover current and former underground
      mineworkers who worked in South African mines from 12 March, 1965 and who have contracted the respective diseases (or
      the dependents of mineworkers who died of those diseases). The High Court ordered a two-stage process in the class
      action. The first stage is to resolve common issues and allow the individuals to opt out. The second stage will allow the
      individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies. The High Court also decided
      that claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life) will be transferable to the estate or
      executor of any deceased mineworker who dies after the date of filing of the certification application. On 3 June 2016,
      AngloGold Ashanti, together with certain of the other mining companies, filed an application with the High Court for leave to
      appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Arguments in the application for leave to appeal were heard on 23 June 2016. On 24
      June 2016, leave to appeal was (i) granted in respect of the issue of the transferability of deceased mineworkers' claims for
      general damages but (ii) denied in respect of all other orders of the High Court. On 15 July 2016 AngloGold Ashanti, along
      with several other respondent companies, filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal such other
      orders of the High Court.

      It is possible that additional class actions and/or individual claims relating to silicosis and/or other OLD will be filed against
      AngloGold Ashanti in the future. AngloGold Ashanti will defend all current and subsequently filed claims on their merits.
      Should AngloGold Ashanti be unsuccessful in defending any such claims, or in otherwise favourably resolving perceived
      deficiencies in the national occupational disease compensation framework that were identified in the earlier decision by the
      Constitutional Court, such matters would have an adverse effect on its financial position, which could be material. Given the
      inherent legal and factual uncertainties with respect to the pending claims and other claims not yet filed against the company,
      no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(2)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors
      Limited's (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling
      agreement at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation
      agreement on 8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a writ issued by MBC claiming a total of
      $97m. In December 2015, the proceedings were stayed in the High Court pending arbitration. In February 2016, MBC
      submitted the matter to arbitration.

(3)    Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that
       they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by
       emission and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the
       Pompora Treatment Plant (PTP), which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory
       infections, skin diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions,
       but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On
       24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves
       and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic
       hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter is set for hearing in October 2016. In view of the limitation
       of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation in
       either matter.

(4)    Mill contractor claims - On 3 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti and Newmont concluded the sale of the Cripple Creek & Victor
       mine in Colorado to Newmont. As part of the negotiated transaction, the parties agreed to a cost/recovery sharing
       arrangement relative to cost claims asserted for or against CC&V based on work performed by contractors during the design
       and manufacture of the High Grade Mill. Under the agreement, AngloGold Ashanti has the right to manage any negotiation,
       settlement, or legal proceedings associated with each cost claim. The total value of the cost claims asserted against CC&V,
       by two contractors, is $20m. On 1 April 2016, CC&V was added as a defendant to a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court
       (Colorado) between one of the contractors and a subcontractor, and the cost claims are being litigated there. Separately,
       CC&V has cost claims against the mill design contractor. These claims are proceeding in arbitration.

       With reference to items (1) - (4) above, provisions have been raised where the amount of the potential claim or settlement
       can be reasonably estimated.

       Tax claims
(5)    Other tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining
       authority, issued a tax assessment against AngloGold Ashanti Brazil Mineração Ltda (AABM) in the amount of $14m
       (2015: $11m) relating to the calculation and payment by AABM of the financial contribution on mining exploitation (CFEM) in
       the period from 1991 to 2006. The matter has been dormant since 2007. AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil
       are involved in various other disputes with tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax assessments including income
       tax, royalties, social contributions and annual property tax. The amount involved is approximately $14m (2015: $11m).
       Management is of the opinion that these taxes are not payable.

(6)    VAT disputes - Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (MSG) received a tax assessment in October 2003 from the State of Minas
       Gerais related to VAT on gold bullion transfers. The tax administrators rejected the company's appeals against the
       assessment. The company is now appealing the dismissal of the case to the State of Minas Gerais. The assessment is
       approximately $13m (2015: $11m).

(7)    Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office
       (DIAN) that it disagreed with the company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income tax returns. On
       23 October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax
       of $22m (2015: $20m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes are
       expected to be $119m (2015: $108m). The company believes that the DIAN has applied the tax legislation incorrectly. AGAC
       subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits in March 2015 and April 2015 before the Administrative Tribunal
       of Cundinamarca (trial court for tax litigation). On 8 July 2016, the tribunal held an initial procedural hearing on the 2010 tax
       dispute.

(8)    Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority
       (AFIP) requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $7m (2015: $8m) relating to the non-
       deduction of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not
       be considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of
       hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $22m (2015: $24m). CVSA and
       AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the opinion that the taxes are
       not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial derivatives. CVSA filed an
       appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015.

       Other
(9)    Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its operations,
       which have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical and legal
       studies have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable
       remediation solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated
       that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances.
       Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use
       of phyto-technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the
       technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(10)   Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified potential water ingress and future pollution risk posed by deep
       groundwater in certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti since 1999
       to understand this potential risk. In South Africa, due to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed
       solution needs to be a combined one supported by all the mines located in these gold fields. As a result, the Mineral and
       Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine
       Closure Strategy to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for
       the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

       Contingent asset
(11)   Indemnity - As part of the acquisition by AngloGold Ashanti of the remaining 50% interest in MSG during June 2012, Kinross
       Gold Corporation (Kinross) has provided an indemnity to a maximum amount of BRL255m against the specific exposures
       discussed in item 6 above. At 30 June 2016, the company has estimated that the maximum contingent asset is $8m (2015:
       $7m).

17.   Announcements

      AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo American South Africa settle stand-alone silicosis claims – On 4 March 2016 AngloGold
      Ashanti announced that together with Anglo American South Africa, the companies have concluded an agreement which resolves
      fully and finally stand-alone silicosis claims. The settlement relates to the approximately 4,400 separate claims which were
      instituted against Anglo American South Africa and included in this figure are the roughly 1,200 separate claims against
      AngloGold Ashanti.

      The settlement has been reached without admission of liability by AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo American South Africa and the
      terms of the agreement remain confidential. Both companies will contribute, in stages, up to $30 million.

      AngloGold Ashanti noted publication of draft Mining Charter – On 18 April 2016 AngloGold Ashanti noted the publication by
      South Africa's department of Mineral Resources of the draft reviewed Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment charter for the
      South African mining and minerals industry 2016.

      AngloGold Ashanti rating action by Standard and Poor's rating agency (S&P) – On 26 April 2016 AngloGold Ashanti
      confirmed that Standard & Poor's rating agency (S&P) had affirmed AngloGold Ashanti's BB+ long-term corporate credit
      rating and revised the outlook to stable from negative.

      S&P cited the reduction in debt and increasing local currency gold prices as reasons for the increase in earnings, cash
      flows, liquidity and credit metrics for AngloGold Ashanti. The stable outlook reflects S&P's expectation that AngloGold
      Ashanti can maintain core credit metrics at the higher end of their intermediate category.

      AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc announces issuance of a notice for the conditional redemption of all of its
      outstanding 8.5% notes due 2020 – On 28 June 2016 AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc (the ""Company"") announced that
      it had issued a notice for the conditional redemption (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the condition described below)
      of all of its outstanding 8.5% Notes due 2020 (the ""Notes"").

      Under the notice, the redemption of the Notes was conditioned upon the receipt by the Company of borrowings under the
      Company's $1,000,000,000 revolving credit facility in a sufficient amount, together with available cash in an amount
      determined by the Company, to pay the redemption price for the Notes, including any applicable premium, and accrued
      and unpaid interest in full and pay all related expenses on or before the redemption date. The redemption date was 1
      August 2016.

      The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 106.375% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed,
      plus additional amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption. The Notes were redeemed in full.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 15 August 2016.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial
results for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding reporting period.

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings and
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the period are both expected to be between 167% and
177% higher than for the six months ended 30 June 2015 (“comparative period”). Headline earnings
are expected to be between $87 million and $99 million, with HEPS between 22 cents and 24 cents.
Headline loss and headline loss per share for the comparative period were $128 million and 31 cents,
respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period are also both expected to be
between 131% and 141% higher than the comparative period. Basic earnings are expected to be
between $45 million and $59 million, with EPS between 12 cents and 14 cents. Basic loss and loss
per share for the comparative period were $143 million and 35 cents, respectively.

During the period, AngloGold Ashanti settled foreign denominated debt resulting in a recycling of
historic foreign exchange losses of $60 million (post-tax) from the Foreign Currency Translation
Reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity to the Income Statement. This amounts to a loss per
share of 15 cents. These losses are non-cash in nature and are added back for purposes of the
HEPS and adjusted HEPS (“AHEPS”) calculations for the period.

The Company will present adjusted headline earnings and AHEPS, which are expected to exceed
headline earnings and HEPS by $66 million and 16 cents, respectively. Adjustments to headline
earnings and HEPS include fair value adjustments to the 8.5% bonds; losses on unrealised non-
hedge derivatives and other commodity contracts; and provision for losses and impairment of
associates.
The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings are primarily due to:

*      The higher gold price, which averaged $1,222/oz in the first half of this year compared with
       $1,204/oz in the comparative period
*      Weaker operating currencies in South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina in the first half of
       this year versus the first half of 2015
*      Continued focus on cost control across the portfolio of 17 operations in nine countries
*      Interest savings after a successful tender offer on 25 September 2015 to repurchase 8.5%
       bonds maturing 2020 (the “Notes”) with an aggregate face value of $779 million, resulting in an
       interest saving in the period of $33 million
*      Positive effect of the translation of the deferred taxation balance in South America of $57
       million
*      The above increases are partly offset by reduced income from associates and joint ventures
       during the period of $39 million.

Gold production for the period is expected to be 1,745koz (1,878koz from continuing operations which
included Obuasi for the comparative period in 2015), with all-in sustaining costs of $911/oz for the
period ($924/oz for the comparative period in 2015).

AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti Limited, reported on
28 June 2016 that it has issued a notice for the conditional redemption (subject to meeting the
condition described below) of all of its outstanding 8.5% Notes. This is in line with AngloGold
Ashanti’s stated intention to reduce its annual interest charge, to improve the free cash flow
generation capacity of the business. These Notes currently carry an annual interest charge of $40
million.

The redemption of the Notes is conditional upon the receipt by the Company of borrowings under the
Company’s $1 billion revolving credit facility in a sufficient amount, together with available cash in an
amount determined by the Company, to pay the redemption price for the Notes, including any
applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest in full and pay all related expenses on or before
the redemption date. The redemption date is 1 August 2016.

These Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 106.375% of the principal amount of the
Notes to be redeemed, plus additional amounts, if any, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
the redemption.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Generates Strong Cash Flow in Q1; Operations Solid

(JOHANNESBURG – NEWS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti today announced strong free
cash flow in the first quarter as an ongoing focus on cost management, and leverage to
weaker currencies, yielded positive results and improved margins.

Free cash flow was $70m, a marked improvement to the outflow of $40m in the first quarter
of last year.

AngloGold Ashanti has delivered on a range of self-help measure to reduce debt using
internally generated funds, without diluting shareholders. The company, which has 17 mines
in nine countries, has made significant cuts to corporate overheads and all-in-sustaining
costs as it has sought to effect sustainable improvements to cash flow and returns.

“We again generated significant free cash flow despite the lower gold price, which shows the
continued success of our self-help measures to reduce debt by improving margins,”
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti, said.
“Notwithstanding our strong cost performance, we’re redoubling our efforts to ensure we
continue to capture as much margin as possible.”

Production from continuing operations was 861,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $860/oz,
compared to 928,000oz at $920/oz in the first quarter of 2015. The lower output from the
continuing operations was due mainly to planned reductions from Obuasi, Tropicana and
Morila mines, as well as an unanticipated drop in production from the Kibali joint venture.

Production from South Africa remained relatively flat year-on-year at 236,000oz, with safety-
related stoppages remaining a disrupting factor. AISC, however, improved by 16%, to
$919/oz. Mponeng, the flagship South African mine, improved its production by 34% year-
on-year.

Total output of 625,000oz from the International Operations was lower due to the sale of the
Cripple Creek & Victor Mine, which was sold in June of last year and contributed 41,000oz in
the first quarter of 2015, whilst Obuasi, where production has been halted, contributed
17,000oz in that period. AISC for the International Portfolio improved from $836/oz in the first
quarter of last year, to $822/oz in the three months to March 31 of this year.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) was
$378m, compared to $402m in the previous year, reflecting a 3% decline in the realised gold
price and reduced production.

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA levels ended the quarter at 1.47 times, lower than the 2.02
times recorded in the corresponding period last year. Accordingly, debt levels remain well
below the covenant of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.5 times under the company’s
revolving credit agreements, further underlining the success of the decisive, deleveraging
efforts.

SAFETY

Regrettably, there was a fatality at TauTona during the quarter, indicating that there remains
much room for improvement. Work continues on the search for innovative ways to reach our
ultimate goal of zero harm in the workplace. Despite this setback, there were some notable
safety successes, including both Mponeng and the Vaal River operations each reaching one
million fatality free shifts, while Continental Africa recorded not a single lost-time injury during
the quarter.


OUTLOOK

The outlook for the full year remains unchanged as follows: production between 3.6Moz to
3.8Moz; total cash costs between $680/oz and $720/oz and AISC between $900/oz and
$960/oz, assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of 15.00 (Rand), 4.00
(Brazil Real), 0.70 (Aus$) and 14.90 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $35/bl average for the year,
based on market expectations. The impact of the Savuka section of Tau Tona seismic event
on 29 April 2016, is still being evaluated and assessed.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

First quarter overview

AngloGold Ashanti delivered another consistent operating and financial performance for the first quarter of 2016, with a
further reduction in debt levels, and solid levels of free cash generation despite weaker production in the period. The
result was also achieved despite lower grades, which were offset by tonnage improvements in key areas.

Free cash flow for the first quarter of the year was $70m, a strong improvement to the free cash outflow of $40m in the
first quarter of 2015. Cash inflow from operating activities was positive at $227m, 19% more than the $190m achieved in
the first quarter of 2015, despite both lower production and a lower gold price received. The strong performance
was due mainly to strong cost management and benefits from weaker local currencies against the US dollar,
principally in South Africa and Brazil. This is lower when compared to the $383m cash inflow from operating
activities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to working capital movements and lower production.

Production was 861,000oz at an average total cash cost of $702/oz, compared to 969,000oz at $734/oz in the first
quarter of 2015, which included 41,000oz from the Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) mine, which was sold last year,
and 17,000oz from the Obuasi mine, which has now ceased production. While production from South Africa remained
relatively flat year-on-year at 236,000oz, production from the International operations was lower due to the
abovementioned CC & V sale and cessation of stockpile production from the Obuasi mine, as well as lower-grade
production from the Tropicana mine. At Kibali, challenges were encountered whilst ramping up both streams to run on
sulphides as per the design specification, resulting in a drop in recoveries. This was compounded by a bearing failure
on one of the ball mills. Costs improved relative to the first quarter of last year, benefitting from continued traction
from cost saving initiatives and weaker local currencies, which helped offset increases at Tropicana and Kibali.

""We again generated significant free cash flow despite the lower gold price, which shows the continued success of our 
self-help measures to reduce debt by improving margins,"" Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer of 
AngloGold Ashanti, said. ""Notwithstanding our strong cost performance, we're redoubling our efforts to ensure we continue 
to capture as much margin as possible.""

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $860/oz, a 7% improvement year-on-year, which reflects, among other improvements,
a 4% year-on-year reduction in total cash costs, 18% lower sustaining capital expenditure and a 38% reduction in
corporate and marketing costs. All-in costs were 8% lower at $924/oz.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities and discontinued operations) during the first quarter was
$128m, compared with $195m (including $27m for CC&V) in the first quarter of 2015, and $223m in the fourth
quarter of 2015. Of the total capital spent, project capital expenditure during the quarter amounted to $19m. Capital
expenditure at continuing operations is expected to increase, particularly over the next two quarters, with slower-than-
anticipated spending in South Africa in the first quarter of the year, principally due the Easter public holidays resulting
in fewer working days.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) were $378m, compared with
$402m in the first quarter of 2015, mainly due to lower earnings as a result of a 3% decline in the realised gold price
from $1,217/oz to $1,185/oz and an 8% reduction in ounces sold over this period. Adjusted EBITDA for the previous
quarter was $388m.

At the end of the first quarter of 2016, net debt was lower at $2.127bn compared to $2.190bn in the previous quarter
and $3.150bn for the same quarter a year ago mainly due to the generation of free cash flow, the proceeds from the
sale of CC&V completed in August 2015, and the subsequent partial tender offer for the 8.5% high yield bonds due in
2020. This reduction in debt has resulted in a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.47 times, compared with 2.02
times at the end of March 2015. Accordingly, debt levels remain well below the covenant of net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA of 3.5 times under our revolving credit agreements.

The outlook for the full year remains unchanged as follows:
    -    Production between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz
    -    Total cash costs between $680/oz and $720/oz and
    -    All-in sustaining costs between $900/oz and $960/oz,
assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of 15.00 (Rand), 4.00 (Brazil Real), 0.70 (Aus$) and
14.90 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $35/bl average for the year, based on market expectations. The impact of the
Savuka section of Tau Tona seismic event on 29 April 2016, is still being evaluated and assessed.

Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $790m and $850m. Corporate and marketing costs are estimated to
be between $75m and $90m, and expensed exploration and study costs ( including equity accounted investments)
are estimated to be $130m to $150m. Depreciation and amortisation is forecast at $820m and interest and finance
costs are expected to be $190m (income statement) and $175m (cash flow statement).

Safety update

Regrettably, there was a fatality at TauTona mine during the quarter. Section 54 safety stoppages, whereby the entire
operation is shutdown to remediate safety concern, continued to be a source of disruption in South Africa. AngloGold
Ashanti continues to engage with the regulator to find an outcome that will help make further improvements in safety in the
most sustainable and practical way possible.

Subsequent to the quarter-end, on 29 April 2016, regrettably there were two fatalities at the Savuka section of Tau Tona 
following a series of seismic events.

There were some notable safety successes, including both Mponeng and the Vaal River operations each reaching one-
million shifts without a fatality, whilst our Continental Africa recorded not a single lost-time injury in the three months
through March. Both Continental Africa and the Americas recorded significant safety gains, with AIFR better by 72% and
36% respectively, compared with the end of last year.

The all-injury frequency rate was at 8.44 per million hours worked, compared with 7.66 in the same quarter last year.

Operating highlights

The South Africa region produced 236,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz for the quarter ended March 2016 compared
to 239,000oz at a total cash cost of $911/oz for the quarter ended March 2015. Production for the quarter was adversely
impacted by a slow start up post the Christmas holidays, the Easter long weekend which fell in March this year, and
ongoing safety-related stoppages across all operations which continue to affect production. Mponeng showed a strong 
recovery, with production up by more than a third to 59,000oz, and all-in sustaining costs down 28% to $930/oz. 

South Africa's total cash cost was down 14% compared to the same quarter last year, benefitting from the weaker
exchange rate despite lower volumes, higher wages and power prices and re-instatement of Moab Khotsong employees 
(who are part of the Association of Mining Construction Union (AMCU)) following the Labour Court ruling at the
end of last year.

The Continental Africa region produced 305,000oz at a total cash cost of $719/oz for the quarter ended March 2016
compared to 351,000oz at a total cash cost of $714/oz for the quarter ended March 2015. At Kibali, the plan to ramp up
treatment of harder sulphide ore saw challenges resulting in lower recovered grades and production. Morila's production 
was 14,000oz lower in line with the mine plan. The Obuasi mine produced 16,000oz less year-on-year given the conclusion 
of production from stockpiled material. Despite lower production, the region saw strong cost management due to ongoing 
initiatives targeted at maintaining or lowering direct operating costs and input costs, particularly fuel.

The Americas region produced 196,000oz at a total cash cost of $516/oz for the quarter ended March 2016 compared to
195,000oz at a total cash cost of $603/oz for the quarter ended March 2015. The region delivered a solid performance as
a result of a marginal increased contribution from Brazil while Argentina production remained stable.

Brazil's production increase was mainly driven by a 6% improvement in output from the Serra Grande mine compared to
the same quarter last year, due to both higher tonnage and feed grade from mining high grade blocks at Mina III and
Pequisão. At Mineração, Córrego do Sítio delivered stable performance from both the oxide and sulphide operations,
while Cuiabá mine was affected due to delayed access to certain high grade stopes at Serrotinho L7, given geo-technical
and ground support issues. These are being addressed and we expect to catch up and recover lost production in coming
quarters.

Americas' total cash cost was down 14% compared to the same quarter last year driven by continued strong cost
management and saving initiatives and the depreciation of the local currencies against the US dollar, despite
unfavourable inventory movements and inflationary pressure. In Argentina, costs were also favourably impacted by export
benefits (reimbursement from the Government for exports channeled through Patagonia ports) and higher by-product
sold, partially offset by salary increases in February as agreed with the union, the union strike in January and higher heap
leaching costs and higher amortisation from stripping assets.

In Australia, production was 124,000oz at a total cash cost of $814/oz for the quarter ended March 2016 compared to
143,000oz at a total cash cost of $679/oz for the quarter ended March 2015. Australia's total cash cost increased by 20%
compared to the same quarter last year mainly due to lower production as well as movements in stockpiles inventory.

Tropicana's lower production during the quarter was due to a 21% decrease in the head grade, consistent with the mine
plan and the mine's grade streaming strategy. Production was also impacted by mining schedule delays, which
contributed to lower head grades from the Havana pit with some benches deferred to the second quarter. In addition, it is
expected that approximately 300,000t of stockpiled ore will be used in coming quarters to supplement the mill feed while
the waste stripping of the Tropicana Pit cutback is being carried out.

At Sunrise Dam, costs were favourably impacted by inventory movement and higher production, while at Tropicana
stockpile inventory movements accounted for $120/oz, consistent with the mine plan.

Corporate update

AngloGold Ashanti rating action by Standard & Poor's Rating

AngloGold Ashanti confirms that Standard & Poor's Rating Agency has affirmed on 25 April 2016 AngloGold Ashanti's BB+
long-term corporate credit rating and revised the outlook to stable from negative.

S&P cited the reduction in debt and increasing local currency gold prices as reasons for the increase in earnings, cash
flows, liquidity, and credit metrics for AngloGold Ashanti. The stable outlook reflects S&P's expectation that AngloGold
Ashanti can maintain core credit metrics at the higher end of their intermediate category.

S&P further raised the short-term national scale rating to 'zaA-1' from 'zaA-2' and their long-term national scale rating on
the subordinated medium-term note program to 'zaA-' from 'zaBBB+'.

Obuasi Update

Despite AngloGold Ashanti Ghana's repeated attempts to have Ghanaian authorities restore law and order at the idled
Obuasi mine, the security situation on site continues to deteriorate. Faced with increasing lawlessness, trespassing,
damage to property and threat to the personal safety of its employees, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana has been forced to turn
to the remedy, provided for in its Mining Lease, to protect and enforce its contractual rights.

Accordingly, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) on Friday, 8 April 2016. The case was registered on 2 May 2016. ICSID is an international
arbitration institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., which facilitates dispute resolution between international
investors and host states. The relevant authorities in Ghana have been duly notified of the commencement of proceedings.

In the interests of safety, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana in February withdrew employees performing non-essential functions
from the Obuasi mine, following the incursion of illegal miners inside the fenced areas of the site. Remaining employees
have been performing critical tasks related to maintenance of the site, and also water treatment, provision of medical
services and maintenance of electrical facilities that provide power and water to employees' homes and surrounding
communities.

There has been no impact on AngloGold Ashanti's production and AISC as the site was not forecast to be in production 
for at least this year.

The incursion by illegal miners followed the withdrawal of government military protection from the mine on Tuesday,
2 February 2016, after initial incursions on 30 and 31 January 2016. The Ghana Army has a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Chamber of Mines, on behalf of its members, to deploy military personnel at mining operations.

Since February, AngloGold Ashanti has engaged on numerous occasions with Cabinet ministers of Ghana including the
Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, as well as other senior government officials. Despite these engagements, and
the fact that His Excellency the President of Ghana directed the return of security agencies in March, law and order is yet to
be restored.

The Company informed local authorities through a declaration of Force Majeure, that under the current situation
it may be constrained from fulfilling certain conditions of its Amended Programme of Mining Operations, the permit that
covers current activities at Obuasi mine. If allowed to continue unchecked, this illegal mining and vandalism of property
taking place on parts of the concession, gravely threaten the long-term viability of the mine and AngloGold Ashanti Ghana's
ability to continue its feasibility study and maintain critical services

AngloGold Ashanti Ghana hopes this next step of ICSID arbitration will provide for reinstatement of safety and security at
Obuasi mine.

Publication of Draft Mining Charter

AngloGold Ashanti notes the publication by South Africa's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), on Friday,
15 April 2016, of the draft Reviewed Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Charter for the South African Mining and
Minerals Industry 2016. The document, also known as the Mining Charter, is open for comments and representations for 
30 days after publication.

AngloGold Ashanti is currently analysing the provisions contained in the document. AngloGold Ashanti had no input into its
contents, prior its publication. AngloGold Ashanti, along with its industry peers, through the Chamber of Mines of South
Africa, will engage with the Minister of Mineral Resources (the Minister) and the DMR, to provide comments and
representations as requested by the Minister.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI LIMITED PROVIDES UPDATE ON OBUASI SECURITY SITUATION


(JOHANNESBURG – NEWS RELEASE) – Despite AngloGold Ashanti Ghana’s repeated attempts to have
Ghanaian authorities restore law and order at the Obuasi mine, the security situation on site continues to
deteriorate. To protect and enforce its contractual rights in the face of increasing lawlessness, trespass,
damage to property and threats to the safety of its employees, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana has been forced to
invoke the dispute resolution provisions in its Mining Lease.

Accordingly, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on Friday, 8 April 2016. The case was registered on Monday,
2 May 2016. ICSID is an international arbitration institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., which
facilitates dispute resolution between international investors and host states. The relevant authorities in
Ghana, including the Attorney General, have been duly notified of the commencement of proceedings.

In early February 2016, following the incursion of hundreds of illegal miners inside the fenced area of the
site, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana was forced to declare force majeure and, in the interests of safety, withdrew
all employees performing non-essential functions from the Obuasi mine (the mine). Remaining employees
have been performing critical services related to the operation of underground water pumping,
environmental and potable water treatment, provision of medical services, and maintenance of facilities that
provide power and water to employees’ homes and surrounding communities.

There has been no impact on AngloGold Ashanti’s production and All-In Sustaining Costs as the site was
not forecast to be in production for at least this year.

The incursion by illegal miners followed the withdrawal of military protection from the mine on Tuesday,
2 February 2016, after initial incursions on 30 and 31 January 2016. The military had been stationed at the
mine since 2013 on directions from the Ghanaian government in order to maintain law and order at the site.
To this effect, a services agreement is in place between AngloGold Ashanti Ghana and the Ghana Army.
Additionally, the Chamber of Mines, on behalf of its members, has entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Ghana Army, to support mine security and police through the deployment of military
personnel at mining operations in the country.

Since February 2016, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana has engaged on numerous occasions with Ghana Cabinet
ministers including the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, the Minister of Defence, and other senior
government officials. Despite these engagements, and the fact that His Excellency the President of Ghana
directed the return of security agencies in March, law and order is yet to be restored.

In its declaration of force majeure, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana explained that the current situation is
precluding it from fulfilling certain conditions of its Amended Programme of Mining Operations, which was
agreed with the government in November 2014. In particular, the presence of illegal miners on the mine’s
operational footprint, in its underground tunnels and in areas which host key infrastructure at the mine is
impacting directly on AngloGold Ashanti Ghana’s ability to continue to perform even the most essential
services referred to above, including the treatment of water for pollutants. If allowed to continue unchecked,
this occupation of the lease area by illegal miners significantly undermines investor confidence and gravely
threatens the long-term viability of the mine, as AngloGold Ashanti Ghana may be forced to withdraw all
essential personnel currently on site, including personnel operating the mine’s underground water pumps,
and suspend critical services to the mine and community.

AngloGold Ashanti Ghana hopes that the commencement of ICSID proceedings will expedite the
reinstatement of law and order at the mine.



Background/ Notes to Editors

AngloGold Ashanti Ghana suspended underground mining operations at the Obuasi Mine at the end of 2014
after incurring heavy (and ultimately unaffordable) financial losses over several years. Employees were paid
a severance as mandated by law and in accordance with relevant Collective Agreements and Employment
Contracts. Despite a very difficult market for the global mining industry, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana continues
to invest significant time, skill and financial resources in building the case for the Obuasi mine’s
redevelopment into a much needed, long-term contributor to the local, regional and national economies.
Since the suspension of operations, Obuasi has been in a government-approved limited operations phase,
whilst AngloGold Ashanti Ghana conducts the feasibility study needed to determine whether the mine can
be redeveloped into a profitable, productive operation that can once again be a significant employer and
contributor to the local, regional and national economies in Ghana.

     limit of the number of AngloGold Ashanti ordinary shares to be utilised for purposes of the Share
     Incentive Schemes
     In light of the redesign of incentive structures discussed in the 2015 remuneration report, the Board has
     decided on a transitional approach, within the framework of the current scheme, to address outstanding
     incentive obligations. Any new incentive scheme that involves shares will be submitted to shareholders
     for approval, when finalised. The Board of the Company, therefore, withdrew ordinary resolution 5 from
     the business to be considered and voted upon by the shareholders.

AngloGold Ashanti confirms that Standard & Poor’s Rating Agency (S&P) has affirmed AngloGold
Ashanti’s BB+ long-term corporate credit rating and revised the outlook to stable from negative.

S&P cited the reduction in debt and increasing local currency gold prices as reasons for the increase
in earnings, cash flows, liquidity, and credit metrics for AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. The stable outlook
reflects S&P’s expectation that AngloGold Ashanti can maintain core credit metrics at the higher end
of their intermediate category.

S&P further raised the short-term national scale rating to 'zaA-1' from 'zaA-2' and their long-term
national scale rating on the subordinated medium-term note program to 'zaA-' from 'zaBBB+'.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Has $160m Q4 Free Cash Flow, Cuts Net Debt 30%

(JOHANNESBURG – PRESS RELEASE) -- AngloGold Ashanti today said it cut net debt by
almost a third last year after margins increased despite lower gold prices, and the company
generated free cash flow of $160m in the fourth quarter.

AngloGold Ashanti delivered on a range of self-help measures last year to reduce debt using
internally generated funds, without diluting shareholders. The Cripple Creek & Victor mine in the
US was sold for $820m plus a royalty, and most of the proceeds were used to buy back a portion
of the company's most expensive debt. At the same time, a strong performance from the
company's international mines helped expand margins even as gold prices fell.

""We've again shown consistency in hitting our production guidance, beating cost estimates,
delivering free cash flow and delivering a sharp reduction in net debt levels,"" Chief Executive
Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""We achieved all of that despite lower gold prices.""

Net debt fell by 30% to $2.19bn from $3.13bn at the end of 2014, lowering the amount the
company will pay in interest charges. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) improved to an average of
$910/oz in 2015, more than 11% lower than the $1,020/oz recorded the previous year, and lower
than guidance of $950/oz to $980/oz. Production of 3.95Moz was at the top end of guidance of
3.8Moz to 4.0Moz.

AngloGold Ashanti has for 12 consecutive quarters either met, or beaten, its cost and production
guidance.

The significant year-on-year improvement in AISC reflects an especially strong showing from the
International Operations, which saw their AISC for the year fall by more than 16% to $822/oz.
Geita was once again a standout performer in Continental Africa, with AISC of $717/oz, whilst the
American operations as a whole had AISC of $792/oz.

The robust performance of the International Operations once again offset a drop in output at the
South African operations to 1.004Moz, from 1.22Moz in 2014, due mainly to a combination of
lower grades and safety-related disruptions during the year. The full-year AISC of $1,088/oz at the
South Africa operations was $24/oz higher than the previous year, reflecting the weaker operating
performance, which was only partially offset by the weaker Rand. The fourth quarter showed an
improving trend, however, with the South African operations reporting AISC of $988/oz.

AngloGold Ashanti's costs also benefit from weaker currencies relative to the dollar in South
Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Australia, where the Rand, peso, real and Australian dollar often

weaken along with the gold price, cushioning the blow. Together, these regions account for about
two-thirds of production. Lower prices for oil also benefit the company given that diesel is used to
power generators and fleet at many of the company's operations.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) for the full
year was $1,472m, compared to $1,616m in 2014, reflecting lower production year-on-year and
weaker average price received. Free cash flow for the full year improved to $141m compared with
an outflow of $112m in 2014. This achievement was all the more noteworthy given that it occurred
despite the 8% drop in the gold price.

Net debt to adjusted EBITDA levels ended the year at 1.49 times, lower than the 1.94 times
recorded at the end of 2014, highlighting the success of the decisive, deleveraging efforts.

SAFETY

Eleven of our colleagues lost their lives in the workplace during 2015, underlining safety as the
most pressing challenge for the company, primarily at its South African operations. Significant
effort is being expended to not only understand the cause of each of these incidents, but also the
root cause of other high potential incidents that could have resulted in fatalities. There has been
some success in this regard, with the all-injury frequency rate, the broadest measure of workplace
safety, improving to 7.18 per million hours worked, from 7.36 the previous year.

FOURTH QUARTER

AngloGold Ashanti delivered another strong operating and financial result for the three months
ended 31 December 2015 ahead of cost and production guidance despite safety-related
stoppages that lowered output in South Africa. Fourth quarter production of 997,000oz was 14%
lower than the corresponding period in 2014 but 2% better than the prior quarter and better than
guidance of 900,000oz-950,000oz. AISC of $860/oz were 14% better than the corresponding
period in 2014, reflecting rigorous cost and capital allocation discipline across the company.

South Africa started to show a modest recovery from its operational challenges related principally
to safety disruptions in the first three quarters of the year. Whilst production was 16% lower than
the corresponding period in 2014, it was – as previously flagged -- consistent with the third quarter
at 252,000oz. AISC of $988/oz was 10% better than the fourth quarter of 2014, and 16% better
than the previous quarter. The International Operations delivered production of 745,000oz at AISC
of $786/oz, which corresponded to a 7% decrease in production but a 17% improvement in AISC
on the same quarter of 2014.

OUTLOOK

Production guidance for 2016 year is estimated to be between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz. Total cash costs
are estimated to be between $680/oz and $720/oz and all-in sustaining costs between $900/oz
and $960/oz at average exchange rates against the US dollar of 15.00 (Rand), 4.00 (Brazil Real),
0.70 (Aus $) and 14.90 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $35/bl average for the year.

Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $790m and $850m, of which $120m to $140m is
earmarked for projects. Corporate and marketing costs are estimated to be between $75m and
$90m and expensed exploration and study costs including equity accounted investments at $130m
to $150m. Depreciation and amortisation is forecast at $820m and interest and finance costs are
expected to be $190m (income statement) and $175m (cash flow statement).

Outlook data is forward-looking information, which is further discussed at the end of this release.

materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and
operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending
or future litigation proceedings, and business and operational risk management.

For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2014, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (""SEC"") on 2 April 2015. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the

Financial and Operating Report

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
FULL YEAR REVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid operating and financial performance for 2015 as it delivered on its ‘self-help' measures to reduce
debt from internally generated cash flows. The results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 show the combination of a strong ongoing
focus on cost and capital discipline, as well as the operational leverage the company has to weaker currencies and lower oil prices.

Free cash flow of $141m was recorded for the full year, compared with the outflow of $112m in the prior year, despite lower output and
a weaker gold price. Cash inflows from operating activities of $1,139m for the year ended 31 December 2015 were only 7% lower than
the $1,220m achieved in the prior year, despite an 8% decrease in gold price received and an 11% decrease in production (including
discontinued operations).

Borrowings decreased by 26% to $2.74bn from $3.72bn at the end of 2014 and net debt fell by 30% to $2.19bn from $3.13bn at the end
of 2014, aided by the sale of CC&V for $819m, as well as tight cost management, which saw full year all-in sustaining costs (AISC)
improve by 11% to $910/oz and cost of sales decrease by 17% to $3,294m.

""We've again shown consistency in hitting our production guidance, beating cost estimates, delivering free cash flow and delivering a 
sharp reduction in net debt levels,"" Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. ""We achieved all of that despite lower 
gold prices.""

The 11% decrease in production over 2014 levels to 3.95Moz (including discontinued operations), was due in part to lower output from
South Africa following safety related disruptions, the sale of CC&V on 3 August 2015 and the transition of Obuasi to limited operations
at the end of 2014. AISC improved 11% over the same period to $910/oz. This compared favourably with revised guidance for the full
year of 3.8Moz to 4.0Moz at an AISC of $950/oz to $980/oz. The significant year-on-year improvement in AISC reflects an especially
strong delivery from the International Operations which saw their AISC fall by more than 16% to $822/oz. Geita was once again a
standout performer in Continental Africa, with AISC of $717/oz, whilst the American operations as a whole had AISC of $792/oz,
benefiting from strong fundamental performances combined with a tailwind from weakening currencies, particularly in Brazil. The South
African operations struggled due to a combination of lower grades and several safety-related disruptions during the year which resulted
in a drop in production to 1.004Moz from 1.22Moz in 2014. The South African operations reported AISC of $1,088/oz, $24/oz or 2%
higher than the previous year, reflecting the weaker operating performance which was only partially offset by the weaker Rand.

The company's cost performance reflected improvements in several key areas including direct operating costs, corporate overheads,
exploration expenses and capital expenditure. The Project 500 initiative, launched in mid-2013 to save $500m in direct operating costs
over 18 months, has surpassed that target and has now been embedded in the International Operations as an ongoing business
improvement initiative. The Project 500 team is in the beginning phases of implementing a range of efficiency initiatives at the South
African operations in 2016.

Capital expenditure of $857m, which came in below the revised guidance for the year of approximately $900m, represented a 29%
decrease compared to $1.2bn in the prior year. This reduction was partially due to favourable exchange rate movements in South
Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Australia, as well as planning and design changes at certain sites and fundamental cost savings. Total
cash costs of $712/oz improved 9% compared to $785/oz recorded in 2014 and better than revised guidance of $720/oz to $770/oz. Corporate
and marketing costs of $78m were 15% lower year-on-year and below guidance of $95m to $110m, while exploration and evaluation
costs of $132m were 7% lower year-on-year and below guidance of $155m to $175m.

The full year ended with an adjusted headline earnings (AHE) of $49m, or 12 US cents per share, compared with an adjusted headline
loss of $1m in 2014. The net loss attributable to equity shareholders for the year was $85m compared with a loss of $58m a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) was $1,472m, compared to $1,616m in 2014
reflecting the lower production and average price received. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA levels ended the year at 1.49 times, lower than
the 1.94 times recorded at the end of 2014, highlighting the success of the deleveraging efforts.

Liquidity remains strong, with $800m available on the US dollar revolving credit facility (RCF), along with A$365m undrawn on the
Australian dollar RCF, approximately R2.4bn available from its South African RCF and cash and cash
equivalents of $484m as at 31 December 2015.

SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY

Safety remains the most pressing challenge for our South African operations, particularly following a regression in performance after a
strong record in 2014. Eleven of our colleagues lost their lives in the workplace during 2015, from six the previous year. Significant effort
is being expended to not only understand the cause of each of these incidents, but also the root cause of other high potential incidents
that could have resulted in fatalities. There has been some success in this regard, with the all-injury frequency rate, the broadest
measure of workplace safety, improving to 7.18 per million hours worked, from 7.36 the previous year. In addition, reportable
environmental incidents were the lowest recorded in the company's history and the company continues to invest considerable resources
to maintain and improve relationships with host communities and governments.

FOURTH-QUARTER REVIEW

The fourth quarter of 2015 saw a robust operating and financial performance, with the continued focus on fundamental cost
management aided by weakening currencies across key jurisdictions. Production was ahead of guidance and total cash costs were
below guidance resulting in strong free cash flow generation and a marked reduction in net debt, despite the lower gold price.

Free cash flow generation of $160m for the quarter ($34m due to lower taxation and taxation refunds, $67m due to working capital
inflows) compared favourably with a $198m outflow in the same quarter last year and an outflow of $50m in the third quarter of 2015.
Net cash inflows from operating activities of $383m represented an 80% increase compared to the $213m generated in the fourth
quarter of 2014, with strong cost control across all metrics helping offset the weaker gold price. The successful tender offer for the high-
yield bond in September, undertaken to repay part of the 8.5% bonds due 2020 ahead of schedule, resulted in a 28% decrease in
finance costs year-on-year from $61m in the fourth quarter of 2014, to $44m in the period under review.

Borrowings decreased by $25m, or 1%, to $2,737m and net debt decreased by $101m, or 4%, to $2,190m during the quarter ended
31 December 2015. This does not equate exactly to the free cash flow generation because the long-term natural-gas offtake contracts
in Australia (related to the new pipeline that is expected to deliver energy to both Sunrise Dam and Tropicana) are treated as debt in
accordance with accounting standards. This was effected during the fourth quarter. The reduction in debt resulted in a net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.49 times, compared with 1.54 times at the end of September 2015. Accordingly, debt levels remain well
below the covenant of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.5 times under our revolving credit agreements.

Group production was 997,000oz at an average total cash cost of $663/oz, compared to 974,000oz (including discontinued operations)
at $735/oz the previous quarter and 1.156Moz at $715/oz in the fourth quarter of 2014. Production guidance for the quarter (which took
into account the lower production following the CC&V sale), was 900,000oz to 950,000oz at a total cash cost of $720/oz to $770/oz.

AISC for the group in the fourth quarter was $860/oz, a 14% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting improved
production from some operations, ongoing cost and capital allocation discipline and the positive impact of lower oil prices - particularly in
Continental Africa and Australia -- as well as weaker currencies in South Africa, Brazil and Australia. All-in costs were 13% lower than
the corresponding quarter in 2014, at $959/oz.

Adjusted EBITDA was $388m, a 3% decrease compared to $402m in the fourth quarter of 2014, despite the 8% decline in the average
gold price received from $1,202/oz to $1,104/oz, and a 13% reduction in ounces sold over this period. Adjusted EBITDA for the previous
quarter was $291m.

Fourth-quarter AHE was $40m, or 10 US cents per share, in the three months ended to 31 December 2015, compared with a negative
$52m, or 13 US cents per share, the previous quarter, and a negative $117m, or 29 US cents per share a year earlier in the fourth
quarter of 2014. The improvement in AHE compared to the fourth quarter last year was due to lower AISC with the benefit of weaker
local currencies and cost saving initiatives, non-recurring Obuasi redundancy costs in 2014, finance cost reductions with the partial
take-out of the high yield bond and part repayment of the Australian dollar RCF, partially offset by the 8% lower gold price and lower
production.

Profit attributable to equity shareholders from continuing operations for the period of $65m compared with a loss of $40m in the fourth
quarter of 2014.

The International operations continued to deliver year-on-year cost reductions in the three months to 31 December 2015, delivering a
17% drop in AISC at $786/oz, compared with $948/oz in the fourth quarter of 2014. This performance was led by the Americas, which
reported a 31% year-on-year improvement in AISC to $684/oz.

South Africa started to show a modest recovery from its operational challenges related principally to safety disruptions in the first three
quarters of the year. Whilst production was little changed from the third quarter at 252,000oz, AISC of $988/oz was 10% better than the
fourth quarter of 2014, and 16% better than the previous quarter.

Weaker local currencies against the US dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 contributed to the
reduction in group operating costs as our currency basket depreciated against the US dollar as follows (average values over the
quarter): the South African Rand by 27%, the Australian Dollar by 19%, the Brazilian Real by 51% and the Argentina Peso by 19%. All,
with the exception of the Australian Dollar, have continued to weaken relative to the US dollar since the end of 2015.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted entities and discontinued operations) during the fourth quarter of 2015 was $223m,
compared with $363m (includes $50m for CC&V) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $207m in the previous quarter. This 39% decrease
reflects greater efficiencies, rescheduling of some expenditures, the positive impact of weaker currencies against the US dollar and
lower capital requirements at Kibali and Obuasi. Of the total capital spent, project capital expenditure during the quarter amounted to
$44m. Capital expenditure was 8% higher in the last quarter of the year, compared to the third quarter mainly due to normal seasonal
patterns of investment at our operations, and slower-than-anticipated spending in South Africa, principally due to safety stoppages.

CORPORATE UPDATE

On 21 December 2015, AngloGold Ashanti announced the termination of the conditional Investment Agreement concluded in
September 2015 with Randgold Resources, for a joint venture to redevelop the Obuasi Mine. The proposed investment did not meet
Randgold's investment criteria. This decision followed concerted efforts by both companies to improve the project's returns and also to
secure an appropriate set of consents from the Government of Ghana, within an ambitious timeframe that would have allowed for a
feasibility decision on the redevelopment of the mine in early 2016. Although improvements were identified, these were not sufficient for
Randgold to commit to a substantial investment under the prevailing conditions.

Appointment of deputy Chief Operating Officer - International

The International Operations team, under the stewardship of Ron Largent since 2012, has performed with distinction in the most
challenging set of market conditions this company has faced. In fact, these operations have set new benchmarks for safety and
consistently met or exceeded targets on production, costs and cash flow, ranking among the top suite of assets in the global gold mining
industry.

The International portfolio has a wide spread of influence and is clearly crucial to AngloGold Ashanti's future. Ron's team has now sets
its sights on a new set of challenges, most notably building on the resounding success of the Project 500 initiatives by driving
operational excellence and identifying and implementing the next round of sustainable improvements, in order to stay ahead of our peer
group. With these factors in mind, Helcio Guerra, currently Senior Vice President: Americas region, has been appointed Deputy Chief
Operating Officer: International, effective 1 February 2016. Helcio joined AngloGold Ashanti from a diversified major mining company
more than seven years ago, and has worked closely with Ron since then.

Helcio will for the coming months continue with his accountabilities for the Americas Region and appoint his successor in the second half
of this year. His additional accountabilities in the new role will include operational effectiveness planning and implementation for all
assets in the International Portfolio, business planning and the budget process.

Change to half-yearly reporting

Consistent with the majority of South African domiciled mining companies, AngloGold Ashanti has decided to move to half-yearly
reporting. This will result in the disclosures for the three-month periods ending 31 March and 30 September consisting of abbreviated
selected operational and financial data. The six-month periods ending 30 June and 31 December will be prepared in terms of IAS 34
(Interim Financial reporting) on a basis similar to the process adopted for interim reporting in prior years.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The South African operations saw a decline in the operational performance in 2015, predominantly due to safety related stoppages
resulting in production loss of 112,800oz for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the region produced 252,000oz at a total cash
cost of $776/oz compared to the 300,000oz at a total cash cost of $830/oz during the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower volumes were a
result of the gradual resumption of operations after safety related stoppages experienced at the end of the third quarter. In the West
Wits, Mponeng was most severely affected by the de-risk plan to reduce the mining rate of extraction to address seismicity and
ventilation constraints above 120L. Access to the higher-grade levels below the 120 level was still pending as at the end of the fourth
quarter. AISC for the quarter were $988/oz, compared to $1,097/oz achieved in the same quarter a year ago. Despite inflationary
pressures, year-on-year cost variations reflect cost savings derived from the Project 500 initiative (P500) particularly around labour,
consumables and energy, and weaker exchange rates.

At West Wits, production was 428,000oz at a total cash cost of $879/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to 544,000oz
at a total cash cost of $804/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014 and 113,000oz at a total cash cost of $759/oz for the quarter
ended 31 December 2015 compared to 119,000oz at a total cash cost of $864/oz for the quarter ended 31 December 2014. Whilst
Mponeng's year-on-year performance was impacted by safety-related production stoppages as well as delays faced during the year due
to de-risking of the operation, production for the quarter improved by 9% and total cash costs were down 24% compared to the fourth
quarter of 2014 due to improved production performance and less disruptions, in addition to the benefit of weaker currency exchange
rate. The cost optimisation process is ongoing with some savings on labour management, contractor management and power
efficiencies achieved to date. TauTona was negatively impacted by a safety stoppage in the previous quarter whereby a seismic related
fall-of-ground accident occurred on the 16th September in the 120 level main haulage leading to a slow ramp-up to normalised
production rates during the fourth quarter.

At the Vaal River district production was 371,000oz at a total cash cost of $867/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to
453,000oz at a total cash cost of $857/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Safety stoppages in the district adversely impacted the
mining mix due to equipping delays and lack of access to higher-grade areas. Head grade dropped by 11% year-on-year due to
increased dilution in 2015 resulting from an increase in mining widths. Despite the operational challenges and inflationary pressures,
Moab's total cash costs increased by only 4% year-on-year to $714/oz due to savings achieved from labour reductions following the integration of
Great Noligwa mine with Moab Khotsong mine.

Surface Operations for the year ended December 2015 produced 193,000oz at a total cash cost of $912/oz, compared to 223,000oz at
a total cash cost of $941/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. The decline in production is mainly the result of a reduction in
grades in the marginal ore dumps (MOD) material. In an attempt to mitigate this, a project was commissioned at the end of November to
screen material ahead of the plant. The P500 project cost savings achieved are expected to continue during 2016 in an endeavour to
further improve efficiencies. At Mine Waste Solutions, the Uranium Flotation circuit was temporarily suspended during the fourth quarter
to troubleshoot and implement necessary improvements given that these units did not operate at the expected efficiencies. It is
anticipated that the plants will resume operations during the first half of 2016.

The Continental Africa region produced 1.435Moz at a total cash cost of $678/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to
1.597Moz at a total cash cost of $783/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. The AISC was $815/oz for the year ended
31 December 2015, a 16% decline from $968/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kibali produced 289,000oz attributable to AngloGold Ashanti at a total cash cost of $609/oz
for the year ended 31 December 2015, compared to the 237,000oz at a total cash cost of $578oz for the year ended 31 December
2014. Production was 22% higher as a result of 23% higher tonnage throughput in the second year of full production at the mine, as
plant operations ramped up to design capacity. Total cash costs were 5% higher than the previous year as a result of commissioning of
the underground mining operations, partially offset by the small increase in head grade milled. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Kibali's
production was 69,000oz at a total cash cost of $603/oz compared to the 80,000oz at a total cash cost of $546/oz during the fourth
quarter of 2014. Despite consistent plant operations and continued ramp-up of the mine, production for the quarter was 14% lower as a
result of a planned 11% decrease in recovered grade partly offset by 2% higher tonnage throughput. Different ore types and particularly
the transition material in the Mengu Hill open pit continued to present recovery challenges, but as the pit deepens and the ore feed
stabilises, recovery is expected to improve.

In Ghana, Iduapriem produced 193,000oz at a total cash cost of $995/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to the
177,000oz at a total cash cost of $865oz for the year ended 31 December 2014, reflecting strong performance towards the latter part of
the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Iduapriem's production increased by 40% year-on-year to 56,000oz as a result of a planned
42% increase in recovered grade due to treatment of higher-grade ore compared with the prior year when lower-grade stockpiles were
treated. Total cash costs consequently decreased by 8%, with the beneficial impact of higher gold production partly offset by higher
mining costs.

In the Republic of Guinea, Siguiri produced 255,000oz at a total cash cost of $827/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared
to 290,000oz at a total cash cost of $799/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production decreased 12% year-on-year as a result
of a planned 11% drop in recovered grade. Total cash costs were 4% higher year-on-year as a result of the impact of the lower
recovered grade. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Siguiri's production increased 4% year-on-year to 71,000oz and total cash costs
decreased 11% year-on-year to $788/oz. Results for the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected a 5% increase in recovered grade from the
Soloni pit, partly offset by marginally lower tonnage throughput. Total cash costs benefitted from the impact of the higher recovered
grades and lower production input costs, particularly lower fuel prices.

In Mali, Morila produced 49,000oz at a total cash cost of $698/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to 44,000oz at a
total cash cost of $1,162/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production increased by 11% as a result of a 17% increase in
recovered grade from higher grade tonnes sourced from the satellite pit commissioned in the latter part of the previous year, partly
offset by a 6% decrease in tonnes treated. Total cash costs decreased by 40% due to higher production volumes, lower production
costs and reduced spend on operational activities as mining activities were concluded in the satellite pit in 2015. Sadiola produced 
69,000oz at a total cash cost of $818/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to 85,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,028/oz 
for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production decreased by 19% due to a planned 19% decrease in recovered grade as there was less 
available higher-grade, oxide ore. Total cash costs, however, decreased by 20% due to the benefits of cost
management initiatives.

Yatela closure has transitioned to the implementation phase with consultation continuing with the relevant regulatory authorities in Mali
for full approval of the closure plan and consent to commence the closure activities which are expected to be received in the first quarter
of 2016. The current reported quarter's operational performance is therefore not comparable to previous periods.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 527,000oz at a total cash cost of $480/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015, compared to 477,000oz
at a total cash cost of $599/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production was 10% higher as a result of a planned increase in
recovered grade from ore sourced in Nyankanga Cut 7. Total cash costs decreased by 20% primarily due to higher production,
efficiency improvements, lower price escalation and weaker fuel prices. The quarter's production decreased by 3% to 139,000oz as a
result of a 3% decrease in plant throughput due to planned maintenance and marginally lower recovered grade from Geita Hill West.
Total cash costs increased by 8% to $465/oz primarily as a result of the lower production and higher unfavourable inventories
movements. Underground mining has commenced at Star & Comet, with the goal of self-funding exploration of the underground
potential of the concession and building underground mining capability at the asset. One reef drive is being developed from the pit ramp
for underground exploration drilling, while an incline and decline are being developed to stope upper and lower areas of the high grade
zone. A total of 8,143m of development is expected over 31 months.

The Americas produced 831,000oz at a total cash cost of $576/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to 785,000oz at a
total cash cost of $676/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. This 6% increase in production was partially offset by the negative
impact from Serra Grande's lower production which was mainly due to lower grades feed from the stockpiles. The AISC was $792/oz for
the year ended 31 December 2015, a 19% decline from $974/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Cerro Vanguardia produced a record 278,000oz at a total cash cost of $625/oz for the year ended 31 December 2015 compared to
246,000oz at a total cash cost of $692oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production for the year was 13% higher than in 2014
and was the highest annual production the mine has achieved in 16 years. The mine's production increase was mainly driven by a
planned increase in grade, increased volumes from underground and improved recoveries. The site saw benefits from reduced
contractor costs, favourable stockpile movement and currency weakness relative to the dollar, which helped offset inflationary pressure
and higher costs related to production from the heap leach.

Brazil's full year production was 553,000oz at a total cash cost of $546/oz compared to 539,000z at a total cash cost of $670/oz for the
year ended 31 December 2014. The AISC for the 2015 year was $748/oz compared to $991/oz in 2014. AGA Mineração also continued
to improve its performance with a 4% increase in production resulting from higher tonnage and better feed grades from both the
Córrego do Sítio and Cuiabá complexes following mine plan changes, offsetting a 3% decrease in production at Serra Grande. For the
fourth quarter of 2015, Brazil operations produced 163,000oz at a total cash cost of $433/oz compared to the same level of production
at a total cash cost of $566/oz during the fourth quarter of 2014. AISC and AIC were $630/oz and $647/oz respectively, compared to
$964/oz and $1,000/oz in the same quarter last year, reflecting higher by-product credits, favourable stockpile movements, and
favourable exchange rate effects, partially offset by higher inflation.

In Australia, production for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 560,000oz at a total cash cost of $702/oz, compared to 620,000oz
at a total cash cost of $804/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. The AISC for the region was $875/oz for the year ended 31
December 2015 compared to $986/oz for the year ended 31 December 2014. Production decreased 10% year-on-year, largely due to
an 18% drop in output at Sunrise Dam, lower mined grades and a 4% decrease in Tropicana production as grades gradually decline in-
line with mine plan.

At Sunrise Dam, production continued to be impacted by lower mined grades which in turn resulted in a lower head grade through the
mill. However, changes to grade control modelling to improve the prediction of mined grade are now delivering results with three months
of good reconciliation. The lower grade is also the result of the transition of the mine from one dominant ore source, GQ, to the next
major zone, Vogue, which requires considerable drilling, planning and development work to establish. During the fourth quarter of 2015,
underground ore movement continued to improve with 699,000t of ore mined and the processing plant continued to perform well with
throughput of 1,005,000t. Total cash costs for the quarter were favourably impacted by lower mining and plant maintenance costs.

Tropicana produced its 1 millionth ounce of gold in December 2015. The throughput rate in the processing plant continued to improve
with the plant achieving its highest quarterly tonnage to date of 1,623Mt (at 100%). The high throughput rate for the quarter ended 31
December 2015 offset the lower head grade relative to the same quarter last year. The head grade has decreased by 16% over this
period in accordance with the mine plan. Grade mined remained in line with plan, with ongoing excellent reconciliations to the Ore
Reserve, and metallurgical recoveries remained steady at approximately 90%. The mill optimisation study continued with the objective
of debottlenecking the plant and optimising the performance of existing major equipment to increase throughput to over 7.0 Mtpa.

Broad-spaced exploration drilling continues to test the down dip extensions of the Tropicana and Havana ore bodies to provide data for
a mining study to evaluate an alternative low-cost approach to mining a major cutback along the full strike-extent of the ore system.

UPDATE ON PROJECTS

Gas Pipeline Project in Australia. Construction, Commissioning and Practical Completion of the 293km long Eastern Goldfields
Pipeline by APA Group (APA) was completed ahead of schedule in the Gas Pipeline Project in Australia. End-of-line facilities at both
mines were completed enabling delivery of gas to the power stations. The Sunrise Dam power station was commissioned fully on
pipeline gas seven weeks ahead of schedule on the 10th of November 2015. The first four new gas engines at Tropicana were installed,
with the first two in commissioning by the end of the quarter, five weeks ahead of schedule.

Kibali mine in DRC. At Kibali, the second phase of the lined tailings storage facility expansion was completed during the quarter,
providing additional lined storage capacity for Carbon-In-Leach tailings.

The decline work continues. The total ore produced from underground increased with the planned ramp-up of the underground mine,
with a record 295,833t of ore hauled during the quarter, contributing to a total of 803,879t for the year. In total, Kibali completed 10.6km
of underground development during 2015.

On the Vertical shaft, there was no vertical or off-shaft development planned for the quarter as the equipping of the crusher and
production levels were completed. The headgear changeover was completed during the fourth quarter and all equipment required for
remobilising the off-shaft development in the first quarter of 2016 has been installed in the shaft. Capital expenditure for the project (at
100%) for the quarter amounted to $78m and $275m for the year.

Obuasi Project update. Following Randgold Resources announcement not to proceed with the proposed joint venture for the
redevelopment of Obuasi Mine, a plan has been developed to finalise the Feasibility Study (FS) and continue with the limited operating phase
at a reduced spend. Optimisations to the FS includes metallurgical testwork, firming up the capital estimate, refining the first five years of mining,
plus tendering the mining contract. EIS approvals for the project, water treatment plant, and lease reduction remain outstanding.

Siguiri Brownfields Expansion. The Siguiri Mine is predominately an oxide operation with sufficient oxide material (full grade and
marginal ore) to maintain production until 2019 with the current processing plant. While the asset base has known deposits of
transitional and fresh rock material, the current processing plant does not have the capability to treat this material. A feasibility study
was completed to evaluate the business case for converting the Siguiri process plant into a hard rock treatment plant, enabling the
treatment of fresh and transitional material containing roughly 1.6Moz of gold and increasing the mine life by a further six years. Under
current assumptions, the project requires capital of $111m (real). The project is expected to extend the life of mine with approximately 6 years 
until the current TSF is filled in 2023. All-in sustaining costs for Siguiri are expected to be competitive within the current gold price environment. 
A decision on this project is expect by the second half of 2016.

The Siguiri concession is a highly prospective area with significant upside beyond the Reserves. The mine has consistently delivered
upside through near term exploration, demonstrated by its track record of gold mined from 2004 to 2015 plus current reserve which
exceeds the 2004 reserve of 2Moz by 3.9Mozs. The expansion project would solidify Siguiri as a core asset within AngloGold Ashanti's
portfolio by extending the mine life and providing a platform to develop satellite deposits, bringing production to just under 10% of the
group's production profile by 2018.

Engagement with Government to finalise the Convention is in progress. The detailed design is progressing in parallel and the
negotiations with the selected EPCM are ongoing. Long lead items are being scoped. The procurement of power through an IPP
approach, continues to ensure power is available to meet the project demands.

Colombia update. The work in Colombia, including the Pre-Feasibility Study for La Colosa, is progressing under a reduced spend
programme while maintaining long-term optionality within the country. The most significant milestone achieved during the quarter was the
issue of the Gramalote EIA and subsequent operating permit (PTO) which means that the project is fully licensed to build and operate.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION UPDATE

The technology project has shown significant progress in 2015, having successfully deployed the latest generation reef-boring machine
at the TauTona Lower Carbon Leader shaft pillar. The reef-boring cycle times improved from 159 hours per hole to performances of 82
hours per hole, which compares very well to the targeted blue print of 72 hours per hole. The Ultra High Strength Backfill product has
also been successfully developed to be able to pump over the required 1,000m distance; a pre-requisite for a full production mining
cycle. Progress on the work done that seeks to establish the base for a safe, automated, deep-level underground mining method at
AngloGold Ashanti is as follows:

1. Reef Boring

1.1 Small range:
A stage gate to stop drilling was implemented in the third quarter of 2015 given that the undulating nature of the reef plan resulted in the
set target of 80% on reef extraction not being achieved. Only one hole was drilled in the last quarter of 2015 after which drilling was
discontinued and the machine removed from underground. Site preparation at Savuka was not completed on schedule and the
commissioning of the Sandvik machine was delayed. It is expected that commissioning may take place in the first quarter of 2016.

1.2 Medium Range:
                                                                                  MKIII Machines             MKIV Machine

Utilisation of the MK IV machine during the fourth quarter regressed due to change of plan to enforce the use of a contained transport
system, which negatively affected the machine's performance, imposing constraints on the operation of the collector bin and causing
shortages in material cars for the transportation of chippings away from the hole. The collector bin has since been redesigned, modified
and returned underground for further trials, which are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016 and additional material cars
have been sourced and delivered.

The MK III machines drilled 13 holes in the fourth quarter of 2015, during which time Rock Engineering made a recommendation to
suspend drilling in block 2. This resulted in an unplanned move of the Azikohoho machine to the top reef drive of block 7. Due to this
move the machine had to be converted to raise bore mode and the opportunity was also used to install the new mechanical anchoring
system for speeding up the set up times.

As part of improving the machine performance, the rod handling system has now been installed on the machine to assist with the
installation and removal of the drill rods, scheduled for drilling in the VCR site during the first quarter of 2016. Other MK III machines are
expected to be fitted with this system as per the refurbishment programme.

2. Ore body Knowledge and Exploration

Orebody knowledge and exploration plays a critical part in the mine design of an orebody. Drilling continued during the last quarter of
2015 with the aim to resolve the accuracy and deflection constraints by testing different stabiliser configurations. A total of 5 wet holes
were drilled and Trial 7 was completed by the end of the year. The holes are expected to be plotted and analysed and a final analysis is
expected to be given in the first quarter of 2016. The manufacturer of the fit for purpose machine, Bohrmeister, could not deliver the
machine due to the Christmas break. It is expected that the machine will be delivered and commissioned for drilling in the first quarter of
this year.

3. Ultra High Strength Backfill (UHSB)
Surface trials to pump the UHSB product at a product temperature ranging between 30°C and 35°C over a 1,000m distance were
successful. The VCR plant was successfully constructed on 66 level TauTona mine. Commissioning has commenced and the
automation process is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2016. The Savuka plant has been trialed on surface at RULA
and construction is expected to now commence underground once the site is completed.

EXPLORATION UPDATE

Total expensed exploration and evaluation costs (including technology) during the fourth quarter 2015, inclusive of expenditure at equity
accounted joint ventures, were $42m ($14m on Brownfield, $5m on Technology, $7m on Greenfield and $16m on pre-feasibility
studies), compared to $48m for the same quarter during the previous year.

BROWNFIELDS EXPLORATION

A total of 84,492m of diamond and RC drilling was completed for the year ended 31 December 2015. Capitalised Brownfields exploration 
during the fourth quarter, inclusive of capital expenditure at equity accounted joint ventures, was $12m compared to $16m for the same 
quarter last year.

In South Africa, three deep surface drilling sites were in operation during the quarter at Mponeng (WUDLs). Drilling of MZA10, Moab
Khotsong, was completed in the previous quarter. Site rehabilitation was conducted during the quarter and work on the site has now
been completed and the contractor has vacated the site.

In Tanzania, exploration drilling focused on Mineral Resource delineation drilling at Geita Hill Underground and Star & Comet (S&C)
Deeps, infill drilling at S&C Cut 3 and S&C Underground, as well as Nyankanga Cut 7 & 8. Metallurgical drilling at Matandani pit and
geotechnical drilling at S&C UG was also completed. A total of 5,679m was drilled comprising 2,523m RC and 3,156m DD. Mineral
Resource delineation drilling at Geita Hill continued with the aim of delineating down-dip extensions of the Geita Hill ore body beyond
the current open pit limits.

Star & Comet (S&C) Deeps drilling commenced to delineate extensions to the S&C deposit down dip and along strike for both
underground and open pit potential. A total of 3 holes were drilled (238m RC pre-collar and 675m DD tails). One hole (158m) was
completed for S&C underground. Pit mapping continued at Nyankanga Cut 7, Geita Hill East and Geita Hill West. In December a seismic's workshop 
was held on site to review and finalise the 2D seismic survey results and interpretation and commence planning for the 2016 3D survey.

In Guinea, at Siguiri Gold mine, a total of 10,362m were drilled. Infill and reconnaissance drilling took place at Bidini North, Bidini South,
Sintroko, Sokunu, Kami ‘Starter Pit', Soloni and Fatoya South. Fresh rock in-fill drilling was carried out at Bidini. The majority of the
drilling was completed at the Bidini North pit with limited drilling in the Bidini South pit.

Reconnaissance drilling at Sintroko was completed which tested the fresh rock potential below the pit. Significant mineralisation was
intersected. The drilling confirmed the mineralisation extension in the fresh rock below the central part of Sokunu pit and further drilling
is planned. The Fatoya South target was drilled to check for potential NE-SW orientated mineralised extensions to the southeast of
Soloni pit. A total of 1,254m were drilled. Results indicate the existence of shallow marginal mineralisation, which would most likely not
be economic.

In Ghana, at Iduapriem, a total of 2,309m DD and 957m RC was drilled, with the majority at the Bankyem target and limited drilling at
the Mile 5 and Block 4S targets. A trenching and drilling programme commenced across the Bankyem target following on the previous
programme of mapping and soil geochemistry. Twelve trenches have been excavated to date and have been mapped and sampled with
several positive results. A total of 2,144m DD and 687m RC was drilled and the majority of the holes intersected mineralised reef.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo at Kibali, exploration along the KZ trend focused on priority targets: Sessenge SW, Tete
Bakangwe, and Kalimva-Ikamva. Work completed included mapping, trenching, pitting and auger sampling; no DD or RC drilling was
undertaken. Mineral Resource estimation was completed on a revised geological model at Megi.

Trenching was completed at Sessenge SW and a review of the results, supported by ground magnetic survey data, have defined 4
target zones. At Tete Bakangwe, trenching, lithosampling and auger results have defined at least three higher grade mineralised lenses.
Resource estimation at Megi produced 6.91Mt@1.89g/t for 419,249oz within a $1500 pit shell, of which some 52% is classified as
Inferred Mineral Resource. The revised geologic model indicate mineralisation remains open down plunge to the NE, providing
exploration upside.

In Mali, at Sadiola exploration RC drilling of 3,034m was completed at Sadiola North (1,042m) and Tabakoto (1,992m) to upgrade the
oxide Mineral Resource. Mineral Resource at FN (Sadiola North), generated targets between the Sadiola North pit and the FN
extensions. Drilling appears to show a low oxide potential but confirmed the existence of low grade sulphide mineralisation along NE
structures.

A total of 367m were drilled at Tabakoto to upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resource and resolve the complex geology. An additional
1,626m were completed on the northern and southern extension of the NW trending mineralisation. The drilling campaign confirmed the
deep weathering and mineralisation associated with weathered carbonate. Results from the strike extension drilling indicates that there
is oxide potential towards the north-west to the S12 target.

In Argentina, field work continued, including trenching and channel sampling, as the focus for the quarter to advance targets to a drill
stage. All drilling programmes for the year were completed in September.

In Brazil, exploration continued at the Cuiaba, Lamego and CdS production centres for AGABM with 24,165m drilled during the quarter
from the combined surface and underground drilling programmes. Geological modelling continued for near-mine target generation
studies. At Serra Grande, 5,360m were drilled as part of the Mineral Resource conversion programme. Mapping and sampling work
continued for drilling target delineation.

In Colombia, drilling continued to test targets within the Gramalote JV tenements. The infill drilling progressed in the saprolite horizon.
1,830m were completed during the quarter. At La Colosa, 1,760m were drilled during the quarter as the site investigation, hydrology,
geotechnical, and limited Mineral Resource conversion drilling continued. The Quebradona programme continued with 800m drilled
during the quarter. The focus remains on infill and delineation drilling for higher grade copper-gold mineralisation in the upper portion of
the deposit.

At Sunrise Dam in Australia, all exploration was focussed on Mineral Resource extension for the underground (13,430m). A total of 42
significant intercepts were returned. Drilling targeted Vogue South extensions, Cosmo North and Cosmo East extensions, Carey Shear
extensions and infill and Ulu Steeps extensions and infill.

High grade results seen in Vogue South continue to extend the Vogue ore body down plunge to the south with a number of holes
exhibiting visible gold in quartz carbonate veins. All assay results have been returned for Cosmo North and Cosmo East extensions,
with encouraging intercepts reported in the Cosmo North extensional area. Dolly Corridor drilling, targeting down plunge extensions has
returned some significant intercepts. Results from the first few holes drilled, targeting Carey Shear were returned and show very
encouraging intercepts within the Carey Shear zone. Review and drill planning continues on all these target areas.

At Tropicana, drilling continued in the immediate mine environs, with diamond holes testing targets at the Tropicana Pit Extensions,
Swizzler and Havana South areas. A total of 4,255m of RC and 9,093m of DD drilling were completed. Work continues to test down dip
extensions to known mineralisation at the Tropicana pit, the saddle area between Tropicana Pit and the Havana Pit (Swizzler), plus
down-dip at the Havana South deposit.

Regional drilling was also completed with 1,199m of RC and 114.5m DD drilling at Apocalypse and Voodoo Child prospects that are
north of the Tropicana Gold Mine within a 50km radius.

GREENFIELDS EXPLORATION

During the fourth quarter of 2015, focussed Greenfields exploration activities were undertaken in Australia and Colombia. Greenfields
Exploration completed 2,807m of diamond and RC drilling. Total expenditure for the quarter was $7m.

In Colombia, drilling continued on the Guintar project (AGA 100%) situated 40km west of Medellin. Seven holes for 2,807m were
completed with a majority of results awaited. A 3D IP geophysical survey was conducted adjacent to the drilled area and indicates a
strong chargeability anomaly associated with a surface epithermal geochemical anomaly. Reconnaissance work was conducted in other
locations within Antioquia province.

In Australia, at the Tropicana JV (AGA 70%) remaining assays were returned for diamond drilling at the Madras and Masala Prospects.
A 3D geological model for Madras and a revised 1:20K scale geology and domain map were generated. Responsibility for all Tropicana
JV tenements (except Oak Dam) is expected to be transferred to the Brownfields exploration team starting in 2016.

At the Mullion Project in New South Wales (AGA 100%), diamond drilling results from last quarter's campaign returned disappointing
low tenor results.

Project generation activities were undertaken in Colombia, Australia, Brazil, USA, and Tanzania.

See the Exploration Update document and the company website: www.anglogoldashanti.com for more details on both Brownfields and
Greenfields exploration programmes conducted during the quarter and year ended 31 December 2015.

OUTLOOK

Year

Production guidance for 2016 year is estimated to be between 3.6Moz to 3.8Moz. Total cash costs are estimated to be between
$680/oz and $720/oz and all-in sustaining costs between $900/oz and $960/oz at average exchange rates against the US dollar of
15.00 (Rand), 4.00 (Brazil Real), 0.70 (Aus$) and 14.90 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $35/bl average for the year, based on market
expectations.

Capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $790m and $850m. Corporate and marketing costs are estimated to be between $75m
and $90m and expensed exploration and study costs including equity accounted investments at $130m to $150m. Depreciation and
amortisation is forecast at $820m and interest and finance costs are expected to be $190m (income statement) and $175m (cash flow
statement).

Both production and cost estimates assume neither labour interruptions, power disruptions, nor changes to asset portfolio and/or
operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material
adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31
December 2014, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE

The AngloGold Ashanti Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve are reported in accordance with the minimum
standards described by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and
Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012 Edition), and also conform to the standards set out in the South African
Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (The SAMREC
Code, 2007 edition and amended July 2009).

The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Ore Reserve component unless otherwise stated. In complying with
revisions to the JORC code the changes to AngloGold Ashanti's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve have
been reviewed and it was concluded that excluding the disposal of CC&V none of the changes are material
to the overall valuation of the company. AngloGold Ashanti has therefore once again resolved not to provide
the detailed reporting as defined in Table 1 of the code. The company will however continue to provide the
high level of detail it has in previous years in order to comply with the transparency requirements of the code.

AngloGold Ashanti strives to actively create value by growing its major asset – the Mineral Resource and
Ore Reserve. This drive is based on active, well-defined brownfields and greenfields exploration
programmes, innovation in both geological modelling and mine planning and continual optimisation of the
asset portfolio.

GOLD PRICE

The following local prices of gold were used as a basis for estimation in the December 2015 declaration:

The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-
range commodity price forecasts which are prepared in-house.

MINERAL RESOURCE

The total Mineral Resource decreased from 232.0 million ounces (Moz) in December 2014 to 207.8Moz in
December 2015. A gross annual decrease of 7.2Moz occurred before depletion and disposals, while the net
decrease after allowing for depletion and disposals is 24.2Moz. Changes in economic assumptions from
December 2014 to December 2015 resulted in 13.4Moz decrease to the Mineral Resource, whilst exploration
and modelling resulted in an increase of 6.6Moz. Depletion from the Mineral Resource for the year totalled
4.9Moz and the sale of CC&V and Mongbwalu totalled 12.3Moz. The Mineral Resource has been estimated
at a gold price of US$1,400/oz (2014: US$1,600/oz).

Rounding of numbers may result in computational discrepancies.

ORE RESERVE

The AngloGold Ashanti Ore Reserve reduced from 57.5Moz in December 2014 to 51.7Moz in December
2015. This gross annual decrease of 5.8Moz includes depletion of 4.3Moz and the sale of CC&V 3.7Moz.
The balance of 2.2Moz additions in Ore Reserve, results from changes in economic assumptions between
2014 and 2015 which resulted in additions of 0.1Moz to the Ore Reserve, whilst exploration and modelling

The following operations were subject to an external review in line with the policy that each operation project
will be reviewed by an independent third party on average once every three years:

- Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Tropicana
- Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at AGA Mineracao Cuiaba and Lamego
- Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Geita
- Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve at Siguiri

The external reviews were conducted by the following companies: Golder Associates (Tropicana), Optiro
(AGA Mineracao Cuiaba and Lamego, Geita and Siguiri). Certificate of competence documentation has
been received from all companies conducting the external reviews to state that the Mineral Resource and/or
Ore Reserve comply with the JORC Code and the SAMREC Code.

Numerous internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve process reviews were completed by suitably qualified
Competent Persons from within AngloGold Ashanti. A documented chain of responsibility exists from the
Competent Persons at the operations to the company's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Steering
Committee.

Independent auditor's review report on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter and twelve
months ended 31 December 2015 to the Shareholders of AngloGold Ashanti Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti Limited (the company) contained in
the accompanying quarterly report on pages 16 to 30, which comprise the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2015, the condensed consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive
income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the quarter and twelve months then ended, and
selected explanatory notes.

Directors' Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides, as issued by the Accounting
Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and
the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review. We conducted our
review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. This standard requires us to conclude whether anything has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical
requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying
analytical procedures and evaluating the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these
financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements of the company for the quarter and twelve months ended 31 December 2015 are not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard, IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting as issued by the IASB, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee
and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa.

Notes
for the quarter and year ended 31 December 2015

1.   Basis of preparation

     The financial statements in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with the historic cost convention except for
     certain financial instruments which are stated at fair value. The group's accounting policies used in the preparation of these
     financial statements are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014
     except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective for the year beginning 1 January 2015.

     Further, the comparative periods have been restated to separate continuing operations from discontinued operations in
     accordance with IFRS 5, as a consequence of the disposal of the Cripple Creek & Victor operations in the United States (note 9).
     In addition, the quarter ended September 2015 was restated to comply with IFRS 5 as the held for sale criteria for Obuasi were no
     longer met. Accordingly, this has effected the net loss after taxation from continuing operations from a loss of $74m to a loss of
     $8m; basic earnings per share from a loss of 18 cents to a loss of 1 cent.

     The financial statements of AngloGold Ashanti have been prepared in compliance with IAS 34, IFRS as issued by the
     International Accounting Standards Board, the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as
     issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
     Standards Council, JSE Listings Requirements and in the manner required by the South African Companies Act, 2008 (as
     amended) for the preparation of financial information of the group for the quarter and year ended 31 December 2015. These
     interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company's audited consolidated financial statements and the
     notes thereto as at and for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.

     Based on materiality, certain comparatives have been aggregated.

      Liquidity and capital resources

      To service the above capital commitments and other operational requirements, the group is dependent on existing cash
      resources, cash generated from operations and borrowing facilities.

      Cash generated from operations is subject to operational, market and other risks. Distributions from operations may be subject to
      foreign investment, exchange control laws and regulations and the quantity of foreign exchange available in offshore countries. In
      addition, distributions from joint ventures are subject to the relevant board approval.

      The credit facilities and other finance arrangements contain financial covenants and other similar undertakings. To the extent that
      external borrowings are required, the group's covenant performance indicates that existing financing facilities will be available to
      meet the above commitments. To the extent that any of the financing facilities mature in the near future, the group believes that
      sufficient measures are in place to ensure that these facilities can be refinanced.

15.   Financial risk management activities

      Borrowings
      The $1.25bn bonds are carried at fair value. The rated bonds are carried at amortised cost and their fair values are their closing
      market values at the reporting date which results in the difference noted in the table below. The interest rate on the remaining
      borrowings is reset on a short-term floating rate basis and accordingly the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair
      value.

      derivatives carried in the statement of financial position.
      
      Embedded derivatives are included as derivatives on the statement of financial position.
      
      The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:      
      Level 1:    quote prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
      Level 2:    inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
                  (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
      Level 3:    inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

      was offering to buy back up to $810m in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 8.5% high-yield bonds that mature in 2020,
      as part of its strategy to reduce debt and lower interest payment. On 25 September 2015, 62.34% of the notes were settled for a
      total consideration of $850m consisting of a $779m principal payment, a tender premium, being the difference between the par
      value of the bond and the redemption price of $58m and interest of US$13m. Included in the tender premium on the $1.25bn

      Litigation claims

(1)   Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) litigation - On 3 March 2011, in Mankayi vs. AngloGold Ashanti,
      the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that section 35(1) of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases
      Act, 1993 does not cover an ""employee"" who qualifies for compensation in respect of ""compensable diseases"" under the
      Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act, 1973 (ODMWA). This judgement allows such qualifying employee to pursue
      a civil claim for damages against the employer. Following the Constitutional Court decision, AngloGold Ashanti has become
      subject to numerous claims relating to silicosis and other Occupational Lung Diseases (OLD), including several potential
      class actions and individual claims.

      AngloGold Ashanti, Anglo American South Africa, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold announced in November
      2014 that they had formed an industry working group to address issues relating to compensation and medical care for OLD in
      the gold mining industry in South Africa. African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) has since joined the industry working group.
      Village Main Reef and DRDGold also joined the working group but have since withdrawn. The companies have taken efforts
      to engage all stakeholders on these matters, including government, organised labour, other mining companies and legal
      representatives of claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies. Essentially, the companies are seeking a
      comprehensive solution which deals both with the legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks, and which,
      whilst being fair to employees, also ensures the future sustainability of companies in the industry. These legal proceedings
      are being defended, and the status of the proceedings are set forth below.

      AngloGold Ashanti, along with other mining companies including Anglo American South Africa, ARM, Gold Fields, Harmony,
      DRDGold, Village Main Reef, Randgold and Exploration, and Sibanye, were served with a consolidated class action
      application on 21 August 2013, as well as a request for an amendment to alter the scope of the classes previously proposed
      by these representatives. The applicants request certification of two industry-wide classes: a Silicosis Class and a
      Tuberculosis Class, which each cover current and former underground mineworkers who worked on the mines from
      12 March 1965 and who have contracted the respective diseases (or the dependents of mineworkers who died of those
      diseases). The applicants envisage a two-stage process in the class action. The first stage is to resolve common issues and
      the second stage allows the individuals to opt in to the class to make their claims against the respondent mining companies.

      If the Court declines to certify the Silicosis and Tuberculosis Classes, then the applicants request that the Court certify 32
      distinct classes – one for each respondent mining company named in the application – composed of the current and former
      mineworkers who have contracted silicosis or tuberculosis (or the dependents of mineworkers who died of those diseases).

      Arguments in the class action certification were heard in October 2015, and we await the Court's judgement.

      In the period from October 2012 to April 2014, AngloGold Ashanti received 1,256 individual summonses and particulars of
      claim relating to silicosis and/or other OLD. The total amount claimed in the 1,256 summonses is approximately $131m as at
      31 December 2015 (2014: $192m).

      On 9 October 2014, AngloGold Ashanti and the plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to refer all of the individual claims to arbitration.
      The court proceedings have been suspended as a result of entering into the arbitration agreement. The arbitration hearing,
      previously scheduled to commence on 19 April 2016, has been postponed by agreement of the parties.

      It is possible that additional class actions and/or individual claims relating to silicosis and/or other OLD will be filed against
      AngloGold Ashanti in the future. AngloGold Ashanti will defend all current and subsequently filed claims on their merits.
      Should AngloGold Ashanti be unsuccessful in defending any such claims, or in otherwise favourably resolving perceived
      deficiencies in the national occupational disease compensation framework that were identified in the earlier decision by the
      Constitutional Court, such matters would have an adverse effect on its financial position, which could be material. The
      company is unable to reasonably estimate its share of the amounts claimed.

(2)   Litigation - On 11 October 2011, AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (AGAG) terminated Mining and Building Contractors
      Limited's (MBC) underground development agreement, construction on bulkheads agreement and diamond drilling
      agreement at Obuasi mine. The parties reached agreement on the terms of the separation and concluded a separation
      agreement on 8 November 2012. On 20 February 2014, AGAG was served with a writ issued by MBC claiming a total of
      $97m. AGAG filed a motion with the trial court requesting a stay of proceedings pending arbitration. On 5 May 2014, the
      court refused AGAG's application to submit the matter to arbitration. AGAG subsequently appealed this decision to the Court
      of Appeal and filed a Stay of Proceedings at the lower court, which was granted on 11 June 2014. On 17 December 2015,
      the Court of Appeal granted AGAG's appeal and set aside the High Court's ruling refusing to stay proceedings pending
      arbitration. MBC has submitted the matter to arbitration.

(3)   Litigation - AGAG received a summons on 2 April 2013 from Abdul Waliyu and 152 others in which the plaintiffs allege that
      they were or are residents of the Obuasi municipality or its suburbs and that their health has been adversely affected by
      emissions and/or other environmental impacts arising in connection with the current and/or historical operations of the
      Pompora Treatment Plant (PTP) which was decommissioned in 2000. The plaintiffs' alleged injuries include respiratory
      infections, skin diseases and certain cancers. The plaintiffs subsequently did not timely file their application for directions,
      but AGAG intends to allow some time to pass prior to applying to have the matter struck out for want of prosecution. On
      24 February 2014, executive members of the PTP (AGAG) Smoke Effect Association (PASEA), sued AGAG by themselves
      and on behalf of their members (undisclosed number) on grounds similar to those discussed above, as well as economic
      hardships as a result of constant failure of their crops. This matter is set for hearing in July 2016. In view of the limitation of
      current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no reliable estimate can be made for AGAG's obligation in either
      matter.

(4)   Mill contractor claims - On 3 August 2015, AngloGold Ashanti and Newmont concluded the sale of the CC&V mine in
      Colorado to Newmont. As part of the negotiated transaction, the parties agreed to a cost/recovery sharing arrangement
      relative to cost claims asserted for or against CC&V based on work performed by contractors during the design and
      manufacture of the High Grade Mill. Under the agreement, AGA has the right to manage any negotiation, settlement, or legal
      proceedings associated with each cost claim. The maximum total value of the cost claims asserted against CC&V, by two
      contractors, is $20m. Similarly, CC&V will have cost claims against the mill design contractor. On 25 September 2015, AGA
      filed on behalf of CC&V a demand for arbitration against all contractors. Negotiations with all parties continue and the
      arbitration processes are ongoing.

      With reference to items (1) - (4) above, provisions have been raised where the amount of the potential claim or settlement
      can be reasonably estimated.

      Tax claims

(5)   Other tax disputes - In November 2007, the Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM), a Brazilian federal mining
      authority, issued a tax assessment against AngloGold Ashanti Brazil Mineração Ltda (AABM) in the amount of $11m
      (2014: $18m) relating to the calculation and payment by AABM of the financial contribution on mining exploitation (CFEM) in
      the period from 1991 to 2006. AngloGold Ashanti Limited's subsidiaries in Brazil are involved in various other disputes with
      tax authorities. These disputes involve federal tax assessments including income tax, royalties, social contributions and
      annual property tax. The amount involved is approximately $11m (2014: $14m). Management is of the opinion that these
      taxes are not payable.

(6)   VAT disputes - Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (MSG) received a tax assessment in October 2003 from the State of Minas
      Gerais related to VAT on gold bullion transfers. The tax administrators rejected the company's appeals against the
      assessment. The company is now appealing the dismissal of the case. The assessment is approximately $11m
      (2014: $15m).

(7)   Tax dispute - In January 2013, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia S.A. (AGAC) received notice from the Colombian Tax Office
      (DIAN) that it disagreed with the company's tax treatment of certain items in the 2010 and 2011 income tax returns. On
      23 October 2013, AGAC received the official assessments from the DIAN which established that an estimated additional tax
      of $20m (2014: $27m) will be payable if the tax returns are amended. Penalties and interest for the additional taxes are
      expected to be $108m (2014: $135m). The company believes that it has applied the tax legislation correctly. AGAC
      subsequently challenged the DIAN's ruling by filing lawsuits before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca (trial court
      for tax litigation) on 26 March 2015 and on 6 April 2015.

(8)   Tax dispute - On 12 July 2013, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) received a notification from the Argentina Tax Authority
      (AFIP) requesting corrections to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income tax returns of about $8m (2014: $14m) relating to the non-
      deduction of tax losses previously claimed on hedge contracts. The AFIP is of the view that the financial derivatives could not
      be considered as hedge contracts, as hedge contract losses could only be offset against gains derived from the same kind of
      hedging contracts. Penalties and interest on the disputed amounts are estimated at a further $24m
      (2014: $39m). CVSA and AFIP have corresponded on this issue over the past several years and while management is of the
      opinion that the taxes are not payable, the government continues to assert its position regarding the use of the financial
      derivatives. CVSA filed an appeal with the Tax Court on 19 June 2015.

      Other

(9)   Groundwater pollution - AngloGold Ashanti Limited has identified groundwater contamination plumes at certain of its
      operations, which have occurred primarily as a result of seepage from mine residue stockpiles. Numerous scientific, technical
      and legal studies have been undertaken to assist in determining the magnitude of the contamination and to find sustainable
      remediation solutions. The group has instituted processes to reduce future potential seepage and it has been demonstrated
      that Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) by the existing environment will contribute to improvements in some instances.
      Furthermore, literature reviews, field trials and base line modelling techniques suggest, but have not yet proven, that the use
      of phyto-technologies can address the soil and groundwater contamination. Subject to the completion of trials and the
      technology being a proven remediation technique, no reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

(10)  Deep groundwater pollution - The group has identified a flooding and future pollution risk posed by deep groundwater in
      certain underground mines in Africa. Various studies have been undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti Limited since 1999. Due
      to the interconnected nature of mining operations, any proposed solution needs to be a combined one supported by all the
      mines located in these gold fields. As a result, in South Africa, the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act
      (MPRDA) requires that the affected mining companies develop a Regional Mine Closure Strategy to be approved by the
      Department of Mineral Resources. In view of the limitation of current information for the accurate estimation of a liability, no
      reliable estimate can be made for the obligation.

      Contingent asset
(11)  Indemnity - As part of the acquisition by AngloGold Ashanti of the remaining 50% interest in MSG during June 2012, Kinross
      Gold Corporation (Kinross) has provided an indemnity to a maximum amount of BRL255m against the specific exposures
      discussed in item 6 above. At 31 December 2015, the company has estimated that the maximum contingent asset is $7m
      (2014: $9m).

      AngloGold Ashanti's borrowings are interest bearing.

18.   Announcements

      Tropicana gold mine celebrates 1 million ounces milestone – On 11 November 2015, the Tropicana gold mine celebrated the
      production of its 1 millionth ounce on schedule, just over two years since pouring first gold.

      Gas flows ahead of schedule at AngloGold Ashanti's Australian operations – On 17 December 2015, AngloGold Ashanti
      Australia Ltd (AGAA) announced that commissioning of the first gas generators were underway ahead of schedule in the power
      station at the Tropicana gold mine in Western Australia following early completion of the 293 kilometre Eastern Goldfields
      Pipeline (EGP).

      Constructed by the AGA Group (APA) under long-term agreements signed with AGAA in July 2014, the pipeline is delivering
      natural gas to AGAA's Sunrise Dam gold mine, 55km south of Laverton, and to Tropicana (AGAA 70% and manager,
      Independence Group NL 30%), 330km east-northeast of Kalgoorlie.

      Randgold Resources not to proceed with Obuasi Joint Venture – On 21 December 2015, AngloGold Ashanti announced that
      Randgold Resources Limited (Randgold) informed AngloGold Ashanti that it wished to terminate the conditional Investment
      Agreement concluded in September 2015, for a joint venture to redevelop the Obuasi mine, as the proposed investment does not
      meet Randgold's investment criteria.

      The minister of Lands and Natural Resources of Ghana approved continuation of Obuasi's limited operating phase during
      Q1 2016. Limited operations will be undertaken at reduced cost, compared to 2015, including maintaining the operations, security,
      environmental management, optimising the feasibility study, as well as ongoing sustainability work.

      Update on recent events at Obuasi – On 6 February 2016, AngloGold Ashanti initiated the withdrawal of employees performing non-essential
      functions from its idled Obuasi Gold Mine, following an incursion of illegal miners inside the fenced areas of the site. Remaining
      employees are performing critical tasks related to maintenance of the site, and also water treatment, provision of medical services
      and maintenance of electrical facilities that provide power and water to employees' homes and surrounding communities. Given
      Obuasi's limited operating status, there will be no impact to group production and costs as a result of this event for at least this
      year.

      The latest development at the site followed the withdrawal of government military protection from the mine on Tuesday,
      2 February 2016, after initial incursions on 30 and 31 January 2016. It is important to note that the Ghana Army has a
      Memorandum of Understanding with the Chamber of Mines, on behalf of its members, to deploy military personnel at mining
      operations. To AngloGold Ashanti's knowledge, no other mines with a military presence have been affected.

      The situation at the mine is currently calm, though the company remains deeply concerned about the prevailing conditions, with

AngloGold Ashanti Information Update on Situation at Idled Obuasi Gold Mine


Johannesburg and New York, 16 February 2016 - Last week, in the interests of safety,
AngloGold Ashanti Ghana withdrew employees performing non-essential functions from its idled
Obuasi Gold Mine, following the incursion of illegal miners inside the fenced areas of the site. There
is no impact on AngloGold Ashanti’s production and All-In Sustaining Costs as the site is not
forecast to be in production for at least this year. Remaining employees are performing critical
tasks related to maintenance of the site, and also water treatment, provision of medical services
and maintenance of electrical facilities that provide power and water to employees’ homes and
surrounding communities.


This latest development at the site followed the withdrawal of government military protection from
the mine on Tuesday, 2 February 2016, after initial incursions on 30 and 31 January 2016. It is
important to note that the Ghana Army has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chamber of
Mines, on behalf of its members, to deploy military personnel at mining operations. To AngloGold
Ashanti’s knowledge, no other mines with a military presence have been affected.


The situation at the mine is currently calm, though AngloGold Ashanti Ghana remains deeply
concerned about the prevailing conditions, with illegal miners continuing to enter the site. If allowed
to continue unchecked, illegal mining taking place on parts of the concession, and vandalism of

to continue its feasibility study and maintain critical services.


AngloGold Ashanti Ghana has informed local authorities, through a declaration of Force Majeure,
that under the current situation it may be constrained from fulfilling certain conditions of its
Amended Programme of Mining Operations, the permit that covers current activities at Obuasi.


Following engagement on 12 February 2016 between AngloGold Ashanti and the Ghanaian
Minister of Lands and Natural Resources and other government officials, the Minister has
committed to sending a delegation of high-ranking government officials to examine the situation at
the mine. AngloGold Ashanti awaits the outcome of the delegation’s visit, and will continue to urge
authorities at a national and local level to assist in upholding the law and returning safety and
security to the site before further injuries or further loss of life occur.

Background/ Notes to Editors
AngloGold Ashanti suspended underground mining operations at the Obuasi Mine at the end of
2014 after incurring heavy (and ultimately unaffordable) financial losses over several years.
Employees were paid a severance as mandated by law and in accordance with relevant Collective
Agreements and Employment Contracts. Despite a very difficult market for the global mining
industry, AngloGold Ashanti continues to invest significant time, skill and financial resources in
building the case for the Obuasi Mine’s redevelopment into a much needed, long-term contributor
to the local, regional and national economies.


Since the suspension of operations, Obuasi has been in a government-approved limited operations
phase, whilst AngloGold Ashanti conducts the feasibility study needed to determine whether the
mine can be redeveloped into a profitable, productive operation that can once again be a significant
employer and contributor to the local, regional and national economies in Ghana.

NEWS RELEASE
Randgold Resources not to proceed with Obuasi Joint Venture: Obuasi to
continue with its Limited Operating Phase at Lower Cost

(JOHANNESBURG – NEWS RELEASE) -- Randgold Resources Limited (“Randgold”) has
informed AngloGold Ashanti that it wishes to terminate the conditional Investment
Agreement concluded in September 2015, for a joint venture to redevelop the Obuasi Mine,
as the proposed investment does not meet Randgold’s investment criteria.

This decision follows concerted efforts by both companies to improve the project’s returns
and also to secure an appropriate set of consents from the Government of Ghana, within an
ambitious timeframe that would have allowed for a feasibility decision on the redevelopment
of the mine in early 2016. Although improvements have been identified, these have not
been sufficient to commit to a substantial investment under the prevailing conditions.

The Minister of Lands and Natural Resources of Ghana has approved continuation of
Obuasi’s limited operating phase during Q1 2016. Limited operations will be undertaken at
reduced cost, compared to 2015, including maintaining the operations, security,
environmental management, optimising the feasibility study, as well as ongoing
sustainability work.

“We have made a concerted effort to unlock a new opportunity for Obuasi, and the work we
have done lays a good foundation for the operation in the long term,” AngloGold Ashanti
Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said. “But in the current environment,
we believe it is prudent to conserve our resources and to revisit this opportunity when market
conditions improve.”

Obuasi, located in the Ashanti region of Ghana 320 kilometres northwest of the capital
Accra, is a large, high-grade deposit with proven and probable ore reserves (as reported by
AngloGold Ashanti in its 2014 Annual Report) of 24.53Mt at 6.70g/t for 5.29Moz, part of a
substantial mineral resource base.
