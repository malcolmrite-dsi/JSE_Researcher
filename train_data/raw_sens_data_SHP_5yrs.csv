OPERATIONAL UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2020


The Group's 2021 financial year has begun in earnest. Across the business 
adherence to strict COVID-19 protocols has become part of daily operations, 
whilst execution on growth across our store base, digital and customer first 
projects has continued.

In accordance with our 2020 year-end guidance expectations, the impact of 
COVID-19 lockdown regulations on RSA liquor trade was particularly marked 
over the quarter given it required our Supermarkets RSA LiquorShop business 
to remain closed for 60 of the 91 days in the period. The loss of trade 
notably impacted our Supermarkets RSA segment's sales growth and 
consequently Group growth and it is for this reason we have provided metrics 
including and excluding RSA LiquorShop's sales for both. Notwithstanding, 
the Group's continued focus on gross margin and expense management continued 
unabated and has delivered positive results for the quarter.

Sales growth from continuing operations for the three months to 
September 2020 over the corresponding three months ended 
September 2019:

                                                                    Change
                                                                         %

Other operating segments                                               9.9

Supermarkets RSA

The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, inclusive of our LiquorShop 
business, which due to South African COVID-19 lockdown regulations was 
closed for 60 of the 91 days in the quarter, increased sales by 3.3%. 

The Supermarkets RSA segment represented by Shoprite, Usave, Checkers and 
Checkers Hyper continued to report market share gains over the quarter. 
Sales excluding LiquorShop increased by 7.2%. Growth amongst the 
aforementioned brands that make up the segment remains led by our mid-to-
upper end Checkers and Checkers Hyper banner. Internal selling price 
inflation for the quarter measured 4.4%. 

The net store movement for the period for the segment measured 16 new 
stores. Across our three supermarket trading brands Shoprite, Usave, 
Checkers and Checkers Hyper we opened 25 new stores in the quarter: five 
Shoprite stores; two Checkers FreshX stores; one Checkers Hypermarket; eight 
Usave stores (including two Usave eKasi container stores) and nine 
LiquorShops.

Supermarkets Non-RSA

In line with the reporting of our 2020 year-end financials, as a result of 
the ongoing process pertaining to the sale of all or part of Retail 
Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, our Nigerian business remains classified as a 
discontinued operation and as such is not included in the reporting for this 
segment. Negotiations in this regard continue and the Group hopes to 
finalise this transaction during the second half of our current financial 
year. 

Supermarkets Non-RSA's onerous operating paradigm has been impacted further 
by COVID-19 lockdowns and their associated restrictions. Notwithstanding 
this, some countries for example Zambia have traded well, whilst others, 
namely Angola, remain under pressure. Across the board however, an admirable 
performance in local currency for the most part has been eroded by currency 
devaluation, which has negatively impacted translation into our reporting 
currency, the rand, in which sale of merchandise for the quarter declined by 
8.4%.

In terms of store movement over the quarter, three stores were opened (one 
in Zambia, one in Eswatini and one in Lesotho) and three stores were closed 
(two in Angola and one in Kenya). In line with the Group's prior statement 
pertaining to our Kenyan operations we expect to exit our two remaining 
stores by our financial year-end. 

Furniture

The Group's Furniture operating segment made up of OK Furniture and 
House & Home increased sales by 20.6%. The segment remains mostly cash 
sales based with credit sales participation measuring 11.7% of sales for 
the quarter. 

The Group's furniture business continues to consolidate its store base with 
a net closure of seven stores (nine closures and two openings).

Other operating segments

The Group's Other operating segments, made up of OK Franchise, Computicket, 
Transpharm and Medirite Pharmacies as well as Checkers Food Services, 
reported a 9.9% increase in sales. The OK Franchise division increased sales 
by 8.5% with 26 net new stores (36 openings and ten closures).

Outlook 

Pursuant to the finalisation of the terms of the 25 February 2020 SENS, in 
which the Group outlined the establishment of Retail Logistics Fund 
Proprietary Limited, Shoprite Holdings received the cash consideration of 
R1.2 billion during November 2020. This, together with the results of our 
continued focus on working capital, US dollar borrowing reduction and 
measured capital allocation bodes well for continued improvement in the 
Group's net cash position. 

From a digital transformation perspective we continue to execute well on our 
Group wide strategy. Noteworthy in this regard was the successful launch of 
the Group's Xtra Savings Rewards Programme in our Shoprite RSA supermarket 
business during October. This is a milestone event for the Group, timed to 
bring our Shoprite Xtra Savings Rewards Programme customers even more value 
at a time they need it most. To date, our Xtra Savings Rewards Programme has 
surpassed 12 million sign ups, half of which can be attributed to our 
Shoprite customer sign ups since the launch, five weeks ago. The Group's 
Xtra Savings Rewards Programme is an important foundational building block 
for the Group, allowing us to execute on our precision retailing objectives. 

Whilst firmly focussed on our customers, our efforts to future-fit our 
channels continues to gain momentum. Notably, our Checkers Sixty60 one hour 
delivery service has won three top tier innovation awards in the past month 
namely the People's Choice Award and the Best Enterprise Solution at the 
2020 MTN Business App of the Year Awards, as well as the 2020 BCX Digital 
Innovation Award in the Corporate category. Furthermore, the accolade of 
Best Convenience and Grocery Store of the Decade in the 22nd annual Sunday 
Times Top Brands survey awarded to Shoprite earlier this month was a great 
honour and an achievement of which we are very proud.

It is pleasing to report that from last week (12 November 2020) the South 
African nationwide lockdown regulations pertaining to the restriction of 
off-consumption liquor trade were lifted. The result of this is that our 
sizable retail LiquorShop business, previously restricted from trading over 
weekends and mid-week after 5pm, is now able to trade seven days a week. 
This is a meaningful change for the Group and comes at a significant time as 
we begin our important festive season period. 

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or 
reported on by the Group's external auditors.

Group results for the year ended 28 June 2020


Pieter Engelbrecht, Chief Executive Officer

In a challenging year we are proud to report the Group's 6.4% increase in 
sales to a record R156.9 billion. Despite significant COVID-19 lockdown 
restrictions impacting the Group to varying degrees, our core Supermarkets 
RSA operating segment increased sales by 8.7%, representing a R9.8 billion 
increase to R122.4 billion. Our Supermarkets Non-RSA continuing operations' 
sales declined by 1.4% in rand terms, however, it increased by 6.6% in 
constant currency terms.

As evidenced by our results, our core business, Supermarkets RSA, made up of 
Shoprite, Usave, Checkers and Checkers Hyper, remained focused on their 
respective customer segments and continued to execute on their value 
proposition. Pleasingly, our South African supermarket business reported 
2.3% volume growth, coupled with 16 months of consecutive market share gains 
up to and including June 2020. It was without doubt a milestone year 
strategically, with the successful launch of our industry first digital 
shopping application Checkers Sixty60 and our Checkers Xtra Savings Rewards 
Programme, which ended the year with 4.7 million customers registered. 

As previously articulated, the Group has embarked on a process to consider 
the sale of either a majority stake or the entire shareholding in our 
Nigeria subsidiary and, as required by IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations, it is now reported as a discontinued 
operation. Overall, it has been a difficult six months for Supermarkets Non-
RSA given lockdown regulations which impacted store openings, days and hours 
of trade, as well as severely restricting transport in some countries, 
impeding our employees and customers' ability to get to our stores.

Notwithstanding lockdown regulations resulting in the closure of our 
furniture and liquor stores, the Group reported a 20 basis point increase in 
trading margin to 5.3% after adjusting for the impact of hyperinflation. 
This is a considerable achievement and is a result of excellent sales 
growth, improved gross margin and commendable expense management, despite 
significant COVID-19 related costs. 

We approached COVID-19 lockdown conservatively given our view of the 
economic contraction and job losses that would follow in what can only be 
described as a devastating year for South Africa. In doing so we prioritised 
two things - the health and safety of our employees and customers and the 
preservation of jobs for our people. 

2020 was a team effort across the business, executing day-to-day operational 
excellence whilst delivering on a number of strategic initiatives. I am, as 
such, very proud of Shoprite, our people and these results.

Operational and voluntary trading update (52 weeks ended 28 June 2020) 


Trading environment

This operational update, inclusive of voluntary earnings per share (EPS) and 
headline earnings per share (HEPS) guidance, is more comprehensive than 
usual for the purpose of providing shareholders and investors with an 
understanding of how the Group has traded during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Despite difficult circumstances, in a year incorporating the COVID-19 
lockdown and accompanying regulations governing trade, transport and 
operations, the Group increased total sale of merchandise for the 52 weeks 
to 28 June 2020 (including the impact of hyperinflation in the prior year) 
by 6.4% to approximately R156.9 billion. Like-for-like growth for the year 
was 4.4%. 

The Shoprite Group remained committed to meeting the demands of our 
customers, whilst focusing on value and remaining solution oriented. 
This was evidenced, inter alia, by our digital voucher innovation, 
ongoing private label development and the conversion of our Checkers 
Food Services (CFS) business to include a consumer facing offering. In
addition, the rapid scaling of our innovative Checkers Sixty60 digital
shopping application, which after a test phase introduction in November
2019, was operational from 87 stores nationwide by June 2020. 

As a Group, our initiatives pertaining to inventory and capital management 
began early in our financial year and carried on unabated despite the 
nationwide lockdown. From a liquidity and net debt standpoint, the Group has 
managed to meaningfully improve its financial position since reporting in 
February 2020 on our first half results. The transaction involving the sale 
of our distribution centres to Equites Property Fund Limited is in its final 
phase of Competition Commission approval and we anticipate transfer will be 
affected during the first half of the 2021 financial year.

Supermarkets RSA's sales growth (inclusive of liquor) of 8.7% for the year 
was underpinned by a strong second half, in which sales grew 7.5%, 
notwithstanding a high second half base in the prior year during which 
fourth quarter sales grew by 9.4%. As a result of lockdown, customer visits 
for the year declined by 7.4%, however, average basket spend increased by 
18.4%. Superb execution across the business coupled with considerable 
efforts from our suppliers resulted in volume growth of 2.3% for the year. 
Market share figures insofar as they are available (up to the end of 
May 2020) reflect consecutive monthly market share gains for the past 
15 months. 

In equally, if not more difficult circumstances resulting from COVID-19 
lockdown regulations, Supermarkets Non-RSA's second half reported an 
increase in sales of 0.1%, resulting in an overall decline in sales of 1.4% 
for the year but in constant currency increased by 6.6%. 

Nigeria - discontinued operations 

Following approaches from various potential investors, and in line with 
our re-evaluation of the Group's operating model in Nigeria, the Board has
decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all,
or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary 
of Shoprite International Limited. As such, Retail Supermarkets Nigeria
Limited may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports
its results for the year. Any further updates will be provided to the market
at the appropriate time.

The following information provides context to the Group's sales growth for 
the year: 

Supermarkets RSA 

-  The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA (including liquor),
   contributing 78.0% to Group sales, achieved sales growth of 8.7% for
   the year. Like-for-like growth for the year measured 6.8%.

-  Shoprite and Usave reported full year sales growth of 6.7% (second
   half sales growth: 5.7%) and Checkers and Checkers Hyper reported
   full year growth of 13.5% (second half sales growth: 16.1%). 

-  Second half internal inflation of 3.4% increased marginally from the
   2.7% reported for the first six months to average 3.0% for the year. 

-  Our private label business, spanning our three supermarket chains and
   offering better value and range to our customers, managed to increase
   its Supermarkets RSA sales participation to 17.1%, up 60 basis points
   compared to the previous year. 

-  South African COVID-19 lockdown regulations implemented from
   27 March 2020 restricted trade in several categories within our
   supermarket business and as such, impacted the business differently at
   different times. However, across the board, our Checkers, Checkers
   Hyper, Shoprite and Usave brands performed admirably in what can only be
   described as incredibly difficult conditions for both our employees and
   customers. The two weeks preceding South Africa's initial 35 days of
   Level 5 lockdown resulted in elevated sales growth across all three of
   our supermarket brands but noteworthy was the significant growth
   reported by our repositioned mid-to-upper end Checkers (including
   Checkers Hyper) business which now represents 39.6% of Supermarkets
   RSA's sales. 

-  The sales growth momentum achieved in our liquor business during our
   first half continued up to February and accelerated, pre-lockdown,
   during March. COVID-19 lockdown regulations required the complete
   closure of our liquor business for 66 days and subsequently restricted
   trade to four days a week (Monday to Thursday) for the month of June.
   The combined result of a first half during which sales grew by 20.5%
   followed by a second half during which sales declined by 29.5%, 
   resulted in a year in which sales declined by 3.3%. Liquor represents
   5.8% of Supermarkets RSA's sales. 

Supermarkets Non-RSA

-  Given the aforementioned comment regarding the pending classification
   of Nigeria as a discontinued operation, Supermarkets Non-RSA (excluding
   Nigeria) contributing 11.6% to Group sales, recorded a decline in sales
   of 1.4% for the year. 

-  Second half constant currency sales growth of 6.3% was significantly
   impacted by lockdown regulations across the 14 African countries in
   which we trade. Lockdown restrictions pertaining to store closures;
   social distancing; transport restrictions; the movement of people;
   trading hours; workforce limitations and trade in alcohol impacted
   various regions to differing degrees at different times. 

Furniture

-  The Group's Furniture segment, representing 3.5% of Group sales,
   reported a decline in sales of 11.9% for the year. Like-for-like sales
   for the year declined by 10.3%.

-  Second half trade was significantly impacted by lockdown regulations
   which required our South African store base to close for 52 days and
   our Non-RSA regions to close, on average, for 31 days. Consequently,
   second half sales declined by 23.1%. 

-  Debtor book collections were hampered during the lockdown period and
   are expected to deteriorate in line with the anticipated economic
   downturn. The assessment of expected credit losses for the year is in
   the process of being finalised, however, our expectation in accordance
   with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments is that the provision against the
   debtor book will increase from 35.8% to approximately 50.5% compared 
   to the previous year. The movement in the provision equates to an income
   statement charge of approximately R325 million.

Other operating segments

The Group's Other operating segments, representing 6.9% of Group sales 
and comprising OK Franchise, Transpharm, MediRite Pharmacies, CFS and 
Computicket, achieved sales growth of 3.9% for the year. This was achieved 
despite lockdown limitations impacting CFS, given that its primary 
customers (the restaurant and hospitality industry) were closed during 
lockdown, as well as Computicket, with lockdown restrictions having a 
significant impact on events and travel related ticketing. Notwithstanding 
these restrictions, the businesses' ability to adapt and innovate resulted 
in second half sales increasing by 3.5%. 

COVID-19 costs

The Group believes it is appropriate to highlight the COVID-19 costs 
incurred pertaining to compliance with national lockdown regulations 
together with managing and protecting our employees, customers, stores, 
inventory and distribution infrastructure. In this regard, the Group has 
incurred a net total of R327.2 million spent across the areas of health and 
safety, security, mobile clinics, personal protective equipment, temperature 
scanners, store and distribution centre sanitation, employee meals, 
communication costs and remote network access for employees. The most 
significant spend pertained to R116.9 million paid to our employees,
inclusive of an appreciation bonus to assist them with the difficulties we
anticipated would accompany the nationwide lockdown. 

Impairment of non-financial assets 

Impairments for the year approximate R1.3 billion, mainly in the 
Supermarkets Non-RSA and Furniture segments as a result of the deterioration 
in the current and future economic outlook. Impairments, net of income tax, 
form part of items of a capital nature and as such impact EPS but not HEPS.

Voluntary trading update

The following information is supplied in order to assess the impact of the 
impairments raised and the aforementioned COVID-19 costs on the Group's 
results for the year.

Furthermore, due to the potential classification of our Nigerian business as 
a discontinued operation, we present continuing operations excluding Nigeria 
as an alternative. 

For ease of comparison of the like-for-like relative performance of the
operations, we have included an adjusted basic HEPS which excludes 
the after tax effect of exchange rate gains or losses and the impact of
hyperinflation. In addition, we have calculated this metric to exclude 
once-off COVID-19 costs.

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the 
Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales growth, 
excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this 
information, current year sales for entities reporting in currencies other 
than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR at the prior 
year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country basis. 

For the year ended 28 June 2020, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be 
hyperinflationary, whilst it was assessed to be hyperinflationary during the 
prior year ended 30 June 2019. As such, in respect of Angola, the constant 
currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of 
hyperinflation.

The table below sets out the percentage change in sales, based on the actual 
results for the financial year, in reported currency and constant currency 
for the following major currencies. The total impact on Supermarkets Non-RSA 
is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this segment.

     each year.

     In respect of the undeveloped land at Centurion and Cilmor, the Lease Agreements will contain
     provisions relating to the future development of such undeveloped land, in terms of which Equites
     will be appointed as the developer and the JVCo will fund the development.

     The effective date of the Proposed Transaction will be the date on which the last of the conditions
     contained in the Heads of Agreement has been fulfilled, which is expected to be during May 2020.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS: UNAUDITED GROUP RESULTS FOR THE 26 WEEKS TO 29 DECEMBER 2019


Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer

We are very proud to report the Group's 7.0% increase in merchandise sales 

for the six months to 29 December 2019. The R81.2 billion in sales was 

achieved on the back of 4.4% growth in volume of products sold and 2.1% 

growth in the number of customers. EBITDA, a more comparable measure after 

the adoption of IFRS 16: Leases, increased by 5.3% to R6.8 billion. This was 

a satisfactory performance given the 1.1% market share gains to 31.6% in 

Supermarkets RSA which achieved sales growth of 9.8%.



Our Group strategy to capture a larger share of South Africa's premium food 

retail segment continues to be one of our drivers of growth as reflected 

particularly in the Checkers brand, together with Hypers, growing sales by 

11.2%. It's been an exciting six months for the Checkers brand with 

significant milestones reached in support of our long-term growth strategy. 

The Xtra Savings Rewards Programme was launched in October and has been very 

well received with 3.8 million customers having already signed up. In 

another first for South African Supermarkets, our pioneering one hour 

grocery delivery service, Sixty60, was launched in November in 8 stores. 

Although, still in the early stages, we believe this mobile e-commerce 

solution offering unrivalled convenience for shoppers holds much promise.



Our Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment, comprising operations in 14 

countries across the African continent, recorded positive sales growth of 

4.8% in constant currency terms. Sales declined by 3.1% in rand terms.



The Group's trading margin of 5.0% remained strong, underpinned by an 8.7% 

increase in gross margin and effective cost control. 



Outside of our retail operations, our focus is increasingly on our 

environment, governance, social responsibility and our continued goal to 

improve the lives of the people in key Shoprite communities. We remain

pleased to report that despite the current difficult economic climate,

Shoprite continued to create new jobs and participate in the YES

(Youth Employment Service) programme.

IMPLEMENTATION OF IFRS 16: LEASES


The purpose of this announcement is to communicate Shoprite Holdings' 

adoption of IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) effective for financial years 

beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group hereby publishes its 

restated 30 June 2019 financial results accordingly. 



IFRS 16 is a new financial reporting standard on leases replacing the 

previous IAS 17: Leases (IAS 17), requiring an accounting change. The main 

objective of IFRS 16 is to recognise and reflect a company's lease 

obligations in its financial statements by aligning the accounting and 

presentation of operating leased assets with those of owned and finance 

leased assets. 



The Group has adopted the new standard with effect from 1 July 2019 using 

the full retrospective approach. Accordingly, the Group's 30 June 2019 

comparative financial results have been restated from a transition date of 

2 July 2018. 



IFRS 16 has a significant impact on the presentation and classification of 

the statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, the 

statement of cash flows and certain key performance metrics. However, it has 

no impact on the Group's underlying economic model, revenue or net cash 

flow. 



The application of IFRS 16 requires the majority of the Group's leased 

property, vehicles, machinery and equipment and other small item leased 

assets to be brought onto the statement of financial position in accordance 

with the aforementioned approach. The Group has elected not to recognise 

right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets and 

short-term leases. The Group defines low-value assets, as assets with a cost 

price below R75 000. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment. Short-term 

leases comprise equipment and vehicle leases with a term of 12 months or 

less.



On the statement of financial position, IFRS 16 requires the recognition of 

a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset. At the 

commencement date of a qualifying lease, the lease liability and 

corresponding asset are raised by discounting future lease payments. 

Management uses the rate implicit in the lease for vehicle leases and the 

lessee's incremental borrowing rate for all other leases. Whilst the lease 

liability and right-of-use asset are initially recognised at the same value, 

except in the case of prepaid leases, they reduce differently over the lease 

term as explained herein. 



On the statement of comprehensive income, IFRS 16 replaces the previously 

recognised straight-line rental expense required under IAS 17 with a 

straight-line depreciation charge over the shorter of the underlying assets' 

useful life and the lease term. The right-of-use asset therefore reduces by 

the depreciation charge. The IFRS 16 lease liability results in an implied 

interest charge on the outstanding lease liability. The lease liability 

reduces over the term of the lease by the value of the lease payments, net 

of the implied interest charge, as payments are made. It is for this reason 

that IFRS 16 is dilutive to profit before tax and earnings per share at the 

initial stages of a lease and accretive at the end of the lease. However,

over the term of the lease, the finance charges and depreciation will equal

the rental payments. 



In accordance with IAS 36: Impairment of assets, on recognition and at each 

reporting date, the right-of-use asset is subject to impairment testing and 

any such impairments are classified under items of a capital nature in the 

statement of comprehensive income.



The impact of the IFRS 16 adoption on the Group's 30 June 2019 results is 

summarised as follows:



On the statement of financial position:

-  An IFRS 16 lease liability of R21.5 billion and right-of-use asset 

   of R15.7 billion has been raised; 

-  Retained earnings has been reduced by R4.0 billion inclusive of a 

   R3.3 billion adjustment to opening retained earnings on 2 July 2018; 

-  A deferred income tax asset of R1.0 billion has been raised. This is 

   due to temporary differences between the lease liability and right-of-use

   asset;

-  Trade and other receivables decreased by R0.8 billion due to a

   reclassification of prepaid leases to right-of-use assets; and

-  The fixed escalation operating lease accrual and onerous lease 

   provision of R1.5 billion has been derecognised. 



On the statement of comprehensive income:

-  Group sales and gross profit are unaffected;

-  Depreciation increased by R2.5 billion due to the creation of the 

   right-of-use asset;

-  Operating lease expense declined by R4.2 billion as a result of the

   derecognition of the IAS 17 straight-line rental expense;

-  There was an increase in the net monetary gain on the creation of the

   right-of-use asset. It is important to note that these restated results

   still apply hyperinflation accounting in accordance with IAS 29:

   Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies;

-  Group trading profit increased by R1.7 billion;

-  Exchange rate losses increased by R0.5 billion mainly due to the Group's

   US dollar leases. From the 2020 financial year, the Group will apply net

   investment hedge accounting to reduce this impact; 

-  Items of a capital nature increased by R0.4 billion as a result of the

   required annual impairment testing on the right-of-use asset created;

-  Finance costs increased by R1.8 billion. This is due to the implied

   interest charge raised on the aforementioned R21.5 billion IFRS 16 lease

   liability; 

-  Group profit before tax declined by R1.0 billion to R5.4 billion; and

-  Previously reported diluted headline earnings per share of 779.9c

   decreased by 81.4c to 698.5c. 



On the statement of cash flows:

-  Lease payments which were previously included in operating activities

   are now allocated between principle and finance costs. The principle

   lease payments are included in financing activities and the finance cost

   remains in operating activities;

-  The Group's net cash flow is not affected; and

-  Dividends paid are not affected. 



The application of IFRS 16 does not impact the Group's underlying business, 

operations, liquidity or cash flow. It also does not affect the Group's 

business strategy on leasing or otherwise. 



The complete restated comparative financial information for the 2019 

financial year included in Annexure A is the responsibility of the directors 

of Shoprite Holdings. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only 

and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors.



The Group is hosting an IFRS 16 briefing webcast call on 18 February 2020. 

It will be hosted by the Group chief financial officer, Anton de Bruyn,

and will follow the format of a short presentation followed by an

opportunity for questions and answers. Registration will be via

http://www.corpcam.com/shoprite18022020. The presentation will be available on

the company website www.shopriteholdings.co.za shortly before the webcast 

begins.

and product volumes by 4.4%.

On a segmental basis, approximate sales for the six months to December 2019 were as follows:

The following provides context to the overall sales growth for the six months:

    -   The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, achieved sales growth of 9.8% for the period.
            -  Internal selling price inflation moderated from 3.0% during the first quarter to 2.4%
               in the second quarter, resulting in internal selling price inflation of 2.7% for the six
               months.
            -  All three supermarket brands, Shoprite, Checkers and Usave, traded well in a tough
               market.
            -  Liquor sales remained strong, with sales growing 20.5%.
    -   Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline in sales of 3.1% in rand terms.
            -  We have continued to experience ongoing currency devaluations and volatility in key
               markets in which we trade. The Angolan kwanza weakened by 40.6% against the US
               dollar since June 2019. During the reporting period, the Angolan kwanza, Zambian
               kwacha and Nigerian naira depreciated 40.4%, 20.8% and 18.2% respectively against
               the US dollar when compared to the previous year.
            -  Constant currency growth measured 4.8%.
    -   The Furniture Division's sales declined 2.7% for the six months to 29 December 2019,
        impacted by a reduction in the store base of 13 net stores over the period; load shedding in
        South Africa and currency devaluations in certain Non-RSA countries.
    -   Other operating segments which include OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite Pharmacies,
        Transpharm and Checkers Food Services grew sales by 4.4%. The period included a 6-week
        strike in Transpharm, the Group's pharmaceutical wholesale business. OK Franchise's growth
        for the six months to 29 December 2019 measured 7.5%.

For the six months to 29 December 2019 the Group added a net 66 stores to its supermarket business
to end the period with 1 911 stores. Franchise added a net 10 stores to end December with 470 stores.

Shareholders are advised that this update does not constitute an earnings forecast. The figures and
information contained herein have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors.

The Group's interim results for the six months ended 29 December 2019 are scheduled for release on

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment in comparative period

For the comparative period ended 30 December 2018, the Angolan economy was assessed to be
hyperinflationary. As such, it required the application of hyperinflation accounting.

For the six months ended 29 December 2019, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be
hyperinflationary. As such, the current period's results do not require the application of hyperinflation
accounting.

In order to facilitate the comparison of the current period's results, the table below outlines the pro
forma financial information for the comparative prior period, excluding the impact of hyperinflation.

The financial impact of hyperinflation on the prior period's turnover was as follows:

BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE CHANGES

In compliance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements the Shoprite Holdings Board of Directors
(""the Board"") would like to inform shareholders of the following transitional changes to the Board
and Board Committees with effect from 15 November 2019:

    *   Dr A Mokgokong has been appointed as Lead Independent Director and member of the
        Remuneration Committee.
    *   Mr J Rock has been appointed as Chairperson of the Group Remuneration Committee.
    *   Ms A Le Roux has been appointed member of the Social and Ethics Committee.
    *   Mr J Basson has been appointed member of the Group Nominations Committee.
    *   Mr P Engelbrecht has been co-opted to the Group Nominations Committee as the
        representative of management.

The Board has commenced a formal process to recompose the Board, identifying and supplementing
the existing Board with additional expertise and skills.

As was noted at the Group's recent AGM, succession planning is a key priority for the Board. This is
echoed by the current Group Chairperson, Dr Wiese, who has indicated his intention to retire as
Chairperson by the next AGM. The Board is of the view that, in line with good corporate
governance, the next Group Chairperson should be independent, a view supported by Dr Wiese. As
such the process to find a suitable independent successor has commenced.

Further updates will be provided from time to time.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2019

In the three months to September 2019, the Shoprite Group's turnover increased by 7.3%.

The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA grew sales by 10.3% during the quarter, continuing its
market share gains. Whilst all three of our supermarket brands traded well, our hard discounter format
Usave led the growth. Internal selling price inflation measured 3.0% over the period.

The Supermarkets Non-RSA segment has seen no change to the difficult operating environment
articulated in our recent results. Currency devaluations have continued and our Nigerian business had a
particularly challenging quarter marred by Xenophobic attacks. Overall our Supermarkets Non-RSA
segment's sales declined 4.9%. Management is assessing the performance of the Supermarkets Non-RSA
segment, with specific reference to the Group's return on capital invested in Africa.

The Group's other operating segments, which include the OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite
pharmacies and Checkers Food Services, reported a 6.4% increase in sales. The OK Franchise division grew
sales by 8.6%.

Across our three supermarket trading brands Usave, Shoprite and Checkers the Group opened 15 new
stores during the quarter: eight Usaves (four of them the smaller eKasi format), four Shoprites and three
Checkers stores. Our furniture store base reduced by a net 10 stores. Liquorshop added a net 10 stores
to reach a milestone 500 stores. Our OK Franchise division grew its base by a net 10 stores in the quarter.

Not included in these new store openings is the re-launch of our existing Johannesburg based Sandton
City Checkers Hyper in late September. This store is a flagship for the Checkers FreshX format and the
store re-opening is surpassing our expectations.

Developing and subsequently selling properties has been, and continues to be, a Shoprite Group strategy.
During our year-end results we articulated plans to sell and lease-back certain non-strategic properties
and we can confirm we are finalising the terms and conditions of the sale and lease-back of two of our
older distribution centres (DCs) - our Western Cape Brackenfell DC and our Gauteng Centurion DC. These
transactions will not impact our operational control nor management of these facilities. We expect these
sales to be finalised during the second half of our 2020 financial year.

Following the successful IT replatforming of the Group's store base across 15 countries, the Group is now
able to shift focus to optimising the business. The Group took an important step in engineering the next
era of growth in October with the launch of our Xtra Savings Rewards Programme in all Checkers stores
nationally.

To date, the Xtra Savings Rewards Programme take up has exceeded expectations with more than a million
members signing up after just one week. It marries advanced data processing with marketing automation
into a powerful personalisation engine. This launch aligns with the Group's focus to ensure our customers
save more every day, paving the way for smarter decision-making and precision retailing. It also unlocks
alternate revenue streams from existing and new customers.

With the momentum achieved during the first quarter, the Group enters the important festive trading
period with confidence in our operations and Group brand strategy both of which position us to deliver
unsurpassed value to our 35 million customers across South Africa and the rest of Africa.

Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer

Our core operations, Supermarkets RSA's sales growth of 4.9%, with like-for-
like sales growth of 1.9%, is a performance significantly impacted by our 
well documented first half challenges. With the strike in the DC behind us, 
our team worked tirelessly to restore performance in the second half. It is 
pleasing to report that we ended the year with our final quarter's sales in 
Supermarkets RSA growing by 9.4%. Our in-stock levels are now higher than 
prior to our system implementation and without compromising on our low price 
leadership, we achieved a second half trading margin in Supermarkets RSA of 
5.5%.

We've continued with our growth strategy to capture a larger share of the 
premium food segment through the ongoing Checkers repositioning. The number 
of Checkers stores in the new look FreshX format now totals 21. We are most 
pleased with returns from these upgrades and, therefore, our medium to long-
term target of 80 stores in this format remains unchanged. Our focus on the 
core Shoprite and Usave customers, who we strive to serve with excellence 
daily, has remained strong as we continue to bring affordable food retail 
into the communities where our customers reside. 

Notwithstanding the much improved recent performance in our core 
Supermarkets RSA division, which generates 74.9% of our sales and grew 
second half sales by 7.4%, it was a testing year. A constrained economy, 
inventory shortages post industrial action and the implementation of a new 
enterprise wide IT system across our store base resulted in lost sales. With 
affordability remaining the top priority for our customers, we 
unquestionably stood by our lowest price promise. Selling price inflation in 
our Supermarkets RSA division for the year measured only 1.2%, and similar 
to last year, we traded throughout the year with many items in key 
categories in deflation. At year-end, the number of products priced lower 
than last year measured at 9 679.

Ongoing forex shortages, currency devaluations and the aftermath of rampant 
inflation in Angola and its ongoing impact on affordability took a further 
toll on our Non-RSA business. Supermarkets Non-RSA reported a trading loss 
of R265 million for the year. Despite no foreseen respite in short-term 
trading conditions in the region, we are committed to our customers in the 
14 Non-RSA countries in which we operate. We remain confident in the 
opportunity our entrenched position as Africa's leading food retailer will 
bring as the economic fortunes of the countries where we trade improve. 
Given the challenging global economic backdrop, we are remaining focused on 
growth opportunities in our home market, inclusive of our established 
African operations, rather than pursuing businesses in foreign geographies. 

Social responsibility has and always will be a priority for the Group. 
Amongst many initiatives focused on improving the lives of our fellow South 
Africans, it is noteworthy that this year we sold a record of 53 million 
subsidised deli meals and 58 million loaves of brown bread, both for under

OPERATIONAL UPDATE AND TRADING UPDATE

Pieter Engelbrecht, Chief Executive:

""Emerging from a transformational year in 2018, which resulted in only marginal sales growth in
the first half to December, we are pleased to report improved growth in the second half with
Group sales up 6.5% (excluding hyperinflation impact). This performance was driven mainly by
our Supermarkets RSA operation growing sales by 7.4% in the six months to June 2019 and
9.4% in the final quarter. The market share gain in the most recent quarter is testament to our
core South African business being back to full operational strength.

Trading conditions in the rest of Africa remain relentless as the results attest but given our
optimism for the long-term food retail opportunity on the continent, we remain resolute in our
purpose to be Africa's most affordable and accessible retailer.

The combination of on-going low food inflation in South Africa and currency devaluations in the
rest of Africa have resulted in this being a most challenging year, however the continued
improvement throughout the second half is pleasing and product availability now surpasses pre-
system implementation levels.

We honoured our promise of lower prices, serving more than 1.1 billion customers in the year.
Better customer service levels and recent market share gains are indicative that the challenges
following last year's industrial action and the successful deployment of our new enterprise-wide
system are now behind us. We look forward to the returns from the new capabilities this large
scale system implementation has enabled. Shoprite has emerged a stronger, fitter retailer with
many exciting innovations underway.

The Group's expansion remains on track with 80 new supermarkets opened in the period and
88 planned for the next year. The Shoprite team is making headway in all of our strategic areas
of focus; including advancing our digital transformation agenda, growing Checkers' share of
premium food retail, building a better franchise offer and increasing our private label penetration.
Ultimately these have all laid a stronger foundation for growth in the medium term.""

Operational update (52 weeks ended 30 June 2019)

Excluding hyperinflation, the Group increased total turnover by 3.2% (0.1% like for like) to
approximately R150.6 billion in the period to June 2019. The Group's supermarkets increased
the number of customers served by 2.3% and product volumes sold by 1.2%. Including the
impact of the Angolan hyperinflation accounting adjustment, Group turnover increased by 3.6%
for the full year.

The Group adopted IFRS 15 with effect from 2 July 2018 and these results include the required
restatements.
Segmental sales performance for the twelve months to June 2019 (excluding the impact of
hyperinflation) is as follows:

The following provides context to the overall turnover growth for the twelve months:

       -     The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, achieved 4.9% sales growth for the
             period (like for like growth: 1.9%) with an improved second half in which sales
             increased by 7.4% on the back of better customer and volume growth, as well as an
             improvement in on-shelf availability and promotional effectiveness. The full year
             performance should be viewed in the context of a first half that was impacted by the
             completion of our multi-year ERP IT system re-platforming as well as the aftermath
             of the May and June 2018 industrial action at our largest DC in Gauteng.
             Supermarkets RSA had a strong Easter sales period and the momentum culminated
             in final quarter sales growth of 9.4% and the Group reclaiming market share.
       -     Internal inflation for the year averaged just 1.2% for Supermarkets RSA. Despite an
             uptick towards year end, it remained lower for longer than was anticipated with 9,679
             items still in deflation in June, many of which are in categories in which the Group
             commands a higher than average market share.
       -     The Checkers chain led the supermarkets' growth, making strides in improving our
             fresh offer and gaining market share in fresh produce and convenience meals. The
             accelerated rollout of our new FreshX concept stores is showing exceptional
             performance.
       -     Shoprite's growth for the year was subdued given the reliance on many food
             categories in deflation as well as the vulnerability of it's core target consumers to
             prevailing economic headwinds. Whilst the primary Shoprite consumer base
             remains under significant pressure in a strained economy, the Shoprite brand has
             retained its price leadership, evidenced in the market share gains in the most recent
             quarter.
       -     Sales growth in the Usave format was hardest hit in the first half by the combination
             of deflation and the supply chain issues causing out of stocks in Gauteng, its largest
             regional market.
       -     The improvement in our private label offer has seen its participation to RSA sales
             grow by a further 30 basis points, offering better value to consumers from budget to
             super premium categories.
       -     LiquorShop remained a standout performer recording strong double digit growth for
             the period. This week marks a significant milestone as we are set to open our 500th
             store.
       -     Online sales which encompass Click & Collect orders and our on-demand liquor
             home delivery partnership has increased 386% with rapid customer acceptance.
       -     Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline in turnover of 7.7% which impacted the
             overall Group sales performance (on a constant currency basis, turnover for the year
             increased by 0.9%). The second half saw the decline in sales slowing to 0.8% from
             the -13.3% in the first half. The underperformance was primarily a result of currency
             devaluations in the major countries where the Group trades in the rest of Africa,
             which negatively impacted sales in rand terms. The rebasing of the sales
             performance in the Angolan operation, the largest contributor in our Non-RSA
             portfolio, remained a drag on the overall Group performance. Angola's supermarkets
             sales declined 38.4% in rand terms after the dramatic 105.4% devaluation of the
             Angola kwanza to the US dollar since January 2018, combined with an economic
             recession.
        -    Excluding Angola, Supermarkets Non-RSA achieved positive sales growth of 5.8%
             in constant currency amidst difficult macroeconomic conditions persisting in all
             territories.
        -    During the financial year, the currencies of the other large countries in which we
             trade, namely Zambia and Nigeria, also showed a sharp decline against the US
             dollar of 29.4% and 17.9% respectively.
        -    The Group's Furniture division increased sales by 4.0% for the period, affected
             particularly by the Non-RSA operating environment.
        -    Other operating segments (OK Franchise, Medirite Pharmacy and Checkers Food
             Services) achieved pleasing growth of 10.0%.

TRADING UPDATE AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE

Notwithstanding the acceleration in Supermarkets RSA's second half sales, increases in the
cost of employment from new legislation, rent and electricity exceeded the year's overall top line
growth given the impact of first half factors. Predominantly, the lost sales following industrial
action at our largest distribution centre as well as the gross margin adjustment relating to the
change to the moving average method of accounting for inventory, have resulted in lower
profitability than the prior year. Pleasingly though, trading profit increased in the second half at
a pace ahead of turnover growth.

As a result of forex shortages and local currency weakness, the profitability of Supermarkets
Non-RSA deteriorated meaningfully in the second half resulting in a trading loss for the period.

The Group therefore anticipates lower earnings per share (""EPS"") and headline earnings per
share (""HEPS"") (after taking hyperinflation into account) for the full year ended 30 June 2019,
falling within the ranges below:

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment
For the period ended 30 June 2019, the economy of Angola was still assessed to be
hyperinflationary. The Group therefore continued the application of hyperinflation accounting in
Angola for the period under review.

The Group discloses the unaudited hyperinflation adjustment information in order to indicate the
effect of the restatement due to the change in the general price index of the hyperinflationary
economy.

To present this information, the functional currency of Angola is adjusted to take into account
the value of money at the end of the reporting period.
The financial impact of hyperinflation on the current period's turnover is shown below:

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure
The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the Group's
Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales growth, excluding
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this information, current period turnover
for entities reporting in currencies other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into
ZAR at the prior year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country basis. In
addition, in respect of Angola, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding
the impact of hyperinflation.

The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the actual results for the
period, in reported currency and constant currency for the following major currencies. The total
impact on Supermarkets Non-RSA is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this

UPDATE ON THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH THE SHOPRITE HOLDINGS
DEFERRED SHARES


Following the announcement by Shoprite Holdings on 18 April 2019 (""Detailed Terms
Announcement"") relating to the Company's consideration of a potential acquisition and
cancellation of all the Shoprite Holdings' deferred shares (""Proposed Transaction""), the
Company has engaged extensively with its shareholders holding over two-thirds of its
issued ordinary share capital, excluding shares held by Thibault Square Financial
Services Proprietary Limited (""Thibault"") and Titan Premier Investments Proprietary
Limited (""Titan"").

As noted in the Detailed Terms Announcement, one of the suspensive conditions to the
Proposed Transaction, which was to be met by 31 May 2019, was that the Company has
not received written notifications from shareholders excluding Thibault and Titan and its
related and inter-related parties (""Other Shareholders""), who in aggregate hold more
than 15% of the total issued ordinary shares held by Other Shareholders, indicating that
they will not vote in favour of the required special resolutions. This was in the interest of
good corporate governance and goes beyond the requirements of the required regulatory
special resolution.

Since the release of the Detailed Terms Announcement and during the period of
shareholder engagement, the Company received broad in principle support for the
cancellation of the Shoprite Holdings' deferred shares. Despite this support, Shoprite
Holdings received written notifications from more than 15% of Other Shareholders
indicating that they will not vote in favour of the special resolutions required to
implement the Proposed Transaction. Accordingly, the parties to the tripartite agreement
relating to the Proposed Transaction entered into on 18 April 2019 (""Transaction

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND BOARD COMMITTEES

Shoprite Holdings' shareholders (""Shareholders"") are advised that Mr EC Kieswetter, an
independent non-executive director of Shoprite Holdings, has commenced his role as the
Commissioner of the South Africa Revenue Service on 1 May 2019. As a result of his new role,
Mr Kieswetter has, subject to obtaining an exemption from the application of Regulation 108(2)
of the Regulations (""Regulations"") issued under the Companies Act, No 71 of 2008, as amended
(""Companies Act""), tendered his resignation as a director of Shoprite Holdings on 30 April
2019. Consequently, he has also resigned as lead independent director, chairperson of the
remuneration committee and member of the nominations committee of Shoprite Holdings.

In terms of Regulation 108(2) of the Regulations a director of a company may not resign as a
director during the period from the publication of firm intention announcement until the offer
that the announcement deals with is declared unconditional or lapses or is withdrawn. Shoprite
published such an announcement on 19 April 2019 in respect of a proposed transaction, the
details which were published on SENS on 18 April 2019 (""Detailed Terms Announcement"").

The Takeover Regulation Panel established in terms of section 196 of the Companies Act has on
3 May 2019 granted an exemption to Mr Kieswetter from complying with Regulation 108(2) of
the Regulations. The resignation of Mr Kieswetter described above accordingly became effective
on 6 May 2019.

The Takeover Regulation Panel has granted the exemption on a condition that in the event the
Company decides to replace Mr. Kieswetter or fill the role that he played within the Company,
in relation to the affected transaction, the Company must endeavour to appoint, or fill such role
with, a director that is independent and capable of fulfilling the role played by Mr Kieswetter in
the Company during the offer period.

The board of directors of Shoprite Holdings (""Board"") wishes to thank Mr Kieswetter for his
valuable contribution during his tenure as a director. In particular, the Board would like to
express its gratitude to him for the leading role that he has played over the last few months in
relation to the proposed transaction.

The Company continues to engage with Shareholders on the proposed transaction as outlined
in the Detailed Terms Announcement.

Further announcements relating to the Board and committee appointments will be made in due
course.

DETAILED TERMS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH THE SHOPRITE
DEFERRED SHARES AND A WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY (INCORPORATING A
FIRM INTENTION ANNOUNCEMENT IN TERMS OF REGULATION 101 OF THE
REGULATIONS ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, ACT 71 OF 2008)



1.   Introduction

     Shoprite Holdings' ordinary shareholders (""Shareholders"") are referred to the
     cautionary announcement released on the stock exchange news service operated by
     the JSE Limited (""JSE"") (""SENS"") on 26 February 2019 and subsequent renewal of
     the cautionary announcement released on SENS on 9 April 2019, relating to the
     Company's consideration of a potential acquisition and cancellation of all the Shoprite
     Holdings deferred shares (""Deferred Shares"") comprising of 264,969,112 Deferred
     Shares and 32.3% of the votes in Shoprite Holdings in issue (the ""Proposed
     Transaction""), being the Deferred Shares in issue other than the Additional Deferred
     Shares referred to hereunder.

     On 18 April 2019, Shoprite Holdings entered into a tripartite agreement with Thibault
     Square Financial Services Proprietary Limited (""Thibault"") and Titan Premier
     Investments Proprietary Limited (""Titan"") on the salient terms detailed below
     (""Transaction Agreement"").

     The directors of the Shoprite Holdings board, excluding Dr Wiese and his alternate
     director JD Wiese (""Board""), being cognisant of the actual and potential conflicts
     between the position of Thibault, Titan and their related and inter-related parties
     (""Titan Group"") and Shoprite Holdings in relation to the Proposed Transaction, has
     taken due care to ensure that its independence has been and will remain in place for
     the duration of the Proposed Transaction.

     The Proposed Transaction is subject to the suspensive conditions set out in
     paragraph 3, which includes the adoption of the special resolutions by the requisite
     number of Shareholders, other than the Titan Group (the Shareholders other than
     the Titan Group are hereinafter referred to as the ""Minority Shareholders"") in terms
     of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008, as amended (""Companies Act"") and in terms
     of the Listings Requirements of the JSE (the ""Listings Requirements"").

2.   Rationale of the Proposed Transaction

     The Board is of the view that the Proposed Transaction will have the following
     benefits for the Company and its Shareholders:

         -   simplify the Company's voting share structure and align the Company with
             international best corporate governance practice;
         -   all shares in the Company post implementation of the Proposed Transaction
             will have equal economic and voting rights. Voting interest of Minority
             Shareholders, will increase from c.57.7% to c.82.2% (representing an equal
             proportion to Shareholders' economic rights in the Company post the
             implementation of the Proposed Transaction);
        -    together with being a simpler and more equitable shareholding structure, the
             post transaction single class of ordinary shares is believed to be more
             appealing to institutional investors and may therefore have a positive impact
             on the demand for the Company's shares; and
        -    the cancellation of the Deferred Shares removes uncertainty around a future
             sale of Thibault and thus a transfer of significant influence over Shoprite
             Holdings to a third party.

3.   Key terms of the Transaction Agreement

     The Proposed Transaction will be implemented through the specific issue of
     20,000,000 new Shoprite Holdings ordinary shares (""Consideration Shares"") to Titan
     in exchange for the agreement by Titan to acquire the Shoprite Holdings ordinary
     shares held by Thibault (""Disposal Ordinary Shares"") and causing the acquisition and
     cancellation of the Deferred Shares by Shoprite Holdings. The issuance of the
     Consideration Shares will result in an economic dilution to Shareholders of c.3.5%.
     The Proposed Transaction will be categorised as a small related party transaction in
     terms of the Listings Requirements.

     Shoprite Holdings is already entitled to acquire 40,652,489 Deferred Shares
     (""Additional Deferred Shares"") as explained below. The acquisition by Titan of the
     Disposal Ordinary Shares will, in accordance with the terms of Shoprite Holdings'
     memorandum of incorporation, result therein that Shoprite Holdings will also acquire
     and cancel the Deferred Shares (other than the Additional Deferred Shares)
     (""Transaction Deferred Shares"") for a nominal consideration of 0.1 cent per share.
     The total consideration to be paid to acquire all the Transaction Deferred Shares is
     approximately R265,000.

     The acquisition by Shoprite Holdings of all of the Deferred Shares, pursuant to
     section 48 of the Companies Act, is subject to the provisions of sections 114 and 115
     of the Companies Act and therefore treated as a scheme of arrangement.

     The Proposed Transaction will be subject to standard warranties and the
     Consideration Shares will be subject to a 180-day lock-up period.

     The Proposed Transaction is subject to, inter alia, the following suspensive
     conditions:

     -       to be met by no later than 31 May 2019:

                 -     the Company has not received written notices from Minority Shareholders
                       who in aggregate hold more than 15% of the total issued Ordinary Shares
                       held by the Minority Shareholders, indicating that they will not vote in
                       favour of the required special resolution, post engagement with Minority
                       Shareholders.

         -       to be met by no later than 30 September 2019:

                 -     the Board and the independent board constituted in terms of the
                       Companies Act comprising of Mr EC Kieswetter, Mr JF Basson, Dr ATM
                       Mokgokong, Ms AM le Roux, Mr JA Rock and Prof SA Zinn (""Independent
                       Board""), have adopted the resolutions required to implement the Proposed
                       Transaction;

                 -     the Board has received an independent expert report in terms of section
                       114(3) of the Companies Act that is acceptable to the Board;
                 -     the Board and/or the Independent Board has received an opinion from an
                       independent expert that reflects that the Proposed Transaction is both fair
                       and reasonable;

                 -     the JSE and Takeover Regulation Panel (""TRP"") have provided the required
                       approvals or exemptions in order to implement the Proposed Transaction;

                 -     the financial institutions that hold any form of encumbrance over the
                       Disposal Ordinary Shares have in writing unconditionally agreed to release
                       the Disposal Ordinary Shares from those encumbrances to enable the
                       Disposal Ordinary Shares to be transferred to Titan;

                 -     Thibault has delivered a certificate signed by the auditors of Thibault to the
                       Company in terms whereof its auditors certify that immediately after the
                       Disposal Ordinary Shares have been transferred and the Consideration
                       Shares have been issued, the fair market value of the assets of Thibault
                       will exceed the aggregate amount of the liabilities of Thibault;

                  -    the required resolutions have been adopted by the requisite number of
                       Minority Shareholders, at a general meeting of Shareholders (""General
                       Meeting"");

                  -    Shareholders not holding more than 2% of all Shoprite Holdings' issued
                       Ordinary Shares have exercised appraisal rights in terms of section 164 of
                       the Companies Act; and

                  -    Shareholders have not exercised their rights in terms of section 115(3) of
                       the Companies Act or if Shareholders do exercise those rights, the court
                       has finally approved the special resolutions and the Proposed Transaction
                       or finally rejected an application to review the special resolutions and the
                       Proposed Transaction, as the case may be.

         Some of those conditions that are not of a regulatory nature may be waived by the
         Company or jointly by the parties hereto.

         Additional Deferred Shares

         Unrelated to the Proposed Transaction, in December 2017 Thibault sold a number
         of Ordinary Shares held by it at the time. The effect thereof was that Shoprite
         Holdings became entitled to acquire the Additional Deferred Shares, in accordance
         with the terms of Shoprite Holdings' memorandum of incorporation. On fulfillment
         of the above suspensive conditions the Company will accordingly acquire and cancel
         all the Transaction Deferred Shares as well as the Additional Deferred Shares held
         by Thibault. The effect thereof will be that on completion of those acquisitions
         Shoprite Holdings will have no more issued Deferred Shares. The Additional
         Deferred Shares have not been included in any of the voting percentages calculated
         in this announcement as the rights to exercise any voting rights in respect of the
         Additional Deferred Shares have lapsed and Thibault has undertaken not to exercise
         any voting rights in respect of these shares prior to the cancellation thereof.

         The approvals required to implement the Proposed Transaction, as detailed above,
         will therefore also include approvals for the acquisition and cancellation of the
         Additional Deferred Shares.

         Effective date

         The effective date of the Proposed Transaction is expected to be when all the
         suspensive conditions have been met, which is expected to be on or before
         30 September 2019.


     4. Process

       Board

       The following process was followed by Shoprite Holdings to ensure its
       independence:

       -   the Board appointed an independent committee to negotiate and evaluate the
           benefits of the Proposed Transaction for Shoprite Holdings and its
           Shareholders;

       -   the Board independently evaluated the Proposed Transaction without the
           presence of the Titan Group, its appointed directors and its financial advisors;
           and

       -   the Board appointed independent financial advisors.

      Independent expert

      The Board has appointed Ernst and Young Advisory Services Proprietary Limited
      (""EY"") as the independent expert, as required in terms of the Listings Requirements
      and Companies Act.

      EY has furnished a draft opinion to the Board that considers the Proposed Transaction
      to be both fair and reasonable to Shareholders (the ""Draft Independent Expert
      Opinion""). The Draft Independent Expert Opinion is subject to the limitations and
      conditions, normal for a transaction of this nature, to be set out in the final opinion
      and subject to the required regulatory approvals.

5.    Impact of the Proposed Transaction on the economic and voting interest of
      Shareholders

      Following the issuance of the Consideration Shares the total voting interest of
      Minority Shareholders will increase from c.57.7% to c.82.2%, while their economic
      interest will dilute by c.3.5% (calculated using the total Ordinary Shares in issue less
      treasury shares of 35,436,572, which are shares owned by Shoprite Holdings' main
      trading subsidiary, Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Ltd).

      The voting interest of the Titan Group will decrease from c.42.3% to c.17.8% and
      its economic interest will increase from c.14.8% to c.17.8%.

6.    Potential financial impact of the Proposed Transaction

      The Proposed Transaction is expected to result in a potential once-off reduction in
      earnings and headline earnings of c.R3.3 billion, based on a 30-day-volume-
      weighted-average-price of R165.35 per share as at 17 April 2019, for indicative
      purposes, in Shoprite Holdings' results for the financial year in which the Proposed
      Transaction is approved. The once-off reduction in earnings is mainly as a result of
      the recognition of Shoprite Holdings' commitment to issue the Consideration Shares
      (as referred to above) and will not have an impact on Shoprite Holdings' cash
      resources.

      In addition, the total Ordinary Shares in issue will increase from 591,338,502 to
      611,338,502 post the issuance of the Consideration Shares, which will affect the
      earnings and headline earnings per share calculations.

      Other than as explained above, the Proposed Transaction is not expected to have
      any direct material impact on the future earnings or cash flow of Shoprite Holdings.
      Shareholders are advised that the above potential financial impact and statements
      contained in this announcement have not been reviewed by Shoprite Holdings'
      auditors or a reporting accountant, are provided for illustrative purposes only and
      are the responsibility of the Board.

      Further details on the financial impact of the Proposed Transaction will be provided
      in a circular to be posted to Shareholders.

7.    Shoprite Holdings share capital

      Shoprite Holdings currently has sufficient authorised but unissued Ordinary Shares
      to issue the Consideration Shares.

8.    Cash confirmation provided to the TRP

      Shoprite Holdings delivered to the TRP a confirmation from Werksmans Attorneys
      confirming that Werksmans Attorneys holds an amount equal to the cash
      consideration required to be paid to acquire all the Deferred Shares, other than the
      Additional Deferred Shares, in trust for Shoprite Holdings (in conformity with
      Regulation 111(4) of the Regulations in terms of the Companies Act) (""Cash
      Confirmation""). The Cash Confirmation is for a nominal amount of approximately
      R265,000.

9.    Intention of Titan post the Proposed Transaction

      Immediately post the Proposed Transaction, the Titan Group will remain Shoprite
      Holdings' largest shareholder. The Titan Group has indicated to Shoprite Holdings
      that its intention is to remain a long-term Shareholder. In addition, Dr Wiese has
      indicated his intention post the Proposed Transaction to remain as chairman of the
      board of directors of Shoprite Holdings.

10.   Notice of General Meeting

      A circular incorporating a notice of General Meeting to be held on or about
      25 June 2019 containing further information in relation to the Proposed Transaction
      will be posted to Shareholders on or about 27 May 2019, subject to the outcome of
      engagement with Shoprite Holdings' major Minority Shareholders.

11.   Responsibility statement

      The Independent Board accepts responsibility for the information contained in this
      announcement. To the best of its knowledge and belief, the information contained in
      this announcement is true and nothing has been omitted which is likely to affect the
      importance of the information.

12.   Shareholder rights

      Dissenting shareholders

      A Shareholder who is entitled to vote at the General Meeting is entitled to seek relief
      in terms of section 164 of the Companies Act if that Shareholder notified Shoprite
      Holdings in advance in writing of its intention to oppose the special resolution to be
      put to Shareholders in terms of sections 48, 114 and 115 of the Companies Act to
      approve the acquisition of the Deferred Shares (""Scheme Resolution""), was present
      at the General Meeting and voted against the special resolution. A copy of section
      164 will be included in the circular to be posted to Shareholders. In this regard
      Shareholders are also referred to the suspensive conditions above.
      Court approval

      Shareholders are advised that in terms of section 115(3) of the Companies Act,
      despite the Scheme Resolution having been adopted, Shoprite Holdings may not
      proceed to implement that resolution without the approval of a court if the resolution
      was opposed by at least 15% of the voting rights that were exercised on that
      resolution and, within five business days after the vote, any person who voted
      against the resolution requires Shoprite Holdings to seek court approval; or the
      court, on an application within 10 business days after the vote by any person who
      voted against the resolution, grants that person leave to apply to a court for a review
      of the transaction in accordance with section 115(3). In this regard Shareholders are
      also referred to the suspensive conditions above.

13.   Cautionary withdrawal

      Shareholders are advised that following the release of full details of the Proposed
      Transaction, Shareholders no longer need to exercise caution when dealing in their
      Ordinary Shares.

CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S CONSIDERATION
OF A POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OR REDEMPTION, AND CANCELLATION OF ALL
THE SHOPRITE HOLDINGS DEFERRED SHARES IN ISSUE



1.   Background

     Shoprite Holdings' capital structure currently consists of two share classes, being
     Shoprite Holdings ordinary shares and Shoprite Holdings deferred shares
     (""Deferred Shares""). All the Deferred Shares are held by Thibault Square Financial
     Services Proprietary Limited (""Thibault""), which carries approximately 32.3% of the
     voting rights of Shoprite Holdings. The Company has entered into exclusive in-
     principle discussions with Thibault and its shareholders with regards to the
     acquisition or redemption, and cancellation of the Deferred Shares to ensure that
     the Company's economic and voting rights are fully aligned (""Proposed
     Transaction"").

2.   Rationale of Proposed Transaction

     The Proposed Transaction will simplify the Company's voting share structure and
     align the Company with international best corporate governance practice.
     Furthermore, the Proposed Transaction will ensure that all remaining shares in the
     Company have equal economic and voting rights.

3.   Process

     An independent board of the Company has been constituted to consider the
     Proposed Transaction and the Company has appointed Investec Bank Limited as
     Financial Adviser to the Company. Furthermore, an independent expert has been
     appointed to opine on the Proposed Transaction.

4.   Cautionary

     The Proposed Transaction, if concluded, may impact the price of the securities of
     Shoprite Holdings. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when
     dealing in the securities of Shoprite Holdings until a further announcement is
     made.

Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer:

2018 has been a transformational year for the Group, which remains Africa's

largest and most profitable retailer. Our first half performance is below

expectations, but not a reflection of the fundamental strength of the

business. The results for the six months were affected by an overlapping of

multiple factors disrupting the trading environment.



These include factors in our external operating environment, where economic

conditions have left our core customer under significant financial pressure

and in which significant currency devaluations severely impacted the

performance in the Non-RSA operations. 



At the same time, we have dealt with many internal challenges, investment

expenses and operational issues relating to the implementation of strategic

decisions including the roll out of the new SAP ERP system. The IT

replatforming was an absolute imperative and represents the culmination of

four years of planning, and it will ultimately improve our global

competitiveness.



In addition to a weak economy, 2018 saw a convergence of four main 

disruptive factors:

- The dramatic devaluation in the Angola kwanza by 85.1% against the 

  dollar since January 2018.

- The supply chain disruption caused by the Centurion Distribution Centre

  (DC) industrial action in May and June which lasted longer than

  anticipated.

- Supply issues coincided with more than half of the business going live 

  on the IT system in the six months and adversely impacted product

  availability for customers.

- RSA internal inflation remains low at only 0.4% marking the longest 

  period of stagnant inflation in a decade. In December customers still

  benefitted from 10 719 items in selling price deflation.



Other environmental issues also affected demand from price-sensitive

customers, namely: the listeriosis crisis affecting processed meat sales,

SA's first VAT hike in 25 years and the new Sugar Tax.



Product availability has improved but a lot of work still needs to be done

and remains our number one priority in the short term. We have continued to

invest in the business through the cycle in new store rollouts and the

digital transformation of the Group.



Despite the tougher set of results, we served a record number of customers

and sold record product volumes, up 1.7% and 0.2% respectively, whilst

supermarket space growth was 1.9%. Strategic decisions to invest in

convenience foods, our fresh offer, private label and our liquor footprint

also continue to bear fruit.



The positive sales trend emerging in the festive season has continued in

January and February alongside improving product availability.

COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS



Diluted headline earnings per share

The decline in diluted headline earnings per share of 24.1% is mainly 

attributable to:



Underperformance of the Non-RSA operations

The Supermarkets Non-RSA segment reported a trading loss of R61.8 million 

versus a trading profit of R552.7 million in the corresponding period.



The decline is mainly attributed to the unprecedented 85.1% currency 

devaluation (against the USD since January 2018) in Angola. As a result, 

gross margin was under pressure with the inability to pass on cost inflation 

to consumers in the selling prices of goods. The Angolan economy remains in 

recession, adversely affecting consumption expenditure in the country, with 

mostly our price sensitive customers being unable to maintain spending 

levels.



Accounting for Angola hyperinflation

For the six months to December 2018, the economy of Angola was again 

assessed to be hyperinflationary. As a result, the Group accounted for the 

results of its Angolan operations on a hyperinflationary basis in accordance 

with IAS 29. The comparative interim results were not restated. 



A summary of the primary adjustments as a result are as follows:

- A decrease in gross profit: R10 million

- An increase in depreciation: R49 million

- A net monetary gain: R439 million



Impact of changing from retail method of accounting (""RMA"") to moving 

average cost (""MAC"")

A R95.2 million adjustment as a result of the transition from RMA to MAC 

reduced the gross margin. All stores and DC's are now operating on the basis 

of MAC.



Centurion DC industrial action impact and supply chain disruptions 

All stores are now live on the new SAP ERP system. The industrial action at 

the Centurion DC in May and June 2018, together with the SAP cutover that 

followed in August 2018 in the Gauteng region, meant that we were unable to 

adequately meet store demand which affected product availability for 

consumers in the largest portion of our RSA business. Estimated lost store 

sales resulting from stock issues exceeded R1 billion in the period. 

Temporarily switching many suppliers to direct store deliveries during large 

promotions adversely affected distribution fee income. On-shelf product 

availability is much improved since October 2018 but more work remains to be 

done.



Statement of Comprehensive Income



Sale of merchandise

Total sales for the Group increased by 0.2% for the 26 weeks to 30 December 

2018 from R75.7 billion to R75.8 billion. Like-for-like sales declined by 

2.7%. Supermarkets RSA reported sales growth of 2.6% which, on a like-for-

like basis, declined by 0.5% while Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline 

in sales of 13.3% with a like-for-like decline of 16.5%. In constant 

currencies Supermarkets Non-RSA grew 0.05%.



The Group's Furniture division increased sales by 4.3% for the period, while 

other operating segments (OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite Pharmacy and 

Checkers Food Services) achieved turnover growth of 6.5%.



Expenses

Total expenses increased by 5.6%. 



Depreciation and amortisation grew at a higher rate than the sale of 

merchandise, mainly due to new store openings, our continued store 

refurbishment programme as well as the depreciation impact of hyperinflation 

(R49 million). During the six month reporting period a net 55 new corporate 

stores were opened (excluding the Hungry Lion stores held for sale and sold 

during the preceding 12 months). 



The 7.4% increase in operating lease expenses is due to the increase in rent 

paid and rates and taxes. The rent paid on existing stores in Supermarkets 

RSA increased in line with CPI. Currency devaluations in various Non-RSA 

countries had a negative impact on USD leases in Supermarkets Non-RSA.

 

Cost of employment rose by 6.2% and includes the agreed upon increase as 

part of the new two-year wage negotiations settlement. Escalation in 

expenses, such as water and electricity of 6.1%, were largely beyond the 

control of the Group due to electricity tariff increases being set by NERSA. 



Trading margin

The trading margin, at 4.4%, is lower than the corresponding period's 5.4% 

on the back of a decrease in gross margin from 23.8% to 23.1% and expense 

growth of 5.6%. The 4.4% trading margin achieved by the Group remains 

competitive relative to its local and international peer group.



Exchange rate losses

The Group recorded an exchange rate loss of R3.4 million for the reporting 

period mainly due to the currency devaluation in the Angola kwanza and 

Zambia kwacha since June 2018. The hedging strategy followed by the Group to 

minimise the exchange rate losses in Angola comprised of the purchase of USD 

Index Linked Government Bonds and Treasury Bills. Interest earned on these 

instruments amounted to R177.8 million and is reported as part of other 

operating income.



Finance cost and interest received

Net finance costs increased as a result of an additional R2.5 billion in net 

borrowings due to funding required for capital projects and expansion of 

Supermarkets Non-RSA. The devaluation of the rand against the USD had a 

negative impact on finance costs payable on offshore USD medium-term 

borrowings. 



Statement of Financial Position



Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 86 new corporate outlets 

during the past 12 months, which included more own stores built, vacant land 

purchased for strategic purposes and distribution centres. The investment in 

information technology remains high and the Group plans to continue 

investing in the medium term given the demands of modern retailing. The 

Group has also started a process of selling non-strategic properties that 

will reflect in the results for the 12 months to June 2019.



Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The main increase in cash at reporting date is due to month-end cut-off for 

accounts payable as well as the increase in long-term borrowings. This was 

offset by the investment in capital expenditure and investment in USD Index 

Linked Angola Government Bonds to hedge against possible further devaluation 

of the Angola kwanza. During the period under review the Angolan operations 

managed to repatriate USD67 million which had a positive impact on the cash 

flow of the Group. 



Inventory

Inventory decreased by 0.3% to R21.7 billion. Supermarkets RSA, including 

the distribution centres, increased inventory by R800 million to 

R15.6 billion due to the provisioning of new corporate outlets as well 

as the increased capacity created by the new Cilmor food distribution 

centre in the Western Cape. The Supermarkets Non-RSA division reported 

a decrease in inventory as a result of the translation from local 

currency to rand due to the currency devaluation in Angola and Nigeria 

and overall improved stock management.



Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables increased by 2.6% on the previous year due to 

month-end cut-off of trade accounts payable as reflected in the increase in 

net cash and cash equivalents.



Borrowings

Total borrowings increased by R4.4 billion to R10 billion as a result of an 

increase in offshore funding together with R2 billion medium-term funding 

secured in RSA. The Group is in the process of finalising medium-term local 

funding in Kenya and Zambia that will replace and reduce the reliance on USD 

funding.



GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

The new ERP system deployment is complete as of January 2019 after a

herculean effort by the Shoprite team. The next phase will focus on refining

and then mastering the new system that will ultimately provide us with

smarter pricing, inventory management and profitability management at item

level.



Since January 2019, an improved sales trend is evident. Various events in 

the second half of the previous financial year such as listeriosis, labour 

disruptions, a VAT hike and the Sugar Tax mean the next six months has a 

less demanding growth base than the preceding half. The new national minimum 

wage implemented in RSA from 2019 is expected to provide some additional 

sales impetus. Economic tailwinds remain limited and the impact of load-

shedding and political uncertainty ahead of the May 8th election make sales 

predictions difficult. On-shelf availability remains our highest priority 

and with the improved results, barring unforeseen external events, we are 

optimistic that the current sales momentum is sustainable.



We anticipate rising selling price inflation in the RSA business towards 

June, with inflation in key commodity categories such as maize, sugar and 

chicken expected. There are 36 new supermarket and liquor outlet openings 

planned for the six months ending June 2019. Our main priority is retaining 

customer trust.



The performance of Supermarkets Non-RSA is dependent on foreign currency 

availability in Angola and Nigeria together with stable currencies. The 

Angola kwanza has shown more stability since the start of January. There are 

seven new supermarket and liquor outlet openings planned for Non-RSA for the 

six months ending June 2019. 



Despite recent improvements following the decline in the interim diluted 

headline earnings per share, it is unlikely that the Group will be able to 

report full year growth on the previous year. 



The Group expects to issue an operational update for the year ending June 

2019 before the end of July 2019. The full year results will be available on

or about 20 August 2019.



PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Certain financial information presented in these condensed consolidated 

interim results for the 26 weeks ended 30 December 2018 constitutes pro 

forma financial information. The pro forma financial information is the 

responsibility of the board of directors of the Company and is presented for 

illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial 

information may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes 

in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial 

information has neither been reviewed nor been reported on by the Group's 

external auditors.



Like-for-like comparisons

Like-for-like sales is a measure of the growth in the Group's year-on-year 

sales, removing the impact of new store openings and closures in the current 

or previous reporting periods. In addition, in respect of Angola, the like-

for-like sales have been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation.

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment

For the period ended 30 December 2018, the economy of Angola was assessed to 

remain hyperinflationary. As a result, the Group accounted for the results 

of its Angolan operations on a hyperinflationary basis in accordance with 

IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. 



It is therefore useful and good governance to report pro forma information 

for the period under review which excludes the impact of hyperinflation. It 

will also facilitate comparisons against the prior period's results which 

were prepared before the application of hyperinflation accounting. 



The pro forma information was calculated through applying all the accounting 

policies adopted by the Group in the latest unaudited condensed consolidated 

interim results except for the hyperinflationary standard IAS 29.



The financial impact of hyperinflation on the current period's results is 

shown in the format of a pro forma statement of comprehensive income and a 

pro forma statement of financial position.

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the 

Group's Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales 

growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present 

this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in 

currencies other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR 

at the prior year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country 

basis. In addition, in respect of Angola, the constant currency information 

has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. For the period 

ended 30 December 2018, the economy of Angola was assessed to remain 

hyperinflationary. 



The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the 

actual results for the period, in reported currency and constant currency 

for the following major currencies. The total impact on Supermarkets Non-RSA 

is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this segment.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW 

The Group has consistently delivered strong results over the past two 

decades. The decline in headline earnings per share during the six months 

ending December 2018 must be viewed in the context of various critical 

expansion and technology projects the Group has embarked on in the past five 

years to ensure future growth and modernise our technology landscape. The 

timing unfortunately coincided with the deterioration of the RSA and Non-RSA 

economies and consumer expenditure levels over this same period.



Supermarkets RSA 

The core South African Supermarket operation, trading through 1 541 outlets 

and representing 74.0% of total sales, increased sales by 2.6% with a 

decline in trading profit of 15.1%. 



Supermarkets RSA's performance was affected by zero inflation or deflation 

in core categories, the distressed financial position of its customers and 

product availability challenges stemming from the Group's largest DC in 

Gauteng, which accounts for 53% of total centralised food distribution for 

the RSA supermarkets business. Industrial action followed by the deployment 

of our new ERP system shortly after the labour disruption hampered the 

ability to adequately meet demand which resulted in lost sales 

opportunities. The challenges have largely been arrested through multiple 

interventions, although we are not yet at targeted levels of efficiency.



The South African supermarket operations continued to serve more customers, 

growing transactions by 2%, while we also sold 0.7% more items. In December, 

a total of 10 719 items were selling at lower prices than a year prior, 

although lower than the 11 607 items in deflation at the end of September. 

This eased the burden on customers as we remained committed to our low price 

promise, but curtailed organic topline growth in the Shoprite and Usave 

operations in particular.



The Group's strategy to capture a greater proportion of the top-end affluent 

consumer segments' grocery expenditure has seen Checkers, excluding the 

larger format Hyper stores, increase sales by 4.3%. The opening and 

conversion of Checkers stores to our new FreshX concept currently stands at 

20 and the focus remains to transform a third of our Checkers store 

portfolio to this format. Coupled with continuous innovation and improvement 

in fresh, health and convenience food ranges, we are optimistic about the 

further value we can extract out of this segment in the medium term.



The Shoprite brand, with its focus on price-sensitive consumers, continued 

to subsidise the essential foods through additional food subsidies, putting 

more than R80 million back into the pockets of consumers. This includes our 

instore bakery bread, which has been selling at a subsidised price of R4.99 

for almost three years, a price in line with ten years ago. Shoprite's price 

leadership remains uncontested despite increased competitor promotional 

activity. Notwithstanding its shopper base being the hardest hit by 

prevailing economic conditions, Shoprite grew sales by 1.2% with zero 

internal food inflation for the period. The growth in the Shoprite and Usave 

brands were particularly affected by the Centurion DC industrial action, as 

deliveries to higher value stores were prioritised at the expense of far 

outlying rural stores. The 1.0% turnover decline in the Group's hard 

discounter format Usave also reflects the position that SA's most vulnerable 

consumers find themselves in. 



The liquor division continues to be a standout performer, increasing 

turnover by 20.1% and gaining significant market share. The chain continues 

to meet its store per week expansion target, opening a net 27 new outlets 

since June 2018. 



Supermarkets RSA continued its expansion, having added a net 61 new 

supermarkets and liquor outlets over the six months, with 101 confirmed new 

stores to open over the next 18 months, including our latest format Usave 

container stores, which allows the Group to make inroads into previously 

underpenetrated areas. 



Supermarkets Non-RSA 

Trading in 14 countries in the rest of Africa and Indian Ocean Islands, 

Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline of 13.3% in sales in rand terms and 

contributed 14.7% to the Group's sales. Non-RSA sales growth remained 

positive in constant currency terms, although currency devaluations and poor 

trading conditions in many countries, contributed to a below par 

performance. Supermarkets Non-RSA internal inflation remains low at just 

2.8% for the current period.



The slower Supermarkets Non-RSA sales are mainly attributed to the 

performance of the Angolan supermarket operation, following the 85.1% 

devaluation of the Angola kwanza against the USD since January 2018. It 

reported a 45.0% decline in sales in rand terms and 9.9% measured in 

constant currency. Angola's economy remains in deep recession and the 

currency devaluation weighed heavily on local consumer expenditure.



The Angolan currency shows signs of stabilising somewhat since the beginning 

of 2019 and the longer term economic outlook looks more positive as 

structural improvements bear fruit. The Group remains positive about the 

return to profitability and viability of its Angolan investment.



Trading in Nigeria continues to be hampered by foreign exchange fluctuations 

and the Group's adoption of the NIFEX exchange rate had a negative impact on 

converting local sales to rand. The Nigerian supermarket operation increased 

sales by 8.4% in local currency and the new store opened in the past year is 

trading well. The Group has made progress in increasing stock availability, 

including through its new fresh produce distribution facility. 



Zambia is now almost self-sufficient in terms of local supply of fresh and 

perishable lines. Zambia's sales in local currency are showing an 

improvement in the second quarter of 14.7%. 



The Group opened its first store in Kenya in the revamped Westgate Mall in 

Nairobi. The store is trading in line with expectations, and another store 

will be opened in Kenya by June 2019. 



The Group is firmly committed to its Non-RSA operations and is positive 

about its long term prospects on the continent. Growth in retail will be 

driven by rapid population growth and formalisation of food retail and the 

Group is uniquely positioned with an unrivalled retail footprint, experience 

and consumer base on the continent.



Furniture 

The Group's 479 furniture stores increased turnover by 4.3% and reported a 

decline in trading profit of 5.5% to R104 million. Second quarter sales were 

lower than expected as excessive demand on Black Friday resulted in 

suppliers being unable to meet delivery before month-end cut-off. South 

African stores continued to trade well whilst sales in Angola decreased in 

rand terms, driven by the currency devaluation, which had a negative impact 

on the profitability of the segment.



Other Operating Segments 

Other operating segments, which include OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite 

Pharmacy and Checkers Food Services, achieved turnover growth of 6.5%.



The OK Franchise division recorded a net increase of 34 stores during the 

last 12 months. The conversion of franchise stores to the OK brand is on 

track for completion this year. Franchise stores are increasingly using the 

Group's central DC's and better sales have been achieved on the back of a 

wider range of fresh products and more frequent deliveries to franchise 

stores. The strong uptake of the Group's extended number of private label 

products and general merchandise ranges available to franchisees is also 

performing well.

      The impact of the adoption of these standards are disclosed in note 2.



      The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation

      or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.



      The preparation of these results has been supervised by Mr A de

      Bruyn, CA(SA). There have been no material changes in the affairs or

      financial position of the Group and its subsidiaries from 30 December

      2018 to the date of this report. The information contained in the

      interim report has neither been audited nor reviewed by the Group's

      external auditors.



2     CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1   Effect of adopting IFRS 9: Financial Instruments

      IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and

      Measurement. It addresses the classification, measurement and

      derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities,

      introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model

      for financial assets.



      The adoption of IFRS 9 with effect from 2 July 2018 resulted in

      changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts

      recognised in the financial statements. The Group has elected not to

      restate its comparative information as permitted by IFRS 9.

      Accordingly, the impact of IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively

      with an adjustment to opening retained earnings on 2 July 2018.

      Therefore comparative information in the prior period annual

      financial statements has not been amended for the impact of IFRS 9.



      The total impact on the Group's retained earnings as at 2 July 2018

      is as follows:

                                                         Notes           Rm

      (before restatement for IFRS 15)                               21 632 



      The application of IFRS 9 had no material impact on the reported

      earnings or financial position for the interim results period

      under review. 



2.1.1 Classification and measurement of financial instruments

      IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on

      the basis of the entity's business model for managing the financial

      assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial

      assets.



      Management has assessed which business models apply to the financial

      assets held by the Group at the date of initial application of

      IFRS 9 and has classified its financial instruments into the

      appropriate IFRS 9 categories. It was determined that all of the 

      Group's financial assets which were measured at amortised cost and

      classified as held-to-maturity and loans and receivables under

      IAS 39, satisfy the conditions for classification at amortised cost

      under IFRS 9. Hence there is no change to the measurement of these

      assets.



      There has been no change to the classification of the Group's

      financial liabilities and they continue to be classified and measured

      at amortised cost.



2.1.2 Derivatives and hedging activities

      The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting and continues

      to account for forward exchange contracts at fair value through

      profit and loss.



2.1.3 Impairment of financial assets under the expected credit loss model

      IFRS 9 has introduced new expected credit loss (ECL) impairment

      requirements, as opposed to an incurred loss model applied in terms

      of IAS 39. The ECL requirements apply to all financial assets

      measured at amortised cost and will result in the earlier

      recognition of credit provisions.



      At a minimum, an impairment provision is required to be measured

      at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL for financial assets measured

      at amortised cost. A loss allowance for full lifetime ECL is

      required for a financial asset if the credit risk of that financial

      instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.



      The Group has the following types of financial assets measured at

      amortised cost that are subject to IFRS 9's new ECL model:

      - Instalment sale receivables

      - Trade receivables for sales of inventory

      - Loans receivable

      - Government bonds and bills

      - Other receivables



      The Group was required to revise its impairment methodology under

      IFRS 9 for each of these classes of assets. The impact of the change

      in impairment methodology on the Group's retained earnings and

      equity is disclosed in the table above.



      The measurement of ECLs reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the

      time value of money and the best forward-looking information

      available to the Group. The calculated ECL is discounted using the

      original effective interest rate applicable to the financial asset.



      The Group measures ECL for instalment sale receivables, loans

      receivable and government bonds and bills using probability of

      write-off, exposure at write-off, timing of when write-off is

      likely to occur and loss given write-off. These components are

      multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of write-off.



      For trade and other receivables without a significant financing

      component, the Group has adopted the simplified approach which

      recognises lifetime expected credit losses regardless of stage

      classification. The Group has established a provision matrix that is

      based on historical credit loss experience, adjusted for

      forward-looking factors specific to such trade and other receivables

      and the economic environment. 



      When a financial asset is classified as stage 3 impaired, interest

      income is calculated on the impaired value (gross carrying amount

      less impairment allowance) based on the original effective interest

      rate. The contractual interest income on the gross carrying amount

      of the financial asset is suspended and is only recognised as

      interest income when the financial asset is reclassified out of 

      stage 3.



2.2   Effect of adopting IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers

      IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18: Revenue. It addresses the classification,

      measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers.

      It establishes a five-step model to account for revenue from contracts

      with customers, based on the principle that revenue is recognised

      either over time or at a point in time, as or when the Group satisfies

      performance obligations and transfers control of goods or services

      to its customers.



      The adoption of IFRS 15 with effect from 2 July 2018 resulted in

      changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts

      recognised in the financial statements. In accordance with the

      transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new

      standard retrospectively and has restated comparatives for the 2018

      financial year.



      The total impact on the Group's retained earnings as at 2 July 2017

      is as follows:

                                                         Notes           Rm

      The impact of IFRS 15 on the consolidated financial statements is

      disclosed under note 2.3.



2.2.1 Accounting for refunds

      It is policy to sell goods with the right of return in terms of

      current consumer legislation. Such sales are cancelled where the

      right of return is exercised. Under IFRS 15, a refund liability for

      the expected refunds to customers is recognised as an adjustment to

      revenue in trade and other payables. The accumulated experience of

      the Group's returns has been utilised to estimate such refund

      liability at the time of sale. Based on past experience it is

      estimated that goods returned in a saleable condition will be

      insignificant and therefore, the Group does not recognise an asset

      and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for its right to

      recover the product from the customer where the customer exercises

      his right of return.



2.2.2 Accounting for breakage

      A customer's non-refundable prepayment to an entity gives the

      customer a right to receive a good or service in the future.

      However, customers occasionally do not exercise all of their

      contractual rights. In terms of IFRS 15, the Group recognised the

      expected breakage amount in such contract liabilities resulting from

      customers' unexercised rights as revenue, in proportion to the

      pattern of rights exercised by its customers. The accumulated

      experience of the Group's breakage history has been utilised to

      estimate when it expects to be entitled to a breakage amount.



2.2.3 Agent vs principal assessment

      IFRS 15 provides new guidance that impacted the Group's assessment

      of whether it acts as principal or agent when recognising revenue

      from certain value-added services. In certain instances, revenue

      previously recognised on a gross basis and included in sale of

      merchandise and cost of sales, is now required to be recognised on

      a net basis in other operating income. In other cases, revenue

      previously recognised on a net basis in other operating income, is

      now required to be recognised on a gross basis in other operating

      income and other operating expenses.



2.3   Impact on the consolidated financial statements

      The following tables set out the impact of the changes in accounting

      policies and retrospective adjustments recognised for each individual

      line item affected in the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9

      was adopted without restating comparative information and the impact

      is therefore not reflected in the restated comparatives but recognised

      in the opening statement of financial position on 2 July 2018. The

      aggregate effect of the changes in accounting policies on the annual

      financial statements and interim results presented are as follows:

9     FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

      The Group has a number of financial instruments which are not measured

      at fair value in the statement of financial position. For the majority

      of these instruments, the fair values are not materially different to

      their carrying amounts, since the interest receivable/payable is

      either close to current market rates or the instruments are 

      short-term in nature. Significant differences were identified for 

      the following instruments at the end of reporting period:

12    RELATED-PARTY INFORMATION

      During the period under review,

      in the ordinary course of business,

      certain companies within the Group

      entered into transactions with

      each other. All these intergroup

      transactions are similar to those

      in the prior year and have been

      eliminated in the condensed

      interim financial statements 

      on consolidation.



13    NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS

      NOT YET EFFECTIVE

      IFRS 16: Leases replaces IAS 17:

      Leases with effect from the year

      ending 28 June 2020. IFRS 16 will

      result in most leases being recognised

      in the statement of financial position,

      as the distinction between operating

      and finance leases has been removed.

      Under the new standard, an asset

      representing the right to use the

      leased item and a financial liability,

      to pay rentals, will be recognised.

      The only exceptions are short-term

      and low-value leases. The new standard

      will primarily affect the accounting

      for operating leases relating to retail

      stores. As at the reporting date the

      Group has non-cancellable operating

      lease commitments of R21.2 billion.

      The Group has not yet determined the

      extent of the right of use asset nor

      the liability for future payments and

      how this will affect profit and

      classification of cash flows.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 30 DECEMBER 2018

Following the operational update for the 26 weeks to December 2018, the Group is in the
process of finalising its financial results for the period. After the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS
15, the effect of the impact of Hyperinflation accounting as well as the transition to moving
average cost for the valuation of stock, the company is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for this period is likely to vary by at least 20% from the
corresponding period.

The low turnover growth resulting from low food inflation, temporary stock availability
challenges and currency devaluations combined with lower Non-RSA gross margins and
inflexible expense growths have adversely affected profitability. Given the numerous once-off
costs and challenging trading environment, the Group anticipates lower earnings per share
(""EPS"") and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the 26-week period ended 30 December
2018, falling within the ranges below:

 Basic EPS (cents)                        369.9 - 317.8                 521.3          -29% to -39%

Profitability in the Group's Non-RSA business suffered mainly as a result of the Angolan operation,
where the 85% devaluation in the local currency against the dollar since the beginning of 2018 caused
affordability challenges. The Group absorbed most of the price increases driven by higher import costs
which simply could not be passed on to consumers given the current economic recession. Higher US
dollar linked rentals in the Non-RSA operations also made local currency cost containment
challenging.

In the Group's RSA business, the following factors impacted profitability:

   -   Deflation (the Group still had 10,719 items in deflation in December) in basic food
       categories in which the Group commands a higher than average market share.
   -   Supply constraints stemming from industrial action and the deployment of a new ERP
       IT system resulted in lost sales in the period. Additional labour costs were incurred to
       ensure our supply chain remained operational and brought up to full efficiency over the
       festive season.
   -   Adjustments relating to the change in accounting estimate between retail method of
       accounting and moving average cost impacted Gross Margin.
   -   Cost increases in rentals, electricity, security, transport and depreciation could not be
       curtailed in line with the lower than expected top line growth.

The Group remains positive about its operational strength, customer support for its brands and
continues to make progress on its longer term strategic priorities. The transformational
changes we made during the year-long migration to a new IT system were challenging, but
the deployment has now been completed. January 2019 has seen the improved trading trend
continue and we are confident of an improved second half as the impact of various once-offs
continues to ease.

The above financial information, including estimated financial information, is the responsibility
of the directors of Shoprite Holdings and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's
auditors. The hyperinflationary adjustment has been prepared for illustrative purposes only.
The consolidated financial results for the review period will be published on or about 26
February 2019.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE
The Shoprite Group increased total turnover by 0.03% to approximately
R72.9bn billion in the 6 months to December 2018. Including the impact of
the Angolan hyperinflation accounting adjustment, the Group's turnover
declined by 0.01%.

In difficult circumstances, the Group managed to increase the number of
customer visits by 1.7% and product volumes by 0.2%. Segmental sales
performance for the six months to December 2018 (excluding the impact of
hyperinflation) is as follows:

The Group adopted IFRS 15 with effect from 2 July 2018. The current results
include the required restatements.

The following provides context to the overall turnover growth for the six
months:
-  The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, achieved 2.58% sales
   growth for the period. Persistently low internal food inflation in
   South Africa of only 0.2% for the period marks 18 months of near
   stagnant prices of basic foods in which the Group has a larger market
   share. The core Shoprite middle income consumer base remains under
   pressure. This was evidenced in Christmas sales in categories like
   Back to School essentials which outperformed traditional discretionary
   purchases such as toys for the first time.
-  Supermarkets RSA had stronger Christmas sales of 3.68% in December,
   achieved on the back of improved customer and volume growth which
   recovered alongside better product availability towards the end of the
   period. This is a much improved growth trend and almost double the
   1.89% for the first quarter, albeit below our expectations.
-  Liquor stores remain a standout performer with 20.09% sales growth for
   the period.
-  As previously reported, product availability challenges stemming from
   the Group's largest Distribution Centre in Gauteng, which accounts for
   53% of total centralised food distribution for the RSA supermarkets
   business, affected sales in the period. Industrial action followed
   by the deployment of our new warehousing system shortly after the
   labour disruption hampered the ability to adequately meet demand which
   resulted in lost sales opportunities, which the Group was unable to
   recover.
-  Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline in turnover of 13.27% in rand
   terms (0.05% growth in constant currency terms) which impacted the
   overall Group sales performance. This was primarily a result of sharp
   devaluations in the currencies of the major countries in the rest of
   Africa negatively impacting the sales performance in rand terms. The
   lower turnover is mainly attributed to a reset of the sales performance
   of the Angolan operation, declining 44.95% in rand terms after a
   significant 85.13% devaluation of the Angolan kwanza to the US dollar
   since January 2018. This was a severe drag on the performance of the
   Group given the size of the Angolan operation. The Angolan economy
   remains in recession with weaker consumer spending evidenced in the
   second quarter.
-  Excluding Angola, Supermarkets Non-RSA managed to achieve a positive
   sales growth of 4.41% in constant currency.
-  During 2018, the currencies of the other large countries in which we
   trade, namely Zambia (-19.48%) and Nigeria (-16.86%), also showed a
   sharp decline against the US dollar. Nigeria's Q2 reflected performance
   was negatively affected by the Group applying the weaker NIFEX rate
   for the Nigerian naira in December 2018 when converting to reporting
   currency, whereas the Central Bank of Nigeria's exchange rate has been
   used historically.

Our largest ever end-to-end system replacement represents a critical and
significant investment in improving our global competitiveness. Although the
timing was inopportune, the replacement was essential to sustain our future
growth. The transformational changes we made during the year-long migration
to the new IT system were challenging, but the deployment has been
completed. We are now confident that the Group is in a position to deliver
improved availability, price and ultimately a better shopping experience for
our customers going forward.

The Group's expansion remains on track with 50 new supermarkets opened in
the period, and plans are finalised to open another 37 before June 2019.

The Group's Furniture division increased sales by 4.30% for the period.
Second quarter sales were lower than expected as excessive demand from Black
Friday resulted in suppliers being unable to meet delivery before year-end
cut off. Non-RSA Furniture sales were also affected by the Angolan currency
devaluation.

Other operating segments (OK Franchise, Medirite Pharmacy and Checkers Food
Services) achieved pleasing growth of 8.40% after a strong festive season
for the OK Franchise division in particular.

Low food inflation and demanding trading conditions are expected to continue
in the second half, but the Group remains positive about its operational
strength, customer support for its brands and is making progress on its
longer term strategic priorities. These include building a stronger OK
Franchise offer and attracting better share of wallet from upmarket
consumers. Our Private Label enhancement continues, lead by the recent
launch of a pioneering, healthier-eating Simple Truth range in the Checkers
banner.

The positive trading trend continued in January with healthy growth in our
Back to School promotion. We are confident of a much improved second half as
the impact of various once-offs continue to ease and the benefit of the new
national minimum wage filters into food expenditure.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment
For the period ended 30 December 2018, the economy of Angola was still
assessed to be hyperinflationary. The Group therefore continued the
application of hyperinflation accounting in Angola for the period under
review.

The Group discloses the unaudited hyperinflation adjustment information in
order to indicate the effect of the restatement due to the change in the
general price index of the hyperinflationary economy. It will also
facilitate comparisons against the prior period's results which were
prepared before the Angolan economy was assessed to be hyperinflationary.

To present this information, the functional currency of Angola is adjusted
to take into account the value of money at the end of the reporting period.

The financial impact of hyperinflation on the current period's turnover is
shown below:

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure
The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the
Group's Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales
growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present
this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in
currencies other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR
at the prior year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country
basis. In addition, in respect of Angola, the constant currency information
has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation.

The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the
actual results for the period, in reported currency and constant currency
for the following major currencies. The total impact on Supermarket Non-RSA
is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this segment.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2018

In the three months to September 2018, the Shoprite Group’s turnover increased by 0.4%
(excluding Hyperinflation accounting in Angola). The Group managed to increase the
number of customers served by 1.6%, however overall turnover growth was impacted by
three main issues:

  -   Sharp devaluations in the currencies of some of the countries in the rest of Africa
      where the Group trades, in particular the large operations in Angola and Zambia,
      negatively impacted the Non-RSA sales performance in rand terms;

  -   Sales in Supermarkets RSA were impacted by consistently low internal food inflation
      of -0.1% for the quarter; and

  -   Product availability challenges stemming from the Group’s largest Distribution Centre
      in Gauteng which accounts for 53% of total centralised food distribution for the RSA
      supermarkets business. The culmination of a 6 week service provider strike and the
      deployment of a brand new warehousing system shortly after the labour disruption
      meant that we were temporarily not able to meet store demand adequately. The
      result was that the Group didn't live up to the high customer standards we pride
      ourselves on. This resulted in significant lost sales opportunities, which naturally
      benefitted some of the Group’s competitors. The situation has now normalised and a
      more positive volume trend is emerging in October on the back of improving product
      availability.

Supermarkets RSA, the Group’s primary business, grew sales by 1.7% during a period
which saw continued low inflation with more than 11,607 items in September remaining
cheaper than they were a year ago. The core customer base of its Shoprite chain in
particular remained under pressure from rising transport costs and unemployment.
Checkers continued to show better growth, notwithstanding also being affected by
availability issues in the broader Gauteng region as detailed above.

Facing many emerging market currency related headwinds, the Group’s Supermarkets Non-
RSA operating segment reported a decline in turnover of 8.6% in rand terms, mainly due to
the further depreciation of both Angola’s currency after year end and more recently the
depreciation of the Zambian currency. The Angola kwanza and Zambia kwacha have
depreciated by 76.3% and 21.0% respectively against the US dollar since the beginning of
2018. The Group’s hedging strategy continues to soften the blow of forex challenges
caused by weakening African currencies.

The Group’s Other Operating Segments (which includes OK Franchise, Computicket,
MediRite pharmacies and Checkers Food Services) continued to make a good contribution
to Group turnover, with the Furniture division reporting an 8.7% increase in sales. The OK
Franchise division recorded turnover growth of 6.3%.
Although some food price inflation in the next few months is inevitable given the current
rand weakness and escalating transport costs, the Group doesn't foresee material
increases in internal food inflation until 2019. This provides some good news for consumers
ahead of the important festive season.

The Group opened 15 supermarkets in the quarter and will open a further 41 new
supermarkets before the end of December 2018.

In the medium term, the Group remains positive about its operational strength and is making
good progress on its strategic priorities particularly around private label development,
franchise offer and its ability to capture a higher share of the more upmarket shoppers’
grocery spend.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1 JULY 2018



Key information

- Turnover increased by 3.1% to R145.3 billion.

- Diluted headline earnings per share of 968.7 cents, down by 3.8%.

- Trading profit decreased by 1.4% to R8.0 billion.

- EBITDA increased by 1.0% to R10.1 billion.

- Opened a net 124 corporate stores (2017: 109).

- Created 3 676 additional jobs.



Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer:

In testing trading conditions, the Group managed to increase total turnover 

by 3.1% to R145.3 billion in the 12 months to 1 July 2018. Positive volume 

growth of 2.7% combined with a 3.3% increase in customer numbers as well as 

local market share gains continue to reflect a strong underlying 

performance.



Group turnover growth includes the effect of hyperinflation accounting in 

Angola for the first time in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards. Excluding this adjustment, the Group's turnover 

increased by 3.6%. Group internal inflation dropped off significantly to 

only 0.5% from 7.3% in the previous year which dampened top line growth.



Trading profit was 1.4% lower at R8.0 billion, representing a still 

healthy trading margin of 5.5%.



Our core South African supermarket operations increased turnover by 5.7% 

despite experiencing overall deflation in selling prices for six out of 

twelve months during the year. Internal selling price inflation declined 

sharply from an average of 5.9% in the corresponding period to just 0.3% 

during the year under review, with 13 241 products in deflation at the end 

of June 2018. This is testimony to Shoprite's commitment for almost 40 years 

to put customers first by keeping prices low. The strong RSA performance 

amidst low inflation still resulted in a market share gain to 31.7% for

the period, propelled by Checkers' progress in its more sharpened focus 

on higher income customers.



Turnover of Supermarkets Non-RSA operations declined 7.0% after exceptional 

growth in the prior year and reflects slow economic recoveries and currency 

fluctuations in the major countries of operation.



We continue to invest in our people and products and secure growth 

opportunities in South Africa and beyond for the long-term growth of the 

business and in order to serve our customers, communities, suppliers and 

shareholders. Our ability to extract growth in trying circumstances 

validates the strength of our strategy which not only includes geographical 

diversification, but also the extraction of value across all operations and 

brands.



The Group continues to advance its primary purpose: to be Africa's most 

accessible and affordable food retailer. The Group opened a net 124 new 

corporate stores during the past 12 months and at year-end was trading from 

2 843 outlets, adding 3 676 additional jobs in the reporting period, to 

bring the total staff complement to 147 478.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

The Group was resilient in the face of strong headwinds which gathered some 

momentum across South African and Non-RSA operations.



South Africa's gross domestic product grew 1.3% over 2017 and fell 2.2% in 

the first quarter of 2018, while unemployment remains high at 27.2%. These 

factors, coupled with an unprecedented VAT increase, record fuel prices, 

sugar tax to name a few, provided a challenging environment for the Group 

and put our customers under undue financial pressure.



Group internal inflation decreased from 7.3% in the previous year to only 

0.5% for the current year, ensuring we continue to provide the most 

affordable products to our customers, but putting pressure on revenue and 

operating profit as external cost inputs continued to increase at a quicker 

pace.



There were signs of increased political stability in a number of Non-RSA 

operations, which continued to experience lacklustre trading conditions and 

foreign exchange fluctuations.



COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS



Statement of Comprehensive Income



Total turnover

Total turnover for the Group increased by 3.1% for the 52 weeks to 1 July 

2018 from R141.0 billion to R145.3 billion. Excluding the impact of the 

Angolan hyperinflation accounting adjustment, the Group's turnover increased 

by 3.6% and like-for-like growth was -0.1%. Supermarkets RSA reported 

turnover growth of 5.7% and, on a like-for-like basis 1.9%, while 

Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline in sales of 7.0% with a like-for-

like decline of 12.0%. The decline in Supermarkets Non-RSA sales are mainly 

due to the normalised performance of the Angolan Supermarkets operation 

following the 65.0% compound growth in turnover over the prior two years, 

the rapid decline in internal selling price inflation and the 50.2% 

devaluation of the Angola kwanza against the US dollar since December 2017. 

In constant currencies, Supermarkets Non-RSA sales increased by 1.2%.



The Group's Furniture division displayed an improved operating performance, 

growing sales by 9.8% for the period, while other operating segments (OK 

Franchise, Computicket, MediRite Pharmacy and Checkers Food Services) 

achieved turnover growth of 5.2%.



Expenses

Total expenses increased by 6.5%. Depreciation and amortisation as well as 

the increase in the cost of operating leases grew at a higher rate than 

turnover, mainly due to increased property taxes, new store openings and our 

continued refurbishment program of existing stores. During the 12-month 

reporting period a net 71 supermarkets and a net 50 LiquorShop outlets were 

opened.



Escalation in expenses such as electricity and other energy costs were 

mostly beyond the control of the Group due to electricity tariff increases 

being set by NERSA. The Group has however invested in power saving 

initiatives that will materialise benefits in the forthcoming financial 

year. The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSiRA) agreed on 

wage increases in the security industry with the resultant impact on the 

Group's security costs in South Africa. There was a marked increase in store 

robberies during the year which necessitated an increase in capital spend to 

implement additional measures to safeguard customers and staff.



Trading margin

The trading margin decreased from 5.8% to 5.5%. Despite the healthy margin 

levels, the reduction reflects investment in projects to future proof the 

Group as part of its store expansion program, enlargement of supply-chain 

infrastructure and the replacement of the information technology landscape. 

Near zero levels of internal inflation and the general slowdown in turnover 

in Supermarkets Non-RSA contributed to the lower margin.



Exchange rate losses

The Group recorded an exchange rate loss of R251 million for the financial 

year mainly due to the 50.2% currency devaluation in the Angola kwanza 

against the US dollar since December 2017. The hedging strategy followed by 

the Group to minimise the exchange rate losses in Angola were two fold with 

the purchase of US$ Index Linked Angola Government Bonds and Angola Treasury 

Bills. Investment income on the US$ Index Linked Angola Government Bonds and 

the Angola Treasury Bills amounted to R191 million and is reported as part 

of Other Operating Income.



Finance cost and interest received

Net interest expense, when compared to the corresponding period, increased 

due to additional funding required for capital projects and due to the 

forfeiture of the last interest payment of the convertible bonds in the 

prior year. Additional capital was required to fund expansion in 

Supermarkets Non-RSA.



Statement of Financial Position



Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 124 new corporate outlets 

which included more own stores built, vacant land purchased for strategic 

purposes and the investment in information technology to support inventory 

management. The Cilmor distribution centre is now fully operational.



Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The increase in cash at the reporting date is mainly due to month end cut-

off for accounts payable. This was offset by the specific buy-back and 

cancellation of ordinary shares in the amount of R1.8 billion and a further 

increase in US$ Index Linked Angola Government Bonds and Angola Treasury 

Bills to the value of R2.4 billion to hedge against a possible further 

devaluation of the Angola kwanza.



Inventory

The 1% increase in inventory is a result of the Supermarkets Non-RSA 

operating segment reporting a marked decrease in inventory due to improved 

stock management. Provisioning of the net 124 new corporate outlets as well 

as the increased capacity created by the new Cilmor distribution centre in 

the Western Cape led to the overall increase in inventory levels.



Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables increased by 18.4% on the previous year due to 

month end cut-off reflected in cash and cash equivalent balances.



Borrowings

Total borrowings increased as offshore funding was secured to fund the 

Group's continued expansion drive outside South Africa. The Group is 

investigating various medium to longer term funding options to support 

future developments.



Pro Forma Information

Certain financial information presented in these annual financial results 

constitutes pro forma financial information. The pro forma financial 

information is the responsibility of the board of directors of the Company 

and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the 

pro forma financial information may not fairly present the Group's financial 

position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.



An assurance report (in terms of ISAE 3420: Assurance Engagements to Report 

on the Compilation of Pro Forma Financial Information) has been issued by 

the Group's auditors in respect of the pro forma financial information 

included in this announcement. The assurance report is available for 

inspection at the registered office of the Company.



Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the 

Group's Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales 

growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present 

this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in 

currencies other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR 

at the prior year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country 

basis. In addition, in respect of Angola, the constant currency information 

has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. For the year ended 

1 July 2018, the economy of Angola was assessed to be hyperinflationary. 

Hyperinflation accounting was applied with effect from 3 July 2017.



The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the 

actual results for the financial year, in reported currency and constant 

currency for the following major currencies. The total impact on 

Supermarkets Non-RSA is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in 

this segment.

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment

For the year ended 1 July 2018, the economy of Angola was assessed to be 

hyperinflationary. As a result, the Group accounted for the results of its 

Angolan operations on a hyperinflationary basis in accordance with IAS 29: 

Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies (IAS 29) with effect from 

3 July 2017.



It is therefore useful and good governance to report pro forma information 

for the current year under review which excludes the impact of 

hyperinflation. It will also facilitate comparisons against the prior 

period's results which were prepared before the application of 

hyperinflation accounting.



The pro forma information was calculated through applying all the accounting 

policies adopted by the Group in the latest audited annual financial 

statements except for the hyperinflationary standard IAS 29.



The financial impact of hyperinflation on the current period's results is 

shown in the format of a pro forma statement of comprehensive income and a 

pro forma statement of financial position.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW



Supermarkets RSA

The core South African Supermarket operation, trading through 1 610 outlets 

and representing 74.0% of total sales, did well in an extremely tough 

environment, increasing sales by 5.7% and trading profit by 1.8%.



Taking into account the low levels of internal inflation, which dropped to 

only 0.3% from 5.9% last year, the improved pace on real turnover growth 

combined with positive volume and customer growth reflects a strong 

performance.



The South African operations continue to experience positive customer growth 

in terms of number of customers and number of customer trips to stores. We 

are also selling more products, with a 3% increase in units sold, a positive 

increase somewhat masked by the effect of deflation and cost pressures.



A total of 13 241 of our products were selling at lower prices than last 

year, easing the burden on our customers but putting some pressure on the 

Shoprite operation in particular. Integrated planning, strict cost 

disciplines and an extensive and sophisticated supply-line infrastructure 

have helped the Group to successfully manage the effect of deflation and the 

poor economy, although the sales increase at Shoprite was limited to 4.3% - 

a creditable performance given the circumstances.



The Group's strategy to capture a greater proportion of the higher LSM 

consumer segments' grocery expenditure has seen Checkers, excluding the 

larger format Hyper stores, increase sales by 8.2%.



Checkers' revamped stores and fresh and convenience offerings have been well 

received by customers, and our higher LSM shoppers are spending more and 

shopping with increased frequency.



Checkers has converted 13 stores to the new look FreshX concept, 

accelerating market share gains in the affluent market segment. The Group 

aims to revamp at least a third of its Checkers stores to the new look in 

the medium term.



Innovation, improved customer service and increases in convenience and fresh 

ranges have been significant draw-cards for Checkers, which continues to 

lead the Group's gain in market share.



The Shoprite brand, with its focus on middle and lower-income consumers, 

continued to subsidise basic food prices to assist the most vulnerable. 

Notwithstanding its shopper base being the hardest hit by prevailing 

economic conditions, Shoprite grew sales by 4.3% (2017: 6.0%) to 

R54.2 billion.



The Group's small format, hard discounter Usaves offering the lowest 

possible prices on a limited assortment, continued to perform well with a 

7.5% increase in turnover, despite deflation in most of its major product 

categories. A net 33 new Usave stores were opened in the year as reach was 

extended to consumers in traditionally underserved areas.



The Group's LiquorShop stores in South Africa recorded a strong performance, 

with a 20.6% increase in sales and new store expansion which met our 

aspirations with a new store opening almost every week of the year.



The implementation of our new SAP ERP system, the biggest IT project ever 

embarked upon by the Group, has almost been completed which will see all 

stores and distribution centres in all countries on one common technology 

platform. The herculean effort to deploy such a significant change to our 

technology platform was not without growing pains, however it will enable 

better inventory accuracy and improved efficiencies whilst addressing 

scalability.



Supermarkets Non-RSA

Trading in 14 countries in the rest of Africa and Indian Ocean Islands, the 

Group's Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment produced disappointing 

results in line with those reported at the interim stage, mainly driven by 

the Angolan operation that faced many headwinds.



Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a 7.0% decrease in turnover in rand terms 

which impacted overall Group sales performance. The slower Supermarkets Non-

RSA sales are mainly attributed to the normalised performance of the Angolan 

Supermarkets operation, the Group's biggest operation outside South Africa, 

following the 65.0% compound growth in turnover over the prior two years and 

the 50.2% devaluation of the Angola kwanza against the US dollar since 

December 2017.



Trading in Nigeria continues to be hampered by foreign exchange 

fluctuations, although Nigerian stores are showing growth in local currency, 

albeit at reduced margins.



A significant drop off in Supermarkets Non-RSA internal inflation from 14.4% 

in the previous year to only 1.1% for the current year was also experienced.



The Group's imminent expansion into Kenya provides an exciting opportunity 

and reflects its ongoing commitment to the African continent, where it 

has a significant competitive advantage.



Furniture

The Group's Furniture division's ongoing refinement continued to bear fruit 

and it achieved a pleasing 9.8% increase in sales and profit growth in 

excess of 100% for the period.



This was achieved despite credit sales participation dropping by almost a 

third to 14.7% (2017: 20.8%) of total sales and only a marginal increase in 

product inflation.



Sales growth in its 396 South African stores was 9.5% up, while its 88 

stores outside South Africa increased sales by 11.0% on the back of improved 

distribution and merchandising decisions. Angola recorded a particularly 

strong performance where the OK Furniture brand is establishing strong 

customer loyalty.



The division's enhanced integration into the wider Shoprite Group has been 

particularly beneficial outside South Africa, with it benefitting from 

opening stores in Shoprite shopping centres.



The division opened 20 new stores, but it is a net four stores lighter than 

the previous year as unprofitable stores were closed.



Other Operating Segments

Other operating segments, which include OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite 

Pharmacy and Checkers Food Services achieved turnover growth of 5.2%.



The OK Franchise division recorded a net gain of 30 new members as its

restructuring continued to enhance the OK brand among customers as well as

potential and existing franchisees.



The Group has seen a strong uptake of its extended number of private label 

products and general merchandise ranges available to franchisees.



GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

Our key indicators remain strong. We remain robust and profitable and 

continue to attract more customers and win market share.



We made a deliberate decision in the face of many headwinds to maintain 

investment in our people and in new stores for the sustainable long-term 

health of the business, the benefits of which will be realised in the 

future.



Sales in the Non-RSA business will remain under pressure as we expect 

continued currency weakness and foreign exchange shortages. Operations in 

the rest of Africa remain a substantial contributor to the Group and on its 

own stands tall relative to various local peers.



The Group has entrenched its position as the continent's leading retailer 

and is well positioned to capitalise on any economic improvements following 

its continued investment into a more accessible store footprint, superior 

brands and its focus on six strategic drivers of growth. Significant 

progress has been made on all of these drivers, which include a customer 

first culture, increasing share of the more affluent LSM 8 - 10 market, 

developing private label, building a stronger franchise offering, strategic 

footprint expansion and ultimately leveraging our African first mover 

advantage.

SELECTED EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS



1     BASIS OF PREPARATION

      The Group reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which treats

      each financial year as an exact 52-week period, incorporating trade

      from Monday to Sunday each week. This treatment effectively results 

      in the loss of a day (or two in a leap year) per calendar year. These

      days are brought to account approximately every six years by including

      a 53rd week. Accordingly the results for the financial year under

      review are for a 52-week period, ended 1 July 2018, compared to 52

      weeks in the previous financial year.



      These summarised consolidated financial results are prepared in

      accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings

      Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the

      Companies Act applicable to summary financial statements. The Listings

      Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance

      with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition

      requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),

      the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting

      Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the

      Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum,

      contain the information required by IAS 34: Interim Financial

      Reporting.



      The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated

      annual financial statements from which the summarised consolidated

      financial results were derived are in terms of International Financial

      Reporting Standards and are consistent with those accounting policies

      applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual

      financial statements, except as set out below. Various new and revised

      accounting standards became effective during the year, but their

      implementation had no significant impact on the results of either the

      current or the previous year.



      The preparation of these summarised consolidated financial results for

      the year ended 1 July 2018 have been supervised by Mr A de Bruyn,

      CA(SA), and have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who

      expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor also expressed

      an unmodified opinion on the consolidated annual financial statements

      from which these summarised consolidated financial results were

      derived. Copies of the auditor's reports on both the consolidated

      annual financial statements and the summarised consolidated financial

      results are available for inspection at the Company's registered

      office. The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of

      the information contained in this announcement. Shareholders are

      therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the

      nature of the auditor's engagement they should obtain a copy of the

      auditor's report together with the accompanying financial information

      from the registered office of the Company. The consolidated annual

      financial statements, together with the integrated annual report, will

      be available on www.shopriteholdings.co.za by 30 September 2018.



      IAS 29: Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies

      During the reporting period, the Group classified the economy of 

      Angola as hyperinflationary, effective from 3 July 2017. Accordingly,

      the results and the financial position, including comparative amounts,

      of the Group's Angolan subsidiaries have been expressed in terms of

      the measuring unit current at the reporting date, as required by IAS

      29. The carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities are

      adjusted to reflect the change in the general price index from the

      date of acquisition to the end of the reporting period. Gains or

      losses on the net monetary position are recognised in profit or loss.

      All items recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are

      restated by applying the change in the general price index from the

      dates when the items of income and expenses were initially earned or

      incurred while all items in the statement of cash flows are expressed

      in terms of the general price index at the end of the reporting

      period. At the beginning of the first period of application, the

      components of owners' equity, except retained earnings, are restated

      by applying a general price index from the dates the components were

      contributed or otherwise arose. These restatements are recognised in

      other comprehensive income. Restated retained earnings at the

      beginning of the first period of application are derived from all

      other amounts in the restated statement of financial position. As the

      presentation currency of the Group is that of a non-hyperinflationary

      economy, comparative amounts of the Group are not adjusted for changes

      in the price level or exchange rates in the current year.

8     FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

      The Group has a number of financial

      instruments which are not measured at

      fair value in the statement of financial

      position. For the majority of these

      instruments, the fair values are not

      materially different to their carrying

      amounts, since the interest receivable/payable

      is either close to current market rates

      or the instruments are short-term in

      nature. Significant differences were

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

In spite of difficult trading conditions, the Shoprite Group increased total turnover by 3.3% to
approximately R145.6 billion in the 12 months to June 2018. Excluding the impact of the
Angolan hyperinflation accounting adjustment, the Group’s turnover increased 3.6%.

The Group turnover growth in this operational update has been prepared taking into account
the effect of hyperinflation in Angola for the first time in accordance with IAS 29: Financial
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, effective from 3 July 2017. The remaining
segmental financial information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation and
constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the
segment disclosure which will be included in the audited consolidated financial statements for
the 12 months to June 2018.

Excluding the Angolan operation, the Shoprite Group managed to increase turnover by 5.5%
for the period. The Group’s internal inflation decreased from 7.3% in the previous year to only
0.5% for the current year.

The Group’s core business, Supermarkets RSA performed well, achieving 5.7% sales growth
for the year with internal inflation dropping to only 0.3% from 5.9% last year. Taking into
account internal inflation, the improved real turnover growth combined with positive volume
and customer growth reflects a strong underlying performance.

Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded negative turnover growth of 7.0% in Rand terms which
impacted overall Group sales performance. The slower Non-RSA sales is mainly attributed to
the normalised performance of the Angolan operation following the 65.9% compound growth
in turnover over the prior two years and the 50.2% devaluation of the Angolan Kwanza since
January 2018. Excluding Angola, Supermarkets Non-RSA managed to achieve a positive
sales growth of 3.0%. A significant drop off in Supermarkets Non-RSA internal inflation from
14.4% in the previous year to only 1.1% for the current year was also experienced.

The Group’s Furniture division increased sales by 9.9% for the period, while other operating
segments (OK Franchise, Medirite Pharmacy and Checkers Food Services) achieved growth
of 5.2%.

Despite the demanding trading environment, exasperated by the sharp decline in internal
inflation, the Group remains positive about its operational strength, customer support for its
brands and is making progress on its strategic priorities.

The above financial information is the responsibility of the directors of Shoprite Holdings Ltd
and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Shoprite Holdings’ auditors. The
hyperinflationary adjustment has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. The
consolidated financial results for the review period will be published on or about 20 August
2018.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment
The Group discloses the unaudited hyperinflation adjustment information in order to indicate
the effect of the restatement due to the change in the general price index of the
hyperinflationary economy. It will also facilitate comparisons against the prior period’s results
which were prepared before the Angolan economy was assessed to be hyperinflationary.
To present this information, the functional currency of Angola is adjusted to take into account
the value of money at the end of the reporting period.
The financial impact of hyperinflation on the current period’s turnover is shown below:

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS: UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE 26 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Key information

- Diluted headline earnings per share of 525.2 cents, up 14.2%
- Trading profit increased by 5% to R4.104 billion
- Turnover increased by 6.3% to R75.823 billion
- Dividend per share of 205 cents declared, an increase of 13.9% over the 
  180 cents of the corresponding period.


Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive:

Shoprite produced an industry-leading performance in the 26 weeks to 31 
December 2017. Total turnover grew 6.3% from R71.297 billion to R75.823 
billion on the back of 3.9% growth in volume of products sold and 3.6% 
growth in number of customers. Trading profit was 5% higher at R4.104 
billion. This was a satisfactory performance given that Shoprite RSA 
internal inflation dropped seven percentage points to just 0.4% compared to 
the previous year.

Group results were boosted by a strong performance in our core South African 
supermarket operations, which grew turnover by 7.8%. Turnover of 
Supermarkets Non-RSA operations, however, declined 0.4%, measured against an 
exceptional prior year increase of 32.3%. At constant currencies, 
Supermarkets Non-RSA turnover grew 1.9%.

The performance by the South African operations, boosted by the continued 
success of Checkers' sharpened focus on high income group customers, helped
offset the effect of a challenging year for Non-RSA operations. The Group
advanced market share in RSA by 0.44 percentage points, which is testimony
to its resilience in less favourable periods.

This is an inversion of the trend in the previous year and validates the 
strength of our strategy which not only includes geographical 
diversification, but also the extraction of value across all operations and 
brands.

Despite negligible price inflation, turnover and trading profit improved 
and the Group achieved a healthy trading margin of 5.41%.

While the corresponding period saw internal inflation in RSA increase from 
2.7% to 7.4%, the current interim period saw internal inflation drop sharply 
to just 0.4%, with deflation recorded across a range of products and now 
affecting more than 5 000 products. 

To sustain long term growth both in South Africa and beyond its borders, the 
Group opened a net 158 new stores during the past 12 months and at the end 
of December was trading from 2 811 outlets, adding 4 254 additional jobs in 
the reporting period, to bring the total staff complement to more than 
148 000.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

The Group was once again able to demonstrate its resilience to economic 
headwinds and its ability to withstand challenges across its Non-RSA 
operations.

South Africa has been in an almost no-growth situation for most of 2017, 
unemployment stood at 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, consumer 
confidence was at low levels and our customers have been under unprecedented 
financial pressure. The Group experienced deflation in most product ranges. 
Non-RSA operations continued to be challenged by harsh trading environments, 
forex shortages, low commodity prices and political instability.

COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS

Statement of Comprehensive Income

Total turnover
Total turnover for the Shoprite Group increased by 6.3% for the 26 weeks to 
31 December 2017 - from R71.30 billion to R75.82 billion while growth on a 
like-for-like basis was 2.0%. The growth this year must be seen in the 
context of the very strong growth of 14% in the corresponding 26 weeks of 
last year. Supermarkets RSA reported turnover growth of 7.8% and, on a like-
for-like basis, 3.5% while Supermarkets Non-RSA reported a decline in sales 
of 0.4% with a like-for-like decline of 6.4%. At constant currency rates 
Supermarkets Non-RSA sales increased by 1.9%.

Expenses
Total expenses increased by 9.3%. Depreciation and amortisation as well as 
the increase in the cost of operating leases grew at a higher rate than 
turnover, mainly because of new stores being opened. Depreciation and 
amortisation is also affected by the new SAP ERP system having been 
implemented. During the 12 months a net 74 supermarkets and 56 LiquorShop 
outlets were opened, while a net 21 unprofitable furniture stores were 
closed, improving the profitability of the Furniture division.

Escalations in expenses such as security, electricity and other energy costs 
were beyond the control of the Group due to electricity tariff increases 
being set by NERSA, while Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority 
(PSiRA) agreed on wage increases in the security sector. These expenses were 
nevertheless monitored as carefully as possible.

Trading margin
The trading margin decreased marginally from 5.48% to 5.41%. This margin 
reflects the investment in new stores and in the supply-chain 
infrastructure, with Cilmor in Cape Town coming on stream. The reduced 
margin is mainly due to the slowdown in turnover in Non-RSA.

Exchange rate gains
The Group recorded an exchange rate gain of R4 million against a loss of 
R188 million in the corresponding period. The loss in the previous year was 
partly due to the devaluation of certain Non-RSA currencies against the US$ 
and the strengthening of the rand during the period under review with the 
resultant effect on short-term loan balances. During the reporting 26 weeks 
the Group obtained more offshore funding to support the Non-RSA operations 
with the result that short-term intergroup loans were reduced and with it 
the forex risk in South Africa.

Finance cost and interest received
Net interest expense, when compared to the corresponding period, decreased 
due to the convertible bonds that were converted during the second half of 
last year. This reduction was offset by additional funding required for the 
expansion in Non-RSA.

Statement of Financial Position

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
The increase is due to the investment in 171 new corporate outlets which 
included more own stores built, vacant land purchased for strategic 
purposes, investment in information technology to support inventory 
management, completion of the Cilmor distribution centre as well as normal 
asset replacements.

Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts
The decrease in cash at the reporting date resulted from (1) Buy-back and 
cancellation of ordinary shares of R1.75 billion; (2) Purchase of additional 
US$ Index Linked Angolan Government bonds to the value of R1 billion during 
the 26 weeks. This was done as a hedge against a possible devaluation of the 
Angolan kwanza; (3) Capital expenditure for the six months was about 13% 
higher than that of the corresponding six months.

Inventory
The increase in inventory is due to the provisioning of the net 121 new 
corporate outlets as well as the increased capacity created by the new 
Cilmor food distribution centre in the Western Cape. Although fully stocked, 
this centre did not operate at full capacity at the end of December, which 
partly accounts for the increase in inventory.

The Group also made a strategic decision to allow Shoprite to participate 
alongside Checkers in the highly successful Black Friday promotion in 
November 2017 with the result that Checkers were slightly overstocked in 
certain lines. However, those lines were all incorporated in the Heyday 
promotion in February.

Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables show an increase of 5.9% on the previous year. This 
increase goes hand in hand with the inventory increase.

Borrowings
The convertible bonds were converted in April 2017, but additional financing 
was arranged to fund the expansion in Non-RSA. The Group is investigating 
various medium to longer term funding options to support future 
developments.

Pro forma information
Certain financial information presented in these results constitutes pro 
forma financial information. The pro forma financial information is the 
responsibility of the board of directors of the Company and is presented for 
illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial 
information may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes 
in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information 
has neither been reviewed nor been reported on by the Group's external 
auditors.

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure
The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information in order to 
indicate the Group's underlying Non-RSA businesses performance in terms of 
sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To 
present this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in 
currencies other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR 
at the prior year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country 
basis.

The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the 
actual results for the financial year, in reported currency and constant 
currency for the following major currencies. The total impact on 
Supermarkets Non-RSA is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in 
this segment.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

Supermarkets RSA
The Group's core business, the South African supermarket operation, produced 
an exceptional performance, growing sales by 7.8%, and generating an 
increased trading profit of R3.342 billion, R350 million higher than the 
R2.992 billion in the corresponding period.

This growth was well ahead of competitors, reflecting continued gains in 
market share.

Trading through 1 451 outlets and generating 81% of the Group's total 
supermarket sales, the division continues to lead the industry with its 
extensive and increasingly sophisticated supply-line infrastructure that 
ensures on-shelf availability. Integrated planning and strict cost 
disciplines continue to enhance the Group's ability to operate successfully 
despite limited price increases and the strain on increasingly financially-
stretched customers.

The Group continues to provide value at affordable prices for these 
customers through its extensive global sourcing capabilities. Private label 
brands, which assist price sensitive consumers, increased their contribution 
by 1.2 percentage points to make up 15.4% of sales.

During the review period the Group intensified its customer-centric focus in 
every aspect of its business to serve the needs of customers better. This 
was particularly evident at Checkers, which grew sales by 9.6% and gained 
market share on the back of significant improvements in service, 
enhancements to its fresh products and convenience food offerings and 
upgraded store design.

The flagship Shoprite brand, with its focus on middle and lower-income 
consumers, remained fully exposed to the effects of a strained economy, and 
sales increased by a creditable 6.2% under the circumstances. Down-trading 
in certain categories reflect the fact that customers are stretched to their 
limit, and Shoprite has responded with the provision of affordable options 
including R5 meals and a bigger choice of private label products.

The small-format Usave chain, which offers the lowest possible prices on a 
restricted product range, performed exceptionally well with turnover growth 
of 8.5% reflecting 38 new store openings and the success of its value 
offering to its customers.

The Group has made its first significant investment into a digital 
transformation programme and continues to explore technology-related 
opportunities. Following a successful pilot partnership with Uber Eats in 
Cape Town, the Group is planning to extend its offering to Johannesburg and 
Durban.

Supermarkets Non-RSA
Supermarkets Non-RSA, which trades in 14 countries in the rest of Africa and 
Indian Ocean islands, produced disappointing results for the period under 
review.

Sales across the 30 supermarkets in Angola were down 9.5% in local currency, 
against growth of 155.4% in the previous year. The decline primarily 
reflects last year's exceptional performance and a drop in internal 
inflation from 41.3% to -1.8%, panic buying that abated in a more 
competitive landscape.

Nigeria's turnover growth in local currency was 9.3%, but customer volumes 
were lower as inflation hit their disposable income while the Zambian 
operations are starting to show positive growth, with sales up 4.5% in local 
currency terms.

Expansion in Africa continues with a planned entry into Kenya before the end
of 2018, where weakened competitor positions have opened a window of
opportunity, to strengthen the Group's presence in East Africa. 

Chronic shortage of foreign currency, particularly in the oil-producing 
countries such as Angola and Nigeria remains an issue, but the Group has a 
significant competitive advantage as it funds its stock requirements from 
its external balance sheet, unlike many other traders in the region.

Results in Non-RSA operations should be viewed against the prior year's 
exceptional sales performance and unprecedented increase in customers, as 
well as against management's prior-year caution that such high growth levels 
may not be sustainable.

Furniture
The ongoing refinement of the Furniture division continued to yield fruit, 
with the furniture division growing total sales by 10.7%, despite credit 
sales participation dropping by almost a third to only 15% of total sales. 
Trading profit grew 15.8% off a low base and this growth was assisted by the 
closure of 37 loss making stores.

The increase was assisted by the continued strong performance of its 81 
stores outside South Africa which increased sales by 14.4% during the 
reporting period, with Angola continuing to do well.

In South Africa, where the division operates 410 outlets under various 
brands, sales grew 9.7%.

Other Operating Segments
The ongoing restructuring of the OK Franchise division, aimed at improving 
service delivery to members and enhancing the image of the OK brand among 
consumers, continues to yield positive results. Turnover increased by 8% and 
it continues to gain market share. The division now has 414 members in South 
Africa, Namibia and Swaziland as it gained a net 37 new members in the 12 
months to 31 December 2017. As the Group continues to enhance support for 
members, which includes increasing delivery frequency to members, their 
purchases from Group distribution centres grew by 25.8% over the six-month 
period.

GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK
The Group continues to face extremely testing trading conditions, with 
positive economic improvements across our operations still some way off and 
food inflation expected to remain low. The Group has, however, proven that 
notwithstanding such conditions, it continues to extract sales and profit 
growth ahead of its competitors.

There are tentative signs of renewed confidence in South Africa and some 
green shoots in several economies in which the Group operates which point to 
positive change in the medium term.

Consumers remain under pressure but have felt some respite with fuel price 
decreases, while the strong rand will have a positive effect on import 
prices. These factors point to the potential for improvements in sales and 
profitability.

Sales in the Non-RSA business will remain under pressure in the coming 
months, as currency weakness, low commodity prices and forex shortages 
continue to hamper economic growth in most territories. The Angolan currency 
devaluation will restrain Angolan sales results in rands.

The Group has entrenched its position as the continent's leading retailer 
and remains well positioned to capitalise on any change in conditions with 
its continued investment into its enviable store footprint, superior brands 
and its focus on its strategic growth drivers.

The Group expects to retain its market-leading growth and remains cautiously 
optimistic for a further improvement in performance in 2018.

8   RELATED-PARTY INFORMATION

    During the period under review, 
    in the ordinary course of business, 
    certain companies within the 
    Group entered into transactions 
    with each other. All these intergroup 
    transactions are similar to those in 
    the prior year and have been eliminated 
    in the condensed interim financial 
    statements on consolidation.

    In terms of an employment agreement, 
    Dr Basson was entitled to put all 
    Shoprite Holdings Ltd shares directly 
    or indirectly held by him against the 
    Company whilst still in the employment 
    of the Company. The specific repurchase 
    was subject to the provisions of the 
    Memorandum of Incorporation of the 
    Company, the Companies Act, No. 71 of 
    2008 (as amended) and the JSE Limited 
    Listings Requirements, where applicable. 
    Dr Basson formally notified the Company 
    of the exercising of the put option on 
    2 May 2017 whereby a specific repurchase 
    of 8 683 327 Shoprite Holdings Ltd shares 
    was proposed at R211.01 per share. 

    Subsequently the purchase price of each 
    Put Option share was reduced to R201.07, 
    being the 30-day VWAP of the ordinary shares 
    up to and including 2 May 2017. 
    This transaction was approved by 
    shareholders at an extraordinary general 
    meeting held on 5 September 2017,
    where after the shares were repurchased 
    by the Company and cancelled with 
    effect from 15 September 2017.

ADDITIONAL CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE

Shareholders are referred to the operational update for the six months to December
2017 (?current period?) released on SENS on 16 January 2018.

As stated in the announcement, the economic and trading conditions in Non-RSA
remained unchanged, with the result that the Group?s Supermarkets Non-RSA operating
segment reported a negative turnover growth of -0.4% in Rand terms (1.9% positive in
constant currency terms). The impact of lower commodity prices and the depreciation
of local currencies remain prevalent in the larger economies of operation outside of
South Africa.

The following constant currency information is disclosed to indicate the Group?s
underlying non-RSA businesses performance in terms of sales growth excluding the
effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this information, current period
turnover for entities reporting in currencies other than ZAR are converted from local
currency actuals into ZAR at the prior year?s actual average exchange rates on a
country-by-country basis. The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover,
based on the current period, in reported currency and constant currency for the
following currencies:

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

The Shoprite Group increased turnover by 6.3% for the six months to December 2017.

Supermarkets RSA, the Group’s primary business, increased sales by 7.8% during a
period when internal inflation decreased to 0.4% for the six months compared to the
corresponding period’s 7.4% driven mainly by a reduction in the price of basic
commodity items.

The economic and trading conditions in Non-RSA remained unchanged, with the result
that the Group’s Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment reported a negative
turnover growth of -0.4% in Rand terms (1.9% positive in constant currency terms).
The impact of lower commodity prices and the depreciation of local currencies remain
prevalent in the larger economies of operation outside of South Africa.

The Furniture division reported increased sales of 10.8% while Other Operating
Segments, mainly driven by the OK Franchise division’s performance, saw a growth of
6.7%. This is pleasing given low internal price inflation and in line with the Group’s RSA
supermarket performance.

The current pace of growth must be viewed in context of the strong turnover growth of
14.0% in the corresponding six months in the prior year and overall internal price
deflation that occurred in the last quarter.

The above financial information has not been reviewed or reported on by Shoprite
Holdings’ auditors. The financial results for the review period will be published on or
about Tuesday, 27 February 2018.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

In the three months to September 2017, the Shoprite Group delivered an increase in
turnover of 6.4%, marking the 65th consecutive quarter of growth for the company.

RSA Supermarkets, the Group’s primary business, grew sales by 8.1% during a period
which saw a sharp reduction in internal inflation, decreasing to only 0.9% for the
quarter from the corresponding quarter’s 7.2%. This material drop was driven by
significant price reductions of many basic commodity items such as maize meal and
potatoes following supply improvements after the earlier drought conditions.

Stripping out the effect of inflation, the real sales growth surpassed the prior year’s
growth in the same quarter, which is a considerable achievement. The core customer
base of its Shoprite chain in particular remained under pressure from rising costs and
unemployment, but the Group managed to overcome this through strong price
leadership and successful promotions, achieving further market share gains in the
quarter.

Facing many economic headwinds, the Group’s Non-RSA Supermarkets reported a
negative turnover growth of -1.8% mainly due to the impact of lower commodity prices
and the depreciation of the currencies of the three main countries where the Group
trades on the continent. Sales growth in Angola, in particular, slowed significantly after
extraordinary growth of 110% in the corresponding quarter.

The smaller divisions also made a good contribution to Group turnover. The Furniture
division, whilst continuing to labour under the effect of the amendments to the National
Credit Act, reported increased sales of 8.9%. The OK Franchise division continues to
gain market share and saw a growth of 10.0%, in line with the Group’s supermarket
performance.

Store openings are continuing as planned with 20 supermarkets and 6 furniture stores
opened during this quarter.

The current pace of growth echoes the prevailing challenging trading environment and
must be viewed in context of the very strong growth of 15.7% in the corresponding
period of the prior year.

The deflationary environment is good news for consumers ahead of the important
festive sales season, although consumer spending is difficult to predict, especially with
further Rand weakness. In the medium term, however the Group remains optimistic
about its operational strength and is making positive progress on its strategic priorities.

Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive:

The Group achieved strong results in the 52 weeks until 2 July 2017 with 

turnover growth of 8.4% (52 weeks: 10.6%). The core South African supermarket 

operation, which represents 72% of total sales and 79% of trading profit, 

recorded sales growth of 8.0% (52 weeks: 10.5%) in a tough operating 

environment. 



Most South Africans continue to prefer shopping at our supermarkets, which is 

evident from our gain in annual market share, which increased to 31.9%. We 

continue to offer people the lowest prices and to subsidise basic food items to 

assist price sensitive consumers. Internal food inflation averaged 5.9% 

compared to official food inflation of 10%. We have shielded customers from 

R1.8 billion of potential additional expenses, had our prices tracked 

inflation.



Supermarkets outside of South Africa in 14 countries in Africa and the Indian 

Ocean Islands continued to perform well, generating a 11.7% increase (52 weeks: 

13.5%) in turnover. Turnover growth of 31.6% (52 weeks: 33.8%) at constant 

currencies remains strong, albeit at a lower rate than the previous year. 



The Group continues to open new stores and was trading from a total 2 689 

outlets in 15 countries at the end of the reporting period. The Group remains a 

significant job creator with 6 027 new positions filled over the past year. Our

total staff complement rose to 143 802 employees, making our Group the largest

South African employer in the private sector. The Group is also ahead of its

annual target in terms of its 5-year employment equity plan. 



We believe there is room for further growth as we continue to improve 

efficiencies and profitability both in South Africa and beyond the country's 

borders. We made progress on all our strategic priorities, which includes an 

increased focus on our upmarket fresh product offering, increasing private 

label participation as well as the strengthening of our franchise offer and 

footprint expansion. 



Despite a constrained trading environment, the company is healthy and doing 

well across multiple brands and regions.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

South Africa experienced a technical recession in the second half of the 

reporting period, putting further pressure on the already price sensitive 

consumer. In this difficult trading environment, the Group remained resilient 

with growth in sales and market share. Our business on the rest of the 

continent was impacted by various factors, such as slowing economies, lower 

commodity prices and forex shortages. The weakening of most currencies against 

the rand (the Nigerian Naira for instance devalued 22.7% against the rand) also 

impacted turnover. Despite this the Non-RSA Supermarkets increased sales and 

grew its customer base by 8.3% (52 weeks: 10.3%), primarily driven by Angola 

and Nigeria.



COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS



Statement of Comprehensive Income 



Total turnover

Total turnover for the Shoprite Group increased by 8.4% to R141 billion for the 

52 weeks to 2 July 2017 (52 weeks: 10.6%). Growth on a like-for-like basis was 

5.8% compared to 52 weeks of the preceding year. All the segments reported 

satisfactory growths in tough economic conditions. Supermarkets RSA grew by 

8.0% (52 weeks: 10.5% with like-for-like growth at 6.9%). Turnover for the 

Supermarkets Non-RSA division is 11.7% higher (52 weeks: 13.5% with like-for-

like growth at 1%) and growth in constant currencies at 31.6% (52 weeks: 33.8%) 

which accentuates the effect of devaluations of Non-RSA currencies against the 

rand.



Gross profit

Gross profit increased by a healthy 10.3% from R30.7 billion to R33.8 billion 

and is reflected at 23.99% of turnover (2016: 23.58%). This improvement was due 

to an even better contribution from the Group's distribution centers as well as 

more rebates generated by successful promotions. Shrinkage remains well under 

control. During this twelve months, the Group changed its accounting policy 

with respect to the treatment of advertising rebates with certain rebates 

relating to advertising now being deducted from the purchase price of goods. 

The effect on Group results was not material. See note 9 in this announcement 

for more detail. 



Expenses

Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7.5%, lower than the previous year 

and mainly due to an increased number of smaller stores opened during the last 

number of years. Operating leases increased by 9.6%, mainly due to a net 109 

new corporate outlets opened during the year. The higher growth in Employee 

benefits can be ascribed to the effect of higher inflation in the Non-RSA 

countries which, in turn, gave rise to higher wage increases.  With increases 

in Electricity less pronounced this year, other operating expenses increased by 

9.4%. Security costs are still showing double digit growth due to the Group 

having to spend more to protect customers and stores from the scourge of 

burglaries and armed robberies which are on the increase, especially during 

month-ends and grant pay-outs. 



Trading margin

The trading margin increased from 5.60% to 5.76%. This margin reflects the 

effects of real growth in turnover as well as of investment in new stores and 

in the supply-chain infrastructure.  



Exchange rate losses

The Group recorded an exchange rate loss of R236 million against a loss of R46 

million in the corresponding period. This was partly due to the devaluation of 

certain Non-RSA currencies against the US$ and the rand during the period under 

review with the resultant effect on short-term loan balances. In addition, the 

rand also strengthened against the US$ with the result that a loss was also 

recorded on US$ balances held in South Africa as well as certain forward 

foreign exchange contracts. It remains Group policy to enter into forward 

exchange contracts on all imports due to rand volatility.



Finance cost and interest received

When compared to the corresponding period, net interest expense decreased due 

to the convertible bonds that converted during the year resulting in the last 

interest payment being forfeited. 



Earnings per share

Diluted headline earnings per share increased by 11.9% from 900.3 cents to 

1,007.4 cents and increased by 16.1% when the 53rd week in the previous year is 

excluded.



Statement of Financial Position



Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 109 new corporate outlets, 

vacant land purchased for strategic purposes, investment in information 

technology to support inventory management, distribution centre developments as 

well as normal asset replacements.



Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The decrease in cash at the reporting date resulted from the purchase of 

US$ Index Linked Angolan Government bonds to the value of R1.4 billion during 

the 12 months. This was done as a hedge against a possible devaluation of the 

Angolan kwanza. In addition, the calendar month closed before the accounting 

month-end date, with the result that some creditors were paid before accounting 

cut-off. Capital expenditure for the year was higher than the corresponding 12 

months due to the building of a new distribution centre in the Western Cape, 

South Africa.



Inventory

The increase in inventory is due to the provisioning of the net 109 new 

corporate outlets as well as the increased capacity created in some of the 

distribution centres. Management is actively pursuing reducing inefficient 

stock holding at branch level and the roll out of new information systems in 

the new year is expected to assist in this.



Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables show an increase of 5% on the previous year when the 

calendar month closed before the accounting month-end date, with the result 

that creditors were paid before the cut-off. This increase goes hand in hand 

with inventory that also increased more than the growth in turnover.   



Borrowings

R4.59 billion of the convertible bonds were converted during the year and R108 

million redeemed. 27 149 869 shares were issued in the conversion. 



Pro Forma Information

Certain financial information presented in these annual financial results 

constitutes pro forma financial information. The pro forma financial 

information is the responsibility of the board of directors of the Company and 

is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro 

forma financial information may not fairly present the Group's financial 

position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. 



An assurance report (in terms of ISAE 3420: Assurance Engagements to Report on 

the Compilation of Pro Forma Financial Information) has been issued by the 

Group's auditors in respect of the pro forma financial information included in 

this announcement. The assurance report is available for inspection at the 

registered office of the Company.



Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information in order to 

indicate the Group's underlying Non-RSA businesses performance in terms of 

sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present 

this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in currencies 

other than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR at the prior 

year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country basis. 



The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the actual 

results for the financial year, in reported currency and constant currency for 

the following major currencies. The total impact on Supermarkets Non-RSA is 

also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this segment.

Impact of the previous year's extra week on 2017 year-end financial reporting 

The Group reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which results in the 

inclusion of a 53rd week approximately every six years, as pointed out in the 

Basis of Preparation. 



The results for the financial year under review are for a 52-week period, ended 

2 July 2017, compared to 53 weeks in the previous financial year. It is 

therefore useful and good governance to report pro forma information for a 52-

week 2016 comparative period, so as to facilitate comparisons against the prior 

and current period results.



The unaudited pro forma 52-week information for the previous financial year has 

been prepared for illustrative purposes only, to indicate how such information 

compares to the actual audited results of the Group for the 52-week period

ended 2 July 2017.

Notes:

1. The accounting policies adopted by the Group in the latest audited 

   annual financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with

   International Financial Reporting Standards, have been used in preparing

   the unaudited pro forma 52-week information.

2. The extra week adjustments were calculated with reference to:

   - Actual sales of merchandise (which have been extracted from the

     Group's accounting records) and cost of sales for the extra week from

     29 June 2015 to 5 July 2015;

   - Other income and expenses based on an assessment of management

     information and

   - The effective tax rate applicable to the extra week period.

3. The calculation of diluted headline earnings per share for the pro

   forma 52-week period is based on the weighted number of shares for that

   period.

4. The extra week adjustments, in the opinion of the directors, fairly

   reflects the results for the one week period from 29 June 2015 to 5 July

   2015.



Like-for-like comparisons

Like-for-like sales is a measure of the growth in the Group's year-on-year 

sales, removing the impact of new store openings and closures in the current

OPERATIONAL REVIEW



Supermarkets RSA

The core South African supermarket operation again delivered a strong 

performance in a tough operating environment. It grew sales by 8.0% to R101.734 

billion during the reporting period (52 weeks: 10.5%). In total the South 

African division boasts 31.9% market share, while almost all its brands gained 

market share and continues to grow. 



Checkers, which includes the larger format Hyper stores, remains the star 

performer and grew sales by 8.5% (52 weeks: 10.8%) to R38.594 billion. The 

division now trades through 239 outlets.



In line with the trend towards more frequent and fresh shopping and wellness 

and healthier eating we have vastly improved our fresh, convenience and healthy 

eating ranges. Our fresh and convenience product offering has been doubled over 

the past year with great success. It resulted in increased spend by more 

affluent customers. 



The Shoprite brand, with its focus on middle and lower-income consumers, 

continued to subsidise basic food prices to assist the most vulnerable. 

Notwithstanding its shopper base being the hardest hit, Shoprite grew sales by 

6% (52 weeks: 8.6%) to R52 billion. 



Usave, the Group's small-format hard discount chain, is positioned to offer the 

lowest possible prices on a limited assortment. It delivered a healthy sales 

growth of 7.8% (52 weeks: 10.4%).



The Group's LiquorShop brand is the country's fastest-growing retail liquor 

chain with a store opening rate of one per week. Its performance has been 

excellent, with an exceptional ROI and growth in sales of 20.4% (52 weeks: 

22.7%) to R4.8 billion. Market share is now 18.2%, a 0.72 percentage point 

increase year-on-year. 



Our supermarkets are supported by an extensive and sophisticated supply-line 

infrastructure that ensures on-shelf availability. With about 750 000 square 

metres of distribution space, we are the country's and continent's largest 

distributor. 



Supermarkets Non-RSA

Supermarkets Non-RSA, which trades in 14 countries in the rest of Africa and 

the Indian Ocean islands, again produced healthy results. The 308 outlets 

generated sales of R24.8 billion, 11.7% higher than the corresponding period 

(52 weeks: 13.5%). Angola and Nigeria continue to be the top performers, 

despite a shortage of foreign currency in these oil-producing countries. We 

have also seen a good recovery in Namibia this year. 



In the first half of the year the Group had a substantial competitive advantage 

over many other traders in the region by funding its stock requirements from 

its external balance sheet. Operations came under pressure in the latter half 

of the year as sales slowed down, severely impacted by various factors such as 

the devaluation of most currencies against the rand. 



Slowing economies, lower commodity prices and forex shortages also negatively 

impacted retail sales. Notwithstanding the trading difficulties, the customer 

base remains healthy, with the Group's supermarkets in Angola and Nigeria 

increasing customers by 35.7% (52 weeks: 37.7%) and 38.2% (52 weeks: 40.4%) 

respectively.



Angola delivered a strong performance and now accounts for the lion's share of 

Non-RSA sales. Our 30 supermarkets are well ahead of expectations. We opened 

one store in the financial year, with an additional two to be opened in the 

next 12 months. We have also purchased a distribution centre which will improve 

supply chain efficiencies and on-shelf availability. 



Restrictions on key imported lines remained a challenge in Nigeria, but through 

a focused marketing drive on local products we managed to generate a 48.2% 

sales growth (52 weeks: 50.2%) in local currency. The region holds significant 

growth potential for the Group despite short term issues including the oil 

price, a devaluing currency and the ban on certain imports to stem the outflow 

of dollars. We have 23 stores in the country with a further two under 

construction. 



Furniture

The Furniture division performed well compared to its peers in a very tough 

environment, with more restrictive credit regulation and low consumer 

confidence putting pressure on sales. It grew turnover by 4.3% (52 weeks:

6.2%). A robust performance by the 77 stores outside South Africa supported

this growth.



In South Africa, where the division trade under the OK Furniture, OK Power 

Express and House & Home brands, the year was characterised by heightened 

competition in a depressed durable goods market. OK Furniture, by far the 

biggest divisional brand, traded relatively well and grew sales by 10.4%. Plans 

are in place to reposition the House & Home brand, which continues to 

experience challenges. Outside South Africa our nine stores in Angola are 

trading particularly well and we plan to expand our operation in the country. 



Other Operating Segments

The OK Franchise division produced excellent results with sales up 10.1% and 

growth in market share. This is an important extension of our business as it 

gives us access to neighbourhoods and smaller, mostly rural communities where 

about 60% of the stores are currently located. A future focus will include the 

main-stream convenience market in metropoles. The division now trades largely 

under the OK Foods, OK MiniMark and OK Express brands, as well as a wholesale 

division, Megasave, which enables franchisees to benefit from the Group's 

buying power. 



Members' purchases from Group distribution centres grew by 29% over the twelve 

months. While increasing the frequency of deliveries to members, the division 

extended its offering to include perishables and frozen products and showed 

better product availability for consumers. The division now has 388 members in 

South Africa and Namibia, while we continue to receive significant interest 

from potential franchisees across the continent. 



The franchise division has a strong growth focus and continues its 

modernisation to improve service delivery and to enhance the image of the OK 

brand.



The MediRite division comprises two business units - the retail pharmacy chain 

MediRite and Transpharm, a wholesaler of medical products. While growth is 

hindered by, amongst others, government imposed exit price restrictions, the 

losses experienced at MediRite have been well contained and the progress of the 

division is positive. MediRite trades from a total 162 pharmacies and expanded 

its footprint in Angola, where we now have 13 pharmacies. Plans are also 

underway for expansion to Mozambique. Transpharm, which supplies to MediRite as 

well as a number of external customers, showed improved profitability. 



Computicket is still hampered by consumers' lack of disposable income with 

customers cutting back on their discretionary spending. We are however 

cautiously confident about sales growth after branching out into new business 

by adding sports competition entries to the booking offer. The travel section 

continues to do well despite the adverse trading environment.



GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

The Group is healthy and its business continues to perform well across multiple 

brands and countries. This diversification of brands and territories offers us 

many levers to pull to navigate the slower growth environment envisaged. In 

South Africa, high levels of unemployment are bound to persist with continued 

consumer indebtedness and shrinking disposable income, but we have proved our 

ability to operate profitably in such circumstances. Our international sales 

have also strengthened despite trading in challenging markets, driven by 

improvements across our offer. We expect the positive sales momentum to 

continue in South Africa and beyond the country's borders. 



RETIREMENT OF CEO AND BOARD MEMBERS

In the past year Dr Whitey Basson, who headed Shoprite since 1979, retired as 

CEO, but continues his association with the Shoprite Group in the role of vice 

chairman. Dr Basson has been succeeded by Mr Pieter Engelbrecht who, for most 

of his 20 years with the Group, has worked in close association with Dr Basson. 

Two esteemed board members, Messrs Brian Weyers and Aubrey Karp, who joined the 

Group in 1980 and 1990 respectively, also retired during the year. Mr Weyers 

served as a director of Shoprite Holdings since 1997 and Mr Karp was appointed 

to the board in 2005. 



DIVIDEND NO 137

The board has declared a final dividend of 324 cents (2016: 296 cents) per 

ordinary share, payable to shareholders on Monday, 11 September 2017. The 

dividend has been declared out of income reserves. This brings the total 

dividend for the year to 504 cents (2016: 452 cents) per ordinary share. The 

last day to trade cum dividend will be Tuesday, 5 September 2017. As from 

Wednesday, 6 September 2017, all trading of Shoprite Holdings Ltd shares will 

take place ex dividend. The record date is Friday, 8 September 2017. Share 

certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 

6 September 2017, and Friday, 8 September 2017, both days inclusive.



In terms of the Dividends Tax, the following additional information is 

disclosed:

1. The local dividend tax rate is 20%.

2. The net local dividend amount is 259.20 cents per share for shareholders

   liable to pay Dividends Tax and 324 cents per share for shareholders

   exempt from paying Dividends Tax.

3. The issued ordinary share capital of Shoprite Holdings Ltd as at the 

   date of this declaration is 600 021 829 ordinary shares.

4. Shoprite Holdings Ltd's tax reference number is 9775/112/71/8.



BASIS OF PREPARATION

The Group reports on the retail calendar of trading weeks which treats each 

financial year as an exact 52-week period, incorporating trade from Monday to 

Sunday each week. This treatment effectively results in the loss of a day (or 

two in a leap year) per calendar year. These days are brought to account 

approximately every six years by including a 53rd week. Accordingly, the 

results for the financial year under review are for a 52-week period, ended 

2 July 2017, compared to 53 weeks in the previous financial year.



These summarised consolidated financial results are prepared in accordance with 

the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary 

reports and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary 

financial statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to 

be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and 

recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 

the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 

Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 

Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required 

by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.



The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated annual 

financial statements from which the summarised consolidated financial results 

were derived are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and 

are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the 

previous consolidated annual financial statements, except as set out below. 

Various new and revised accounting standards became effective during the year, 

but their implementation had no significant impact on the results of either the 

current or the previous year.



The preparation of these summarised consolidated financial results for the year 

ended 2 July 2017 have been supervised by Mr M Bosman, CA(SA), and have been 

audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion 

thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified opinion on the consolidated 

annual financial statements from which these summarised consolidated financial 

results were derived. Copies of the auditor's reports on both the consolidated 

annual financial statements and the summarised consolidated financial results 

are available for inspection at the Company's registered office. The auditor's 

report does not necessarily report on all the information contained in this 

announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full 

understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should obtain a 

copy of the auditor's report together with the accompanying financial 

information from the registered office of the Company. The consolidated annual 

financial statements, together with the integrated annual report, will be 

available on www.shopriteholdings.co.za on 30 September 2017.



Held-to-maturity investments

During the reporting period, the Group acquired AOA, USD Index Linked, Angola 

Government Bonds which are classified as held-to-maturity investments. The 

Group classifies investments as held-to-maturity if they are non-derivative 

financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities and 

the Group intends to, and is able to, hold them to maturity.



Held-to-maturity financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus 

directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 

held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost, using the 

effective interest rate method. These financial assets are included under non-

current assets unless it matures within 12 months after statement of financial 

position date. Interest on held-to-maturity financial assets is recognised in 

the statement of comprehensive income as part of other operating income.



If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the 

amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the held-to-maturity 

investments' carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash 

flows discounted at the original effective interest rate applicable to the 

relevant held-to-maturity investments. The carrying amount will be reduced and 

the loss recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.



Change in accounting policy

During the reporting period, the Group changed its accounting policy with 

respect to the treatment of advertising rebates. The Group previously reflected 

these rebates net of advertising expenses as part of other operating income. 

The change in accounting policy is effective for the year ended 2 July 2017 and 

has been applied retrospectively. This has therefore resulted in a restatement 

of the comparative 2016 figures on the statement of financial position and 

statement of comprehensive income. Refer to note 9 for further information and 

a summary of the effect of this change in accounting policy.

3.1  Convertible bonds

     The Group has issued 6.5% convertible bonds 

     for a principal amount of R4.7 billion 

     (2016: R4.7 billion). The bonds matured on 

     3 April 2017 at their nominal value. Bondholders 

     had the option to convert their convertible 

     bonds at the maturity date at the rate of 

     5 919.26 shares per R1 million. The values of 

     the liability component and the equity conversion 

     component were determined at issuance of the bonds.



     The fair value of the liability component was 

     calculated using a market interest rate for an 

     equivalent non-convertible bond at initial 

     recognition. The residual amount, representing 

     the value of the equity conversion option, was 

     initially included in shareholders' equity in other 

     reserves, net of income taxes, and transferred to 

     retained earnings upon conversion and redemption.



     The convertible bonds recognised in the statement 

     of financial position is calculated as follows:



     Liability component at the beginning of the year   4 655         4 511

7    RELATED PARTY INFORMATION

     During the year under review, in the ordinary course of business,

     certain companies within the Group entered into transactions with

     each other. All these intergroup transactions are similar to those in

     the prior year and have been eliminated in the annual financial

     statements on consolidation. Related party transactions also include

     key management personnel compensation, loans to directors and loans to

     associates and joint ventures. For further information, refer to the

     audited annual financial statements.



     In terms of an employment agreement, Dr Basson is entitled to put

     option on 2 May 2017 whereby a specific repurchase of 8 683 327

     Shoprite Holdings Ltd shares was proposed at R211.01 per share.

     Subsequently the purchase price of each Put Option share was reduced to

9    CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY

     During the year, the Group changed its accounting policy with respect

     to the treatment of advertising rebates. Although nothing has changed

     in ""IAS 2 Inventories"", ""IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with

     customers"" has provided a principle that can be applied when

     determining which rebates should be deducted in determining the costs

     of purchase in accordance with paragraph 11 of IAS 2. IFRS 15 provides

     more clarity on how the supplier should treat the payment of rebates

     to its customers: ""An entity shall account for consideration payable

     to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore,

     of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a

     distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the entity.""

                                   

     The Group has changed its policy in applying IAS 2 paragraph 11 and now

     considers whether the good/service provided to the supplier in exchange

     for the advertising rebates is distinct from the purchase of the 

     goods/services from the supplier. The Group's advertising rebates

     result from the process of negotiating the best product price with the

     supplier and therefore the Group does not provide distinct goods or

     services to its suppliers in exchange for the rebates.



     The Group previously classified these rebates net of advertising

     expenses with its other operating income in the statement of

     comprehensive income. It was concluded that the Group's inventory

     accounting policy should be changed as a result of the additional

     guidance provided by IFRS 15 with regards to the accounting treatment

     of rebates. Further, in accordance with ""IAS 8: Accounting policies,

     changes in accounting estimates and errors"", it results in information

     that is more relevant to the financial position and performance.

                                   

     The change in accounting policy is effective for the year ended 

     2 July 2017 and has been applied retrospectively. This has therefore

     resulted in a restatement of the comparative 2016 and 2015 figures on

     the statement of financial position. The aggregate effect of the

     changes in accounting policy on the annual financial statements for

     these periods are as follows:

     receivables are reflected appropriately.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

The year ended 2 July 2017 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks for the year ended 3 July
2016.

The Shoprite Group increased total turnover by a healthy 10.4% to about R140.7 billion for
the 12 months to June 2017 with like-for-like turnover growth improving by 5.8%. Turnover
for the 52-week period compared to the 53 weeks of the prior year increased by 8.2%.

The challenging trading conditions in South Africa continued in the second half of the year
and the South African supermarket operation increased sales by 10.1% (7.7% if compared
to 53 weeks). On a like-for-like basis, sales increased by 6.9%. Internal inflation slowed to
5.9% for the period from the 7.4% in December as the impact of the drought began to ease
and compares to 3.9% in the prior year.

The Group’s non-RSA supermarkets recorded sales growth of 13.5% (11.7% if compared to
53 weeks) mainly due to the impact of lower commodity prices and the devaluation of certain
currencies. This had a material impact on prices of imported products during the latter part of
the year. On a like-for-like basis, sales increased by 1%. Taken at constant currencies, sales
grew by 33.8% (31.6% on a 53-week basis). The fourth quarter in particular is where the
previous high base in Angola’s sales impacted growth for the year.

The Group’s furniture division still faced industry challenges around affordability requirements
of the National Credit Act and subdued durable purchases, with the result that sales grew by
6.2% for the period (4.3% if compared to 53 weeks).

The Other Operating Segments achieved growth of 7.7% (7.0% if compared to 53 weeks).

The above financial information is the responsibility of the directors of Shoprite Holdings Ltd
and has not been reviewed or reported on by Shoprite Holdings’ auditors. Constant currency
information as well as comparisons to pro forma 52-week financial information for the
previous year has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. The consolidated financial
results for the review period will be published on or about Tuesday, 22 August 2017.

Impact of the Group’s pro-forma constant currency disclosure.

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information in order to indicate the Group’s
underlying non-RSA businesses performance in terms of sales growth, excluding the effect
of foreign currency fluctuations.
To present this information, current period turnover for entities reporting in currencies other
than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR at the prior year’s actual
average exchange rates on a country-by-country basis.

The table below sets out the percentage change in turnover, based on the actual results for
the current financial year, in reported currency and constant currency for the following major
currencies:

                            Reported Currency            Constant Currency


   -   Angola kwanza               49.23 %               80.87   %
   -   Nigeria naira               -6.98 %               50.24   %
   -   Zambia kwacha                1.01 %               0.67    %
   -   Mozambique metical         -16.91 %               22.27   %


Impact of the previous year’s 53rd week on the 2017 financial year-end reporting period.

The Group has prepared unaudited pro-forma 52-week financial information for the period
ending 3 July 2016. It is appropriate and good practice to report the pro-forma information to
facilitate comparisons between the current year’s 52 weeks and the prior year’s results
excluding the 53rd week.

Proposed specific repurchase of Shoprite Holdings ordinary shares

1.   Introduction and background

     Shareholders are advised that Shoprite Holdings intends proposing a specific repurchase of
     8 683 327 Shoprite Holdings ordinary shares (“Shares”) from Bassgro Proprietary Limited
     (“Bassgro”) (“Specific Repurchase”) at a general meeting of the Company (“General
     Meeting”).

     In terms of an employment agreement concluded between Shoprite Holdings and Dr J.W.
     Basson (“Dr Basson”) in December 2003, Dr Basson is entitled to put Shares held either directly
     or indirectly by himself to Shoprite Holdings whilst still in the employ of Shoprite Holdings (“Put
     Option”), and Shoprite Holdings is obliged to repurchase such Shares at the middle market price
     of the Shares on the date of exercise of the Put Option (“Middle Market Price”).

     Dr Basson, in his personal capacity and as a duly authorised director of Bassgro, of which the
     Wellwood Basson Familietrust is the ultimate shareholder, notified Shoprite Holdings of the
     exercise of the Put Option on 2 May 2017 at the Middle Market Price of R211.01 per Share. The
     Shares do not represent the entire shareholding of Dr Basson or that of any related parties.

     The Specific Repurchase will further be subject to the provisions of the Memorandum of
     Incorporation of the Company, the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended, and the JSE
     Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements, where applicable, including, inter alia, Shoprite Holdings’
     shareholder approval.

2.   Terms of the Specific Repurchase

     2.1     The Specific Repurchase will be effected through the repurchase by the Company from
             Bassgro of 8 683 327 Shares at a price of R211.01 per Share, being the Middle Market
             Price on 2 May 2017, at a total value of R1 832 268 830.27.

     2.2     The Specific Repurchase represents 1.447% of Shoprite Holdings Shares currently in
             issue.

     2.3     Application will be made to the JSE for the delisting of the Shares once the Specific
             Repurchase has been effected.

     2.4     The Specific Repurchase has no impact on the number of Shoprite Holdings treasury
             shares, which is 35 436 572 treasury shares.

     2.5     The date upon which the Specific Repurchase is to be made will be as soon as possible
             after the compliance with all required formalities, including the obtaining of Shoprite
             Holdings shareholder approval.

3.   Fairness opinion

     In terms of section 5.69(e) of the JSE Listings Requirements, if the Specific Repurchase:
     3.1     is from a “related party” as defined in section 10.1(b) of the JSE Listings Requirements;
             and
     3.2     is at a price which is at a premium to the weighted average traded price (“VWAP”) of the
             Shares measured over the 30 business days prior to the date that the Specific
             Repurchase is agreed,

     the board of directors of Shoprite Holdings (“Board”) must obtain a fairness opinion.

     In this regard, Bassgro (being an “associate” of Dr Basson, as defined in the JSE Listings
     Requirements) is deemed to be a “related party” to Shoprite Holdings. In addition, the Specific
     Repurchase will take place at the Middle Market Price of R211.01 per Share, which is at a 5.32%
     premium to the 30 day VWAP of the Shares up to an including 2 May 2017, being R200.36 per
     Share.

     In order to fulfil its obligations under the JSE Listings Requirements, the Board confirms that the
     Specific Repurchase will be subject to the inclusion of a statement by the Board in a circular to
     be posted to shareholders (“Circular”) confirming whether the Specific Repurchase is fair insofar
     as Shoprite Holdings shareholders are concerned and that the Board has been so advised by an
     independent expert. The Board is currently in the process of appointing an independent expert to
     obtain a fairness opinion.

4.   The impact of the Specific Repurchase on financial information

     It is intended to fund the Specific Repurchase through the use of existing bank facilities. As
     such, the impact of the Specific Repurchase on the financial information of Shoprite Holdings is
     as follows:

     4.1     an increase in interest charged of approximately R144 million per annum, assuming a
             weighted average interest rate of 7.87% per annum; and
     4.2     a decrease in Shoprite Holdings’ issued Shares by 8 683 327 Shares.


     The above financial information has not been reported on by the Company’s auditors.

5.   Salient dates and times

     A further announcement will be published in due course setting out the salient dates and times
     of the Specific Repurchase.

6.   Circular

     A circular proposing the Specific Repurchase, including full details of the Specific Repurchase
     and a fairness opinion as required by the JSE Listings Requirements, will be despatched to
     shareholders and the shareholders will also be advised of the date of the General Meeting in due
     course.

  (2015: 398.2 cents).

- Dividend per share declared 180 cents, an increase of 15.4% over the

Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive:

Shoprite produced an excellent set of results for the six months to 

December 2016, which included a successful festive trading period. Total

turnover grew 14% from R62.519 billion to R71.297 billion while trading

profit was 19.2% higher at R3.907 billion. Group results were boosted by 

a very strong performance by our Non-RSA operations which grew turnover 

by 32.3% to R12.877 billion. At constant currencies this represents growth

of 51.7%.



The rise in trading profit above turnover growth was the result of increased 

marketing activity, strict cost control across the spectrum, improved 

planning involving all the various disciplines in the business, and the 

Group's ability to achieve ongoing supply line efficiencies. These factors 

combined enabled the Group to increase the trading margin from 5.2% to 5.5% 

while continuing to provide the best value at highly competitive prices. 



The widespread drought and its impact on agricultural production, coupled 

with the high replacement cost of basic food imports, caused internal 

inflation to increase from 2.7% a year ago to 7.4%, the highest level in 

several years. To assist price sensitive consumers and support low prices 

with value we continued to subsidise those basic foods most affected by 

price escalations.



To sustain growth both within South Africa and beyond its borders, the Group 

opened a net 147 new stores during the past 12 months and at the end of the 

reporting period was trading from 2 653 outlets. This enabled it to create, 

to our immense satisfaction, 7 144 additional jobs bringing its total staff 

complement to more than 143 000.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

The Group proved highly resilient in the weakened economic environment which 

impacted especially lower-income South Africans throughout the review 

period. The drought caused material price escalations especially in the case 

of basic commodities while fuel price increases and other cost-of-living 

expenses put further pressure on disposable income. The drought also 

affected several of the Group's markets in Africa such as Zambia, where it 

effectively countered increased competition from other, mainly South African 

retailers. A positive is that the summer rainfall areas have experienced 

some good early rains and it does appear to have eased the severe conditions 

somewhat. Other African markets such as Angola and Nigeria on which the 

Group has a particular focus, proved buoyant despite the oil-price collapse 

and a consequent lack of foreign currency.  



COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS



Statement of Comprehensive Income



Total turnover 

Total turnover for the Shoprite Group increased by 14.0% for the six months 

to December 2016 - from R62.52 billion to R71.30 billion. Growth on a like-

for-like basis was 8.6%. Supermarkets RSA reported turnover growth of 10.7% 

and, on a like-for-like basis, of 7.4% while Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded 

sales growth of 32.3% and a like-for-like growth of 14.2%. At constant 

currency rates Supermarkets Non-RSA sales increased by 51.7%. 



Expenses

Total expenses increased by 12.6% which was lower than the sales growth of 

14.0%. Depreciation and amortisation as well as the increase in the cost of 

operating leases grew at a slower rate than turnover, mainly because of 

fewer new stores being opened. However, the spend on the refurbishment of 

existing stores and on information technology is continuing. During the 12 

months a net 51 supermarkets, 24 furniture stores and 50 LiquorShop outlets 

were opened.



Escalations in expenses such as security, electricity and other energy costs 

were beyond the control of the Group. They were nevertheless monitored as 

carefully as possible. 



Trading margin

The trading margin increased from 5.24% to 5.48%. This margin reflects the 

effects of real growth in turnover as well as of investment in new stores 

and in the supply-chain infrastructure. During this six months the Group 

changed its accounting policy with respect to the treatment of advertising 

rebates with certain rebates relating to advertising now being deducted from 

the purchase price of goods. See note 9 in this announcement for more 

detail. 



Exchange rate losses

The Group recorded an exchange rate loss of R188 million against a profit of 

R11 million in the corresponding period. This was partly due to the 

devaluation of certain non-RSA currencies against the US$ and the rand 

during the period under review with the resultant effect on short-term loan 

balances. In addition, the rand also strengthened against the US$ with the 

result that a loss was also recorded on US$ balances held in South Africa as 

well as certain forward foreign exchange contracts. 



Finance cost and interest received

Net interest expense, when compared to the corresponding period, decreased 

due to an improvement in cash flow from an improvement in net working 

capital. For the convertible bonds issued, IFRS requires that interest be 

calculated at a rate that approximates a market-related vanilla bond rate. 

For the six months under review this amounted to a calculated interest 

expense of R202 million compared to the actual interest paid of 

R143 million. 



Statement of Financial Position



Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 133 new corporate outlets, 

vacant land purchased for strategic purposes, investment in information 

technology to support inventory management, distribution centre developments 

as well as normal asset replacements.



Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The decrease in cash at the reporting date resulted from the purchase of US$ 

Index Linked Angolan Government bonds to the value of R770 million during 

this six months. This was done as a hedge against a possible devaluation of 

the Angolan kwanza. In addition, the calendar month closed before the 

accounting month-end date, with the result that some creditors were paid 

before cut-off. Capital expenditure for the six months was on par with that 

of the corresponding six months.



Inventory

The increase in inventory is due to the provisioning of the net 133 new 

corporate outlets as well as the increased capacity created in some of the 

distribution centres. Management is also actively pursuing reducing 

inefficient stock holding at branch level and the increase of 9.4%, much 

lower than turnover growth, shows some progress is being made.



Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables show a decrease of 2.6% on the previous year when 

the calendar month also closed before the accounting month-end date, with 

the result that creditors were paid before cut-off. This small reduction 

goes hand in hand with inventory that increased less than the growth in 

turnover.



Borrowings

The convertible bonds that are redeemable on 3 April 2017 are now reflected 

under current liabilities.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW



Supermarkets RSA

The Group's core business, the South African supermarket operation, 

produced a more than creditable performance, growing sales by 10.7% from 

R45.960 billion to R50.894 billion. This generated a trading profit of

R2.992 billion compared to R2.665 billion in the corresponding period, an

increase of 12.3%. 



Trading through 1 336 outlets and generating almost 80% of the Group's total 

supermarket sales, the division is supported by an extensive and 

increasingly sophisticated supply-line infrastructure that ensures on-shelf 

availability. In fact, the in-stock levels in stores are the highest ever, 

the result of extensive, integrated planning by the different disciplines in 

the business. 



As a result of the slowdown in the economy and the pressure on disposable 

income, customers across the spectrum increasingly searched for better 

value. To satisfy their needs, the Group sourced products across the globe 

that offer such value at affordable prices. It also extended its range of 

private label brands extensively to assist price sensitive consumers. 



During the review period the Group greatly intensified its customer-centric 

focus in every aspect of its business to serve the needs of customers 

better. In response, the Group's market share increased to 31.7% from 31.2%. 



Its supermarkets offer customers an extensive range of ancillary services 

such as LiquorShop, Money Market, MediRite and Computicket, entrenching them 

as one-stop destination stores. LiquorShop, the country's fastest-growing 

retail liquor chain at a store opening rate of one per week, increased 

turnover 26.3% through 355 outlets of which 29 were opened in the six months 

to December.



The flagship Shoprite brand with its focus on middle and lower-income 

consumers was fully exposed to the effects of a strained economy. An 

extensive range of highly successful promotional activities, especially 

during a buoyant festive season, effectively countered this negative 

environment. It also continued to subsidise basic food prices to assist the 

most economically vulnerable. Shoprite, which opened a net 17 new stores 

during the last 12 months, grew turnover by 8.8% to R25.899 billion, 

notwithstanding an environment in which internal inflation for the Group 

averaged 7.4%, the highest rate in years.



Checkers continued its uninterrupted growth of the past few years further 

entrenching its appeal to higher-income consumers. It increased sales by 

11.1% to R19.346 billion across its 235 stores. Growth on existing business 

was a satisfactory 7.4%. The chain continued its drive to grow sales of 

fresh and convenience foods with an expanded and enhanced offering four-fold 

over the festive season.  



The small-format Usave chain with its limited offering produced total 

turnover growth of 13.1% - the highest of the various formats. It did so 

through its 294 stores in South Africa, while also recording excellent 

growth on existing business. Management continues to enforce strict 

disciplines to ensure the chain does not stray from its primary positioning 

of offering the lowest possible prices on a restricted product range.



Supermarkets Non-RSA

Supermarkets Non-RSA, which trades in 14 countries in the rest of Africa and 

Indian Ocean islands, produced excellent results for the six months with 

Angola and Nigeria the top performers. The 221 supermarkets and 13 

LiquorShops generated turnover that grew 32.3% from R9.735 billion to 

R12.877 billion. During the twelve months a net 22 new supermarkets opened 

with another 11 to follow in the second half of the year.



Despite the chronic shortage of foreign currency in especially the oil-

producing countries such as Angola and Nigeria, the Group enjoyed a 

significant competitive advantage in that it could fund its stock 

requirements from its external balance sheet, unlike many other traders in 

the region. Product availability saw consumers flock to its stores, 

resulting in a constant currency sales increase of 155.4% in Angola and 

60.1% in Nigeria. During the reporting period the customer base of the 

Group's 29 supermarkets in Angola grew by 70% and that of Nigeria's 23 

outlets by 56.3%.



Management is aware that such high growth levels may not be sustainable in 

the longer term. However, it is confident that the majority of the new 

customers, having become acquainted with the stores' price positioning and 

product quality and availability, should be retained when market conditions 

improve.



Furniture

The furniture division grew total sales by 10%. This was mainly due to the 

strong performance of its 75 stores outside South Africa which increased 

sales by 38.6% during the reporting period. Once again, the star performer 

was Angola. In South Africa, where the division operates 437 outlets under 

various brands, the difficult trading conditions saw sales grow 3.4%, well 

below budget. Of the division's several chains, the dominant OK Furniture 

continued to do well, increasing turnover by 17.0% while the more upmarket 

House & Home delivered negative growth. 



Other Operating Segments

OK Franchise: The ongoing restructuring of this division, aimed at improving 

service delivery to members and enhancing the image of the OK brand among 

consumers, has produced excellent results, with turnover increasing by 13.7% 

and growth on existing business by 13.0%. The division now has 377 members 

in South Africa and Namibia, having gained 27 in the six months to December. 

The decision to enable members to open standalone liquor stores saw the 

number of outlets rise from ten a year ago to 47. Its management 

infrastructure is being extended to enhance support for members, whose 

purchases from Group distribution centres grew by 36% over the six-month 

period. While increasing the frequency of deliveries to members, the 

division will also be extending its offering in the second half of the year 

to include perishables and frozen products.



MediRite: The division comprises two business units - the retail pharmacy 

chain MediRite and Transpharm, a wholesaler of medical products. Hampered 

by, amongst others, government imposed exit price restrictions, the division 

as a whole still operates at a loss. MediRite trades from 161 pharmacies of 

which 12 are in Angola and three in Swaziland, with plans afoot to expand to 

Mozambique. Transpharm, which supplies to MediRite as well as a number of 

external customers, returned a profit for the six months. 



Computicket: The operations of Computicket continue to be constrained by

lack of disposable consumer income as well as the relative weakness of the

rand which places visits by major international artists beyond the reach of

local impresarios. The entertainment calendar for the balance of the year

looks much healthier, though. However, its travel division continues to do

well despite the adverse trading environment.   



GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

Although a slightly higher growth rate is predicted for 2017, it will in our 

view have at most a minimal effect on the financial wellbeing of the members 

of our primary target market. The high levels of unemployment are bound to 

persist with continued consumer indebtedness and shrinking disposable 

income. However, we have repeatedly shown we are able to function profitably 

in such an environment. We continued to enjoy excellent consumer support at 

the start of the second half of the year and we are confident this will 

continue for the rest of this reporting period. 



RETIREMENT OF DR WHITEY BASSON AS CEO

Dr Whitey Basson, who headed Shoprite from 1979, retired as CEO at the end 

of the reporting period. During those 37 years he, with the support of an 

experienced management team, transformed a small eight-store chain into the

biggest food retailer on the African continent, in so doing, deservedly,

becoming a legendary business name. Dr Basson, who is continuing his 

association with the Group in the role of vice chairman, has been succeeded 

by Mr Pieter Engelbrecht who, for most of his 20 years with the Group, has 

worked in close association with Dr Basson. He and his management team will 

continue to build on and expand the business philosophy and principles that 

have enabled Shoprite to perform well even under the most trying conditions.

Angola Government Bonds which are classified as held-to-maturity 

investments. The Group classifies investments as held-to-maturity if they 

are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and 

fixed maturities and the Group intends to, and is able to, hold them to 

maturity.



Held-to-maturity financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 

plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 

recognition, held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised 

cost, using the effective interest rate method. These financial assets are 

included under non-current assets unless it matures within 12 months after 

statement of financial position date. Interest on held-to-maturity financial 

assets is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as part of 

other operating income.



If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, 

the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the held-to-

maturity investments' carrying amount and the present value of the estimated 

future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate 

applicable to the relevant held-to-maturity investments. The carrying amount 

will be reduced and the loss recognised in the statement of comprehensive 

income.



Change in accounting policy

During the reporting period, the Group changed its accounting policy with 

respect to the treatment of advertising rebates in line with the guidance 

provided by the newly issued IFRS 15: Revenue From Contracts With Customers. 

The change in accounting policy allows for symmetry in the accounting 

treatment of rebates by suppliers and customers, i.e. if the supplier is 

treating the rebate as a reduction of revenue, the Group as the customer 

should account for rebates as a reduction in the purchase price of 

inventory, which will result in a reduction of cost of sales when inventory 

is sold. The Group previously reflected these rebates net of advertising 

expenses as part of other operating income. Further, in accordance with 

IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, this 

results in information that is more relevant to the financial position and 

performance of the Group. The change in accounting policy will be effective 

for the year ending June 2017 and will be applied retrospectively. This has 

therefore resulted in a restatement of the comparative June 2016 and 

December 2015 figures on the statement of financial position and statement 

of comprehensive income. Refer to note 9 for further information and a 

summary of the effect of this change in accounting policy.

     The Group has issued 6.5% 

     convertible bonds for a principal 

     amount of R4.7 billion 

     (Dec '15: R4.7 billion; 

     Jun '16: R4.7 billion). The 

     bonds mature on 3 April 2017 

     at their nominal value of 

     R4.7 billion (Dec '15: 

     R4.7 billion; Jun '16: 

     R4.7 billion) or can be

     for an equivalent non-convertible 

     bond at initial recognition. 

     The residual amount, representing 

     the value of the equity conversion 

     option, is included in shareholders' 

     equity in other reserves, net of 

     income taxes.

     using cash flows discounted at a rate based on the borrowings rate of

     The fair value is calculated using cash flows discounted at a rate

     based on the borrowings rate of 10.5% (Dec '15: 9.8%; Jun '16: 10.5%)

     at a rate based on the borrowings rate of 7.8% (Dec '15: 9.4%; 

     Jun '16: 9.5%) and is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

9    CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY

     During the reporting period, the Group changed its accounting 

     policy with respect to the treatment of advertising rebates. 

     ""IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers"" provides more 

     clarity on how the supplier should treat the payment of rebates 

     to its customers: ""An entity shall account for consideration payable 

     to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore,

     of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a 

     distinct good or service (as described in paragraphs 26 to 30) that 

     the customer transfers to the entity."" (IFRS 15 par 70).



     The Group's advertising rebates result from the process of negotiating 

     the best product price with the supplier and therefore the Group 

     does not provide distinct goods or services to its suppliers in 

     exchange for the rebates. It is our view that the rebates paid by 

     our suppliers would therefore be treated as a reduction of the 

     suppliers' revenue in terms of IFRS 15. We believe that there should 

     be symmetry in the accounting treatment of rebates by suppliers 

     and customers. Therefore if the supplier is treating the rebate as 

     a reduction of revenue, the Group, as the customer, should account 

     for rebates as a reduction in the purchase price of inventory, 

     which will result in a reduction of cost of sales when inventory is

     sold.



     The Group previously classified these rebates net of advertising 

     expenses with its other operating income in the statement of 

     comprehensive income. It was concluded that the Group's inventory 

     accounting policy should be changed as a result of the additional 

     guidance provided by IFRS 15 with regards to the accounting 

     treatment of our rebates. Further, in accordance with ""IAS 8: 

     Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors"", 

     it results in information that is more relevant to the financial 

     position and performance.



     The change in accounting policy will be effective for the year 

     ending June 2017 and will be applied retrospectively. This has 

     therefore resulted in a restatement of the comparative 2016 and 

     2015 figures on the statement of financial position. The aggregate 

     effect of the changes in accounting policy on the annual financial

     statements and interim results for these periods are as follows:



                                                                  Unaudited

WITHDRAWAL OF JOINT CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders of Steinhoff and Shoprite (together “the Companies”) are referred to the joint
announcement of the Companies on 14 December 2016 (“the Cautionary Announcement”), regarding the
negotiations between the Companies, initiated by the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (“PIC”)
and Titan Premier Investments Proprietary Limited (“Titan”) as the largest shareholders of the
Companies.

The Cautionary Announcement dealt with the potential sale of Steinhoff’s Africa retail assets to Shoprite
(“the Proposed Transaction”), as well the possible exchange by the PIC and Titan of their Shoprite shares
for Steinhoff shares at an “to be agreed” ratio (“the Share Exchange”).

Shareholders of the Companies are hereby informed that the Companies have decided to terminate their
negotiations related to the Proposed Transaction as the PIC, Titan and Steinhoff could not reach
agreement on the exchange ratio that would apply to the Share Exchange.

The Proposed Transaction was investigated and analysed by the respective management teams of
Steinhoff and Shoprite, and although the Proposed Transaction presents exciting opportunities for the
Companies and their respective management teams, the fact that the relevant parties could not reach an
agreement in respect of the Share Exchange resulted in the negotiations being terminated.

Accordingly, shareholders of Steinhoff and Shoprite are advised that caution is no longer required to be
exercised by shareholders when dealing in their Steinhoff and/or Shoprite securities.

JOINT DETAILED CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AFRICAN RETAIL CHAMPION

1.   Background
     Shareholders of Steinhoff and Shoprite are hereby advised that the largest shareholders of both
     companies, namely the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (“PIC”) and Titan Premier
     Investments Proprietary Limited (“Titan”) (a company ultimately controlled by a family trust of Dr.
     Christo Wiese) have initiated and facilitated discussions between the Steinhoff and Shoprite boards
     of directors regarding the potential combination of their respective African retail businesses, with the
     objective of establishing a diversified African retail business of significant scale and international
     geographical reach that could be regarded as the retail champion of Africa (“Retail Africa”)
     (“Proposed Transaction”).

     The vision to create Retail Africa, which will be a formidable entity, having its roots firmly entrenched
     in Africa, is shared by both the PIC and Titan. Accordingly, both shareholders have indicated that
     they are fully supportive of an initiative which could lead to the creation of Retail Africa.

     In terms of the Proposed Transaction, it is envisaged that Shoprite will acquire Steinhoff’s African
     retail operations, consisting of:

         -   Pepkor Africa: Pep SA, Ackermans, Speciality Group, including Shoe City, John Craig,
             Refinery and Dunns, as well as the Pep and Ackermans African operations;
         -   JD Group: Russells, Bradlows, Rochester, Incredible Connection, Hi-fi Corporation,
             Sleepmasters and financial services;
         -   Steinbuild, including Buco, Pennypinchers, Timbercity and Hardware Warehouse; and
         -   Tekkie Town (collectively known as “Steinhoff Africa Retail”).

     Shoprite will issue new ordinary shares to Steinhoff in consideration, pursuant to which Steinhoff will
     receive a significant equity interest in Shoprite. The value for Steinhoff Africa Retail will be negotiated
     taking into account the best interests of both Steinhoff and Shoprite shareholders.
     
     From Shoprite’s perspective, the Proposed Transaction is expected to position the combined
     businesses of Retail Africa as the leading multi-format discount retailer on the African continent.
     Retail Africa, locally bred, will have the required size and scale to compete with any other
     international retailer, making it a compelling value proposition for Retail Africa’s value conscious
     African customer base. As the largest retailer in Africa, Retail Africa will employ approximately
     186,000 people. It is expected that the Proposed Transaction will further enhance Retail Africa’s
     position as an employer of choice and it is also anticipated that the Proposed Transaction will not
     result in any job losses. The combined group’s growth plans could lead to future job creation in
     various countries.

     In addition to the above, Steinhoff has entered into an in principle agreement with the PIC and Titan
     to acquire their interests in Shoprite as part of the Proposed Transaction in the form of a Steinhoff
     share-for-Shoprite share exchange, subject to an exchange ratio to be agreed (“the Exchange
     Ratio”) which may ultimately result in Steinhoff acquiring control of Retail Africa. This Exchange
     Ratio will be negotiated taking into account the consideration price for Steinhoff Africa Retail on the
     basis that the Proposed Transaction will not be earnings dilutive to Steinhoff shareholders.

     In addition, Steinhoff may be required to extend a mandatory offer based on the same Exchange
     Ratio to other Shoprite shareholders to acquire their Shoprite ordinary shares (“Offer”). If this is the
     case, such Offer will be in the form of a Steinhoff share-for-Shoprite share exchange, at the
     Exchange Ratio. Shoprite shareholders will, however, at all times have the election right to retain
     their exposure to listed Retail Africa directly or be free to choose to accept the Offer, should it be
     made.

     The boards of directors of both Shoprite and Steinhoff remain fully supportive of maintaining Retail
     Africa’s separate listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and are committed to the preservation
     of an appropriate free float of Retail Africa ordinary shares.

2.   Rationale
     The Proposed Transaction will result in Steinhoff’s African exposure being held through a strategic
     interest, within a separately listed entity with sufficient liquidity, which can be independently valued
     as an African retail champion. Additionally, through Retail Africa, Steinhoff’s African assets will be
     exposed to additional growth opportunities. The Proposed Transaction would allow Steinhoff, as a
     group, to strengthen its exposure and relevance to the African consumer, through the diversified
     global retail platform that would include Africa’s leading fast moving consumer goods, household
     goods and furniture retailer.

     It is expected that Retail Africa’s value proposition will provide its shareholders with a sustainable
     business where the growth and margin improvement opportunities are greater than the current
     individual businesses. The collective product ranges, expertise, infrastructure and size of Retail
     Africa will provide a unique and differentiated customer value proposition, operating in South Africa
     and in 14 African countries in which established infrastructure sharing will take place.

     These benefits would be likely to include: infrastructure and services sharing; product specialisation;
     product diversification; supply chain optimisation; customer loyalty, choice and convenience; and
     people management and benefits, such as, access to additional skills, and attracting retail talent.

     On a pro forma combined basis, Retail Africa would have had revenue and EBITDA of approximately
     ZAR200 billion and ZAR15 billion respectively, for the twelve month period ended 30 June 2016, with
     a strengthened balance sheet structure to support further organic and acquisitive growth in its
     diverse, but complementary constituent businesses.

3.   Cautionary
     The boards of directors of Shoprite and Steinhoff have agreed to enter into formal negotiations with
     regard to the Proposed Transaction which negotiations, if successfully concluded, may have a
     material effect on the price of both companies’ securities. Accordingly, shareholders of both
     Steinhoff and Shoprite are advised to exercise caution when dealing in their securities until further
     details pertaining to the Proposed Transaction are announced. Any forecast financial information
     contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the companies’ external
     auditors.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS



Shoprite Holdings has announced at the company’s Annual General Meeting held
today (31 October 2016) in Cape Town that the company’s Chief Executive
Officer, Dr. Whitey Basson, has decided to retire at the end of December 2016.
To ensure an orderly leadership transition he will remain as non-executive vice
chairman and be available to management.

The Board has appointed Mr Pieter Engelbrecht (47), former Chief Operating
Officer and alternate director, as an executive director and the incoming CEO as
of the first of January 2017. He has been with the company for 20 years and has
played a leading role in the company’s growth under Basson’s leadership.

Basson’s decision to retire will bring to a close a remarkable career of nearly 45
years, virtually all of which was spent with Shoprite, in which the business grew
from     a small eight-store chain with a value of R1m to a globally respected
retailer with a market capitalisation of R114bn, and over 140 000 employees
today.

Dr Christo Wiese, Chairman of the Shoprite Holdings Board, in making the
announcement, said: “Whitey has been a very strong and charismatic leader,
who has managed the company through market transitions and challenging
times, taking calculated risks to turn the supermarket group into the leading
retailer on the continent. He accelerated the growth of the business and inter
alia spearheaded Shoprite’s pioneering expansion into the rest of Africa after
1994. He also successfully acquired and integrated Grand Bazaars, Checkers and
OK Bazaars. He fully deserves his reputation as one of South Africa's 'retail
giants'.”

“The board is immensely grateful for his innumerable contributions to the
company and his distinguished tenure as CEO over almost four decades.             His
continuous service to the company, its employees and shareholders, as well as
to the broader South African business community has been remarkable.
Pleasingly, Dr Basson will remain on the Shoprite Holdings board as Non-
Executive Vice-Chairman to continue to share his knowledge and experience.”

Basson said: “I have been privileged to lead the Shoprite group from small
beginnings to one of the continents’ greatest companies. After so many years
with the group, it’s time to pass the baton to a new generation of leadership.”

“Given the quality of Shoprite Holdings’ current management team and their
exceptional track record I foresee that the company will continue to grow from
strength to strength.   Fortunately effective succession has always been a key
focus for the management team and over the last few years many of the key
operational responsibilities had already been successfully handled by the senior
management team.”

""I look forward to being a sounding board for Pieter Engelbrecht and his team as
they take the company forward and continue the high standards we have always
set ourselves as the supermarket with the lowest prices and the highest level of
customer satisfaction” Basson concluded.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

In the three months to September 2016, the Shoprite Group increased turnover by
15.7%, continuing the momentum of the last quarter of the 2016 financial year.

RSA Supermarkets, the Group’s primary business, increased sales by 12.4% during a
period when internal inflation increased to 7.2% driven by both the drought’s impact on
fresh produce prices and basic commodity items as well as the weaker rand pushing up
the cost of imported general merchandise goods. The core customer base of its Shoprite
chain in particular remained under pressure from rising costs, labour instability and
lack of job creation, but the Group managed to overcome this through price leadership
and successful promotions.

The Group’s Non-RSA Supermarkets achieved a turnover growth of 35.1% (55% in
constant currencies) despite the impact of lower commodity prices and the devaluation
of the currencies of the three main countries where the Group trades on the continent.

The smaller divisions also made a good contribution to Group turnover. The Furniture
division, whilst still labouring under the effect of the amendments to the National Credit
Act, reported increased sales of 9.1% while OK Franchise saw a growth of 14.5%, in line
with the Group’s performance.

Store openings are continuing as planned with 16 supermarkets and 5 furniture stores
opened during this quarter.

The current pace of growth must be viewed in context of the slower growth in the
corresponding period in the prior year. Festive season sales are also difficult to predict,
especially with the increase in food inflation, as well as the weakness of the rand and its
inflationary impact on the price of imported seasonal goods. The Group, however,
remains optimistic in the medium term.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 2016

Key information



The key information is for a 53-week period. The comparative figures for 

52 weeks are given in brackets. Any reference to 52 weeks is for information 

purposes only and is unaudited.

- Trading profit was up 15.0% to R7.278 billion (52 weeks: 11.0% to 

  R7.024 billion).

- Turnover increased 14.4% - from R113.694 billion to R130.028 billion 

  (52 weeks: 11.6% to R126.907 billion).

- Diluted headline earnings per share rose 17.0% - from 769.1 cents to

  899.7 cents (52 weeks: 12.7% to 867.0 cents).

- EBITDA increased by 16.2% - from R8.065 billion to R9.373 billion 

  (52 weeks: 14.0% to R9.191 billion).



Whitey Basson, chief executive, commented:

In our view the Group has produced excellent results in the 12 months to 

June 2016 given the challenging conditions that prevailed in the markets in 

which we operate. Equally gratifying as the results we have achieved, is the 

growing trust placed in us by our customers, with the latest AMPS figures 

showing that 76% of the adult South African population shop at one of our 

supermarket brands - up from 72% a year ago.



There are many factors which contributed to the results we have achieved, 

but crucial amongst them has been an unwavering focus on ensuring the lowest 

prices while also subsidising the price of basic foodstuffs wherever 

possible. Rigorous cost control and more effective operating methods have 

enabled us to achieve this without compromising our trading profit margin 

which remained at 5.6%. Despite intense local competition we managed to keep 

market share above 30%. In June market share increased to the highest level

in three years.



The level of efficiency with which we managed our business is also reflected 

in our internal food inflation. Based on a monthly measurement of 81 000 

product lines, it averaged just 3.5% for the period, well below South 

Africa's official rate of food inflation according to Statistics SA of 7.2% 

for the same period.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

The 12 months to June have been a difficult period economically not only for 

South Africa, but also for the African continent and the world at large. 

South Africa has remained caught in a low-growth trap because of external 

factors beyond its control such as the continued slowdown in the Chinese 

economy and the uncertainty following Brexit.



In a climate of political and economic instability and high unemployment, 

domestic growth has slowed even further. The cost of living was compounded 

by the worst drought in 35 years which has severely impacted prices of basic 

agricultural products. As a result, the disposable income of especially 

lower-income consumers has come under increasing pressure.



This drought has had an equally debilitating effect on the economies of 

those countries in Southern Africa where we do business, while growth in 

West-African countries such as Angola and Nigeria has been stifled by the 

continued low price of oil on world markets and a severe lack of foreign 

currency.



When seen against this backdrop, then the performance of the Group was even 

more impressive. In the 12 months to June the Group continued to be 

leaders in the food retailing sector in South Africa as well as in the

countries where it trades elsewhere in Africa. The strongest performance was

delivered by the African division with impressive turnover and profit growth

despite severe trading restrictions in some of its markets. In the local

market several of the smaller business units performed extremely well, the

star among these once again being LiquorShop which grew turnover by 32.3%

and like-for-like sales by 15.4%. Non-RSA liquor sales also showed rapid

growth. LiquorShop opened 44 outlets during the reporting period.



COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS



Statement of Comprehensive Income



Total turnover

As a general rule most international retailers report their results 

utilising full weeks. The Group also uses this accepted accounting

procedure, with the result that an extra week is included approximately

every five to six years. This extra week is included in this year's results.

Total turnover increased by 14.4% for the 12 months to June 2016 – from

R113.69 billion to R130.03 billion. For a comparative 52 weeks the growth

was 11.6%.



Turnover growth in Non-RSA countries was negatively affected by the drop in 

oil prices (Angola and Nigeria) while their currencies also depreciated 

against the US$. There was also a significant depreciation of the Zambian 

kwacha. On the positive side, the Group's Palanca store in Angola reopened 

to great acclaim in April of this year. In addition, the Supermarkets Non-

RSA segment continued with its strategy of importing inventory to ensure 

that customers have a proper range of products available to them. This 

contributed to an excellent performance by this segment in the second half 

of the year with a turnover growth of 43.1% (52 on 52 weeks). The increase 

for the year at constant rates was 39.0%.



At the same time the general state of the economy in RSA is placing a damper 

on consumer spending. The Supermarkets RSA operation nevertheless showed its 

resilience with a satisfactory turnover growth of 10.9% and 8.1% for 52 

weeks. This segment also had a much improved second six months with a 

turnover growth of 9.0% (52 on 52 weeks).



Expenses

Depreciation and amortisation as well as the increase in the cost of 

operating leases grew at a faster rate than turnover. This was mainly due to 

the Group's continued investment in new stores and the refurbishment of 

existing ones as well as in information technology. During the 12 months a 

net 67 supermarkets and 26 furniture stores were opened. The Group continues 

its roll-out of new stores, albeit at a more cautious pace, to enable it to 

derive the maximum long-term benefit from the expected eventual improvement 

in the economy.



Escalations in expenses such as security, electricity and other energy costs 

were beyond the control of the Group. They were nevertheless monitored as 

carefully as possible.



Trading margin

The trading margin increased slightly from 5.57% to 5.60%, but decreased 

marginally to 5.53% when the effect of the extra week is taken into 

consideration. This margin reflects the effects of real growth in turnover 

as well as of investment in new stores and in the Group's supply-chain 

infrastructure.



Exchange rate losses

The Group recorded an exchange rate loss of R46 million against a loss of 

R132 million in the corresponding period. This was mainly due to the 

devaluation of the Angolan, Nigerian and Zambian currencies against the 

US$ during the period under review with the resultant effect on short-term 

loan balances.



Finance cost and interest received

Net interest paid, when compared to the corresponding period, increased due 

to a general hike in rates during the year and with capital and information 

technology expenditure almost on par with the previous year. For the 

convertible bonds issued, IFRS requires that interest be calculated at a 

rate that approximates a market-related vanilla bond rate. For the 12 months 

under review this amounted to a calculated interest paid of R449 million 

compared to the actual interest paid of R305 million.



Earnings per share

Diluted headline earnings per share increased by 17.0% - from 769.1 cents to 

899.7 cents and increased by 12.7% when the 53rd week is excluded.



Statement of Financial Position



Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 104 new corporate stores, 

vacant land purchased for strategic purposes, investment in information 

technology to support inventory management, distribution centre developments 

as well as normal asset replacements.



Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The decrease in cash at the reporting date resulted from capital expenditure

of about R4.8 billion during the past 12 months. In addition, the calendar

month closed before the year-end date, with the result that creditors were

paid before the accounting month end.



Inventory

The increase in inventory is due to the provisioning of the net 104 new 

corporate stores as well as the increased capacity created in some of the 

distribution centres. Management is also actively pursuing reductions of 

inefficient stock holding at branch level and the increase of 12.6%, lower 

than turnover growth, indicates that some progress was made.



Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables show a decrease of 4.8% on the previous year mainly 

due to the calendar month that closed before the year-end date, with the

result that creditors were paid before the accounting month end.



Borrowings

The convertible bonds that are redeemable on 3 April 2017 are now reflected 

under current liabilities.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

In the past year the focus on becoming even more customer-centric had very

positive results for the Group. Fulfilling shoppers' basic requirements so

that they always find the products they want at competitive prices, has

major implications for the way we run our business and for our 

relationship with customers.



To meet the challenge of having preferred products on the shelf in time, the 

Group has continued to expand and refine its supply-line infrastructure in 

close cooperation with suppliers. At the same time staff training programmes 

have been greatly expanded to increase skills and build a more service-

orientated culture.



Supermarkets RSA

The South African operation, which remains the Group's core business, 

representing more than 80% of total supermarket turnover, continues as a 

major player in the domestic food retailing sector. With its four different 

formats covering the full consumer spectrum, it performed very well under 

the difficult prevailing circumstances, supported by the extensive range of 

ancillary services provided. Boosted by a strong second half, it achieved a 

turnover growth of 10.9% to R94.167 billion and a trading profit of R5.814 

billion for the 53 weeks.



During the reporting period the Group opened an additional 57 supermarkets 

to bring its total number of supermarkets in South Africa to 964. Food-

retailing formats were further streamlined during this time to better serve 

the needs of smaller communities without compromising quality. Many of these 

new stores are located close to residential areas for greater convenience.



The Shoprite brand, with 439 stores, generating R46.562 billion in sales, a 

growth of 9.2%, continues as the flagship of the Group. There was a strong 

focus on price to retain its low-price leadership in the market, driven by 

several highly successful promotional programmes which also involved 

subsidising certain basic food items to assist the poorest of the poor. Its 

stores, which generate almost half of the Group's total supermarket sales in 

South Africa, also continued to serve as prominent centres for the monthly 

pay-out of grants and paid out 19 million grants over the year for children, 

the elderly and the unemployed.



The Checkers supermarkets and hypers reported solid sales growth of 11.0% to 

R33.968 billion for the year. Work is ongoing in the Checkers network of 

stores to further upgrade specialist departments for cheese, wine, meat and 

fresh foods and thus increase their appeal for higher-income urban 

professionals in particular.



Usave with its limited range of essential product lines and promise of 

everyday low prices, also enjoyed a good year, growing turnover by 11.8% to 

R5.520 billion and customer numbers by 5.0%. It opened 30 new stores during 

the year bringing the total number of outlets in South Africa to 292.



To support the growing number of outlets, the supply chain infrastructure is 

continually expanded. In Cape Town a 120 000 square meter regional 

distribution node, scheduled for completion before the end of 2017, will 

consolidate the activities of five distribution centres spread throughout 

the metro and greatly improve efficiencies in the provisioning of stores in 

the area.



Supermarkets Non-RSA

The Group achieved excellent results elsewhere in Africa, which it considers 

a natural geographic extension of its South African operations. 

Notwithstanding stagnant commodity prices, a lack of foreign currency and 

slower growth in several of the 14 countries where it trades, sales growth 

for the 53 weeks accelerated by 32.6% (29.1% on a 52-week basis) and on a 

constant currency basis by 39.0% (35.3% on a 52-week basis) while the number 

of customers increased by 16%. Shoprite succeeded in operating successfully 

in every market where it has a presence, even in small ones such as Uganda 

and Malawi, both of which have been earmarked for further expansion.



The Group opened 22 supermarkets during the review period, most of them in 

Angola, Zambia and Nigeria, to bring the total number of supermarkets beyond 

South Africa's borders to 207. Angola was the star performer as, unlike most 

other retailers, the Group was not restricted in its trading by the 

country's severe lack of foreign exchange. In fact, it was able to replenish 

its 29 supermarkets, spread throughout the country, on an almost continuous 

basis. This near-exclusive availability of stock propelled very strong sales 

to the extent that Angola reported the highest sales growth of all the 

countries where Shoprite trades.



Although trading conditions in Nigeria, another important West-African 

market for the Group, were extremely demanding because of import 

restrictions, a collapsing oil industry and a lack of foreign exchange, the 

Group has continued to grow its presence, opening seven supermarkets during 

the reporting period with another four to follow in the new financial year.



Furniture

The Division's turnover growth of 15.3% (12.5% on a 52-week basis) was 

boosted by a substantial increase in the number of outlets in the previous 

financial year when it expanded its footprint by 103 stores. However, the 

growth in turnover masks the extremely difficult market conditions in which 

lack of disposable income was more pronounced than in almost any other 

sector of the retail industry. As a result, the Division's profitability 

came under considerable pressure in an intensely competitive environment.



The Furniture Division was markedly affected by the latest amendments to the 

National Credit Act that has legislated a more onerous calculation of 

affordability. This has not only complicated the granting of credit but has 

also eliminated a substantial number of potential customers. These changes 

had a material effect on the Division's profitability with both finance and 

insurance income being negatively affected by the drop in credit 

participation.



After several years of deflation, the furniture sector recently experienced 

rapidly increasing inflation. This helped turnover growth in the Division's 

three chains of which two - OK Furniture, by far the largest with 387 

outlets, and OK Power Express - are focused on the middle to lower end of 

the market while House and Home caters mainly for the higher income earners.



Like the rest of the Group, the Furniture Division is also accelerating its 

push into Africa where it now runs 67 stores in seven markets which include, 

in addition to the BLNS countries, also Mozambique, Zambia and Angola.



Other Operating Segments

OK Franchise: During the past year an energised Franchise Division was 

substantially restructured to see it become a more competitive and assertive 

player in its market segment. The number of OK trading formats was reduced 

and a strong focus placed on upgrading all franchise stores to OK standards. 

At the same time a programme was launched to further improve and strengthen 

the Group's relationship with members. Management's decision to allow 

members to open standalone liquor stores was received favourably.



These steps, coupled with an increased frequency in deliveries to stores, 

have resulted in a marked improvement in the quality of customer service 

provided by members. This in turn has led to a substantial increase in 

turnover which grew by 15.6% to R5.583 billion for the year. The OK brand's 

growth in stature has also led to an increasing number of developers 

approaching the Division to take up space in new shopping malls.



MediRite: The Pharmacy Division consists of two business units: The in-store 

pharmacy chain MediRite with 160 outlets of which 12 are in Angola and three 

in Swaziland; and the wholesale operation trading under the name Transpharm 

which supplies 99% of MediRite's stock in addition to servicing a range of 

private clients.



Africa will be an important focus for both MediRite and Transpharm in the 

new financial year. All 12 MediRite's in Angola, of which five were opened 

during the year, are operating profitably.



MediRite is at present cooperating closely with the South African department 

of health whereby its pharmacies will serve as pick-up points for people 

receiving chronic medication from the State. This service will be rolled out 

to 58 pharmacies in the course of 2017.



Computicket: The profitability of Computicket, which operates from the Money 

Market kiosks in Shoprite and Checkers supermarkets, was again compromised 

by the weakness of the rand. The devalued rand placed leading international 

artists for local concert tours beyond the reach of South African 

impresarios. However, its travel division, established several years ago, 

continued to show substantial growth, especially in respect of the services 

it offers for travel on the continent.



GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

There is nothing to indicate that the demanding trading conditions in South 

Africa and in the countries in which the Group has a presence will ease in 

the year ahead. If anything, conditions could become even more stressful, 

judging by recent predictions such as the Governor of the South African 

Reserve Bank expecting no growth for the country in the months ahead, while 

the growth prospects for sub-Saharan Africa have again been revised down by 

international agencies such as the IMF. The disposable income of a large 

percentage of our customer base will therefore remain under intense pressure.



However, we are buoyed by the fact that over the years the Group has 

acquired the skill to operate successfully even under the most adverse 

conditions, as it has again demonstrated in the past financial year. This 

gives us the confidence to believe we can do it again, for ours is a 

business structured to withstand difficult times with a tried and tested 

management team that operates at its best under challenging conditions.

2.1  Convertible bonds 

     The Group has issued 6.5% convertible bonds 

     for a principal amount of R4.7 billion 

     (2015: R4.7 billion). The bonds mature on 

     3 April 2017 at their nominal value of 

     R4.7 billion (2015: R4.7 billion) or can 

     be converted into shares at the holders' 

     option at the maturity date at the rate of 

     5 919.26 shares per R1 million. The Group holds, 

     subject to conditions, rights on early 

     redemption. The values of the liability 

     component and the equity conversion component 

     were determined at issuance of the bonds. 

  

     The fair value of the liability component 

     was calculated using a market interest rate 

     for an equivalent non-convertible bond at 

     initial recognition. The residual amount, 

     representing the value of the equity 

     conversion option, is included in 

     shareholders' equity in other reserves, 

     net of income taxes. 



     The convertible bonds recognised in the 

     statement of financial position is 

     calculated as follows: 

  

     Liability component at the beginning of the year   4 511         4 381

     Interest expense                                     449           436

     Liability component at the end of the year         4 655         4 511

  

3    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

     The fair value of amounts owing by employees 

     included in loans and receivables amounted 

     to R217.0 million (2015: R216.0 million) at 

     the statement of financial position date. 

     The fair value is calculated using cash flows 

     discounted at a rate based on the borrowings 

     rate of 10.5% (2015: 9.3%) and is within 

     level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

  

     The fair value of the liability component 

     of the convertible bonds included in borrowings 

     amounted to R4.7 billion (2015: R4.6 billion) 

     at the statement of financial position date. 

     The fair value is calculated using cash flows 

     discounted at a rate based on the borrowings 

     rate of 9.5% (2015: 8.5%) and is within 

     level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

  

     The book value of all other financial assets 

     and liabilities approximate the fair 

     values thereof.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

The Shoprite Group increased total turnover by 14.4% for the 12 months to June 2016
to about R130.03 billion compared to R113.69 billion during the preceding 12 months.
The current period comprised 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the prior year. On a
comparative 52-week basis, turnover growth was 11.6% with like-for-like growth of
5.5%.

After an improved trading performance in the second half of the year, the South African
supermarket operation increased sales by 10.9% (8.1% on a 52-week basis). Internal
inflation was lower and averaged just 3.9% for the period compared to 4.8% during
the corresponding 12 months.

Sales growth for the Group’s non-RSA supermarkets accelerated to 32.6% (29.0% on
a 52-week basis) despite the impact of lower commodity prices and the devaluation of
certain currencies. On a constant currency basis, sales grew by 39.0% (35.3% for the
52-week period).

The Group’s furniture division grew sales by 15.3% for the period (12.5% on a 52-
week basis), with the OK Furniture brand still the best performer.

The Other Operating Segments achieved growth of 12.8% (11.9% on a 52-week basis)

The above financial information has not been reviewed or reported on by Shoprite
Holding’s auditors. The financial results for the review period will be published on or
about Tuesday, 23 August 2016.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS : RESULTS FOR THE 6 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 2015


Key information

-  Trading profit up 10.4% to R3.314 billion.

-  Turnover up 8.8% to R62.519 billion.

-  Diluted headline earnings per share up 8.9% to 403.0 cents 

   (2014: 370.2 cents).

-  Dividend per share up 9.1% to 156 cents (2014: 143 cents).



Whitey Basson, chief executive: 

For the six months to December 2015 the Shoprite Group lifted total turnover 

by 8.8% to R62.519 billion despite South Africa's weak economic growth and 

high unemployment. The improved sales growth in the second quarter is 

particularly pleasing considering internal food inflation declined over the 

period and was less than half that of the corresponding period (2.2% vs 

5.2%).


Effective management of all aspects of the business, including cost control, 

enabled the Group to achieve a trading profit which, at R3.314 billion 

(2014: R3.003 billion) is 10.4% higher than in the comparative period. In a 

highly competitive environment, the trading margin increased from 5.2% to 

5.3% as the Group's established store and distribution infrastructure 

continued to become more efficient.


The Group's results were boosted by strong growth in the major markets where 

it trades outside South Africa. The economies of oil-rich Angola and 

Nigeria showed surprising resilience despite the challenges brought about by 

the steep drop in the oil price. Sustainable growth remains central to the 

Group's strategy and during the twelve months to December a total of 176 net 

new corporate stores were opened (74 of which were in the period under 

review). Some 6 150 new jobs were created making us one of the largest

employers in South Africa, employing more than 136 000 people.


The fact that there is at least some consultation between Government and

business regarding economic solutions is something we welcome.  We should

however be careful that we don't keep ourselves busy with fanciful Star Wars

projects and neglect basic initiatives such as job creation, crime and

education at a ground level. The question has to also be asked if we are

really capable of managing the current mix of parastatals. We also caution

that the slowdown in global commodity prices, although an influencing factor,

it is only part of the problem and we must not overlook the inefficiencies

in our own economy.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

It has been a challenging six months for consumers, especially for those in 

the middle and lower income groups. The effects of a weak currency as well 

as a devastating drought have begun to be felt, with initial increases in 

the price of staples such as maize, cooking oil and similar essentials. The 

slowdown in the Chinese economy and the consequent drop in the demand for 

commodities impacted South Africa's extensive mining industry with 

widespread job losses. In African countries, as in most emerging economies, 

growth has also slowed but as yet consumer spending has not been affected to 

the same extent as in South Africa. It is unavoidable that under these 

circumstances competition among retailers in South Africa would intensify. 

This has put margins under pressure as everyone battles for their share of 

the consumer's rand. Compounding the situation is the high cost of transport 

that has seen many consumers shop closer to home at informal traders where 

short-term credit is also available. Despite these demanding conditions 

Shoprite retained its commanding position and the ability to trade 

profitably.


COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS


Statement of Comprehensive Income


Total turnover

The Group increased total turnover for the six months to R62.52 billion, an 

increase of 8.8%. Turnover growth in Non-RSA countries was negatively 

affected by the drop in oil prices (Angola and Nigeria), currency 

depreciation (particularly in Zambia and Mozambique) and droughts. This was 

offset by certain Non-RSA currencies remaining stronger than the rand as 

well as new stores opened. At the same time the general state of the economy 

placed a damper on consumer spending. Against the backdrop of these 

challenges, Supermarkets RSA reported a sales growth of 7.2%, an improvement 

on the first quarter's 4.9%. Supermarkets Non-RSA reported an increase of 

15.2% at current exchange rates and 23.5% at constant rates.


Expenses

Depreciation and amortisation, as well as the cost of operating leases grew 

at a faster rate than turnover. This was mainly due to the Group's continued 

investment in new and refurbished stores and information technology. 

During the last 12 months a net 70 supermarkets and 92 furniture stores were 

opened. The Group continues its roll-out of new stores, albeit at a more 

cautious pace, to enable it to derive the maximum long-term benefit from the 

expected eventual improvement in the economy. Escalations in expenses such 

as security, electricity and other energy costs are items over which the 

Group has little control. They were nevertheless managed as stringently as 

possible. 


Trading margin

The trading margin edged up to 5.30% (2014: 5.23%) and reflects the effects 

of improved real growth in turnover as well as the investment in new stores 

and supply chain infrastructure becoming more efficient. 


Exchange rate gains

The Group recorded an exchange rate gain of R11 million compared to a loss 

of R68 million in the corresponding period. This was mainly due to the rand 

depreciating against the US dollar and certain African currencies during the 

period under review with the resultant effect on short-term loan balances 

and cash balances. 


Finance cost and interest received

Net interest paid, when compared to the corresponding period, increased 

with capital and information technology expenditure higher than the previous

year. For the convertible bonds issued, IFRS requires that interest be 

calculated at a rate that approximates a market-related vanilla bond rate. 

For the six months under review this amounted to a calculated interest 

expense of R222.9 million compared to the actual interest paid of 

R152.6 million. 


Earnings per share

Basic headline earnings increased by 8.9% - from 371.9 cents to 405.0 cents 

while diluted headline earnings per share increased by a similar 8.9% - from 

370.2 cents to 403.0 cents. 


Statement of Financial Position


Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The increase is due to the investment in a net 176 new corporate stores, 

vacant land purchased for strategic purposes, investment in information

technology and distribution centres as well as normal asset replacements.


Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

The decrease in cash at the reporting date resulted from the capital 

expenditure of about R4.816 billion during the past 12 months.


Inventory

The increase in inventory is due to the provisioning of the net 176 new 

corporate stores as well as the increased capacity created in distribution 

centres. Management is also actively pursuing reductions of inefficient 

stock holding at branch level but, at the same time, has to embrace the 

opportunity to purchase inventory ahead of anticipated price increases to 

support margin. 


OPERATIONAL REVIEW 

Under challenging circumstances all the divisions in the Group produced 

satisfactory results for the six months to December 2015. These divisions 

are supported by an extensive and highly sophisticated supply-line 

infrastructure. A network of distribution centres which serve as 

collection points for an increasing number of suppliers, ensures the 

delivery of merchandise to stores at the right time and the best price. 

Work started in January this year on the construction of an 85 000 square 

meter regional distribution node outside Cape Town that will further enhance 

service to stores. A new system for demand management is being introduced 

across the Group that will further strengthen its value chain. IT and other 

systems are being upgraded on an ongoing basis to further improve ranging 

and on-shelf availability in stores and extend electronic integration with 

suppliers.

Supermarkets RSA

Buoyed by a stronger second quarter that benefited from a successful festive 

season, Supermarkets RSA increased turnover by 7.2% (2014: 12.0%) to R45.960 

billion. This generated a trading profit of R2.676 billion which was 9.0% 

higher than in the corresponding period (2014: R2.456 billion). This growth 

was achieved in an environment in which internal food inflation was 

stringently controlled to bring it down to 2.2%, almost half of the 5.2% of 

the corresponding period. 


Ancillary services such as Money Market, MediRite and LiquorShops aimed at 

extending the customer offering continued to attract shoppers and lift 

in-store sales. LiquorShops, which locates its outlets just outside or near 

Group supermarkets, has shown dynamic growth since its inception. Opening 

the equivalent of almost a store a week during the period under review, it 

now operates 307 outlets in South Africa. It grew sales by 31.6%, almost 

double that of the rest of the market resulting in strong market share gain. 


The growth in turnover reported by the Shoprite chain, the Group's flagship 

brand, reflects the lack of disposable income of its traditional middle to 

lower income categories. With these shoppers tending to visit stores less 

frequently because of the transport costs involved, strategies have been 

implemented to maximise basket size when consumers do visit. Marketing 

campaigns have been intensified to strengthen the chain's price positioning. 

The chain has continued to subsidise basic food stuffs such as bread, milk 

and rice, putting money back in the pockets of consumers while also 

driving volume growth in those product categories. Shoprite opened a net 10 

new stores during the review period to trade from 435 outlets in South 

Africa. 


Targeting mainly middle to higher-income consumers, Checkers, which consists 

of 195 supermarkets and 36 hyper stores, was again the best performing 

supermarket brand, growing turnover by 8.1%. The Checkers Hypers, large-

format supermarkets which are centrally located to make them readily 

accessible for its target market, were the star performers. Non-food sales 

were particularly encouraging. We believe the brand still has growth 

potential, since it remains underrepresented in many of the country's more 

affluent communities.


Usave with its limited product range has felt the effect of the growing 

tendency among consumers to buy from informal traders closer to home. It 

added a net 22 stores during the last 12 months to its base of 264 small-

format outlets. 


Supermarkets Non-RSA

The Group continues to extend its operations in sub-Saharan Africa and now 

operates 199 supermarkets in 14 countries outside South Africa. A net 10 new 

supermarkets were opened during the six months to December 2015. Non-RSA 

sales increased 15.2% and 23.5% in constant currencies. Despite the sharp 

drop in commodity prices, oil-dependent countries such as Nigeria and 

especially Angola performed very well. Boosted by the opening of two new 

stores, Angola replaced Zambia as the biggest contributor to Non-RSA 

turnover. The large store in Palanca near Luanda, which burnt down more 

than a year ago, will reopen its doors in April this year and is expected 

to boost turnover even further. Despite import restrictions and forex 

shortage, Nigeria opened four new stores during the period with four 

more planned for the second half of the year. 


Furniture 

In line with the rest of the durables retail sector, the Furniture 

Division felt the effects of the volatile exchange rate and the poor state 

of the economy. The large number of new outlets opened in the previous 

financial year enabled it to increase turnover by 13.7% while growth on 

existing business remained almost flat. The best performers continued to be 

the middle-income chains OK Furniture and OK Power Express. Whereas the 

sector had to contend with price deflation for several years, the situation 

changed in the six months to December, with price inflation rising to 5.7%. 

Credit sales continued to decrease and now lag cash sales by a considerable 

margin. One of the main contributing factors is the implementation in 

September 2015 of the first set of amendments to the National Credit Act 

which introduced a more onerous calculation of affordability. This has made 

it harder for consumers to obtain credit. During the period under review, 

the division added a net 17 new stores to bring the total number of outlets 

to 488 of which 61 are outside South Africa. 


Other Operating Segments

The OK Franchise Division grew turnover 11.2% while growth on existing 

business was 10.3%. This produced a trading profit that was better than 

turnover growth. The division expects to maintain the present level of 

growth during the second six months of the year. About 90% of members are in 

South Africa and 10% in Namibia. The division has been upgrading its brands 

with the result that an increasing number of its 363 members is now trading 

under the OK banner. 


MediRite, the in-store pharmacy chain that forms part of the Group's 

pharmacy division, traded from 147 outlets in South Africa and 12 beyond the 

country's borders. The number of prescriptions in South Africa increased to 

2.8 million. In South Africa, 22 of its pharmacies serve as distribution 

points for the Department of Health where patients can collect their chronic 

medication. MediRite was recently accredited with Discovery Vitality for its 

member risk management programme. The service, that encompasses testing for 

blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar levels, will be rolled out countrywide 

in the second half of the year. Transpharm, the wholesale arm of the 

division, not only provides MediRite outlets with a reliable source of 

supply, but also serves external customers who represent 66% of its total 

turnover. It grew total turnover by 3.5% in the period under review. 


Although Computicket's income from the sale of tickets for live events 

increased during the reporting period, with some international artists 

secured before the recent major decline of the rand, operating margins in 

this area of the business remained under pressure. Computicket Travel, 

launched just over a year ago, showed good growth with ticket sales for 

local and international flights increasing by 22.3%. During the six months 

to December, it handled ticket sales for 27 international airlines. 


GROUP PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK

With the World Bank predicting economic growth of less than 1% for South 

Africa in 2016, the second half of the financial year will see challenging 

trading conditions persist in the local market. The run-up to the local 

municipal elections could also prove disruptive. However, the greater 

geographic diversification of its operations places the Group in a better 

position than its main competitors. In addition, our continuing investment

     amount of R4.7 billion 

     (Dec '14: R4.7 billion; 

     Jun '15: R4.7 billion). The bonds 

     mature on 3 April 2017 at their 

     nominal value of R4.7 billion 

     (Dec '14: R4.7 billion; 

     Jun '15: R4.7 billion) or can be 

     converted into shares at the 

     holders' option at the maturity 

     date at the rate of 5 919.26 

     shares per R1 million. The Group 

     holds, subject to conditions, 

     rights on early redemption. The 

     values of the liability component 

     and the equity conversion component 

     were determined at issuance of the bonds.



     The fair value of the liability component 

     was calculated using a market interest 

     rate for an equivalent non-convertible 

     bond at initial recognition. The residual 

     amount, representing the value of the 

     equity conversion option, is included 

     in shareholders' equity in other 

     reserves, net of income taxes.



     The convertible bonds recognised 

     in the statement of financial position

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

For the six months to December 2015 the Shoprite Group increased turnover by 8.8%
from R57.5 billion to about R62.5 billion. Growth on a like-for-like basis was 2.8%.

After an improved second quarter driven by good festive season trading, the South
African supermarket operation increased sales by 7.2%. Internal inflation averaged
just 2.7% for the period.

The Group’s non-RSA supermarkets recorded sales growth of 15.2% notwithstanding
the impact of lower commodity prices and the devaluation of certain currencies. Taken
at constant currencies, sales grew by 23.5%.

The Group’s furniture division grew sales by 13.7% for the period, with the OK
Furniture brand the best performer.

The Other Operating Segments achieved growth of 9.3%

The above financial information has not been reviewed or reported on by Shoprite
Holding’s auditors. The financial results for the review period will be published on or
