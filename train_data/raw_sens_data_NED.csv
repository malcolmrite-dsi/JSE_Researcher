CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE

Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) press release
on 24 November 2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group. Moody’s downgraded the long-term local and
foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited from Ba1 to Ba2. The outlook on all the bank’s long-
term deposit ratings and long-term issuer ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody's decision on 20 November 2020 to downgrade the Government of
South Africa’s long-term foreign currency and local currency issuer ratings from Ba1 to Ba2, and
maintain the negative outlook. The South African sovereign ratings act as a ceiling and the rating of
domestic banks cannot be above that of the sovereign.

The Moody’s press release stated: ‘Today’s rating actions on the five South African banks reflect (i) the
deterioration in the creditworthiness of the South African sovereign, as indicated by the downgrade of
the Government of South Africa’s issuer rating to Ba2 from Ba1. The weakening in the sovereign’s credit
profile has direct implications for banks given their significant holding of sovereign securities on their
balance sheets; and (ii) the gradual weakening of the banks’ standalone credit profile as the coronavirus
pandemic exacerbates an already challenging operating environment in South Africa.’

Moody’s further noted that: ‘More positively, the rating agency expects the South African banks to
continue to maintain solid capital buffers, along with sound funding and liquidity. Systemwide gross
loans to deposit ratio was also healthy at 89%.’

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Long-term local currency deposit rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Ba1 to Ba2,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Long-term foreign currency deposit rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Ba1 to Ba2,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Counterparty Risk Rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Baa3/P-3 to Ba1/NP.
    -   Senior Unsecured MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from (P)Ba1 to (P)Ba2.

The Moody’s downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial
impact on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is not expected to have any significant
impact on the group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and
raising most of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between
foreign denominated funding and foreign denominated assets. As noted in our Nedbank Group voluntary
trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2020, released on 29 October 2020, ‘The group
remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and above board approved minimum targets
and well above all regulatory requirements.’

NEDBANK GROUP VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30
SEPTEMBER 2020

In line with the JSE Limited’s letter to issuers regarding effective communication to investors during the
Covid-19 pandemic wherein they highlighted the importance of providing more regular and detailed
communication to the market during uncertain times, the following Nedbank Group voluntary trading
update for the nine months ended 30 September 2020 (9M 2020) is shared with investors.

The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns as well as financial market volatility in late March
2020 were extreme events and the negative impact of these on the group’s client base remains evident
and is expected to continue for some time. The economic environment in the third quarter of 2020 (Q3
2020) improved when compared to the second quarter of 2020 (Q2 2020), as evident in macroeconomic
indicators and high frequency data from our transactional banking channels. Industry turnover data
recorded on our point of sale devices and digital channels in Q3 2020 illustrates an ongoing recovery
as lockdown levels eased, with turnover levels in September 2020 at 98% of March 2020 levels and an
increase of 3% compared to the month of September in 2019. This compared to the April 2020 low at
47% of March 2020 levels (46% down on the month of April 2019).

In the group’s interim results announcement, released on 26 August 2020, we noted that our focus at
this time is primarily on the health and safety of our staff and clients and serving and supporting clients
in good standing in managing their finances through this difficult period. While it is still too early to draw
final conclusions given the risk of a second round of infections, Covid-19 infection rates in staff peaked
in mid-July and are trending downwards. In support of our clients in this difficult economic environment,
in the period up to 30 September 2020, we have approved and concluded more than 400 thousand loan
restructures qualifying under SARB Directive 3/2020 (D3) amounting to more than R121bn and paid out
R1,1bn under the SA Government’s SME Loan Guarantee scheme and in so doing have helped our
clients to better manage their cashflows through the crisis. Our IT systems remain stable and the
Managed Evolution technology strategy on track despite the lockdown. The launch of market-leading
digital solutions has resulted in an increase in digital usage and a 9% yoy increase in digitally active
clients to over 1,9m.

Financial performance
The financial performance of the group improved in Q3 2020 when compared to Q2 2020, primarily
driven by lower impairments in the quarter as the extent of forward looking IFRS 9 macro-model
adjustments and judgmental overlays booked in Q2 2020 did not repeat.

Average interest earning banking assets growth slowed to around mid-single digits, down from the 8,2%
reported in H1 2020. In RBB, gross loans and advances growth increased to around 3%, up from the
1% reported in H1 2020. Retail loan application volumes have recorded a full recovery to above pre-
lockdown levels across all major products, in part driven by pent up demand given the impact of
lockdown on home loans and vehicle finance, and in part by the 300 bps lower interest rates. The higher
growth in RBB was achieved notwithstanding loan approval rates that are lower than pre-crisis levels.
In CIB, gross banking loan and advances growth slowed from the 10% growth reported in H1 2020
primarily as a number of clients that accessed committed liquidity facilities at the height of the crisis
repaid their loans, and as we continued to optimise the portfolio.

Deposit growth remained robust and well ahead of growth in loans and advances.

Net interest income (NII) growth for 9M 2020 decreased from the 1% growth reported for the six months
to 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) as overall loan growth slowed and the group’s net interest margin (NIM)
contracted slightly to just below the 330 bps reported in H1 2020. The decline in NII in Q3 2020 was
less than we expected but is in line with our full year 2020 guidance range of between 0% and -5%.
While lower endowment income continued to put pressure on NIM due to the run rate impact of the 300
bps interest rate cuts to date, asset pricing improved, particularly in the secured lending (home loans,
vehicle finance and commercial property) and corporate lending portfolios.

Impairment growth for 9M 2020 remained elevated but was lower than the 202% reported in H1 2020,
supporting a credit loss ratio (CLR) that decreased from 194 bps in H1 2020 to within our 2020 full year
guidance range of between 150 bps to 185 bps. The reduction was supported by lower CLRs across
CIB, RBB and Nedbank Africa Regions, while Nedbank Wealth’s CLR remained flat on June 2020.

-   In CIB, impairments for Q3 2020 decreased compared to Q2 2020 as the R1bn forward looking
    IFRS 9 macro-economic overlay in Q2 2020 did not repeat. More clients migrated to Stage 3 loans
    and appropriate impairments were raised, and D3 loans increased to R32bn, slightly up from the
    R30,5bn reported in H1 2020. An update to the group’s macro-economic forecasts resulting in a
    larger GDP growth decline for 2020 (-9,2%) compared to the (-7,0%) forecast in June 2020, has not
    had a material impact on CIB’s impairments as the lower levels of exposure at default (EAD) had
    an offsetting impact. The commercial property portfolio continues to perform well and the underlying
    rental collections by listed clients continued to improve (94% in August 2020, up from 88% in July
    2020 and the low of 67% in April 2020).
-   In RBB, impairments for Q3 2020 reduced compared to Q2 2020. Impairments in Q3 2020 reflect
    the impact of D3 loans migrating to Stage 2 due to payment holiday renewals, as well as an increase
    in Stage 3 loans. 90% of the R79bn D3 loans extended in RBB have matured (lapsed) with 66%
    having resumed their monthly payment, 5% were one or more payments in arrears and 19% have
    been extended/renewed. 10% of D3 loans have not yet matured. Of the 71% of loans that matured
    and were not renewed, 93% are paying their instalments. As at 30 September 2020 R23bn (6% of
    RBB loans and advance) were classified as D3 loans, a reduction from R78bn (21,5% of RBB loans
    and advances) at 30 June 2020. Non-D3 loan repayments continue to perform ahead of our
    expectations given the positive impact of the 300 bps reduction in interest rates ytd.
-   The group’s total coverage ratio increased from the 2,95% reported at H1 2020 to 3,2%, driven by
    an increase in Stage 2 coverage from 4,7% in H1 2020 to 6,0% as a result of additional D3
    extension-related overlays in RBB and a reduction in Stage 2 CIB clients with low coverage that
    repaid and/or cured, and therefore moved to Stage 1.
-   While impairment trends are encouraging, risks associated with D3 and D7 restructured loans in
    RBB, as well as watchlist clients in CIB remain elevated and are closely monitored. A D3 loan is a
    restructured loan categorised under SARB Directive 3 of 2020 providing payment relief to qualifying
    borrowers that are temporarily affected by Covid-19 and were up to date with their payments at 29
    February 2020. A D7 loan is a distressed restructure categorised under SARB Directive 7 of 2015,
    classified as defaulted (Stage 3) and has to be kept in default for at least six months until the new
    loan agreement can be considered cured.

Non-interest revenue growth for 9M 2020 decreased when compared to the decline of 5% reported in
H1 2020, in line with our expectations and our full year 2020 guidance range of between -7% to -11%.

-   Commission and fees reduced by less than the 9% decline reported in H1 2020 as the easing of
    lockdown restrictions to level one and two has been beneficial. Client transactional activity across
    our branches, as well as on our digital channels, ATMs and POS devices increased when compared
    to April, May and June 2020, but remained below March 2020 levels. Digital penetration increased
    further to 26% (H1 2020: 25% digitally active clients as a percentage of total clients). Retail main-
    banked clients increased 4,5% from the 2,65m reported in H1 2020 as transactional activity levels
    improved, while CIB recorded 25 primary-banked client wins ytd (H1 2020: 22).
-   Insurance income continued to decline given higher levels of credit life claims which we expect to
    peak in H2 2020.
-   Trading income growth remains strong but has slowed, as expected, with declining levels of volatility
    and volumes.
-   Private equity income recorded an improvement from the R765m loss reported at interims as market
    valuations stabilised in Q3 2020, but downward pressures on underlying investee companies are
    still evident.
-   A portion of the fair value gains reported in H1 2020 continued to unwind in line with our
    expectations.

Expenses continued to be well managed in response to the more challenging environment through lower
variable costs and diligent cost management and the decline in expenses for 9M 2020 was in line with
our full year 2020 guidance range of between -1% and -4%, and lower than the 1% decline reported in
H1 2020.

Associate income of R222m, relating to Nedbank Group’s 21% shareholding in ETI for 9M 2020 (9M
2019: R561m), has been recognised. This includes accounting for associate income from our share of
ETI’s Q4 2019 and H1 2020 attributable profits (a quarter in arrear) of R458m, as well as our share of
the ETI’s 2019 restatement of R236m which was reflected in our half year results.

As a result of the group’s improved financial performance in Q3 2020, the ROE for 9M 2020 increased
when compared to the 4,8% reported in H1 2020. NAV per share increased 4%, up from the 2% increase
reported at H1 2020.

Outlook
SA Q2 GDP of -51% annualised q-o-q (-17,1% yoy), was slightly worse than expected, given a greater
deterioration of economic activity during lockdown. Over the first half of 2020, the economy contracted
8,7% yoy. As a result, our Nedbank Group Economic Unit’s SA GDP forecast for 2020 has been revised
down from -7,0% to -9,2% while our 2021 forecast increased slightly to 2,5% (from our previous 2,2%
forecast). The SA Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan announced by President Ramaphosa,
contains many practical initiatives which together should improve the underlying investment
environment and unlock greater job creation and faster economic growth. Much now depends on how
quickly the specific measures proposed in the plan can be implemented.

The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) delivered by the Minister of Finance on 28
October 2020 had no surprises and few new insights. SA’s debt trajectory is, however, substantially
worse than reflected in the Supplementary Budget. The MTBPS reiterates the need to make difficult
choices to stabilise debt, stressing that failing to do so could lead to a fiscal crisis. The fiscal policy path
presented will be a further drag on SA’s recovery, with higher taxes and spending constraints likely to
weigh on incomes, earnings and growth.

The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies are material and continuously evolving. As a
result, the impact on the banking industry and Nedbank Group’s results in 2020 remains uncertain. As
noted in our H1 2020 disclosures, full-year HEPS and EPS are expected to decline by more than 20%
when compared to the 12-month period ended 31 December 2019 (HEPS: 2 605 cents, EPS: 2 500
cents). As at 30 September 2020 this guidance remains unchanged. A further trading statement will be
issued in Q1 2021 to provide more specific guidance ranges once there is reasonable certainty regarding
the extent of the decline and the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges.

The group’s pre-close call is scheduled for the first week of December 2020 and further details will be
provided in due course.

Nedbank Group Chief Executive, Mike Brown, noted: ‘While these are very challenging times, we are
well prepared to respond to and manage the risks that have emerged. We have strong, capable and
experienced management teams in place to navigate our way through these headwinds and emerge
stronger and more competitive on the other side. The past eight months have been a difficult period and
we thank our dedicated staff for continuing to support and deliver to our clients, communities and all our
stakeholders. The group remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and above board-
approved minimum targets and well above all regulatory requirements. Our current guidance for all the
key 2020 performance metrics, as outlined in our 2020 interim results announcement on 26 August
2020, remains intact. The group’s Basel III disclosures as at 30 September 2020 will be released in
November 2020.’

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this voluntary trading update has
not been reviewed or reported on by the Nedbank Group´s auditors.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX
MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT

In a period of unprecedented health, economic and social challenges that
have impacted our staff and our clients, Nedbank Group remained profitable
and open for business, with capital and liquidity ratios within board-
approved targets and well above all prudential requirements.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on individuals, families,
businesses, societies and countries in what is becoming known as the Great
Lockdown Crisis (GLC). Unfortunately, as a result of consistently weak
economic growth and an unsustainable fiscal position, the SA economy
entered this crisis in a more challenging position than it did entering the
Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The impact of the pandemic and the GLC has
resulted in a revision of our 2020 SA GDP growth forecast to a contraction
of 7,0%, with the second quarter expected to be most impacted and the Q2
GDP in SA forecast expected to decrease by more than 40%. By contrast, SA
banks are in a more resilient position than they were during the GFC, with
loan growth going into the GLC being more prudent, impairment coverage
ratios being higher, funding tenor being longer and capital levels being
stronger than they were during the GFC.

At Nedbank our primary focus since the crisis started has been on
resilience: ensuring the health and safety of our staff and clients;
invoking business continuity plans; ensuring IT systems stability;
supporting our clients in managing their finances through this very
difficult period; and managing liquidity, credit risk, capital and
discretionary costs closely. We have provided payment relief to our
qualifying clients in good standing on R119bn of loans under PA D3/2020,
reduced various fees, and launched digital innovations to assist our
clients during the lockdown, including the Avo app and Tap on Phone
payments functionality. Throughout the crisis we have maintained a strong
balance sheet, evident in a tier 1 capital ratio of 11,7% and CET1 ratio
of 10,6% at 30 June 2020, as well as a strong liquidity profile. Both
ratios are above board-approved minimum targets and well above all
regulatory requirements. The Covid-19 health crisis morphed quickly into an
economic crisis and is currently escalating to become a social crisis due
to, among other things, increases in already unacceptable levels of
unemployment. As Nedbank, we are committed to making a difference in this
difficult environment and deliver on our purpose to use our financial
expertise to do good for our clients and society.

Nedbank Group’s HE in the six months to 30 June 2020 declined by 69% to
R2,1bn, impacted by a significant increase in the impairment charge,
including a provision build from forward-looking IFRS-9 macro-model
adjustments and judgemental overlays for anticipated Covid-19-related
impacts and expected job losses, in total amounting to R2,9bn. In addition,
H1 was impacted by the effect of lower interest rates on endowment income
(NII) and a decrease in NIR as a result of lower client transactional
activity in Q2 2020 and negative revaluations to unrealised private-equity
investments driven by lower listed market prices and increases in
cost of equity. Expenses were well managed and declined on the prior
period.

Forecasting in the current environment is complex and estimates are subject
to a much higher level of forecast risk than usual, but we are hopeful that
the worst impacts of Covid-19 and the GLC are behind us and that
impairments in the second half will be lower than in the first half and
client activity will continue to increase off a low base. Our focus in the
second half of 2020 will remain on resilience as we reintegrate business
functions in a phased manner, including delivering market-leading client
experiences and innovative digital solutions, supporting our clients, and
optimising on costs, while managing credit risks and maintaining resilient
capital and liquidity ratios and remaining on high alert for subsequent
waves of infection.

We thank our 29 000 dedicated staffmembers who have been observing the
Covid-19 health protocols and supporting our clients and the economy during
this difficult period. We also extend our deepest condolences to the
families and friends of the five Nedbank staffmembers who have passed away
as a result of Covid-19 and related illnesses.

NEDBANK GROUP AND NEDBANK: CHANGES TO CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

Shareholders are advised that Raisibe Morathi has resigned as the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO) and executive director on the Nedbank Group and Nedbank Boards with effect from
30 September 2020. She will remain employed by Nedbank until the end of October to
ensure an orderly handover. Raisibe has been CFO since September 2009 and is a highly
regarded professional, internally and externally. The Boards accept her resignation with
regret, but wish her every success in her future career aspirations.

In accordance with Nedbank Group’s executive succession plan and after a process overseen
by a panel of non-executive directors, Mike Davis, currently Group Executive: Balance Sheet
Management (BSM) and an existing member of Group Exco has been appointed as CFO-
designate with immediate effect, and as the Group’s Chief Financial Officer and to the Group’s
Boards on 1 October 2020.

Mike Davis (BCom(Hons), DipAcc, CA(SA), AMP) was appointed as Group Executive of BSM
and to the Group Executive Committee on 1 January 2015. He has significant industrywide
experience in finance, asset and liability management and capital management, having worked
in financial services for over 20 years. Mike is the current deputy-chairperson of the Nedbank
CFO Forum and has strong relationships within Nedbank and with shareholders and the
broader investment community and has consistently been part of the group’s results
roadshows and investor engagements.

Mike Brown, Chief Executive, said ‘It has been a privilege to work alongside Raisibe and whilst
we are disappointed that she has decided to pursue new opportunities outside of the Group,
we thank her for her valued contribution to Nedbank over the past decade. We will miss her
and wish her well in her future. I am thankful that in the current environment we were able to
make an immediate appointment into this important position and am confident Mike Davis will
seamlessly step into the role.’

Raisibe Morathi, outgoing CFO, said ‘I wish to thank the Board of Nedbank for the opportunity
afforded to me over the last several years, the experience gained is truly invaluable. It is in that
context that this is a moment of mixed emotions, sad to leave all my friends and colleagues at
Nedbank whilst also looking forward to opening a new chapter in my career. I remain a true
Nedbank loyalist whose connection as a client of 26 years will continue well beyond this period
and I congratulate Mike Davis and wish him well in the role, with full confidence that he will do
well.”

Nedbank Group Chairman, Vassi Naidoo, thanked Raisibe for her years of excellent service
to Nedbank as CFO and a member of Group Exco and the Nedbank Boards, and wished her
well in her future career aspirations.

UPDATED NEDBANK GROUP TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30
JUNE 2020 AND NOTIFICATION THAT NO INTERIM ORDINARY DIVIDEND WILL BE DECLARED

As advised in the SENS announcement released ahead of our AGM on 22 May 2020, the Nedbank
Group’s performance in the first quarter to 31 March 2020 already reflected the impact of a difficult
macroeconomic environment in SA and in our African operations. The Covid-19 pandemic and
subsequent lockdowns, as well as financial market volatility in late March 2020 were extreme events
and the negative impacts of these on the group’s client base became more evident in April 2020 and
was expected to continue.

In the same SENS announcement of 22 May 2020 we noted that year on year advances growth was
high single digits, supported by wholesale clients drawing on available facilities and with retail lending
slowing as demand for new retail loans stalled during the lockdown. The group’s net interest margin had
decreased from the 2019 level as a result of the endowment impact from lower interest rates and
impairments rose steeply in April 2020 primarily as a result of the negative impact of forward-looking
IFRS 9 macro-model adjustments. Client transactional activity had slowed as the lockdown commenced
and trading income had grown strongly, benefitting from increased market volatility.

We highlighted at our AGM in May 2020 that our focus at this time was primarily on the health and safety
of our staff and clients and serving and supporting clients in good standing in managing their finances
through this difficult period. While it is still too early to draw final conclusions, Covid-19 infection rates in
staff appear to have peaked in July and are trending downwards. Unfortunately five staffmembers have
passed away from Covid-19 and related illnesses and we extend our deepest condolences to their
families and friends. In support of our clients and as a result of the economy, in the period up to 30 June
2020, we have approved and concluded loan restructures qualifying under SARB Directive 3/2020 for
over 375 000 eligible clients amounting to R119bn and in so doing have helped our clients to better
manage their cashflows through the crisis.

The largest impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the group’s financial performance in the six months to
30 June 2020 has been a significant increase in the impairment or expected credit loss charge, including
forward-looking IFRS 9 macro-model adjustments and judgmental overlays for anticipated Covid-19
related impacts and estimates of future job losses, as well as increases in impairments on Stage 3
advances. The combined macro-model adjustments and judgmental overlays amounted to R2,9bn for
the period (across stages 1, 2 and 3), with the annualised credit loss ratio to June 2020 increasing to
just over 1,9%. Given the annualisation impact of the IFRS 9 forward-looking macro-model adjustments
and judgemental overlays, the full year credit loss ratio to December 2020 is currently expected to be
lower than June 2020, but above the levels of the global financial crisis (1,52%). NII to 30 June 2020
grew in low single digits and was impacted by lower endowment income as a result of interest rates cuts
and a slowdown in advances growth since Q1. NIR had showed positive growth in Q1 2020, but by the
end of Q2 2020 NIR in H1 2020 had decreased by mid-single digits when compared to H1 2019, largely
as a result of lower client transactional activity in lockdown and negative revaluations to unrealised
private equity investments driven by lower listed market prices and increases in the cost of equity. These
impacts were partially offset by very strong trading income growth given increased market volatility. With
the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, client transactional activity in May and June improved from
the lows in April, but remained below March levels. Expenses were tightly controlled with overall
expenses slightly lower than H1 2019.

Our primary focus since the crisis started has been on resilience: ensuring the health and safety of our
staff and clients, invoking business continuity plans, ensuring IT systems stability, supporting our clients
in managing their finances through this difficult period and closely managing liquidity, credit risk, capital
and discretionary costs.

As at 30 June 2020, the group’s balance sheet remained strong with capital and liquidity ratios above
board-approved minimum targets and well above all regulatory requirements. Notwithstanding this, in
line with SARB Guidance Note 4/2020, the board deemed it appropriate not to declare an interim
ordinary dividend (Nedbank Group) for the period ended 30 June 2020. The Nedbank Limited preference
share dividend is still expected to be declared as preference shares are not impacted by this guidance
note.

Trading statement update

released on 22 May 2020 where shareholders were advised that headline earnings per share (HEPS)
and earnings per share (EPS) for the six month period ending 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) were expected
to be more than 20% lower than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS:
1 435 cents, H1 2019 EPS: 1 419 cents), the board now has reasonable certainty regarding the extent
of the decline and therefore the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges are as follows:

-   HEPS for H1 2020 is expected to be between 67% and 72% lower than the comparative period,
    resulting in a range of between 474 cents and 402 cents per share.
-   EPS for H1 2020 is expected to be between 79% and 84% lower than the comparative period,
    resulting in a range of between 298 cents and 227 cents per share.

The difference between the HEPS and EPS ranges is primarily attributed to an additional R750m
impairment the group has raised against the carrying value of its investment in Ecobank Transnational
Incorporated to reflect the more difficult trading environment expected in the period ahead, particularly
in Nigeria. While various scenarios supported a value-in-use calculation above the carrying value of our
investment, in the current environment giving more weight to downside scenarios resulted in the
additional impairment.

H1 2020 results announcement
Nedbank Group’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 will be released on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service on 26 August 2020 and will also be available on the group’s website:
nedbankgroup.co.za.

While these are very challenging times, Nedbank Group is well prepared to respond to and manage the
risks that have emerged. We have strong, capable and experienced management teams in place to
navigate our way through these headwinds and emerge stronger and more competitive on the other
side. The group remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and in full compliance with
all prudential regulatory requirements.

We thank our 29 000 dedicated staffmembers who have been observing the Covid-19 health protocols
and supporting our clients and the economy during this difficult period.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading statement has not been
reviewed or reported on by Nedbank Group´s auditors.

NEDBANK GROUP VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR Q1 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT
FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2020

Trading update

On 29 April 2020 Nedbank Group hosted a webcast where management updated the investment
community on the progress made in responding to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic. We highlighted that
our primary focus at this time is on the health and safety of our staff and serving and providing support
for clients in managing their finances through this difficult period. We have pivoted our strategy to
increase our focus on resilience so that we can continue to support our clients through these challenges
– this means we have increased our focus on managing liquidity, capital, market and credit risk alongside
ongoing scenario modelling and stress testing, and an increased focus on costs.

As noted in the Nedbank Group SENS announcement on 14 April 2020, given the uncertain
environment, we have withdrawn our 2020 financial guidance and at the same time noted that our
medium and long-term targets are under review. Our 2020 financial guidance was based on our
economic forecasts completed in January 2020 and at that stage we expected SA GDP growth for 2020
to be 0.7% and interest rates to be flat over the year. Economic forecasts today are materially different
from January 2020. While forecasting in the current environment is complex and subject to a much
higher degree of forecast risk than usual, in April 2020 the Nedbank Economic Unit revised their forecast
of SA GDP growth for 2020 to -7,0%. After the cumulative 225 bps of interest rate cuts up to April 2020,
the SARB MPC cut interest rates by a further 50 bps in May 2020.

The Nedbank Group’s performance in the first quarter to 31 March 2020 (‘the Period’) reflects the impact
of a difficult macroeconomic environment in SA and in our African operations. While the initial impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown emerged in March and financial market volatility in
late March was extreme, impacts on our client base became more evident in April 2020 and are expected
to continue.

Loan and advances growth in the Period for Nedbank Group was high single digits (year on year). In
CIB growth was just above double digits driven primarily by wholesale term loans and commercial
property finance as we supported clients in good standing to draw down on existing credit facilities as
they prepared for the uncertainty ahead and foreign currency loans increased as a result of Rand
depreciation. In April, similar trends continued.

In RBB, loans and advances growth in the Period was just above mid-single digits (year on year) driven
by growth in personal loans and vehicle finance. During April 2020, retail lending growth slowed
significantly as demand for new home loans and vehicle finance stalled and card balances reduced,
affected by the lockdown and consequential restrictions. Overdrafts increased as we supported our
SMEs and Business Banking clients.

Deposits in the Period continued to grow ahead of loans and advances. In this environment bank funding
profiles shortened across the industry as term-maturity deposits rolled down with depositors having a
lower propensity to term out new deposits into future maturity dates. Towards the end April 2020
depositors’ appetite for tenure improved as market confidence returned, resulting in a lengthening of
bank funding profiles.

Net interest income for the Period increased by mid-single digits when compared to Q1 2019,
underpinned by the strong advances growth. The group’s net interest margin (NIM) decreased from the
2019 level of 3,52%, primarily as a result of the endowment impact from lower interest rates. The
negative impact of lower interest rates on NIM continued into April 2020.

Impairments increased and the group’s credit loss ratio for the Period was in the top half of the through-
the-cycle target range of 60-100 bps. In April 2020, impairments rose steeply driven primarily by the
negative impact of the forward looking IFRS 9 macro-factor models on portfolio impairments based on
our current best estimates of the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. We will continue to review and
refine these macro-factor models over time and related portfolio impairment estimates. Stage 3
impairments increased across the group.

SARB Directive 3/2020 applies to the restructuring of loans that were in good standing at 29 February
2020 to enable these clients to better manage cashflows through the lockdown. As at the end of April
2020 we had proactively approved and concluded restructures for eligible clients amounting to
approximately R81bn (CIB: R34,0bn, RBB: R42,0bn and Nedbank Wealth: R4,6bn). To date Nedbank
has assisted more than 225 000 clients (out of a total credit active client base of approximately 2,5m)
with debt relief across our product range, including home loans, vehicle and asset finance, personal
loans, loans to SMEs and credit cards.

Non-interest revenue growth in the Period was in low single digits as flat commission and fee growth
was offset by solid trading income growth across all asset classes, as well as fair value increases in the
centre due to the large unexpected interest rate cuts. From the end of March 2020 and into April, client
transactional activity slowed materially as the lockdown commenced and this was particularly evident in
lower consumer activity and spend across sectors most impacted by the lockdown such as tourism and
travel, hospitality and transport. Generally lower levels of spending and related cash transactions also
negatively impacted NIR. Trading income in April grew strongly benefiting from increased market
volatility.

Expenses continued to be well managed in response to the more challenging environment. The group’s
ongoing digital transformation has proven beneficial during the lockdown and we continue to invest in
our Managed Evolution technology programmes. The group’s cost-to-income ratio (excluding associate
income) improved year on year as expenses grew more slowly than revenues and the JAWS ratio
(revenue growth less expense growth), excluding associate income, was positive in the Period as well
as year to date April 2020 (both including and excluding associate income).


An associate loss of R108m, relating to the Nedbank Group’s 21% shareholding in ETI for the period
ended 31 March 2020, has been recognised. This includes accounting for ETI’s Q4 2019 associate
income (a quarter in arrear), as well as Nedbank’s share of the $79,5m restatement of ETI’s 2018 income
statement for interest accruals on oil market exposures that had to be reversed in terms of Central Bank
of Nigeria regulations as disclosed by ETI in their 2019 results announcement on 24 March 2020. The
impact of the restatement was a R236m reduction in Nedbank’s associate income in Q1 2020. Excluding
accounting for this ETI restatement, Q1 2020 associate income relating to ETI was R128m (Q1 2019:
R191m).

Following regulatory approvals, the sale of Nedbank Malawi and the transaction to increase our
shareholding in Banco Ùnico were both completed in Q1 2020 as planned.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS) for
the six month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower than the reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS: 1 435 cents, H1 2019 EPS: 1 419 cents). A
further trading statement will be issued in order to provide specific guidance once there is reasonable
certainty regarding the extent of the decline and the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges. Nedbank Group’s
results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 are currently expected to be released on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service during the month of August 2020. The specific date is being finalised and will
be communicated to shareholders in due course.

The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and lower oil prices on economies are material and evolving. As
a result, the impact on the banking industry and Nedbank Group’s results in 2020 remains uncertain.
We will update investors on our revised 2020 financial guidance and medium to long-term prospects
once we have more clarity.

While these are very challenging times, Nedbank Group is well prepared to respond to and manage the
risks that are emerging. We have strong and experienced management teams in place to navigate our
way through these challenging times and emerge stronger and more competitive on the other side. The
group continues to be profitable and capital and liquidity metrics remained strong and in full compliance
with all prudential regulatory requirements. At 31 March 2020 Nedbank Group reported a CET1 capital
adequacy ratio of 10,9% after accounting for the 2019 final dividend (Q1 2019: 11,2%), Liquidity
Coverage Ratio of 110% (Q1 2019: 108%) and Net Stable Funding Ratio of 110% (Q1 2019: 106%).

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank Group´s auditors.

VESTING OF SHARES TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED OFFICERS: 2017 MATCHED SHARE SCHEME

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors and prescribed officers of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2017 voluntary bonus share
scheme (VBSS). This is not classified as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

In terms of the VBSS, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax bonus (less any amount already deferred under
Nedbank Group’s compulsory bonus deferral scheme) could be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would
then be committed into the Matched Share Scheme for a period of three years. Alternatively, the employee could
commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus
less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these
shares at any time prior to the end of the deferral period, which would cancel their participation in the scheme in
respect of those shares and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares owned by them committed into the VBSS but no rights to
dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the requisite Matched Shares are
delivered to the Participant at the end of the three year period.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person continued in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date would be matched
on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2017 to 2019 was met.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY STANDARD AND POOR’S
Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) press release on 7 May
2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank Limited, the 100%-
owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group.


S&P downgraded the long-term issuer foreign-currency credit rating on Nedbank Limited to BB- from
BB and affirmed the B short-term rating. The outlook is stable. S&P affirmed the zaAA long-term and
zaA-1+ short-term South Africa national scale rating of Nedbank Limited.


In line with historic trends, the downgrade on the South African banks was expected and follows S&P's
decision on 29 April 2020 to downgrade its long-term foreign-currency sovereign credit rating on the
Republic of South Africa to BB- from BB and affirm the B short-term foreign-currency sovereign credit
rating. The outlook is stable. S&P noted that: ‘We do not rate financial institutions in South Africa above
the foreign currency sovereign ratings, given the direct and indirect impact that sovereign distress would
have on domestic banks' operations. As a result, we are taking various rating actions on South Africa-
based institutions.’ S&P further noted that: ‘Positively, the South African Reserve Bank’s support
measures will support the stability of the financial and banking sector.’ and that ‘The stable industry risk
trend reflects early adoption of global best practices, effective and proactive regulation and supervision,
and good capitalization’.


The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Lowered the long-term issuer foreign-currency rating to ‘BB-‘ from ‘BB’ and noted the outlook
        as stable
    -   Affirmed the ‘B’ for the short-term foreign-currency rating
    -   Affirmed the ‘zaAA’ long-term national scale rating
    -   Affirmed the 'zaA-1+' short-term national scale rating


The S&P downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial impact
on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital ratios
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is expected to have a small impact on the
group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and raising most
of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between foreign
denominated funding and foreign denominated assets.

NO CHANGE STATEMENT

The Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited annual financial statements contain no changes to

Shareholders are advised that these documents were approved by the board of Nedbank
Group on 2 March 2020 and thus contain disclosures and statements based on the economic
conditions that existed at 2 March 2020 as required by International Financial Reporting
Standards. However, material changes in market conditions have since occurred as a result
of the Covid-19 pandemic that emerged in SA during March 2020 and the sovereign
downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch. Shareholders should refer to the information contained in
our Integrated Report to obtain initial insights into our current understanding of the impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic on Nedbank Group.

WITHDRAWAL OF NEDBANK GROUP 2020 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE

In recent weeks a combination of the rapid escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Moody’s and
Fitch downgrades of the SA sovereign credit ratings have combined to place unprecedented challenges
on the South African economy.

Given the developments stated above, there has been a material change in market conditions and the
economic outlook in the countries where we operate. It is difficult to accurately predict the progression
and duration of the Covid-19 pandemic globally and in South Africa, our predominant market, as well as
the residual risks when the lockdowns are lifted. As a result, it is not possible, at this stage, to accurately
predict the economic outcomes of the virus and the impact these will have on the banking outlook.

As part of our 2019 annual results announcement on 3 March 2020, Nedbank Group provided financial
guidance for 2020 and a series of medium to long-term targets. This financial guidance and related
medium to long-term targets were highlighted as being based on our macroeconomic forecasts
formulated in January 2020 and subsequently disclosed in our 2019 annual results announcement.
Given the rapid escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the material changes to the economic outlook
since 3 March 2020, these macroeconomic forecasts are no longer valid. As a result, shareholders are
herewith advised that Nedbank Group’s 2020 financial guidance as provided in our annual results
announcement on 3 March 2020, has been withdrawn and our medium and long-term targets are under
review.

This withdrawal of guidance for 2020 is in line with similar announcements made recently by many
companies on the JSE. We will continue to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and will provide
appropriate disclosures and updates when sufficient clarity and certainty exists.

The Nedbank Group board and management support the lockdown actions taken by governments in
the markets where we have operations. As determined by the respective governments, Nedbank’s
banking and financial services have remained open during the lockdowns to ensure clients can continue
to receive essential services. Our primary focus is to keep our staff safe and to support our clients in
managing their finances through this difficult period, while maintaining our responsibilities to all our
stakeholders.

In March we established a Group Executive Steering Committee to oversee all our Covid-19 related
actions and risk management processes. This committee reports to the Nedbank Group Board and is
supported by a Covid-19 Pandemic Steering Committee, focusing on operational matters including the
safety of our staff and managing business continuity plans; a Liquidity Steering Committee focusing on
maintaining our strong liquidity profile; and a Credit Steering Committee overseeing the management of
credit risks and the support that is being provided to clients in good standing.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank
Group’s auditors. Shareholders are further advised that this is not a trading statement as per paragraph
3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

UPDATE ON THE NEDBANK GROUP FINAL 2019 DIVIDEND IN CONTEXT OF THE SARB
GUIDANCE NOTE G4/2020

Nedbank Group notes the SARB’s guidance note G4/2020: “Recommendations on the distribution of
dividends on ordinary shares and payment of cash bonuses to executive officers and material risk
takers, in light of the negative economic impact of the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic and
the temporary regulatory capital relief provided by the Prudential Authority” and we are supportive of the
guidance. We also refer shareholders to the explanations provided by the Deputy Governor of the SA
Reserve Bank in this regard during a teleconference he hosted with analysts and investors at 9:30 am
on Tuesday, 7 April 2020.

Our current assessment of the guidance note and related explanations is that it distinguishes between
those dividends that are already declared and as a result the relevant legal requirements that the
guidance note refers to (ie S46 of the Companies Act) are therefore applicable; and those future
declarations and related distributions that are expected not to take place while the Covid-19 pandemic
uncertainty continues.

As a result of this assessment, Nedbank Group currently expects that the 2019 final dividend of 695
cents per ordinary share will be paid on Monday, 20 April 2020, in accordance with the declaration
announcement made on 3 March 2020. Future dividend declarations and related distributions will be
impacted for so long as the guidance note is applicable. Management and the Board are consulting their
advisors and monitoring evolving developments in this regard and will make further announcements as
necessary.

Nedbank Group remains well capitalised with a strong liquidity profile.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank
Group’s auditors.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, PRESCRIBED OFFICERS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2020 COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEMES

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following information is
disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors, prescribed officers and the company secretary of Nedbank
Group and Nedbank Limited.

The following shares have been committed by the executive directors, prescribed officers and the company secretary
to the 2020 Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)     in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme, deferred bonus amounts are invested in the Matched Share
        Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee resign and not be classified as a good
        leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank
        Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results come to light during the deferral
        period. In these instances, the employee also forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount
        subject to forfeiture;

(b)     in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax bonus (less any
        amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme set out above) can be used to acquire
        shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into the Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the
        employee can commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s
        total after-tax bonus less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme. The
        employee can dispose of these shares at any time prior to the vesting date, which will cancel their
        participation in the scheme in respect of those shares, and will render them ineligible to qualify for any
        matching of shares.

The date of the transactions (off-market) was 31 March 2020 (the inception date) and the value of the shares was
determined using a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 23 March 2020 and 25 March
2020.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person has remained in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date may be matched on a
one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2020 to 2022 is met.

For executive directors, prescribed officers (and all other members of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee), the
performance condition of the Nedbank matched share scheme was extended to 100%, ie. 100% of the shares held in
the trust on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis only if the predetermined company performance
target for the period 2020 to 2022 is met and if the person has remained in the employ of the company throughout
the vesting period.

VESTING OF SHARES TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED OFFICERS: 2017 COMPULSORY BONUS SHARE
SCHEME (CBSS)

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors and prescribed officers of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2017 CBSS. This is not classified
as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

In terms of the CBSS, compulsory deferred bonus amounts could be invested in the Matched Share Scheme for a
period of three years. The deferred amount would be forfeited should the employee resign before the end of the
deferral period and not be classified as a good leaver, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank
Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral period.
In these instances, the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares owned by them committed into the CBSS but no rights to
dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the requisite Matched Shares are
delivered to the Participant at the end of the three-year period.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person continued in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date would be matched
on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2017 to 2019 was met.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE
Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) press release
on 31 March 2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group.

Moody’s downgraded the long-term local currency and foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank
Limited to ba1 from baa3. The outlook on all the bank’s long-term deposit ratings and long-term issuer
ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody's decision on 27 March 2020 to downgrade the Government of South
Africa’s long-term foreign currency and local currency issuer ratings to Ba1 from Baa3, and retain the
outlook as negative. The South African sovereign ratings act as a ceiling and the rating of banks cannot
be above that of the sovereign.

The Moody’s press release stated: ‘Moody’s downgraded the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of
Nedbank Limited to Ba1 from Baa3 primarily as a result of the increasingly difficult operating conditions,
and our expectation that the bank’s profitability and asset quality metrics will deteriorate over the next
12 months. However, Nedbank's BCA of Ba1 continues to reflect the bank's solid local franchise and
material investments in digitisation and information technology and its resilient capitalisation (a reported
Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11,5%, as of December 2019). Nedbank’s asset quality metrics
deteriorated only marginally over 2019 with NPLs rising to 3,6% as of December-end 2019 from 3,5%
as of December-end 2018.’

Moody’s further noted that: ‘The negative outlook of the South African banks' ratings reflects our
expectation that the weak economic environment will increase the downside risks for bank’s credit
profiles. The challenging operating environment will translate to higher impairments for the banks;
exerting negative pressure on revenues and testing the resilient performance they have demonstrated
in recent years. However, Moody's does not anticipate that the asset quality deterioration will materially
compromise banks’ capitalisation. The negative outlook on the bank is aligned with the outlook on the
sovereign rating, which reflects downside risks around economic growth and fiscal metrics, that could
lead to an even more rapid and sizeable increase in the debt burden, further lowering debt affordability
and potentially weakening South Africa’s access to funding’.

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Long-term local currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Long-term foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Counterparty Risk Rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Baa3/P-3 from Baa2/P-2.
    -   Senior Unsecured MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to (P)Ba1 from (P)Baa3.
    -   Subordinate MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to (P)Ba2 from (P)Ba1.

The Moody’s downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial
impact on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is expected to have a small impact on the
group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and raising most
of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between foreign
denominated funding and foreign denominated assets.

The prescribed officers and the company secretary are now entitled to 52,4% of the restricted shares
allocated with performance-based vesting criteria on 15 March 2017, and 100% of the restricted

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Good strategic and operational progress and solid franchise fundamentals,
but financial performance below expectations

In 2019 SA economic growth was much slower than expected as recessionary-
like conditions prevailed. This was mainly due to severe and frequent power
outages, the unsustainable fiscal trajectory and ongoing policy
uncertainty, combined with a deteriorating global outlook. Under these
difficult domestic conditions, company profits and household finances
deteriorated during the year, resulting in subdued credit demand, lower
transactional volume growth and rising defaults in the SA banking industry.

In this environment Nedbank Group's financial performance was below
expectations as headline earnings declined 7,3% to R12,5bn and the group
produced an ROE (excluding goodwill) of 16,0%. In addition to the
challenging environment, headline earnings were impacted by additional
items in the second half of the year, including hyperinflation in Zimbabwe
(R142m headline earnings impact) and the raising of impairments against
recoverability of recognised intercompany legacy debt (R44m), the exercise
of an option that will increase our shareholding in Banco Unico (R140m)
from 50% plus one share to approximately 87,5% (subject to regulatory
approval), the revaluing of a number of private equity investments as the
underlying investee company performance was weaker and public market
multiples declined (R238m), and the increase in impairments to just above
the midpoint of our target range of 60 bps to 100 bps as a result of
increased impairments raised on certain CIB watchlist items and an increase
in the central impairment. This was partially offset by good cost
management due to the ongoing benefits from optimisation of processes and
operations as part of our digital journey, and as a result our cost-to-
income ratio improved from 57,2% to 56,5%.

We continued to make good strategic and operational progress throughout the
year and produced solid balance sheet growth with advances up 7,2% and
deposits growing 9,5%. A key focus was the operational rollout of our
digital onboarding capability for individuals visiting branches and using
the Money app and online banking, alongside our ability to sell current
accounts and personal loans digitally, as well as pilots for cards,
investment products and overdrafts. In addition, we launched our refreshed
loyalty and rewards programme together with various market-leading digital
innovations. As our clients began to experience the value from our digital
journey and improved service levels, Nedbank ended the year as the only SA
bank to have improved its net promoter score (NPS) and on client
satisfaction metrics became the second highest-rated bank in SA.

SA's economic growth prospects remain subdued, undermined by persistent
energy constraints, weak government finances and slow progress on
structural reforms combined with a weaker outlook for global growth. In
this difficult SA macroeconomic environment, where we currently forecast
GDP growth in 2020 to be only 0,7%, and given our 2019 base, our guidance
for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2020 is to be around
nominal GDP growth. Our medium- to long-term financial targets for ROE
(excluding goodwill) and the cost-to-income ratio in 2020 were communicated
to the market in early 2018, when GDP growth was forecast to be materially
higher than what has transpired and as a result credit growth and interest
rates (endowment impact) were also forecast to be higher than what took
place. To reflect the deterioration in these metrics since 2018 we have
revised the timelines for achievement of these medium- to long-term
financial targets to be more reflective of the current weaker economic
environment, which we expect to persist. For ROE (now including goodwill),
our medium-term target (two to three years) is now greater than 17% and our
long-term target (five or more years) is greater than cost of equity plus
4%. For the cost-to-income ratio we are now targeting less than 53% in the
medium term and less than 50% in the long term as our digital journey
matures and enables ongoing efficiencies.

NEDBANK GROUP EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP APPOINTMENTS

Nedbank Group announces that Brian Kennedy (59), Group Managing Executive:
Nedbank Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB), reaches the mandatory retirement
age of 60 next month and retires on 31 March 2020 after more than 24 years at
Nedbank. Brian led the Capital Markets business in Nedbank following the merger
with BoE in 2003 and in November of that year was appointed to the Group
Executive Committee (Group Exco), with the mandate to develop the investment
banking franchise known as Nedbank Capital. During his tenure, Brian has been
actively involved in the design and execution of innovative solutions for top
corporates and parastatals in SA and across Africa as well as attracting top
investment banking talent to Nedbank. He has been instrumental in developing and
driving strategy, culture and new business initiatives as well as overseeing the
merger of Nedbank Capital with Nedbank Corporate in 2015 to create the client
centric integrated investment banking franchise now known as Nedbank CIB.

Following an extensive internal and external process, we are pleased to announce
that Anél Bosman (53) has been appointed to succeed Brian as the Group Managing
Executive: Nedbank CIB and as a member of Group Exco with effect from 1 April
2020, reporting to the Chief Executive, Mike Brown. Anél obtained her BCom
(Econometrics) (Hons) (Cum Laude) from the University of Johannesburg in 1988
and a M.Phil (Economics) from the University of Cambridge in 1990. Anél has had
an 18 year career at Nedbank CIB and its predecessors and this will facilitate a
seamless transition. She started her career at Nedbank as a trader, heading up the
Multi-disciplinary desk and was then appointed as the Head of Risk for Nedbank
Capital from 2005 to 2010.

After a short period as CFO and Head of Strategy for Nedbank Capital, she was
appointed as the Chief Operating Officer for the cluster in 2011. In 2015, Anél was
appointed as Managing Executive for Nedbank CIB Markets, with responsibility for all
trading activities in Nedbank as well as wholesale funding. Over the last five years,
this business has grown earnings consistently, increased market presence by
investing in talent and technology across various asset classes and has established
a strong market franchise.

Given Nedbank’s ongoing focus on growth opportunities on the African continent, Dr
Terence Sibiya (50), Managing Executive: Nedbank Africa Regions, has been
appointed as a member of Group Exco with effect from 1 April 2020 (subject to
regulatory approval) and will report to Chief Executive, Mike Brown. Prior to starting
his current role in 2018, Terence was the Managing Executive: Client Coverage in
Nedbank CIB. Before joining Nedbank in 2011, Terence was the Executive and
Head of Power, Infrastructure, Construction, Oil, Gas & Renewable Energy in the
Corporate and Investment Banking Division of the Standard Bank Group.

Terence holds a B.Sc (Information and Decision Systems) from Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, USA; Masters and Doctoral degrees in Instructional Systems
Design and Information Technology from the University of Pittsburgh in the USA; as
well as an Advanced Management Programme qualification from Duke University.

Mike Brown, Chief Executive, and the rest of the Group Exco wish to thank Brian for
his valuable contribution to Nedbank Group, and look forward to working with Anél
and Terence.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE DISPOSAL OF NEDBANK MALAWI LIMITED (""NEDBANK MALAWI"")

Nedbank Group refers shareholders to the market announcement by Frankfurt-listed fintech and African
banking group, MyBucks S.A. (""MyBucks"").

Nedbank Group and Nedgroup Investments Africa (together, ""Nedbank"") have agreed to dispose of, and
MyBucks Banking Corporation Limited (""MyBucks Malawi"") has agreed to acquire, in one composite,
indivisible transaction, 100% of the issued shares of Nedbank Malawi and the cession and delegation of a
term loan from Nedbank Limited to Nedbank Malawi (the ""Disposal""). MyBucks Malawi is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of MyBucks.

The Disposal is subject to suspensive conditions that are standard for a transaction of this nature. The
Disposal has been approved by the Reserve Bank of Malawi and is still subject to the approval from the
relevant competition authority, being the Common Market of East and Southern Africa.

The Disposal follows a strategic review by Nedbank Group. As at 30 June 2019, Nedbank Malawi contributed
less than 0,1% to Nedbank Group's headline earnings and total assets and its market share in Malawi was
approximately 1%.

Nedbank Group remains committed to grow its operations in SADC, explore opportunities in East Africa, and
strengthen its strategic alliance with Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (underpinned by a 21%
shareholding) in Central and West Africa.

About Nedbank Malawi
Nedbank Malawi currently has 11 branches in various cities in Malawi with just short of 42,000 customers,
which it services through three divisions: Retail, Small and Medium Enterprises and Wholesale / Treasury.

About MyBucks
MyBucks S.A. is a company domiciled in Luxembourg that delivers financial services through technology.
MyBucks operates in six African countries through its brands GetBucks, GetSure, MBC, and Opportunity
Bank. The Group offers credit, banking solutions and insurance products to customers.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY STANDARD AND POOR'S

Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) press release on 26
November 2019 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group. S&P has affirmed the  BB/B' long- and short-
term global scale ratings of Nedbank Limited and changed its outlook from stable to negative. At the
same time, S&P lowered their long-term national scale ratings on Nedbank Limited, and affirmed their
'zaA-1+' short-term national scale ratings on the entity.

This rating action follows S&P's decision on 22 November 2019 to revise its outlook on South Africa
from stable to negative. S&P noted that:  We do not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the
foreign currency sovereign ratings, due to the direct and indirect impacts a sovereign distress would
have on banks' operations. That said, we acknowledge that, amid challenging macro and industry
changes, South Africa's banking performance has been fairly resilient. We expect sector-wide
pressure on revenues but broadly, stable earnings as banks continue to streamline costs'.

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Affirmed the  BB/B' long- and short-term global scale ratings and changed its outlook from
        stable to negative
    -   Lowered the long-term national scale ratings from  zaAA+' to  zaAA'
    -   Affirmed the 'zaA-1+' short-term national scale ratings
