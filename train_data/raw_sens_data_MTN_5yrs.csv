Unless otherwise stated, financial growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis and are year-on-year (YoY,
9M to September 2020 vs 9M to September 2019). Non-financial growth rates are presented as quarter-on-quarter
(QoQ, 3Q20 vs 2Q20).

Service revenue excludes device and SIM card revenue. Data revenue is mobile and fixed access data and excludes roaming and wholesale.
Fintech includes MoMo, insurance, airtime lending and e-commerce. Active data users is a count of all subscribers at a point in time which
had a revenue generating event in the specified period of time (90 days) prior to that point in time and also during the past 30 days had data
usage greater than or equal to 5 megabytes. MoMo users are 30-day active users.


                                                                                                                                            
Group president and CEO, Ralph Mupita comments:

“As the Covid-19 pandemic has continued to impact lives and livelihoods across our markets, the group
has demonstrated strong operational execution and resilience during the period under review.
Although trading conditions remain challenging, we delivered a solid performance in Q3 2020 during
which the positive momentum achieved in key traffic and revenue trends towards the end of H1 2020
was sustained.

We continued to drive good growth in our subscriber base, enabled by strong commercial execution
across our markets. In the quarter we added 12 million subscribers and 5,3 million active data users.
We reached a significant milestone in our goal to enable greater financial inclusion by surpassing the
40 million MoMo subscribers mark, an addition of 3,5 million in the quarter. In Nigeria, we added over
90 000 agents to end Q3 at 311 770 registered agents for our fintech business. Apart from greater
adoption brought on by COVID-19, more people used MoMo because of enhancements to the
functionality of the MoMo app, the large increase in registered MoMo agents, as well as the
integration of MoMo into our instant messaging platform Ayoba in some of our markets.

Service revenue grew by 11,4% and EBITDA grew by 13,9%, with the group EBITDA margin improving
by 1,4pp to 43,3%, in line with our medium-term targets. Group leverage remains comfortably within
covenant limits and improved to 0,9x, from 1,1x at June 2020. Although our group holding company
(holdco) leverage continues to be impacted by timing delays in upstreaming from key operating
companies, it improved slightly to 2,6x from 2,7x at June 2020. As lockdown restrictions interrupted
new network rollout, particularly in Q2, we continued to focus our investment of R16,1 billion on
network capacity and resilience and modernising our IT systems. Pleasingly, we were able to accelerate
some of our investment as lockdown restrictions eased.

The group results were supported by the strong performance of our larger operations. MTN South
Africa sustained its turnaround, with an acceleration in its core consumer and enterprise business units
in Q3. MTN Nigeria recorded a solid result with some recovery in revenue growth under difficult
operating conditions, and MTN Ghana’s continued strong operational execution drove the delivery of
another good performance.

We recorded solid growth in voice revenue of 3,9%, which reflects an encouraging recovery supported
by the easing of lockdown restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economies in our markets.
Data revenue grew by 31,9%, bolstered by increased demand for work from home services, digital
entertainment as well as online education offerings. We also delivered pleasing growth in fintech and
digital revenue of 21,0% and 37,5% respectively, driven by increased adoption and usage of our digital
channels and offerings.

As we continue to navigate the impacts of the pandemic, we remain focused on our people, customers,
networks and efficiency, supporting our broad range of stakeholders through our Y’ello Hope and other
initiatives. While managing the risks, we are also alive to the opportunities presented by COVID-19,
particularly the accelerated need for digitalisation evidenced in the adoption and usage of our services.

Our balance sheet and liquidity position is supported by our focus on prudent capital allocation.

                                                                                                       
We have completed the exit from our 18,9% investment in Jumia as well as the localisation of an 8%
shareholding in MTN Zambia, realising net proceeds of approximately R2,3 billion and R204 million
respectively.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to providing leading network service; building and scaling our
digital and fintech businesses; securing greater efficiency through cost discipline; and executing on our
pan-African strategy and asset realisation programme.


The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa
and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and their
respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted), eSwatini (joint
venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea
Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

MTN South Africa
MTN SA delivered an encouraging performance, with strong commercial execution sustaining the
growth of consumer prepaid, consumer postpaid and enterprise business units. Service revenue grew
by 2,1% with an improved performance in Q3, when it increased by 11,8% YoY.

Service revenue growth was supported by the strong performance in the consumer prepaid business,
continued growth of the enterprise business and the resilience of the consumer postpaid business. All
three business units continue to benefit from the growth in data usage driving the increase in data
revenue by 16,0% YoY in the nine months to September 2020.

MTN SA’s results were negatively impacted by the discontinuation of our roaming agreement with
Telkom which concluded in June 2019 and the effect of accounting for Cell C roaming revenue on a
cash basis. Excluding the impact of national roaming, MTN SA would have recorded service revenue
growth of 3,4% in the first nine months of the year and 5,7% YoY in Q3.

Total subscribers increased by 1,9 million in the quarter, to 30,9 million. The majority of additions
were prepaid customers, reaching a total of 24,3 million and marking the largest quarterly increase in
nearly 18 months. Postpaid subscriber numbers remained broadly flat at 6,6 million, primarily as a
result of churn on short-term COVID-19 related deals. Excluding the net impact of these deals, the
postpaid subscriber base increased 168 100 for the quarter.

Strong data traffic growth of 80,6% coupled with a 0,5 million increase in active data users to 14,7
million supported a solid 16,0% increase in overall mobile data revenue. In line with the commitment
to improving the affordability of data for its customers, MTN SA has reduced its effective data tariff
by approximately 34,7% since September 2019.

The execution of MTN SA’s prepaid strategy resulted in a solid performance in the consumer prepaid
business, which remained on an improving trajectory with service revenue up 3,1%, benefiting from a
strong third quarter when service revenue increased by 5,7% YoY. The business benefited from
increased data usage and customer additions as well as an increased uptake in data packages as it
focuses on affordability and customer value management (CVM) initiatives.

                                                                                                                                           
The consumer postpaid business recorded a 3,1% growth in service revenue, achieved in a highly
competitive environment. The business benefited from efforts to reduce churn as well as Data First
(Mega Deals) offers driving uptake of data-rich contracts.

The enterprise business continued recording growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Service
revenue was up 17,2%, boosted by customised data deals for universities to facilitate ‘learn from
home’ initiatives as well as the uptake of ‘work from home’ solutions. As these deals were on a short-
term basis, there was a slowdown in the quarter reflecting the university churn, however the focus
remains on base retention as well as on adding new corporate customers.

Wholesale revenue declined by 14,4%, impacted by the lost national roaming revenue from the
discontinuation of the agreement with Telkom and the effect of continuing to account for Cell C
revenue on a cash basis. MTN SA recognised approximately R1,3 billion in national roaming revenue
in the nine months to 30 September 2020 (taking into consideration that no Cell C revenue was
recognised in Q3 2019), while R698 million of Cell C revenue remained unrecognised as at
September 2020. The implementation continues of Phase 2 of the Cell C roaming agreement, which
commenced on 1 May 2020.

MTN SA produced a solid EBITDA margin of 39,3%, expanding by 2,7pp, aided by the reductions in
device volumes and subsidies, execution of the cost efficiency programme as well as channel
optimisation.

Since launching MoMo in South Africa in January 2020, this service continues to scale, with
approximately 2,0 million registered users at 30 September 2020. The focus remains on growing the
platform through innovative and relevant service offerings.

In the quarter, MTN SA maintained its leading network experience ranking and once again achieved
the highest ranking on the MyBroadband Network Quality Score in all main areas of the country.

Since launching MTN 5G in June, MTN SA continued to deliver 5G connectivity with more than 100
sites and across multiple spectrum bands. Our network resilience programme is mitigating the impacts
of load shedding and load reduction in order to guarantee the best customer experience, despite a
further increase in power outages in September.

This very strong network performance has also been assisted by the Independent Communications
Authority of South Africa (ICASA) issuing certain high demand frequency spectrum to MTN on a
temporary basis. Such frequencies were deployed in urban and rural areas to alleviate congestion and
provide further world-class quality and speeds to our customers during the COVID-19 lockdown
period. On 30 September, ICASA announced the broad terms of the planned spectrum auction and
the wholesale open access network (WOAN), as well as the decision to extend the temporary
allocation of spectrum.

Q3 saw MTN SA staff continuing with work from home arrangements, with most remaining at home.
This includes many of the in-house call centre agents who have been set-up at home so they can
continue serving our customers. Staff in our branded stores continued to adhere to the strict COVID-
19 social distancing and sanitation protocols and during the quarter, MTN SA concluded its mass
testing of customer-facing employees. Through the MTN Y’ello Hope programme, the MTN
Foundation provided 16 NGOs with support in the form of PPE and food parcels. MTN SA has now
zero-rated over 950 health, education and employment websites, including all public universities,
TVET colleges, as well as hundreds of schools and NPOs, as guided by the Department of
Communications and Digital Technology working group, including the Department of Basic Education.
MTN SA also collaborated on the national launch of the COVID SA Alert app which is also zero-rated.


MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria delivered a solid performance in a challenging operating environment, with service
revenue growth of 13,8% and an acceleration in Q3 growth to 16,5% YoY. This performance was largely
driven by continued growth in data and a recovery in voice against a backdrop of ongoing oil price
volatility, COVID-19-related pressures and scarcity of foreign exchange.

Voice revenue grew by 4,0%, with a recovery in the trend to 7,0% YoY in Q3, on the back of expanded
customer acquisition touch points, rural telephony initiatives as well as revamped offers and CVM
toolkits to increase usage and traffic. MTN Nigeria added 3,9 million customers in Q3, bringing the
overall base to 75 million subscribers.

Data continued on a strong trajectory of growth with revenue up 57,1%. Continuing the momentum
from H1, Q3 growth was 56,0% YoY and was delivered through a combination of increased active data
users and usage, which drove higher traffic. The number of active data subscribers increased by
1,7 million, to close the quarter at 30,7 million. Some 2,9 million new smartphones connected to the
MTN Nigeria network, increasing smartphone penetration to 45,2% of the base – up from 43,5% in Q2
and 41,7% in Q3 2019.

Growth in the digital business remained strong off a low base, increasing by 116,1% and 103% YoY in
Q3. This was supported by increased adoption of digital products and services offered into the
1,5 million active user base.

Fintech revenue rose by 28,2%, and by 25,9% YoY in Q3. Increased adoption of airtime lending service
MTN Xtratime remains the key driver of growth in the business. The strategic and commercial
initiatives to scale the business are ahead of schedule with over 90 000 new MoMo agents added in
the quarter, which ended with 311 770 registered agents – this exceeded the year-end target of
300 000. MTN Nigeria increased its fintech subscribers by 1,2 million to reach 3,4 million in Q3, and
the volume of transactions processed increased by 101,0% in the period to 29,4 million.

Enterprise revenue grew by 2,0% but declined in Q3 by 2,1% YoY largely due to the economic impact
of the lockdown on the businesses we support. However, there was some improvement in the Q3
performance compared to Q2 as economic activity started to recover.

EBITDA rose by 7,9% and the EBITDA margin was 51,0%, from 53,7%. This was impacted by the
combined effects of a 2,5% increase in value-added tax (VAT), the change in the treatment of non-
recoverable VAT on lease payments, and COVID-19-related costs. The EBITDA margin was also affected
by the accelerated 4G site rollout, which commenced in Q4 2019, resulting in the full impact of
increased lease rentals coming through in 2020. This put upward pressure on lease rental costs in the
period, along with the effects of a 23,9% adjustment in the official exchange rate.


Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region
The SEAGHA region delivered another solid performance, navigating the challenging trading
conditions brought about by COVID-19 and aided by the revival in some economic activity into Q3 as
lockdown restrictions were eased. SEAGHA recorded a strong increase in service revenue of 19,2%,
with all operating companies improving in Q3 to drive aggregate regional growth of 19,8% YoY. The
region increased subscribers by 3,8 million to 55,1 million.

MTN Ghana produced another good performance, with service revenue growing by 18,8%, driven by
double-digit improvements in voice (up 12,0%) and data (up 21,0%) revenue along with further solid
fintech revenue growth (up 24,8%). The growth in revenue was supported by strong increases in
overall subscribers as well as in active data and fintech users, while the ongoing deployment of CVM
helped to manage churn and improve adoption and usage of product and service offerings.

The EBITDA margin for MTN Ghana expanded by 3,2pp to 53,3%, supported by various cost efficiency
initiatives including enhanced penetration of electronic distribution channels and optimising network
costs.

MTN Uganda increased service revenue by 9,6%, with a recovery in most revenue lines. Notably, the
pleasing growth in voice (up 4,4%), data (up 30,1%) and fintech revenue (up 10,5%) was supported by
increases in the user base and usage. The EBITDA margin expanded by 1,4pp to 49,0%, supported by
higher revenue and cost efficiency initiatives.

Overall, the SEAGHA portfolio excluding MTN Ghana delivered healthy service revenue growth of
19,6%, and 22,0% YoY in Q3.


West and Central Africa (WECA) region
The WECA region grew service revenue by 7,8%, and by 9,3% YoY in Q3 – well-above the blended
average inflation of approximately 3,0% across the region. This was a pleasing outcome in light of
ongoing uncertainty in the political and economic environment in various markets within the WECA
portfolio. Q3 showed some signs of economic recovery, although there remains pressure from the
effects of COVID-19. The overall service revenue performance was enabled by continued subscriber
growth of 1,5 million QoQ to 38,6 million, and improvements in fintech and data revenue.

MTN Ivory Coast recorded an increase in service revenue of 8,3%, supported by net additions of
0,6 million in Q3 as well as ongoing strong revenue growth in data (up 25,1%) and fintech (up 14,2%).
The effective execution of marketing, sales and distribution initiatives implemented during the period
helped to drive gains in market share and an acceleration in voice revenue, which increased by 2,8%
(up 5,7% YoY in Q3). The EBITDA margin widened by 5,9pp to 34,2%.

MTN Cameroon’s service revenue grew by 4,7%, achieving further market and value share gains, in a
challenging environment as the conflict in the Northwest/Southwest regions continued. Data revenue
was up by 19,7% and fintech revenue increased by 40,8%. The EBITDA margin for MTN Cameroon
improved by 2,4pp to 33,0%.

Excluding MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast, the WECA markets grew their service revenue by an
aggregate of 9,2%, and 10,1% YoY in Q3.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region
The performance delivered by the MENA region was pleasing in a persistently difficult operating
environment, with double-digit service revenue growth of 22,7%, and of 24,7% in Q3. This was largely
supported by solid growth in data revenue (up 46,2%) with an 11,2% YoY increase in active data
subscribers in the nine months to September 2020. Total subscribers (excluding MTN Irancell)
increased by 0,2 million in the quarter to 25,5 million.

MTN Syria grew service revenue by 23,9%, driven by growth in voice (up 9,6%) and data (up 33,5%).
The EBITDA margin declined by 15,4pp to 23,2% as a result of a material devaluation in the local
currency, which put pressure on foreign-denominated operational expenditure.

MTN Sudan increased service revenue by 71,4%, underpinned by growth in voice (up 53,1%) and data
(up 122,8%) on the back of increased active data subscribers and usage. The EBITDA margin expanded
by 10,4pp to 39,9%, driven by strong growth in revenue.

MTN Irancell, our equity-accounted joint venture, again delivered strong underlying growth despite a
challenging operating environment including the depreciation of the currency and the high rate of
inflation. Service revenue grew by 34,4%, with data revenue up by 51,2%, benefiting from increased
usage (up 82,2%) particularly during the hard lockdown period. The EBITDA margin increased by 0,7pp
to 37,5%.


Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme (ARP)
Our ARP, initially launched in March 2019 and enhanced in March 2020, aims to reduce debt, simplify
our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise capital of at least an additional R25 billion over
three to five years. In August 2020, the group announced its decision to focus on its pan-African
strategy and exit the Middle East region in an orderly manner over the medium term.

Discussions regarding the potential sale of our 20% shareholding in Belgacom International Carrier
Services SA (BICS) are ongoing and we will update the market of any further developments in this
regard.

MTN Syria is included in those assets classified as held for sale and it remains the group’s intention to
exit its 75% stake in the business.

The group has now fully exited its 18,9% investment in Jumia Technologies AG (Jumia), realising a total
consideration of approximately R2,3 billion (US$138 million). We are proud to have been a partner in
the evolution of one of Africa’s pioneering online marketplace businesses and will continue our
relationship with Jumia through ongoing operational partnerships in some markets.


                                                                                                        
We are pleased to announce that a sale and purchase agreement has been concluded to transfer an
8% holding in MTN Zambia to the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) in Zambia. This forms
part of the localisation strategy within our broader portfolio optimisation and ARP. The group has
received net proceeds of approximately R204 million for the transaction.

In September 2018, MTN Ghana completed an initial public offer in which 12.5% of its shares were
listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and nearly 130,000 Ghanaians were welcomed as
shareholders in the company. MTN Group intends to sell down a further 12.5% of its investment in
MTN Ghana, with a focus on local shareholding, which will increase MTN Ghana’s free-float on the
GSE to 25%.


Update on regulatory and legal considerations
MTN Afghanistan anti-terrorism complaint
On 27 December 2019, a complaint for violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act was filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia (the Complaint). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009
and 2017, and on behalf of their families. The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses
supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure.
The defendants named in the Complaint are made up of a number of different groups of affiliated
companies, one of which is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies, including MTN Afghanistan.

In late April 2020, MTN filed a ‘motion to dismiss’ that asked the court to end the lawsuit and grant a
judgment in MTN’s favour for two independent reasons: because the court lacks jurisdiction over
MTN, which does not operate in the United States, and because the complaint does not allege any
conduct by MTN that would have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.

In June 2020, the plaintiffs in the matter filed an amended Complaint to which further complainants,
defendants and allegations were added. MTN believes that the amended Complaint suffers from the
same fundamental defects in the case explained in the April motion. The plaintiffs proceeded to
amend their initial Complaint, following the June 2020 motion to dismiss. With the Complaint having
been amended with new allegations, MTN filed another motion to dismiss in September 2020. This
motion to dismiss takes into account the new allegations made in the amended Complaint. MTN
remains of the view that the court should dismiss this claim on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and
that the amended Complaint still does not allege any conduct by MTN that is in violation of the Anti-
Terrorism Act.

MTN conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories and will defend
its position where necessary.

MTN Ghana classification as a significant market power
In June 2020, the National Communications Authority (NCA) classified MTN Ghana as a significant
market power (SMP) and determined that special regulatory restrictions would be enforced on MTN
Ghana.

Following consultations as well as engagements on the matter with regulatory and other stakeholders,
MTN Ghana applied to the courts – on procedural grounds – for relief in the form of a judicial review
of the NCA’s decision. Given the progress made in further engagements with the NCA and Ghana’s
Ministry of Communications, MTN Ghana, on 13 October 2020, withdrew its legal challenge filed at
the Supreme Court in order to pave the way for further discussions and an amicable resolution. These
discussions are ongoing.

MTN Ghana is a responsible market player in a highly competitive market and does not engage in anti-
competitive behaviour.

Spectrum allocation and auction in South Africa
On 2 October 2020, ICASA released the full terms of the spectrum auction and WOAN. The auction
will include spectrum in the 700-800 MHz band, 2,6 GHz band and 3,5 GHz band. The 2,3 GHz will be
auctioned at a later stage to be determined. The temporary spectrum allocated at the start of
lockdown, and which was due to expire in November 2020, has been extended to March 2021. This
continues to significantly ease the congestion in hotspots across the country where data traffic has
surged. MTN welcomes the planned spectrum auction, which will be critical in further broadening
access in South Africa in a sustainable manner.


COVID-19 pandemic impact on the business
Although the trading environment remains quite challenging, the easing of lockdown regulations and
restrictions that have arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some improvement in economic
activity and market conditions. We remain focused on the key areas impacting our business, namely:
social (our people, communities and stakeholders); commercial (including our customers); network
and supply chain; and funding and liquidity.

Social
We continue to implement strict health measures and monitoring to ensure the safety of our people,
who remain empowered to work remotely although some have started returning to workplaces. The
group provides ongoing support through the MTN Global Staff Emergency Fund, Y’ello Hope Packages
for our stakeholders as well as MTN foundations and various government-led initiatives in our
markets, including the Solidarity Fund in South Africa.

In September, MTN added its voice to global efforts to encourage the wearing of masks to fight the
spread of COVID-19, committing our marketing resources in the month to our #WearItForMe
campaign across our markets.

Commercial
Our commercial trends have been encouraging as COVID-19 restrictions have eased across the MTN
footprint. Overall data traffic has remained resilient at elevated levels, although we have observed
some easing from the peaks. Voice traffic and revenue, which initially came under significant pressure,
have been in recovery and the month-to-month trajectory of fintech drivers has trended upwards
following a dip in April 2020.

Comparing the September 2020 level for the group’s data traffic against April 2020, the level of activity
was 10,2% higher, and up 8,9% QoQ in Q3. For our largest markets on the same basis: MTN SA was up
by 2,0% (and 4,1% QoQ), MTN Nigeria increased by 22,1% (and 15,2% QoQ), while MTN Ghana was
up by 9,3% (and 5,6% QoQ). These trends demonstrate the resilience of data traffic relative to the
elevated activity prompted by COVID-19 during Q2.

On the whole, data demand benefited from shifts in consumer spending patterns during the peak
periods of lockdowns and restrictions as spend that would have otherwise been directed elsewhere
(such as travel, entertainment etc) was channelled into data and other digital services. As restrictions
have been lifted, we have observed some reversal in this trend.

Since April 2020, during which the effects of COVID-19 were the most severe, the trajectory for voice
has been encouraging. Group voice traffic was up by 11,5% at the end of September 2020 compared
to the April 2020 level. For MTN SA, voice traffic was 7,0% higher in September versus April, MTN
Nigeria was up by 14,1% and MTN Ghana had increased by 5,6%. These trends are evidence of the
recovery in voice traffic since the most severe impacts of COVID-19.

The commercial trends in fintech have also recovered strongly from the April 2020 low, with group
fintech transaction volumes in September 2020 up by 38,7% on the April 2020 level and up 23,1%
QoQ. On the same basis, the value of fintech transactions in US dollar terms was up by 64,7% and
33,7% respectively.

As we continue our focus on managing the risks posed by the pandemic, we are also focused on
continued commercial execution around the opportunities it presents. In particular, we are well
positioned for the accelerated need for digitalisation, which is already evident in the trajectory of our
data, fintech and digital businesses.

Network and supply chain
Throughout the pandemic we have maintained the capacity and resilience of our networks. As
lockdown regulations have lifted in our markets, we have been able to resume a more regular rollout
of network investment as restrictions on movement and logistical bottlenecks have eased. This has
also enabled us to increase the headroom in our networks, notably in South Africa and Nigeria among
our larger markets.

To ensure there are no significant interruptions to our business, we continue to closely monitor and
manage the impact of the pandemic on our network and supply chain. At the end of September 2020,
the headroom on our data networks was 45,0% in South Africa, 58,0% in Nigeria and 30,0% in Ghana.

Funding and liquidity
The strength and resilience of our balance sheet has been evidenced in our ability to weather the
volatility brought about by COVID-19. Year to date we have successfully fast-tracked and closed
R18,2 billion in funding to mitigate refinance risk around upcoming maturities. We continued to
manage and focus on liquidity as a priority. At 30 September 2020, our group net debt was
R60,6 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0,9x, well within our covenant of 2,5x. Our interest
cover was 9,0x, comparing favourably with the covenant limit of no less than 5,0x.

At the holdco level we maintained a healthy liquidity position, with holdco net debt of R55,5 billion
slightly higher than the December 2019 level. At the end of September 2020, our holdco leverage was
2,6x, affected mainly by timing effects of cash upstreaming from our opcos, although slightly improved
on the June 2020 level of 2,7x.

MTN Nigeria has declared and paid its final dividend for 2019 as well as its interim 2020 dividend
(totalling R5,4 billion as at September 2020). The upstreaming of this cash to the group remained
delayed in Q3 due to challenges in securing foreign currency in that market, however we expect the
availability of US dollars to improve in the last quarter of the year and some upstreaming of dividends
to resume.

Our approach to liquidity management continues to be prudent and focused on cash preservation. At
30 September 2020, our holdco liquidity headroom stood at approximately R39,0 billion – comprising
R13,4 billion in cash and R25,6 billion in committed, undrawn credit facilities.

Our medium-term focus remains to reduce our exposure to US dollar debt and improve the funding
mix at the holdco level through improved cash flows which will be supported by proceeds from our
ARP.

Management changes
On 26 October 2020, we announced two important new appointments: that of CEO of major subsidiary
MTN Nigeria and that of MTN Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO), a new group executive committee
(exco) position. Both are effective from 1 March 2021.

Karl Toriola, current vice president for MTN Group’s WECA region, will take over as MTN Nigeria CEO
from Ferdi Moolman, who has served MTN Nigeria with distinction for the past five years. Ferdi will
return to South Africa, where he will assume the new role of GCRO and lead the evolution of our
enterprise-wide risk management system. Both will remain members of the group’s exco.

Karl’s successor as Vice President for WECA will be announced after the group strategy review is
completed by the end of November 2020.

Outlook
Despite the relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions across our markets, the operating
environment remains challenging and uncertain. We will continue to focus our efforts and capital
investments on ensuring we provide our customers with reliable connectivity and digital services
during these challenging times.

While we continue to manage the risks brought about by COVID-19, we are also well-positioned to
unlock the opportunities that have arisen. The pandemic and its effects have highlighted the
importance of connectivity, financial inclusion and digital services, and we are reviewing and refining
our strategy to position the business to capture growth going forward.

As we continue to strengthen our operational and financial position – focusing on expense
management and efficiencies, as well as liquidity and cash preservation – we are well placed to sustain
growth and meet our targets over the medium term. Our capital expenditure (capex) programme
prioritises the resilience and capacity of our networks, while we execute our strategy to deliver
sustainable growth across our operations.

We target capex of at least R26,0 billion for 2020, revised up from the previous guidance of
R24,0 billion as the overall visibility and ability to roll out the network investment in our footprint has
improved following the relaxation of COVID-19 related regulations and restrictions.

presenting the pro forma financial information and for the completeness and accuracy of the pro forma financial information is that of the
directors of MTN. This is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly
present MTN’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows. It has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has not been reviewed and
reported on by MTN’s external auditors. Constant currency information has been presented to remove the impact of movement in currency
rates on the group's results and has been calculated by translating the prior financial reporting period’s results at the current period’s average
rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira.
The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results compared to the current
year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has
been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary
for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Commentary
The year to date has been characterised largely by the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on the business.
COVID-19 has had a significant effect on the economy with the informal sector severely impacted. Consequently,
GDP growth has been revised downwards from 6.8% to about 1%, as announced by the Ghanaian Finance
Minister during the presentation of the mid-year review of the Budget Statement and Economic Policy for the
2020 financial year.

COVID-19 has led to shifts in consumer behaviour with the dependency on, and usage of, digital options
increasing significantly. The increase in demand for digital and data services have placed significant pressure on
our network infrastructure. This has necessitated our capex spend of GH¢876 million in network capacity and
infrastructure expansion projects to meet the needs of Ghanaians in this era of accelerated digitalisation and we
are committed to the further investments required.

Our investments to date will support and enable continued economic productivity. In the period, we have rolled
out 115 2G, 115 3G and 547 LTE sites, which has supported a significant improvement in network coverage,
customer experience and quality of service (QoS). This has helped us to accommodate the demand for digital
and data services that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Service revenue increased by 18.8%, supported by growth in voice, data, MoMo and digital revenue.

Voice revenue grew by 12.1%, benefitting from an increase in the number of subscribers * (+8.7%) during the
period, as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage churn and
improve usage. The contribution of voice to service revenue declined from 45.0% to 42.5% YoY in favour of our
new growth areas in line with our revenue diversification strategy and building a digital operator.

Data revenue growth of 20.7% was driven by an increase in active data subscribers # (+8.3%), a higher number of
smartphones on the network (+12.6%) and a general increase in demand and 58.9% growth in usage. Data
revenue contribution to service revenue increased from 28.5% to 29.0% YoY.

The growth in MoMo revenue (up 27.3%) was supported by an increase in the number of active users * (+4.3%)
from new activations in the period, higher person-to-person (P2P) transactional activity and broader penetration
of more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and international remittances. MoMo revenue
contribution to service revenue increased from 18.5% to 19.9% YoY.

Digital revenue continued its recovery (up 52.9%), driven by growth in the number of active subscribers *
(+13.7%) as well as improvements to our video and gaming offerings and increased adoption of our MyMTN and
Ayoba messaging apps. Digital revenue contribution to service revenue increased from 3.4% to 4.4% YoY.

Reported EBITDA grew by 26.7%, with a corresponding margin expansion of 3.3 pp to 53.3%. Our margin
improvement continued to benefit from our cost efficiency initiatives, digital distribution efficiencies and other
transformation activities.

Growth in top-line revenue, coupled with short-term cuts in expenses and cash preservation as a response to
COVID-19, resulted in an increase (+53.1%) in profit after tax.


COVID-19
Over the period we have seen a progressive removal of COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the President of Ghana
earlier in the year and the economy continues to open up. We have also seen the level of active cases drop
below 500 following proactive interventions from the Government. Despite the positive developments, we
continue to experience some supply chain challenges, as well as the overall effects of the economic slowdown
on our manufacturing and hospitality customers. We are seeing some improvements in activity from our small
and medium enterprise (SME) customers, though the level of activity following the general decline due to COVID-
19 remains subdued.

The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity and consumer incomes showed some easing through the third
quarter and this trend is expected to continue through the final quarter of the year.

In our bid to continue supporting Government’s efforts and promote activities that are in the best interest of
the safety of our customers, MobileMoney Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scancom PLC, extended the
offer for free MoMo P2P transfers up to a value of GH¢100 per day to the end of 2020. This will save customers
an estimated total of at least GH¢90 million in transaction fees while promoting the safety of Ghanaians and
deepening financial inclusion.

MTN Ghana continues to support Government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic by providing free
access to over 200 websites for online education for public and private institutions until the end of the pandemic.
To date, we have supported over 4.5 million students and teachers with over 150 Terabytes of free data valued
at more than GH¢3 million. To augment this effort, MTN through the MTN Ghana Foundation donated GH¢5
million worth of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff
through the Government’s COVID-19 Trust Fund activities.

In support of Government’s efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic and to keep Ghanaians safe, MTN Ghana
launched the ‘BE WISE’ campaign aimed at encouraging Ghanaians across the nation to keep wearing their face
masks and wear them the correct way to protect themselves and their loved ones. Together with donations of
PPEs, this campaign has created awareness to protecting one another through a selfless act of wear ones’ face
mask. Today, this campaign has transitioned into the MTN’s global ‘Wear It For Me’ campaign which seeks to
continue creating awareness of wearing face masks in order to protect our loved ones, future generations and
prevent another wave of the pandemic.

We will continue to provide PPEs and sanitizers, and ensure all safety protocols are adhered to, across our branch
network. The cumulative value of our efforts in the fight against COVID-19 stood at approximately GH¢100
million as at end of September 2020.

We remain focused on our people, customers, network resilience and efficiency in delivering on our quest to
make the lives of our customers a whole lot BRIGHTer in these uncertain times.

Regulatory update
On September 1st, 2020, the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) dismissed the company’s application –
made on procedural grounds – for a judicial review of the declaration by the National Communications Authority
(NCA) of MTN Ghana as a significant market power (SMP).

On September 4th, MTN Ghana filed an application with the Supreme Court to review the High Court’s
judgement. Following that, MTN Ghana embarked on a series of engagements with the regulator and other key
stakeholders to have the concerns raised addressed in an amicable manner.

Given the progress made, in good faith, on settlement discussions with the NCA and Ministry of
Communications, the company on October 13th, 2020 withdrew its application filed at the Supreme Court. It is
our expectation that this action will pave the way for further discussions and an amicable resolution, using the
renewed channels of engagement. We remain grateful to the NCA, the Ministry of Communications and key
stakeholders for their openness and commitment to engage with the view to resolve the issues amicably.

MTN Ghana remains focused on providing the enabling technology to support Ghana’s digital economy through
partnerships with the Government of Ghana and other Ghanaian telecommunications players.

Further Localisation of Scancom PLC
In September 2018, Scancom PLC completed an initial public offer in which 12.5% of its shares was listed on the
Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and nearly 130,000 Ghanaians were welcomed as shareholders in the company.
MTN Group has agreed with the Government of Ghana to sell down a further 12.5% of its investment in Scancom
PLC, with a focus on local shareholding, which will increase Scancom PLC’s shareholding on the GSE to 25%. This
process of further increasing localisation and deepening shared value is underway and we look forward to
providing updates in future performance updates.

2021 marks MTN Ghana’s 25th Anniversary
2021 marks the 25th anniversary of MTN Ghana and as part of the celebrations, MTN is committing the
equivalent of $25 million (or GH¢150 million) to a fund supporting Ghana’s post-COVID-19 recovery efforts. MTN
Ghana will seek to further its strategic partnership with the Government of Ghana through investments in digital
ecosystem projects as part of Governments long-term transformation agenda. We will share more details in H1
2021, about this exciting development when plans are finalised with Government and partners .

Outlook
Although a progressive recovery is expected into 2021, the macro outlook for the rest of 2020 remains relatively
uncertain. As a business, we remain cautious of the uncertainties surrounding the extent of economic impact of
COVID-19 although the continued gradual opening up of the economy is encouraging. We expect business
performance to continue to be influenced by the shifts in consumer behaviour towards accelerated digital
adoption and usage as well as the rate of economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 regulations and
restrictions imposed earlier in the year. There would be continuous need for more capex and related opex to
accommodate the usage growth and build resilience in all areas including cyber security. Certain costs had to be
postponed whilst managing the COVID-related uncertainties would start to be incurred as the local and global
economies open up more and more.

Our focus remains our employees’ and customers’ safety; regulatory risk; supply chain challenges mitigation;
liquidity, currency and counterparty risk management; and the potential revenue impact of reduced consumer
spend. Our social support programs towards those severely impacted by the pandemic will continue.

In the fourth quarter of the year, we continue our journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications
operator to an emerging digital operator, with 2020 being the ‘Year of the customer: the digital experience’.

MTN Nigeria is one of Africa’s largest providers of communications services, connecting over 75 million people in communities across the
country with each other and the world. Guided by a vision to lead the delivery of a bold new digital world, MTN Nigeria’s leadership position
in coverage, capacity and innovation has remained constant since its launch in 2001. MTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group – a multinational
telecommunications group which operates in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East.



MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:
“The year 2020 has been challenging for everyone. The COVID-19 pandemic was first reported in Nigeria during
the first quarter of 2020 and the country has, to date, registered over 62,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths
according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Many share a common distressing story of health,
social and financial consequences of the pandemic. The recent agitations across the country are of further
concern and our thoughts and prayers are with all those directly and indirectly affected.

Through all these, we recognise that we must keep rising the best way we have learnt to do, which is together.
That is why our priorities have remained focused on continuing to provide and invest in a network that brings
people together and provides a platform for everyone’s voice to be heard. It also enables the accelerated need
for digitalisation where more people work from home with increasing reliance on a ubiquitous and effective
digital network.

As part of our COVID-19 response, we launched various initiatives to provide support for our people, customers
and the various levels of government. We were pleased that over 75% of our customers benefitted from the free
SMS under our Y’ello Hope package aimed mainly at the vulnerable in the society. This initiative enabled our
customers to send over 4.3 billion messages and stay connected to family and friends in the midst of social
distancing imperatives.

We provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers and facilitated zero-rated access to
healthcare websites, also aimed at supporting individuals and institutions, mindful that all hands must be on
deck to stem the pandemic. When we deployed our Wear-it-for-me campaign, we leveraged on the power of
community and the family ties that bind us, to help create awareness around wearing masks, again as part of
Y’ello Hope.

Continuing our national support in relation to the disruptive effect of the pandemic, we launched The MTN Revv
Programme in August to expand our support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the country. The
programme is designed to help SMEs reposition their businesses for growth in the emerging digital economy, and
includes masterclasses, advisory services, marketing and technology support. The first phase, which is the
masterclass, has engaged more than 18,000 SME participants so far. Based on the popularity of the programme,
we now plan to hold it annually.

We are humbled that MTN Nigeria was named the ‘Most Responsive Organisation to COVID-19’ at the 2020
Nigerian Risk Awards. This is a reflection of our commitment to the initiatives we implemented in response to
the pandemic. We will continue to provide support as the country navigates the pandemic and its associated
impact.

During the period under review, we saw volatility in both voice and data revenue, affecting the trajectory of our
overall service revenue, as well as pressure on costs, which continues to impact our operating margins,
dampening profitability.

Following a decline in voice traffic and an acceleration in data during lockdowns in Q2, we have seen a
normalisation of traffic as restrictions have been removed, with a recovery in voice traffic and continued growth
in data. This has supported a 13.9% growth in service revenue, with an acceleration of growth to 16.5% in Q3
specifically.

Data revenue rose by 57.0%, with an increase in data usage and traffic. Revenue from digital and fintech services
rose by 114.3% and 28.3% respectively, while voice revenue growth was 4.2%.

We saw a significant increase in our subscriber base with the addition of 3.9 million customers in Q3, bringing
total subscribers to 75 million. Cumulative net additions totalled 10.7 million in the nine months to September
2020 the first time we have exceeded 10 million additions in an annual cycle with one quarter remaining. We
also connected 1.7 million new users to the internet in Q3 (5.5 million for the nine months), bringing our active
data subscribers to 30.7 million.

To accommodate the increase in traffic and enhance service quality for all our customers, we continued to invest
in the capacity and resilience of our network, accelerating our 4G rollout and expanding our investments in rural
connectivity. Our 4G network now covers 52.9% of the population, up from 48.6% in Q2 and 35.4% in Q3 2019.

The growth in our digital business continued to accelerate from a low base, and our fintech business delivered
impressive results. In Q3, we surpassed our year-end target of 300,000 registered Mobile Money (MoMo) agents,
as we continued to convert our traditional airtime agents. Our fintech subscribers increased by 1.2 million in the
quarter to 3.4 million, driving higher transaction volumes and fintech revenue growth.

EBITDA rose by 9.1%, supported by service revenue growth. However, the EBITDA margin declined by 2.3pp to
51.0% due to cost pressures arising mainly from increased investments in our network and the impact on costs
of the depreciation to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and NAFEX exchange rates, affecting in particular the
costs of our lease contracts. PBT and EPS declined by 0.6% and 3.3% respectively; however, we saw a recovery in
Q3 with a growth of 2.2% YoY in PBT and a marginal decline of 0.7% YoY in EPS.

Finally, we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Rob Shuter, former Group CEO of MTN Group
and former Board member of MTN Nigeria, who resigned with effect from 1 September 2020. We appreciate his
exemplary leadership and commitment to the Company.”

Operational review
We made significant progress in building the base for our business, with 75.0 million subscribers connected to
our networks and accessing communication services as of September 2020. The growth in our subscriber base
provided support for voice revenue, which accounted for 67.2% of service revenue and rose by 4.2%, with an
acceleration in growth to 7.0% YoY in Q3. The key drivers for this were our expanded customer acquisition
touchpoints, rural telephony initiatives and revamped acquisition offers using our customer value management
toolkit.

Data revenue (24.8% of service revenue) continued to grow strongly, building on the positive momentum from
H1. The performance in data was delivered through a combination of increased subscribers, usage (MB per user)
and ultimately traffic, supported by increased network capacity and 4G penetration. Data traffic rose by 135.6%
YoY and average usage by 70.4%. We added 2.9 million new smartphones to our network in the quarter, bringing
smartphone penetration to 45.2% of our base, up from 43.5% in Q2 and 41.7% in Q3 2019.

Digital revenue improved strongly off a low base, rising by 114.3%. This was driven by the increased uptake of
our enhanced digital offerings, supported by our active base of 1.5 million users and partnerships with digital
content providers.

Our fintech business continued to grow, with MTN Xtratime as a key revenue driver. We expanded our MoMo
agent network with the addition of over 90,000 registered agents during the quarter and broadened our service
offerings to include bill payments as well as bank deposit and withdrawals through the agents. At the end of Q3,
we recorded 311,770 registered MoMo agents, surpassing our year-end target and processing more than 29.4
million transactions (up 101% QoQ in Q3), from an active base of 3.4 million subscribers.

Enterprise revenue grew by 2.0% YoY in the first nine months but declined by 2.1% YoY in Q3 due to the
economic impact of the lockdown on the businesses we support. However, we are encouraged by the recovery
we saw on a sequential QoQ basis as economic activity started to pick up in the quarter. Our enterprise business
includes revenue from mobile and fixed connectivity, cloud and ICT solutions, and devices. It cuts across voice,
data and digital services for SMEs, the public sector and large enterprise customers.

Capital expenditure (“capex”) was N194.2 billion, up 26.1%. Excluding right of use assets, capex was down by
2.5% to N130.1 billion. In Q3, we were able to ramp up site rollout by 46.2% YoY, following a slowdown in Q2
due to a scarcity of foreign exchange and port congestion.

The aggressive 4G site rollout, which commenced in Q4 2019, resulted in the full impact of increased lease
rentals coming through in 2020. This, together with the effects of a 23.9% adjustment to the official exchange
rate, put upward pressure on lease rental costs in the period. In addition to this, the combined effect of the 2.5%
increase in value-added tax (“VAT”), the change in the treatment of non-recoverable VAT on lease payments,
and COVID-19-related costs led to a 24.9% increase in operating expenses with a commensurate knock-on effect
on EBITDA.

EBITDA rose by 9.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 51.0%. We delivered a healthy free cash flow of N303.6 billion,
up 0.4%. Overall, PBT declined marginally by 0.6%, mainly due to an increase in finance costs arising from higher
borrowings. PAT and EPS declined by 3.3% respectively, reflecting an increase in taxation mainly due to lower
investment allowance and exempt income.

CEO succession
We have previously announced the appointment of Mr Karl Toriola as the CEO designate for MTN Nigeria. His
appointment is effective 1 March 2021, when he will take over from the current CEO, Mr Ferdi Moolman.

Mr. Toriola is currently the Vice President, West and Central Africa (WECA) for MTN Group, a role he has held
since 2016. During this period, he has overseen the steady progress of the operating companies in that region
as well as the significant commercial and strategic strides made in some if its markets. This includes the
development of mobile financial services which is an important driver of our medium to long-term growth
strategy. Mr Toriola has held a number of senior operational roles since joining the MTN Group, including CEO
of MTN Cameroon and Chief Technical Officer for Nigeria, and also serves on the boards of a number of its
subsidiary companies, including MTN Nigeria.

Mr Moolman will exit his current role as MTN Nigeria’s CEO with effect from 1 March 2021 and assume a new
role as MTN Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO). Mr Moolman joined MTN Nigeria, first as CFO in 2014 and became
CEO in 2015. Under his leadership, significant progress has been made in stabilising the business and setting it
on a sustainable growth path. He will remain on the Board of MTN Nigeria in his new role as the MTN GCRO.

Outlook
Despite the relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, the operating environment remains challenging. We will
continue to build on our operational and financial resilience and execute on our strategy to position the business
for sustained growth over the medium and long term. The availability of foreign exchange remains a constraint
even as we strive to minimise its impact on the business.

In the remaining quarter of 2020, we will build on the momentum from Q3 to further expand 4G coverage and
broaden rural connectivity. This, backed by our revamped acquisition offers, will help to boost subscriber
acquisition as well as support the continued growth in voice and data revenue.

For our digital business, we will focus on growing the active base and building partnerships with digital content
providers to stimulate increased adoption and usage of our services. Progress in our MoMo business remains on
track as we continue to expand the agent network and financial service offerings to drive adoption.

While the exchange rate impact on our lease rental costs continues to put downward pressure on EBITDA margin
into Q4, we will continue to drive service revenue growth and optimise our balance sheet to unlock efficiency
and support margins.

Iran. He has spent the past five years as the CEO of MTN Nigeria and during that time, significant
progress has been made in stabilizing the business and setting it on a sustainable growth path.

The management of enterprise-wide risk is integral to MTN’s growth strategy and Ferdi will bring
extensive operational and financial experience to the role given his deep knowledge of the Group, its
markets and the telecoms sector. As such, this appointment establishes the role of a chief risk officer

MTN is pleased to announce the appointment of Karl Toriola as the MTN Nigeria CEO, effective

companies (“OpCo’s”) in the region, notably the turnaround of MTN Ivory Coast and MTN Cameroon
over the past two years.

In addition, the WECA markets have made significant commercial and strategic strides, including the
improvement of market shares within the region and the development of mobile financial services,
which is an important driver of the Group’s medium to long-term growth strategy.

Karl (48) has also held a number of senior operational roles at MTN, since joining the Group in 2006,
including Chief Technical Officer of MTN Nigeria and CEO of MTN Cameroon. He is also a board

treatment of foreign currency translation reserves (“FCTR”)

In its trading statement dated 31 July 2020, and its interim financial results released on 6 August 2020, MTN
communicated a voluntary change in accounting policy relating to the treatment of FCTR. IAS 21 - The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, requires that, on the disposal of a foreign business operation, the cumulative
amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign business operation recognised in equity on the
statement of financial position over time, shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification
adjustment when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

MTN is hosting a workshop for sell-side analysts to discuss the principles and implications of this above-mentioned
voluntary change in accounting policy on the Group financial statements. The briefing will be held via a
teleconference today, 13 August 2020.

Condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended
30 June 2020

MTN is an emerging market mobile operator with a clear vision to lead the delivery of
a bold, new digital world to our 262 million subscribers across 21 operations. We are
inspired by our belief that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.


Highlights
-   Subscribers increased by 10,6 million to 261,5 million
-   Group service revenue grew by 9,4%*
-   EBITDA margin improved by 6,4pp to 49,7% (up 1,2pp* to 43,1%*)

    increased to 2,7x
-   Return on equity (ROE) improved to 14,1%
-   No interim dividend declared due to uncertainties resulting from COVID-19
    impacts

-   Future focus on pan-African strategy, orderly exit of Middle Eastern assets
    announced


* Constant currency information after accounting for the impact of the pro forma adjustments as defined.
- EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income and finance costs (which includes gains or losses
on foreign exchange transactions), tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented before
recognising the following items: impairment of goodwill and joint ventures; net monetary gain resulting
from the application of hyperinflation; share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax;
hyperinflation; gain on disposal of tower associates; impairment loss on remeasurement of disposal
group; and gain on disposal/dilution of investment in associates and joint ventures (Travelstart and
Jumia). EBITDA including once-off items increased 33,1%
ROE is calculated based on reported group HEPS of 430 cps after adjusting for non-operational impacts
of 46 cps

                                                                                                      
Any forward-looking financial information disclosed in this results announcement has not been reviewed
or audited or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

                                                                                                    
Certain information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. The
responsibility for preparing and presenting the pro forma financial information and for the
completeness and accuracy of the pro forma financial information is that of the directors of the
company. This is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial
information may not fairly present MTN’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations
or cash flows. It has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

Certain financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared
excluding the impact of hyperinflation, impairments of goodwill; PP&E and associates, gain on disposal
of tower associates; impairment loss on remeasurement of disposal group, the Nigerian regulatory
fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered into and the finance
costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting of the liability), gain on dilution of
Jumia, impairment of investment in MEIH, impairment of Iran receivable, gain on Travelstart disposal
and impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (the pro forma adjustments) and constitutes pro forma financial
information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the reviewed
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2020. This pro
forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments
from the consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable (YoY) analysis. The pro forma
adjustments have been calculated in terms of the group accounting policies which are consistent with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for the changes in accounting policies as a
result of the adoption of the accounting standards effective 1 January 2019 and the voluntary change
in policy relating to the treatment of foreign currency translation reserves (FCTR).

IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (IAS 21) requires that on the disposal of a
foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign
operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FCTR in equity, shall be
reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the gain or loss on
disposal is recognised. Two accepted methods exist for recycling FCTR where the investments in
foreign operations are held by an intermediate parent with a different functional currency than the
entity disposed of and the ultimate parent, the step-by-step approach and the direct approach. The
group has accordingly changed its accounting policy on the reclassification of FCTR on disposal of
foreign operations held by an intermediate parent where the functional currency of the foreign
operation and intermediate parent is different to that of the ultimate parent from the step-by-step
method to the direct method.

Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates
on the group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the prior financial
reporting period’s results have been adjusted to the current period average exchange rates determined
as the weighted average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each
of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant
currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results
compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South
Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of
hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary
for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors and represents only a summary of
the information contained in the full interim financial results. Consequently, it does not contain full or

The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa,
Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA)
region and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-
equity accounted), eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region
includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau.
The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

Although Iran, Botswana and eSwatini form part of their respective regions geographically and
operationally, they are excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity
accounted for by the group.

                                                                                                      
Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:


“MTN delivered strong results for the period against the backdrop of difficult trading
conditions, exacerbated by the unprecedented socio and macroeconomic challenges
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With service revenue growth of 9,4%* and EBITDA
growth of 10,9%*, the group’s EBITDA margin improved by 1,2pp* to 43,1%* as our
group efficiency programme continued to bear fruit. Group leverage remained stable
at a group net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.1x. The holding company (holdco) leverage
ratio increased to 2,7x from 2,2x at December 2019, impacted by the weaker rand and
lower upstreaming from operating companies. We invested R10,1 billion in our
networks, focussing on capacity and resilience as COVID-19 lockdown constraints
impacted network rollout.

Amongst the larger opco’s, MTN Ghana delivered another strong performance in H1,
while MTN Nigeria achieved continued solid growth in a challenging environment. MTN
South Africa (MTN SA) reported a pleasing turnaround in its underlying consumer and
enterprise business units as well as an expansion in EBITDA margin.

Commercial momentum continued, and we added 10,6 million subscribers to reach a
total base of 261,5 million and reached a significant milestone in surpassing the 100
million mark of active data users. We recorded 38,3 million MoMo users and in Nigeria
added 114 000 agents to reach 222 000 registered agents. Following the peak impact
of COVID-19 effects in April 2020, we are encouraged by the sequential recovery we
have observed in key voice, data and fintech trends as restrictions have been
gradually eased.

As we navigate the pandemic and its effects, we have prioritised looking after our
people, customers and networks while focusing on efficiencies. Work from home
programmes continue for our people; our Y’ello Hope Packages are helping to ease
customers’ financial pressures and we continue to support various other initiatives
across our markets to limit the impact of the pandemic on society as a whole.

Our balance sheet and liquidity remain resilient despite the challenging environment
and was supported by strong operating free cash flows, which increased by 117,8%.
Given the significant uncertainties in our operating environment brought about by
COVID-19 we have resolved not to declare an interim dividend for 2020. Should
conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390c per share,
aligned to the current dividend policy.

MTN has resolved to simplify its portfolio and focus on its pan-African strategy and
will therefore be exiting its Middle Eastern assets in an orderly manner over the
medium-term. As a first step we are in advanced discussions to sell our 75% stake in
MTN Syria.”


                                                                                    
Service revenue
Group service revenue increased by 9,4%* to R80,2 billion (2019: R67,9 billion). This
was led by growth of 12,4%* in MTN Nigeria and 19,4%* in MTN Ghana. MTN SA
recorded a 2.5% decline in service revenue, as a result of the lost national roaming
revenues arising from the discontinuation of our roaming agreement with Telkom
and effects of the continued accounting for Cell C revenue on a cash basis. The
continued turnaround in MTN SA’s consumer and enterprise businesses has however
supported a pleasing improvement in sequential service revenue growth trend in the
second quarter.

EPS
Basic earnings per share, which includes the gain on disposal of our tower
associates, increased by 165,4% to 674 cents from 254 cents (June 2019), supported
by the weaker rand, an overall healthier operational performance as well as an
improved contribution of share of profits from JVs and associates.

HEPS
Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 120,5% to 430 cents from
195 cents in June 2019. HEPS were positively impacted in aggregate by 46 cents from
the following items: 0 cents relating to the Nigeria fine interest (-8 cents in 2019);
hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of 10 cents (-8 cents in 2019); the impact of
foreign exchange gains and losses of 28 cents (-39 cents in 2019) and reversal of the
time value loss recognised on the Iran receivable of 8 cents (0 cents in 2019).




                                                                                    
Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme
Our asset realisation programme (ARP), launched in March 2019 and enhanced in
March 2020, aims to reduce debt, simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns
and realise capital of at least a further R25 billion over three to five years.

Interco B.V. and Uganda Tower Interco B.V to AT Sher Netherlands Cooperatief U.A.,
and received cash proceeds of US$524 million. This completed the first phase of our
ARP, with the full cR15 billion of the initial three-year plan realised within the first 12
months.

The COVID-19 pandemic and flux in global oil prices has brought about extraordinary
macroeconomic uncertainty and major volatility in financial markets. This has
impacted our ability to continue with further realisations in the short-term. We remain
committed to execute on the ARP over the medium-term and have made significant
progress in laying the groundwork for when conditions become more conducive.

Our 20% shareholding in the carrier business Belgacom International Carrier
Services SA (BICS) is included in those assets classified as not long-term strategic.
MTN and its co-shareholders in BICS are in discussions regarding a potential sale of
a controlling stake in the business. BICS has accordingly been classified as a non-
current asset held for sale on 5 August 2020. At 30 June 2020, the carrying amount
of the investment in associate was R2,3 billion and the accumulated FCTR gain
related to BICS was R1,4 billion.

MTN to focus on its pan-African strategy
As part of the review of our portfolio, we believe the group is best served to focus on
its pan-African strategy and to simplify its portfolio by exiting the Middle East region
in an orderly manner over the medium-term. The Middle East assets contributed less
than 4% to group EBITDA in H1.

As part of this process we are in advanced discussions to sell our 75% stake in MTN
Syria to TeleInvest, which is the minority shareholder in MTN Syria with a 25% holding.

MTN Syria contributed 0,7% to MTN’s reported EBITDA in H1 2020. The net assets
attributable to MTN Syria in the MTN Group accounts have been written down to the
estimated recoverable amount of R1,4 billion (US$80 million). The foreign currency
translation loss of R4,8 billion as at 30 June 2020, that has accumulated over time,
will be released to the income statement on conclusion of the transaction. This will
negatively impact EPS, but will have no material impact on HEPS, cash flow and the
balance sheet.

                                                                                         
Capital allocation priorities and suspension of interim dividend
We are committed to a disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritises the
deployment of our resources to growth, supported by investment in our network;
reduction of debt and management of our funding mix and liquidity; and dividend
growth.

We are pleased with the performance and resilience of our networks, which have ably
sustained the explosion of growth in traffic, not only during the recent COVID-19
crisis, but over the past few years as we have connected more users. Our financial
position continues on a steady path of improvement and optimisation and, as
mentioned, places the group well to navigate the prevailing volatility.

We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our financial position and
maintaining a healthy liquidity position. As announced in our trading statement dated
31 July 2020, in order to sustain this progress, and in line with our capital allocation
framework, the board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend (2019:
195cps) in the context of the COVID-19 impacts and the material uncertainties these
present. Should conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390
cents per share, aligned to the current dividend policy. The key factors to consider
will include the general macro-economic environment, the status of cash
upstreaming from operating companies and the outlook for the holding company
leverage ratio.

                                                                                      
Prospects and guidance
Well positioned to deliver growth
The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant volatility and
uncertainty across our markets, placing unprecedented pressure on the various
economies and affecting the daily lives of our people, customers and other
stakeholders.

The operational performance of our portfolio in H1 has demonstrated the resilience
and agility of the MTN business model, as well as our operations’ ability to sustain
growth in challenging circumstances as our products and services are fundamental
to the people and economies of our markets. This lies at the heart of MTN’s digital
operator strategy. While we expect the remainder of the year to be shaped by the
ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we believe that MTN will remain
comparatively resilient in the current environment and is well-placed to sustain its
growth over the medium-term.

As we weather the prevailing storm, focusing on managing the risks brought about
by COVID-19, through strict cost-control measures and enhanced oversight of
expenditure, we are also alive to the opportunities the pandemic has presented,
particularly the accelerated need for digitisation. This was embodied in the strong H1
performance of our data, digital and fintech growth curves as the impacts of COVID-
19 took hold.

As we continue building a digital operator, we are well-positioned to further unlock
this opportunity over time, on the foundation of our strong position in high-growth
markets where the populations are youthful and fast-growing. The opportunity to
increase the adoption and usage of our data, digital and fintech services over the
medium to long-term remains substantial.

We are pleased with the turnaround in the core consumer and enterprise businesses
in MTN SA against a challenging macro environment. Whilst COVID-19 impacts will
present ongoing headwinds in the second half of the year we are pleased with the
work done to build the operational resilience of MTN SA and believe it is well-
positioned to navigate the volatility.

In Nigeria, we will continue to invest in our network and ramp up the rollout of 4G,
which was slowed down by the impact of COVID-19 during H1. The increased
adoption and growth in usage of data remains a key priority to drive further data
revenue growth. We remain committed to expanding our fintech and digital service
offerings, as we continue to expand our MoMo agent network with the conversion of
our existing airtime agents into MoMo agents and broaden our service offerings. We
remain on track to achieve our agent network target of 300,000 by year-end.

                                                                                    
We will further strengthen and grow our digital offerings. The work is ongoing to scale
Ayoba and build on the progress already achieved in increasing conversion and
retention rates, as well as engagement on the channel which is gaining some traction.
In the broader digital business, advancements continue in broadening the
accessibility of services for our customers and stimulating increased engagement.


Medium-term guidance
We remain committed to delivering on our guidance framework over the medium-
term (3 to 5 years), although, as mentioned, we expect the remainder of the year to
be challenging. Within this context, we maintain our medium-term target of double-
digit growth in group service revenue in constant currency terms; double-digit
growth in MTN Nigeria’s service revenue and mid-single-digit growth in service
revenue from MTN South Africa.

We expect to continue to improve our group EBITDA margin through the execution of
our group efficiency programme and to deliver on our ROE target.

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an
increasing revenue contribution from our digital businesses, we expect the group
capex intensity to improve steadily over the medium term on an IFRS reported basis.

We aim to secure at least a further R25 billion in asset realisations over the medium-
term. This is within the context of our localisation ambitions, MTN’s portfolio of assets
that have been identified as not long-term strategic and market conditions being
conducive. Our holdco leverage ratio target over the medium-term is ‘below 2,0x’ and
we remain focused on delivering on our capital allocation priorities.

We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our financial position, and we
maintain a healthy liquidity position. As mentioned, in order to sustain this,
particularly in context of COVID-19 impacts and the material uncertainty these
present, the board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend. Should
conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390c per share,
aligned to the current dividend policy.

In light of the ongoing assessment of our networks and the disruptions in supply
chain and challenges in rolling out coverage in the current COVID-19 environment,
we revise our guidance for capex in 2020 to at least R24,0 billion – this is up from the
guidance of R22,0 billion provided in our Q1 2020 trading update.

MTN Group Limited
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
(Registration number 1994/009584/06)
(Share code MTN)
(ISIN: ZAE000042164)
(“MTN” or “the Company” or “the Group”)

Trading statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the six months ended 30 June 2020. These
will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Ltd. (""SENS"") on or about Thursday,
6 August 2020.

Following the trading statement published on Friday, 24 July 2020, shareholders are further advised
that MTN expects to report growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) of between 160% and 170% (or
406 cents to 432 cents). Considering the restated EPS of 254 cents for the corresponding six-month
period ended 30 June 2019 (restatement explained further below), this translates into a range of 660
cents to 686 cents for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020.

EPS includes the benefit from gains amounting to 341 cents on the disposal of the ATC Uganda and
ATC Ghana tower joint ventures as announced in March 2020 (2019: includes 74 cents benefit from
gains on disposal).

Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) growth is expected to be between 115% and 125% (or 224 cents
to 244 cents). Considering the HEPS of 195 cents for the corresponding six-month period ended 30
June 2019, this translates into a range of 419 cents to 439 cents.

HEPS benefited from non-operational items for the six months ended 30 June 2020 totalling
approximately 46 cents per share (June 2019: 55 cents negative impact on HEPS) of which more than
half related to foreign exchange gains.

The Group has implemented a voluntary accounting policy change relating to the treatment of foreign
currency translation reserves (“FCTR”). IAS 21 requires that, on the disposal of a foreign operation,
the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in
equity on the balance sheet over time, shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a
reclassification adjustment when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised. In this regard, the Group
has changed its accounting policy on the calculation of this reclassification of FCTR from the step-by-
step method to the direct method, which provides a more reliable and relevant view of the gain or
loss realised in the context of the Group’s functional currency.

This change in accounting policy impacted the FCTR gain reclassified to profit in the current period on
the disposal of the Group’s investments in the ATC Uganda and ATC Ghana tower joint ventures. The
impact of the change in policy on EPS is an increase of 47 cents (2019: 7 cents, resulting in a
restatement of the 2019 EPS). The change in accounting policy had no impact on HEPS in the current
or prior comparative period.

Dividend update

MTN has made meaningful progress in strengthening its financial position and maintaining a healthy
liquidity position. In order to sustain this, and in line with MTN’s capital allocation framework, the
board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend in the context of the COVID-19 impacts and
the material uncertainties these present. Should conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no
more than 390 cents per share, aligned to the current dividend policy. The key factors to consider will
include the general macro-economic environment, the status of cash upstreaming from operating
companies and the outlook for the holding company leverage ratio.

MTN succession process on track

The succession process for the MTN Group CEO role is on track and MTN expects to make an
announcement in this regard in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Current Group CEO Rob Shuter will complete
his fixed four-year contract in March 2021 as announced earlier this year and this timing will enable a
seamless handover to his successor.

MTN notes the announcement issued today by BT Group Plc that Rob has been appointed as the CEO
of BT Enterprise. Rob will relocate to the UK and start with BT Group Plc in 2021 after finishing at MTN.
MTN thanks Rob for his contribution over the years and wishes him well in his new endeavours.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

Commentary
MTN Ghana delivered a robust performance for the period, despite macroeconomic challenges
following the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Service revenue increased by 19.3%,
underpinned by strong growth in voice, data, Mobile Money and digital revenue.

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 14.1%) was driven by a 4.1% increase in the number of active
subscribers* as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage
churn and improve usage. The contribution of voice to total service revenue declined from 45.4% to
43.3%, as other lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional business in line with our
revenue diversification objective.

Strong data revenue growth (up 21.7%) was attributable to the increase in active data users# (+5.2%),
continued growth in the number of smartphones on the network (+4.2%) and a general increase in
demand and usage. Data revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased marginally from 28.0%
to 28.5%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to show strong growth (up 24.9%) and benefited from an increase
in the number of active subscribers* (+5.1%), growth in person-to-person (P2P) transactional activity
and broader penetration of more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and
international remittances. Mobile Money revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from
18.3% to 19.2%.

Digital revenue was robust, growing by 27.7% on the back of a 44.5% increase in the number of active
subscribers* to 2.2 million. This performance was supported by the expansion of our digital portfolio
including new gaming offerings, the renewal of our MyMTN app and the launch of Ayoba messaging
app, which allows non-smartphone users to communicate with smartphone users on the app. Digital
revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from 4.0% to 4.3%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 29.1%, with an EBITDA
margin expansion of 4.1 percentage points (pp) to 53.6%. This margin improvement was a result of
our cost efficiency initiatives, underpinned by continued distribution efficiencies.

Our growth in revenue, coupled with our cost efficiency initiatives, resulted in a strong growth
(+52.3%) in profit after tax.


Due to ongoing discussions on the potential change in regulatory subscriber definitions, subscriber data in this report will be limited to the MTN Group definition until the regulatory
definitions are finalized.

* Aligned with the MTN Group definition, subscribers are SIMs which generate or participate in an event that generates revenue for MTN Ghana.
# Active data subscribers as per MTN Group definition are data subscribers who have used more than 5MB in a month.
^ Capex under IFRS 16 is made up of core capex spend of GH¢301.2m, intangibles of GH¢404.3m (Network license, Software, etc) and right of use (RoU) assets of GH¢10.1m for the period.




Commentary (continued)

MTN Ghana continues to prioritize its investments in infrastructure expansion and have invested
GH¢715.6 million in capex^ to date (2019 capex: GH¢803.1 million) supporting significant
improvement in network coverage, customer experience and quality of service (QoS). As part of the
network expansion and quality of service improvement, we rolled out 11 2G and 11 3G sites; and
upgraded 300 LTE 2600MHz sites. Our continued belief in the Ghana market and our significant
investments in capex of US$470 million over the past 3 years has led to improvement in customer
experience and sustained subscriber growth.

MTN accepted and signed a GH¢450 million, five-year medium-term financing arrangement – out of a
total offer of GH¢816 million received, with seven local lenders to support the renewal of our 2G
license and the acquisition of additional spectrum. We maintained a strong balance sheet, managing
it in line with existing banking covenants.

COVID-19

COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business performance through the second quarter despite
the easing of restrictions that had been imposed by the President of the Republic of Ghana from 15
March 2020 through to 01 June 2020. As a business, we continued to experience delays in supply
chain, as well as the overall effects of the economic slowdown on our manufacturing and hospitality
customers plus a general decline in activity for our SME customers.

In our continued support of the fight against COVID-19, MobileMoney Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Scancom PLC, extended the free offer for all Mobile Money P2P transfers up to GH¢100
per day including increased limits on daily transactions and wallet balances to the end of September
2020. We were pleased to receive approval from the Bank of Ghana for our voluntary request to
extend the free P2P transfers offer. This offer will save customers an estimated GH¢60 million to
GH¢70 million in transaction fees while promoting the safety of Ghanaians and deepening financial
inclusion.

The MTN Ghana Foundation committed to Government, GH¢5 million worth of personal protective
equipment (PPE) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff and government in the fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic. Internally, we have deployed PPEs and sanitizers across our branch
network and implemented extended safety measures for our people at an estimated cost of GH¢22
million.

MTN Ghana has also supported Government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic by providing
free access to over 200 websites for online education for public and private institutions. This effort
has supported over 4.5 million students and teachers, who have consumed over 150 Terabytes at a
cost of over GH¢3 million as at the end of June 2020. In addition, MTN Ghana has also provided
GH¢10,000 worth of free data to all its 200 university students on its MTN Bright Scholarship scheme.

Commentary (continued)

We remain focused on our people, customers, network resilience and efficiency in delivering on our
quest to make the lives of our customers a whole lot BRIGHTer in these uncertain times.

In June, the National Communications Authority (NCA) classified MTN Ghana as a significant market
power (SMP) meaning that special regulatory restrictions would be enforced on MTN Ghana, to
potentially limit the company’s growth, performance, innovativeness and its competitiveness in the
telecoms market.

Broadly, the NCA has proposed measures that include the application of a 30% asymmetrical
interconnect rate for two years; a price floor/ceiling on voice, data, SMS and Mobile Money; the
review and approval of all MTN pricing by the NCA; the removal of on-net/off-net price differentials;
and the implementation of a national roaming scheme.

MTN Ghana acknowledges the NCA’s duty and powers to promote fair competition amongst licensed
operators in Ghana’s telecommunications sector, however, the manner of the recent declaration of
MTN as an SMP raises concerns about clear procedural breaches and substantive issues. After
engaging and sharing our views on the matter with regulatory and other stakeholders, and after
further consultations, MTN Ghana has made the difficult decision, and as a last resort, to resort to the
law courts for redress in the form of a judicial review of the NCA’s decision, to ensure the observance
of the requirements of procedural fairness. We remain open to dialogue to achieve an amicable
resolution to this matter.

MTN Ghana is an ethical business committed to its regulatory obligations and would like to reassure
Government and its cherished shareholders and customers that our commitment to the delivery of a
bold new digital world in Ghana continues to be paramount and that the company remains focused
on providing the enabling technology to support Ghana’s digital economy particularly during the
Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.

Annual General Meeting and 2019 Final Dividend

Notice has been served of the annual general meeting of Scancom PLC which will be held virtually and
streamed live from MTN Ghana’s head office at MTN House in Accra on the 13 August 2020 at 11am
Ghana time. Amongst the business for the day will be the approval of the 2019 final dividend of 4
pesewas which will be paid on 28 August 2020 following shareholder approval.

Outlook

Following a strong overall performance in the first half of the year, we are cautious of the uncertainties
surrounding the likely duration and related economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the rest
of the year. The potential areas of impact and focus remain our employee and customers’ safety;
regulatory risk; supply chain delays and availability; liquidity, currency and counterparty risks
management; and the potential revenue impact from reduced consumer spend.

We remain focused on our journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an
emerging digital operator, with 2020 being the ‘Year of the customer: the digital experience’ with
focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value for our
shareholders.

MTN NIGERIA RELEASES UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Shareholders are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria), one of Africa’s largest
providers of communications services, which has a clear vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new
digital world, today, announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2020.

Salient features:

    •   Mobile subscribers increased by 6.8 million to 71.1 million
    •   Active data users increased by 3.8 million to 29.0 million
    •   Service revenue increased by 12.6% to NGN637.0 billion
    •   Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 8.2% to
        N327.1 billion
    •   EBITDA margin declined by 2.0 pp to 51.3%
    •   Profit before tax (PBT) declined by 2.0% to N139.6 billion
    •   Earnings per share (EPS) declined by 4.7% to N4.66kobo
    •   Interim dividend per share of N3.50 kobo

Unless otherwise stated, financial information is year-on-year (YoY, H1 2020 versus H1 2019) and non-
financial information is year-to-date (June 2020 versus December 2019).

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

“Following a strong first quarter, we experienced a challenging operating environment in the second
quarter characterised by COVID-19 induced lockdowns and the broader macro-economic impact it has
had. Despite this, we have maintained double-digit service revenue growth of 12.6% for H1, driven by
strong growth in our key revenue lines.

Data revenue rose by 57.6% supported by an increase in data users and traffic. Revenue from digital
and fintech services rose by 121.8% and 29.6% respectively, while voice revenue growth was 2.8%
amidst a change in traffic pattern following the lockdowns. However, costs also increased leading to
an overall decline in profit before tax and earnings per share.



In the first half of the year, we achieved 6.8 million in net additions, to connect over 71.1 million
customers to our network. We also connected 3.8 million new users to the internet, bringing our active
data subscribers to 29 million. Our MoMo subscribers increased by 1.6 million to 2.2 million, the
majority of which were in Q2. We prioritised the upgrade of our network capacity to accommodate
growth in traffic, while continuing to expand 4G network coverage, albeit at a slower pace given the
constraints presented by COVID-19.

As part of several initiatives under our Y’ello Hope Package launched in Q1, we offered our subscribers
free SMS targeted at providing value to the vulnerable in the society. It is pleasing that 75% of our
subscribers benefitted, sending over 4.3 billion messages through the SMS platform. We also offered
free money transfers using the MoMo Agent Network with over 100,000 customers utilising the
service.

During the period, we changed the accounting treatment of the Value Added Tax (VAT) component of
our lease payments resulting in some impact on margins. In addition to this, the combined effect of
the foreign exchange rate adjustments, the 2.5% increase in value-added tax and the associated costs
of COVID-19 initiatives have impacted margins. As a result, growth in EBITDA was 8.2% in H1, while
EBITDA margin declined by 2.0pp to 51.3% and profit before tax and EPS declined by 2.0% and 4.7%,
respectively.

In line with our dividend policy, the Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend of N3.50 kobo
per share to be paid out of distributable net income.”

COVID-19 Impact

Our response to the global pandemic and its impact was focused in four broad areas, namely social,
commercial, network and supply chain as well as funding and liquidity considerations.

In terms of the social impact, health concerns, along with the restriction on movement and lockdown
of certain parts of the economy, impacted our peoples’ working routine. To address this, we
implemented work from home initiatives to ensure business continuity. We also intensified health and
safety measures, including the increased use of personal protective equipment and hand sanitisers to
preserve the wellbeing of our staff.

Through various contributions and initiatives, we supported our customers, communities and
government in the transition through this unique situation. This includes support for the Federal
Inland Revenue Services’ (FIRS) revenue acceleration efforts with an early payment of our taxes ahead
of established deadlines.



We launched a free SMS initiative in early April targeted at the low-income mass market, which
concluded at the end of June, with more than 4.3 billion free SMS’s sent by more than 53 million
customers. Customers used more than 3,000TB of free data to access zero-rated healthcare websites.
We have now expanded this initiative to include a range of education platforms endorsed by Nigerian
federal and state governments. This is in addition to the N1 billion donation we have made to the
Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), the N250 million of personal protective equipment (PPE)
delivered to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) through MTN Nigeria Foundation, and the
logistical and communications support provided to the Nigerian Governors Forum, NCDC and State
Governments.

From a commercial perspective, demand for data and digital services grew significantly, but we saw a
decline in demand for voice services as our customer base, especially in the mass market segment,
our largest, was impacted by the economic constraints caused by lockdowns in the country. The
acceleration in data and digital revenue only partially offset the decline in voice revenue. As lockdown
restrictions have eased, we have seen an encouraging recovery in voice revenue.

With regards to our network and supply chain, the movement restrictions and scarcity of foreign
exchange affected site rollout. We have mitigated these effects through building up inventories of
critical spares as well as closer control and management of our supply chain.

Our funding and liquidity remain well-managed, supported by strong cash flows and approved
headroom facilities. Our headroom to leverage is comfortably within banking covenants and are able
to meet our operational, investment and financial requirements and obligations. Our foreign currency
exposure is within manageable limits, with 95% of our debt in local currency, so that our balance sheet
can withstand currency volatility.

Further impacts of COVID-19 are very uncertain and will depend on the evolution of the virus
throughout the remainder of the year, any reinstatement or intensification of lockdowns and any
other economic impacts caused by the global situation. However, we remain confident in the
resilience of the business, and the ability of our employees to adapt as the situation develops.

Trading statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and, in
accordance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements paragraph 3.4(b)(iii)(3), provides this trading
statement on its results which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE
Limited (""SENS"") on or about Thursday, 6 August 2020. The JSE Listings Requirements specify that
issuers must publish a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least
20% from the financial results for the previous corresponding period.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised that MTN expects to report an increase in earnings per share
(“EPS”) of at least 345 cents or 140%, representing EPS of greater than 592 cents for the six months
ended 30 June 2020, compared with EPS of 247 cents for the corresponding six-month period ended
30 June 2019.

Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) is expected to be at least 195 cents or 100% higher, representing
HEPS of greater than 390 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared with HEPS of 195
cents for the corresponding six-month period ended 30 June 2019.

EPS includes the benefit from gains amounting to 341 cents on the disposal of the ATC Uganda and
ATC Ghana tower joint ventures as announced in March 2020. HEPS benefited from non-operational
items for the six months ended 30 June 2020 totalling approximately 50 cents per share (June 2019:
55 cents negative impact on HEPS) of which more than half related to foreign exchange gains.

MTN will provide a further update on the expected EPS and HEPS growth ranges once it has reasonable
certainty of such ranges.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

MTN Nigeria Communications Plc and Global Independent Connect Limited, INT Towers Limited, IHS
(Nigeria) Limited and IHS Towers NG Limited, Nigerian affiliates of IHS Holding Limited amend
service agreement

Shareholders are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications PLC (MTN Nigeria) and Global
Independent Connect Limited, INT Towers Limited, IHS (Nigeria) Limited and IHS Towers NG Limited,
the affiliates of IHS Holding Limited (together, IHS) have reached an agreement to expand the scope
of their current service agreement, and amend the currency conversion provision for tower services.

In 2014, MTN Nigeria took a strategic decision to sell its passive infrastructure (including towers) and
focus on its core business. Although MTN Nigeria retains a small number of towers, it currently has
agreements in place with a number of tower providers across the country, including IHS.

MTN Nigeria leases the majority of the tower/site space required for its network equipment from IHS
and has concluded a renegotiation of certain terms of its tower rental agreements. These include an
increased focus on rural connectivity and fibre deployment. Furthermore, the changes will result in
improved cost for future technology evolution and backhaul in the network, which will bear fruit in
the longer term, whilst agreeing to move the reference rates for conversions to Naira from the Central
Bank of Nigeria's official rate (CBN) to the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate (NAFEX).

This change in reference rate currently at N360 (CBN) to N385 (NAFEX) reduces the EBITDA margin in
2020 by approximately 0.4pp on an IFRS16 basis. This is however offset over time by the improved
pricing and increased focus on rural connectivity and backhaul in the network. MTN Nigeria will
continue to focus on operational efficiencies to further mitigate these impacts.

Commenting on the agreements, MTN Nigeria’s CEO Ferdi Moolman said: “We are pleased to have
agreed a mutually beneficial update to our agreements with IHS. These changes provide clarity for
both parties on foreign exchange denomination with Naira payments, while also extending our
relationship into key new areas. I am particularly excited about the partnership to expand fibre
connectivity and deliver accelerated rural telephony. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the
huge importance of digital infrastructure, and these agreements enable us to enhance fibre networks,
while rapidly connecting those Nigerians in rural areas who are currently unable to access
telecommunications services.

MTN Group Limited-Credit Rating Review by S&P Global(“S&P”)

Noteholders are advised that on 12 May 2020, S&P took rating
actions on corporate issuers exposed to South Africa.

S&P lowered MTN Group and the Issuer’s long-term credit rating
to 'BB-' from 'BB' with a stable outlook.

S&P stated that the rating on the Company was constrained by
the foreign currency ratings on South Africa and Nigeria.

S&P’s rationale for the rating review was that in South Africa
they expect pressures on the consumer and wholesale businesses
with recovery expected beyond fiscal 2020 and further that for
MTN’s Nigerian business, oil exposure in the economy could lead
to lower affordability of mobile voice, data, and payments
services as well as possible margin pressure.

Furthermore, S&P believes that devaluation of the Nigerian naira
and higher value-added tax rates would likely place upward
pressure on the cost base and lower cash flow generation from
Nigeria.


Notwithstanding the above, S&P stated that they expect COVID-19
to have a moderate effect on the Company’s financial metrics,
given the heightened importance of telecommunications during
restricted mobility and expected voice and data demand to be
reasonably    well-supported,    although     lower    consumer
affordability and the impact of negative GDP growth on
enterprise customers cannot be discounted.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:

“The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy have brought about unprecedented
uncertainty, volatility and challenges which are impacting our markets at both the socio-economic and
macroeconomic levels. The impact of the pandemic on our quarter one performance was not
significant as lockdown restrictions for our consolidated subsidiaries were only implemented from the
last week of March 2020.

For the first quarter, MTN delivered a solid performance by increasing service revenue by 11,1% and
EBITDA by 15,6% with the EBITDA margin improving by 2,1pp to 43,2%, in line with our medium-term
targets.

MTN Nigeria and MTN Ghana generated strong double-digit service revenue growth and improving
EBITDA margins, contributing to the solid group performance.

MTN South Africa’s (MTN SA) performance was negatively impacted by the wholesale business, as we
continue to account for Cell C roaming revenue on a cash basis, as well as the loss of revenue from the
Telkom roaming agreement which came to an end in June 2019. We are encouraged by the
stabilisation of the consumer prepaid business which was affected by the implementation of the new
out-of-bundle data usage rules. Also pleasing was the continued progress in the enterprise business,
which recorded 8,2% service revenue growth.

The group recorded voice, data and fintech revenue growth of 6,3%, 26,4% and 26,0% respectively as
we continued to execute on our strategic objectives and progress toward becoming a digital operator.
Digital revenue has returned to growth, increasing by 15,6%.

We continued to build commercial momentum, adding 6,6 million subscribers in the quarter, with
active data users increasing by 2,9 million and MoMo subscribers by 0,4 million. We continued to scale
our Ayoba platform, recording 2,6 million monthly active users. We accelerated our MoMo agency
network in Nigeria under our super-agent licence, adding 70 000 agents in the first quarter and
bringing the total number of registered agents to 178 000.

In these difficult times we continue to focus on our key priorities: looking after our people, our
customers and our networks while we focus on efficiencies. For our people, the immediate priority is
their health and safety, where the work-from-home programmes across our markets empower our
staff to work remotely while ensuring continuity in our operations. For our customers, we have ramped
up our digital channels as a service alternative to enable them to continue purchasing airtime and
accessing our products and services seamlessly as well as launching Y’ello Hope Packages in most of
our markets. Our various initiatives support governments across our markets with communication
systems and connectivity as we do our part to help minimise the economic and social impact.

The COVID-19 situation is an evolving one and will undoubtedly affect the year ahead. Given the
uncertainties associated with the duration and economic impact of the pandemic, it is difficult to
reliably quantify the direct and indirect financial effects on the business at this early stage. The group
will continue to focus on business continuity and efficiency, and we have implemented strict measures
to preserve resources and strengthen our resilience.

We maintain our medium-term guidance and will update the market in the future of any changes in
that regard. The group remains committed to delivering on its strategy including delivering on our
asset realisation programme, which aims to simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and
realise capital of at least a further R25 billion over the medium-term.”


                                                                                                        
The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the Southern
and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted),
eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin,
Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity
accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

MTN South Africa
MTN SA has seen its prepaid business starting to recover, following the impact of regulation changes,
while the postpaid customer base saw an increase in net additions in challenging macro and
competitive environment. The revival in the enterprise business continued, with growth for a second
consecutive quarter. This progress validates the investment made in MTN SA’s leading network, which
once again won the Best in Test Award for the third successive year.

MTN SA recorded a slight increase in total subscribers (by 75 000 QoQ) to end the quarter with a
base of 29,0 million. Service revenue declined by 6,2% owing largely to a sharp reduction in
wholesale revenue resulting from the effects of a change to cash accounting for Cell C roaming
revenue and the loss of the Telkom roaming agreement. If we adjust the numbers by removing
national roaming (both Cell C and Telkom), then overall Q1 service revenue for MTN SA would have
been flat, highlighting the progress made in the underlying business. The momentum in overall data
revenue in MTN SA has also been pleasing and grew by 7.1%, supported by a 53% YoY increase in
traffic.

The overall first quarter performance was impacted by a challenging trading environment brought
about by weak macroeconomic conditions compounded by the global outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, currency depreciation and loadshedding.

The consumer prepaid business continued on its improving trajectory, with service revenue coming
in flat YoY, compared to a decline of 4,1% in 2019. The performance of the business remained affected
by the base effects of ICASA’s end-user subscriber regulations, with out-of-bundle (OOB) data revenue
still included in the first two months of the prior period before the new regulations took effect from 1
March 2019. There was encouraging momentum in prepaid data revenue, which increased by 3,3%
YoY. This was driven by a 31,0% increase in prepaid data traffic following a slight decline of 0,7% in
2019.

MTN SA made further progress in lowering churn and stabilising the quality of the prepaid base. In
2019, these interventions included the discontinuation of the loss-generating 1GB acquisition
promotion along with similar incentives in prepaid, which helped to drive distribution cost efficiencies.
The trajectory in net additions has stabilised and started to show a steady recovery over the past few
quarters, with a 0,1 million QoQ reduction in prepaid subscribers in Q1, to a closing base of around
22,7 million. MTN SA continues to focus on making data more affordable for its customers, which is
evident in the 21,0% YoY reduction in the effective prepaid data tariff.

The consumer postpaid business service revenue was flat YoY in a competitive market. The postpaid
subscriber base was also flat, reflective of the tight competitive environment and pressure on                                                                                                                        3
consumers due to tough economic conditions. The slower acquisition volumes were also a result of
stricter vetting rules aimed at reducing credit risk.

Wholesale revenue declined by 44,0% YoY. This resulted from our roaming agreement with Telkom
having concluded at the end of June 2019 as well as lower revenue recognised from Cell C due to the
ongoing cash basis of accounting.

For Cell C specifically, roaming revenue continued to be accounted for on a cash basis in line with
IFRS 15 and MTN SA recognised approximately R292 million in revenue during the quarter. At 31
March 2020, R450 million in Cell C revenue remained unrecognised. MTN SA commenced phase two
of the roaming agreement with Cell C, effective 1 May 2020.

The progress made in the enterprise business continued in Q1 2020, where growth was achieved for
the second consecutive quarter with service revenue up 8,2% YoY. The business continued to benefit
from interventions aimed at stabilising churn, adding new corporate customers and driving growth in
our ICT offering.

MTN SA’s EBITDA margin was 36,6%, a decrease of 2,2pp due to the factors mentioned above,
including the reduction in OOB data and national roaming revenue.

As part of the group-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic detailed later in this report, MTN SA
has implemented several initiatives to assist in reducing cash circulation and containing the spread of
COVID-19. The MTN MoMo app allows free person-to-person cash payments under R200, while a
number of electronic transfer and payment channels on our platforms will also be zero-rated. To
further ease the burden on consumers, MTN SA has also launched discounted social bundle prices to
MoMo users and waived in-app cash service fees.

For our communities, MTN has eased the COVID-19 disruption with digital innovations, including zero-
rated channels for the benefit of businesses, schoolchildren and families across South Africa. MTN SA
has also zero-rated USSD lines and other COVID-19 channels, including Ayoba, to report infections and
other critical information.

In aid of the Department of Basic Education academic recovery plan, MTN SA is supporting learners
by providing access to a number of e-learning platforms, which are zero-rated for all MTN customers.
The MTN Foundation has also contributed R3 million to sponsor students to have full access to a broad
range of learning materials.

The assistance in combating COVID-19 in South Africa extends to the Department of Health through
the supply of personal protective equipment including the delivery of more than 30 000 face masks
and 18 000 bottles of hand sanitisers to provincial health departments to date.


MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria followed the encouraging momentum achieved in Q4 2019 with another solid
performance in Q1 2020, where double-digit service revenue growth accelerated to 16,7% YoY,
supported by voice and data growth.

                                                                                                     
Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 7,4%, supported by subscriber growth. MTN Nigeria
continued to gain market share and added 4,2 million subscribers to its network to end the quarter at
68,5 million. This was underpinned by the deployment of additional subscriber registration devices,
while the continued implementation of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives also
helped to increased voice traffic.

Data revenue continued to accelerate with growth of 59,2% YoY. This was achieved through a higher
number of active data subscribers, which increased by 1,7 million to 26,8 million, as well as improved
4G penetration, which supported traffic growth of 130,4% YoY. Some 1,6 million new smartphones
joined the network, bringing smartphone penetration to 42,6% of the base.

The digital business returned to growth, with revenue increasing 63,7% supported by an improved
uptake of products within our portfolio of digital offerings and improvements in the customer journey
experience. During the quarter, we added 1,7 million new users, bringing the active base for digital
subscriptions to 3,8 million users.

Fintech revenue grew by 36,3% in Q1 2020, driven by an increase in the adoption of MTN Xtratime,
an airtime lending service. MTN Nigeria added 70 000 MoMo agents in the quarter, bringing the total
number of registered agents to 178 000 nationwide. As part of the Y’ello Hope Package, transaction
fees were suspended for all money transfers using the MoMo agent network for an initial period of
one month starting 23 March 2020.

The enterprise business segment continued to improve, with revenue growth of 12,7%.

EBITDA rose by 15,3% YoY, while the EBITDA margin moderated by 0,7pp to 52,7% due to the increase
in costs relating mainly to higher lease rentals following an aggressive 4G roll site rollout, as well as
once-off costs relating to litigation and value added tax (VAT) that was implemented during the period.

In terms of the agreements MTN Nigeria has with tower companies, a component of the payments
are quantified in foreign currency. The recent reset by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to a naira/US
dollar exchange rate of N360, from N305, will apply to the relevant contracts with effect from
1 April 2020 and will have an impact on MTN Nigeria margins going forward. MTN Nigeria is in
continued discussions with tower providers to optimise the terms of these long-term contracts.


Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
The SEAGHA region recorded solid service revenue growth of 21,2%, with all operations achieving
growth in Q1 2020. The region recorded a 1,5 million increase in subscribers to 50 million.

MTN Ghana was once again a key contributor to the region’s strong performance, with service
revenue up 20,6%, supported by voice and data growing in double digits as well as continued strong
growth in fintech revenue (up 31,6%). The EBITDA margin expansion achieved of 5,3pp, to 53,3%, was
supported by various cost efficiency initiatives including enhanced penetration of electronic
distribution channels, realigning the device strategy and optimising network costs.

                                                                                                       
MTN Uganda also delivered a solid performance with service revenue up 13,4%, driven by accelerated
growth in voice (up 9,5%), data (up 29,1%) and fintech revenue (up 15,2%). The EBITDA margin
declined 1,2pp to 48,5% because of higher provisions.

Overall, the SEAGHA portfolio excluding MTN Ghana delivered pleasing service revenue growth of
21,9% in the quarter.


West and Central Africa (WECA)
The WECA region delivered a solid performance. Service revenue grew by 9,8% YoY, significantly
above the blended average inflation of approximately 3,5% across the region. This performance was
enabled by improvements in fintech and data revenue and continued customer growth across the
markets of 0,4 million QoQ to 36,6 million.

MTN Ivory Coast delivered a 6,7% increase in service revenue, supported by growth in data (up 18,9%)
and fintech (up 11,6%). The EBITDA margin expanded by 4,9pp to 25,7%.

MTN Cameroon recorded service revenue growth of 8,7%, supported by double-digit growth in data
(up 22,6%) and fintech (up 50,4%), notwithstanding the continued challenging environment marked
by conflict in the Northwest/Southwest regions. The EBITDA margin for MTN Cameroon widened by
3,0pp to 32,8%.

Excluding MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast, the WECA markets grew their service revenue by an
aggregate of 12,9%, driven by double-digit service revenue growth in MTN Benin, MTN Conakry and
MTN Liberia.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
In a challenging operating environment, the MENA region achieved a pleasing performance in the
quarter, with service revenue up 24,0%, supported by solid growth in data revenue. Subscribers
(excluding MTN Irancell) were stable at 26,1 million.

MTN Syria grew service revenue by 20,7%, driven by growth in voice (up 8,3%) and data (up 19,8%).
The EBITDA margin improved by 6,5pp to 42,1%. MTN Sudan grew service revenue by 62,7%,
underpinned by growth in voice (up 47,6%) and data (up 92,3%) on the back of higher usage. The
EBITDA margin expanded by 3,8pp to 36,5%. MTN Afghanistan and MTN Yemen also delivered
growth, with service revenue up by 16,2% and 7,3% respectively.

MTN Irancell, our equity-accounted joint venture, delivered a solid performance despite its
challenging operating environment, the depreciation of the currency and the high rate of inflation.
MTN Irancell was the only operation to be significantly affected by COVID-19 during Q1, as Iran was
one of the countries experiencing the pandemic early on. Against this backdrop, service revenue grew
by 29,8%, with data revenue up by 43,5%, and the EBITDA margin improving by 1,8pp to 37,9%.

                                                                                                  
Regulatory and legal considerations

MTN Afghanistan anti-terrorism complaint
On 27 December 2019 a complaint for violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia (the Complaint). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009
and 2017, and on behalf of their families. The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses
supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure.
The defendants named in the Complaint are six different groups of affiliated companies, one of which
is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies, including MTN Afghanistan.

In late April 2020, MTN filed a “motion to dismiss” that asks the U.S. court to end the lawsuit and grant
a judgment in MTN’s favour for two independent reasons: because the court lacks jurisdiction over
MTN, which does not operate in the United States, and because the complaint does not allege any
conduct by MTN that would have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.

MTN remains of the view that it conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its
territories and will defend its position where necessary.

MTN South Africa Competition Commission inquiry
In March 2020 MTN SA announced the outcomes from its engagement with the Competition
Commission (CompCom) and its response to the Data Service Market Inquiry. The announcement set
out a range of voluntary solutions to deepen our ongoing drive to reduce the cost to communicate.
These focused on the affordability of monthly prepaid data bundles, the provision of lifeline data
access utilising the Ayoba app and the zero-rating of data for public benefit service websites.

In late April 2020, MTN SA concluded its consent agreement with the CompCom to regulate these
arrangements and the agreement has been submitted to the Competition Tribunal.

Spectrum temporary allocation and auction in South Africa
On 17 April 2020, ICASA released free emergency spectrum for use by operators during the national
state of disaster. The allocation of spectrum to MTN SA was: 40 MHz from the 700-800 MHz band, 50
MHz from the 2,6 GHz band and 50 MHz from the 3,5 GHz band. The temporary allocation is subject
to certain minimum obligations. MTN SA will be ready to make use of the additional spectrum
allocation within six weeks of it being issued, and we expect it to significantly ease the congestion in
hotspots across the country where data traffic has surged. The temporary spectrum will be available
for use until November 2020.

Uganda licence renewal
We have agreed with the authorities in Uganda to extend our licence in that market to June 2032, for
a consideration of US$100 million. We made an initial payment of US$50 million in March 2020 and
the final payment will be made on settlement of the detailed terms and conditions of the licence.


COVID-19 pandemic impact on the business

For MTN, the main considerations arising from the COVID-19 impact revolve around four areas                                                                                                       7
namely: social (our people and communities), commercial (including our customers), network and
supply chain as well as funding and liquidity. Our operating companies (opcos) have customised their
respective responses within this framework.

Social
Our immediate priority has been the health and safety of our people and playing our part in slowing
down the transmission of the virus. We initiated work-from-home programmes across our markets,
enabling our staff to work remotely while ensuring the continuity in our operations. Our daily health
monitor survey allows us to ascertain the wellbeing of our staff and their families and we have
increased our health and safety measures including the compulsory wearing of masks, as well as the
use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers and other personal protective equipment (PPE) across our offices,
branches and experience centres for use by customers and employees.

More broadly, in addition to our employees, our social response also focuses on our customers,
vulnerable groups, support of government efforts and participating in industry interventions. To this
end MTN Group has announced a R250 million relief package to be deployed in four areas. Firstly, we
established the MTN Global Staff Emergency Fund for employees impacted by the pandemic. The
relief fund has been launched in part through the contributions of MTN Group directors, executives
and staff. This includes a pledge from the chairman, group CEO, group CFO and a number of directors
to contribute 30% of their board fees and salaries for the second quarter.

Secondly, we have invested in Y’ello Hope Packages for customers. This includes free SMS services,
the waiving of fees for certain Mobile Money transactions, discounted calling during off-peak periods,
zero-rating of certain health, social services and educational sites and payment concessions to our
business customers.

Thirdly, the group will contribute towards the MTN Foundations across our markets, which have been
mobilised to reach those most vulnerable through contributions towards tackling health emergencies
to minimise the spread of COVID-19 (disease commodity packages and ICT services needed for health
ministries and health professionals) and enabling students to remain productive by accessing vital
school and university content. Finally, MTN will contribute R70 million to the government’s Solidarity
Fund in South Africa, the market of its birth.

Many of these initiatives are also being amplified at an opco level in our various markets.

Commercial
From March 2020, countries within our footprint implemented a series of restrictions on people’s
movements and business operations to varying timelines and degrees ranging from full lockdowns,
partial lockdowns to “business as usual”. We have observed varying impacts on our commercial
performance, including a slowdown in subscriber additions and recharges.

There has been some counterbalance to this from reduced churn and increased electronic recharges
as we have ramped up our digital channels as a service alternative, to ensure that customers are able
to continue purchasing airtime and accessing our products and services seamlessly. This has also
provided some mitigation for distribution costs. From a revenue viewpoint, the trends have indicated                                                                                               8
some shift in mix, with data revenue increasing, roaming declining and voice revenue coming under
pressure. Fintech revenue has also come under pressure due to the restriction of movement and as
our opcos have discounted many of their fintech services in support of COVID-19 initiatives.

The increase in demand for our data and digital services has driven a surge in usage and traffic on our
networks. In addition to the effects of increased teleworking and home data usage, the increase in
data traffic has also been driven by some of the relief packages and additional value we have put into
the market in support of customers and stakeholders during this time.

Data traffic on our networks has, on aggregate, accelerated by more than 30% when comparing traffic
levels at the end of April 2020 against February 2020, which is before COVID-19-related behaviour
such as work-from-home began in earnest. In our three largest markets on this basis, data traffic in
MTN Nigeria was up 32% (and 156% YoY), in MTN SA was up 56% (and 85% YoY) and in MTN Ghana
was up 39% (181% YoY).

The picture for voice revenue has thus far been mixed across our opcos. The disruption of COVID-19
has resulted in a slowdown in voice usage due to lower economic activity, which has been
compounded by the abovementioned migration to digital connectivity arising from increased
teleworking. For voice traffic, we have observed aggregate declines averaging in the mid- to upper-
single-digits in most markets when comparing 2020 traffic levels for end-April against end-February.
On the same basis, voice traffic in MTN Nigeria was down 9% (and 9% YoY), in MTN SA was down 3%
(and 10% YoY) while in MTN Ghana it was up 10% (and 31% YoY).

How these dynamics will settle remains uncertain at this relatively early stage, and we expect this to
become clearer in the coming quarters depending on how national responses and the economic
impact thereof unfold. The initial trends from April indicate pressure on voice revenue because of
lockdowns, particularly in those of our markets with lower penetration of electronic recharges.
However, we are encouraged that in markets where some lifting of restrictions has started to happen,
such as Nigeria and Ghana, we have already noted signs of recovery in subscriber additions, recharges
and voice traffic while data traffic appears to be holding up at current elevated levels.

Network and supply chain
Our core connectivity services have become more critical over this period and we have prioritised
network continuity, focusing on the availability of spares and equipment as well as the upgrading of
capacity. We note that in some markets like South Africa, the regulator has provided free additional
spectrum on a temporary basis which will help alleviate the pressure on network from increased traffic
in these markets. Our biggest focus for the remainder of the year is ensuring the resilience and
capacity of our networks.

To date, there has been moderate disruption to our supply chain. We have put measures in place to
ensure resilience of our networks and mitigate supply chain risk and are working closely with our
suppliers and partners in implementing increased visibility and control processes. We have built up
inventory and have procured critical spares for at least 12 months. MTN SA, our principal device
market, is experiencing some challenges with the availability of top-end handsets and there are also
some impacts on procurement of SIM cards. We continue to closely monitor our inventory to minimise
significant interruptions.

Funding and liquidity
We have worked to ensure balance sheet strength and resilience over the past few years, which
positions us relatively well to weather the prevailing volatility. Our holdco net debt stood at R55,4
billion at March 2020, which is slightly lower than the December 2019 level. As at the end of
March 2020, our holdco leverage was at 2,5x, primarily affected by the 21,5% weakening of the rand
against the US dollar as at the end of the period.


We are comfortably within our debt covenants, which are gauged on a group consolidated basis. Our
group net-debt/EBITDA ratio stood at 1,1x as at 31 March 2020 (31 December 2019: 1,3x) against our
covenant of 2,5x and our interest cover ratio at 31 March 2020 was 9,4x (31 December 2020: 6,6x)
compared to the covenant of 5,0x. Our group cash balance at the end of March 2020 stood at
R42,1 billion.

We continue to actively manage our maturity profile and have made good progress on our 2020/2021
refinancing priorities, with approximately R15 billion (R12,5 billion in term and revolving credit
facilities, plus R2,5 billion in a domestic medium-term note (DMTN) programme) in debt maturing over
the next 10 months that we are refinancing this year. Of the total refinancing, we have already
concluded R1 billion in local capital markets (under DMTN). This transaction was successfully closed
amid volatile and uncertain local market conditions. We are at an advanced stage in securing
R11 billion of the R12,5 billion of bank funding by the end of June 2020.

We continue to be prudent in our approach around liquidity management and note that, as at
31 March 2020, our holding company liquidity headroom stood at approximately R45,2 billion –
comprising R19,3 billion in cash and R25,8 billion in committed, undrawn credit facilities. The final
dividend payment of approximately R6,7 billion was paid after the quarter-end. Our debt maturity
profile for 2020 and 2021 is R6,5 billion and R12,2 billion respectively.

In terms of dividend upstreaming from our two larger markets, MTN Ghana declared an interim
dividend in April of which approximately US$61 million is attributable to the group, and MTN Nigeria
declared its final 2019 dividend in February of which approximately US$131 million is attributable to
the group subject to shareholder approval at its AGM on 15 May 2020.

Our medium-term priorities remain to reduce our exposure to US dollar debt and improve the funding
mix at the holdco level. Amid the nearer-term risks and uncertainties of the impact of COVID-19 on
markets, we remain focused on preservation of cash and maintaining a healthy liquidity position.


                                                                                                  
Outlook
Looking ahead, the current environment is marked by significant uncertainties. It is still too early to
assess the economic impact of the pandemic on our customers and reliably quantify the direct or
indirect financial effects on our business. The remainder of the year will be shaped by the ramifications
of the pandemic, and we will continue to update shareholders as the effects become clearer.

The effects of COVID-19, and other macro developments, have increased risks such as exchange rate
volatility, economic growth and capital flows in our markets. We have seen the sovereign credit ratings
of our two largest markets, South Africa and Nigeria, downgraded by credit ratings agencies in the
past few months. This will have an impact on economic prospects of the markets as well as MTN at a
group and opco levels. We monitor these developments very closely to assess their implications, and
manage our responses, in order to mitigate these risks. In the meantime, we believe that our extensive
interventions already being implemented will safeguard the sustainability of the business, its people
and its customers in the prevailing challenging environment.

In addition to the work we have done around further strengthening our operational and financial
position, we have implemented cost control measures, focusing on mission critical expenses and
enhanced oversight of expenditure.

Our capital expenditure (capex) focus will be on ensuring the resilience and capacity of our networks.
We anticipate that disruptions in the supply chain and challenges in rolling out coverage under
lockdown rules combined with our emphasis on liquidity will impact on our capex programme for the
year. Our updated capex guidance for 2020 is between R21 billion and R22,0 billion, from R28,3 billion
guided at the 2019 results.

We are not only focused on managing the risks brought about by COVID-19, but also on the
opportunities it creates in the accelerated digitalisation it has brought about. We are well positioned
as a company to benefit from this evolution, especially given our focus on growth in our data, digital
and financial services businesses. The group remains focused on the execution of our BRIGHT strategy
to deliver sustainable growth in our operations.

While the current financial year will be challenging, at this stage we are maintaining our medium-term
framework. We are progressing with the expense efficiency initiatives across our markets that will
support margin management and liquidity across the business. Over the next three to five years we
remain committed to growing service revenue, improving efficiencies, executing on our asset
realisation programme and reducing our holdco leverage ratio. The board will continue to monitor the
environment in the context of our clearly defined capital allocation framework and provide any update
in this regard with our interim results in August 2020.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has
not been reviewed and reported on by MTN’s external auditors. Constant currency information has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the group's results. In determining the change
in constant currency terms, the prior financial reporting period’s results have been adjusted to the current period
average exchange rates determined as the weighted average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement
has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira.
The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results
compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and
MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The
economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period under review
and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

SUMMARY OF MTN GHANA UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

Shareholders of MTN Group are advised that Scancom PLC (MTN Ghana), has today announced its
unaudited results for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) as follows:

Salient features

    -       Subscribers (QoQ)

        •    Subscribers increased by 6.2% to 23.9 million (+4.5% to 20.7 million*).

        •    Data subscribers increased by 5.4% to 21.2 million (active data subscribers up by 6.1% to 8.6
             million#).

        •    Registered Mobile Money (MoMo) subscribers increased by 6.9% to 15.5 million (active
             MoMo subscribers up by 2.1% to 9.3 million*).

    -       Service revenue up by 20.4% to GH¢1,427 million.

    -       EBITDA up by 34.5% to GH¢768 million.

    -       EBITDA margin up by 5.5 percentage points (pp) to 53.4%.

    -       Capex for the period was GH¢605.2 million^ (GH¢597.2 million under IAS 17).

    -       Outlook: Market conditions are expected to be more challenging for the remainder of the
            financial year as the extent and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are uncertain. As
            such, we are leaning toward a more measured outlook in the near-term.


* Aligned with the MTN Group definition, subscribers are SIMs which generate or participate in an event that
generates revenue for the company. Out of bracket numbers conform to the respective regulator subscriber
definition.

# Active data subscribers as per MTN Group definition are data subscribers who have used more than 5MB in a
month.

^ Capex under IFRS 16 is made up of core capex spend of GH¢215.1m, intangibles of GH¢382.1m and right of use
(RoU) assets of GH¢8.0m for the period.



MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance for the period, despite macro-economic challenges
arising in Ghana in the last month of the quarter from the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Service revenue increased by 20.4%, underpinned by double-digit growth in voice, data and Mobile
Money revenue.

Voice growth was resilient (up 16.6%), driven by an increase in the number of active subscribers*
(+4.5%) as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage
churn and support usage. The contribution of voice to total service revenue decreased from 47.1% to
45.6%, as other lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional business in line with our
revenue diversification strategy.

The double-digit increase in data revenue (up 19.4%) was attributable to growth in active data users#
(+6.1%) and growth in the number of smartphones on the network (+2.1%). Data revenue’s
contribution to service revenue decreased marginally from 26.7% to 26.5%.

Mobile Money revenue grew strongly (up 30.4%) and benefited from an increase in the number of
active subscribers* (+2.1%), higher transactional activity of person-to-person (P2P) and growth in
more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and international remittances. Mobile
Money revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from 17.9% to 19.4%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 34.5% with an EBITDA
margin expansion of 5.5 percentage points (pp) to 53.4%. This margin improvement was a result of
our cost efficiency initiatives underpinned by continued distribution efficiencies.

Our strong growth in revenue coupled with our cash management initiatives resulted in a strong
growth (+62.1%) in profit after tax and improved our cash generation from our operation by 12.5%.

We invested GH¢215.1 million in core capex^ as we continued to improve our network.

In line with existing banking covenants, there was no breach to any of the financial covenants and we
continue to maintain a strong balance sheet.

In Q1 2020, a series of restrictions on people’s movements and business operations were
implemented through executive directives by the President of the Republic of Ghana to mitigate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in some disruptions in demand and supply chains and
consequently led to dampening of the levels of economic activity in the country. The impact of the
pandemic on the global economy, coupled with the sharp fall in oil prices, is likely to significantly
slowdown GDP growth in Ghana.

The government – through the Bank of Ghana (BoG) – announced certain regulatory measures to help
with the fight against the pandemic. These include the zero-rating of all Mobile Money peer-to-peer
(P2P) transfers up to GH¢100 daily for a period of 90 days and simplified registration for merchant and
person-to-person (P2P) wallets and purchases from e-commerce and other platforms. The
government also increased the daily transaction limits and balances for the various wallet types to
promote customer safety through non-cash transactions. The BoG also extended the deadline to meet
the minimum capital requirements for Payment Service Providers and Electronic Money Issuers, from
the original date of 30 June 2020 to 31 December 2020.

In support of government’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19, MTN Ghana – through the MTN
Ghana Foundation – donated GH¢5 million for the procurement of medical supplies. These include
personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff. We also
increased our focus on four key areas: our people, our customers, our network and our efficiency.

For our people, the immediate priority is their health and safety. Our work-from-home programme
enables our staff to work remotely while ensuring the continuity in our operations. Our daily health
monitor survey allows us to ascertain the wellbeing of our staff and their families. We have also
launched a Ghana Staff Care Emergency Fund in support of MTN Ghana’s extended workforce who
may be affected by the pandemic. We have also positioned alcohol-based hand sanitizers across our
offices, branches and experience centres for use by customers and employees to augment the
deployment and use of temperature guns, PPEs and the practising of social distancing.

For our customers, we have ramped up our digital channels as a service alternative, to ensure that
they are able to continue purchasing airtime and accessing our products and services seamlessly.
Through zero-rating, MTN Ghana has also offered free access to over 100 educational online sites to
support students’ and teachers’ remote learning and research activities during this period. So far, this
supports more than 250,000 customers, consuming over 3.5TB of free data per day for educational
purposes. MTN Ghana has also provided GH¢10,000 worth of free data to all university students on
our MTN Bright Scholarship scheme.

MTN Ghana is collaborating with the National Information Technology Authority (NITA) to offer free
access to Government of Ghana’s Smart Workplace Portal to enable government workers work from
home. In addition, MTN Ghana has already offered free access through the zero-rating of several
government websites that are providing health and other COVID-19 related information such as the
Ghana Health Service website and others. MTN has also provisioned short codes to facilitate
information flow on COVID-19 for the Ministry of Information to be used for social media services. To
augment efforts in spreading information, MTN Ghana is also assisting with the circulation of safety
tips received from the Ghana Health Service and promotion of the national emergency hotline to our
customers.

MTN Ghana has also brought to bear its leadership in the technology space by supporting the infection
monitoring and contact tracing team in line with the requisite legal procedures. To support this
further, MTN Ghana has initiated the provision of 800 sim cards with 8TB of data to National Security
and 10 Turbonet devices with 2.25TB of data to the National COVID-19 Response Team for use by
contact tracers.

During the period leading to the imposition and lifting of the lockdown, MTN Ghana experienced
increased traffic on its network as students, government agencies, businesses and individuals adopted
social distancing measures such as working from home, increased use of eLearning platforms and
more social media engagements. We have put in place measures to ensure that our network remains
resilient and supports round-the-clock connectivity during this period and beyond.

We had started the year with a strong Q1 performance and optimism about the financial year 2020.
However, given the uncertainty associated with the likely duration and related economic impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic calls for a more measured outlook in the near-term. The potential areas of
impact and focus include employee safety; supply chain delays and availability; management of credit
and liquidity; currency risk; counterparty risk; and the potential revenue impact from reduced
consumer spend.

Voice and Mobile Money revenue have experienced an immediate impact from the current macro
disruptions and Government interventions to manage the COVID-19 situation, based on early
trends. The decline in voice traffic and Mobile Money transactional activity is largely due to a
slowdown in economic activity and a reduction in consumer discretionary spend.

Although we have witnessed growth in data revenue, due to shifts in behaviour to work-from-home
and school-from-home schemes, this does not fully offset the slowdown in voice and Mobile Money
revenue.

While we continue to monitor and analyse the current situation and explore various scenarios in a bid
to mitigate its impact on our business, we remain cautious of the uncertainties and heightened risks
associated with the COVID-19 impact and acknowledge that the remainder of the financial year will
be shaped by the impact of these developments on the Ghanaian economy and consequently, on our
business.

In line with our transition journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an
emerging digital operator, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the ‘Year of the customer: the digital
experience’ with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create
value for our shareholders.



Notice is hereby given that a gross interim dividend of GH¢ 0.03 per share for the period to 31 March
2020 has been declared. This is subject to deduction of appropriate taxes. The number of ordinary
shares in issue at the date of this declaration is 12,290,474,360.

Scancom PLC’s tax reference number is C0003632776. In compliance with the requirements of GSE
rules, the salient dates relating to the payment of the dividend are as follows:

Ex-Dividend Date                                                  Wednesday, 13 May 2020

Qualifying Date                                                      Friday, 15 May 2020

Dividend Payment Date                                                Friday, 29 May 2020

All shareholders registered in the books of Scancom PLC at close of business on Friday, 15 May 2020
qualify for the interim dividend.

In view of the foregoing, the ex-dividend date has been set as Wednesday, 13 May 2020.
Consequently, an investor purchasing MTNGH shares before this date will be entitled to the interim
dividend. However, an investor buying MTNGH shares on or after Wednesday, 13 May 2020 will not
be entitled to the interim dividend.

On Friday, 29 May 2020 the dividend will be transferred electronically to the bank accounts or mobile
money wallets of shareholders who make use of these facilities.

SUMMARY OF MTN NIGERIA UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

Shareholders of MTN Group are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria),
announced its unaudited results for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 on 28 April 2020 on the Nigerian
Stock Exchange (NSE) as follows:



Salient features:



    •   Mobile subscribers increased by 4.2 million to 68.5 million

    •   Active data users increased by 1.7 million to 26.8 million

financial information is quarter-on-quarter (QoQ, March 2020 versus December 2019).



MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

“We recorded a solid performance in the first quarter, building on the growth momentum we achieved
in Q4 2019. Service revenue was strong and rose by 16.7% driven by voice and data revenue. 4.2 million
subscribers were added to the network driving voice revenue growth of 7.4%. Data revenue increased
by 59.2% supported by growth in data traffic with a further 1.7 million active subscribers connecting
to the internet during the quarter. We continued to deepen data penetration with the further rollout
of 4G sites, increasing 4G population coverage to 48% in Q1 2020 from 44% as at year-end 2019.



We saw strong growth in digital and fintech revenue with digital revenue growing by 63.7%, while
fintech was up by 36.1%. Our mobile money agent network has grown to 178,000, adding 70,000
agents during the quarter.



This performance was achieved against the backdrop of several developments during the quarter.
Value added tax (VAT) was increased in February 2020 from 5% to 7.5%, which adversely affected both
revenue and costs. The situation has been exacerbated by upheavals in the global oil market, which
put significant downward pressure on oil prices leading to an exchange rate adjustment by the Central
Bank of Nigeria on 20 March, 2020, increasing some of our costs. In addition, a series of lockdown
measures began being implemented globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in
significant operational challenges and supply chain disruptions.



In response to these tough times, we have heightened our focus on four key areas – our people, our
customers, our network and our efficiency. The immediate priority for our people is their health and
safety. We have provided facilities to enable our staff to work safely and remotely, ensuring that
operations run smoothly. We run a daily health survey, which enables us to ascertain our staff’s
wellbeing, and we have launched a staff-care emergency fund to provide an added buffer for our
people who may be affected by the pandemic.



To support our customers and communities, we launched the ‘Y’ello Hope Package,’ a broad set of
initiatives deployed to support national efforts at containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, mitigate
the pandemic’s social and economic impact, and keep our customers connected to their loved ones,
critical resources and support. This includes supporting government with communication systems,
connectivity, analytical response management and risk profiling tools; and facilitating efforts of the
Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) by providing connectivity, SMS distribution of updates and
personal protective equipment for front-line health workers.



MTN has also contributed N1 billion to the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), a private-sector
task force working to increase public awareness, provide food relief to 1.7 million households
nationwide, and support the nation’s crisis response capabilities by providing medical supplies and
equipment, isolation and treatment centres, test kits and training. In addition, MTN customers have
been granted free daily access to key health-related websites, and fees for local money transfers via
the MoMo Agent Network have been waived. Finally, to ensure the most vulnerable and marginalised
communities are not left behind, 300 free SMS’s were provided per customer for one month in the first
instance. To date, more than 1 billion free messages have been sent.



Our team has worked extremely hard to minimise the impact of the temporary disruption in the supply
chain on operational continuity. We have put in place necessary measures and resources to keep the
network running, continue network rollout and expansion of population coverage.



Towards the end of March, we started experiencing a change in traffic patterns with a drop in voice
traffic which was partially offset by an increase in data traffic on the network. Data traffic increased
as customers began to adopt digital channels for most of their activities and routines including
telecommuting, entertainment and social media engagements due to the lockdown. To accommodate
this, we have deployed additional resources to upgrade the capacity of the network. Enhancing
operating efficiency remains critical at this time, with an increased focus on optimising costs and cash
flow generation.



The impact of COVID-19 on our first quarter performance was not significant, except for delayed
orders. However, given that lockdown measures only started towards the end of the quarter, and given
the uncertainty associated with the likely duration and related economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and its effects on our customers, unstable oil prices as well as pressure on the rate and
availability of foreign exchange, it is currently too early to reliably quantify the direct or indirect
financial effects on our business going forward. We have activated our business continuity plan and
implemented extensive response measures aimed at mitigating the potential impact on the network
and overall business performance. The continuity plan covers, among others: supply chain,
management of credit and liquidity, currency risk, counterparty risk, and potential revenue impacts
from reduced consumer spend.



Operational review

Over the quarter, we continued to gain market share, with the addition of 4.2 million subscribers to
the network, representing a 6.5% increase in the quarter to 68.5 million. Active data subscribers also
increased by 6.6% to 26.8 million, representing an additional 1.7 million data users. The increase in
the subscriber base was supported by the deployment of additional SIM registration devices and
various customer value management (CVM) initiatives implemented during the quarter.



Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 7.4% (+3.2% QoQ) and accounted for 69.1% of service
revenue. Voice traffic increased by 7.2% YoY, supporting revenue growth.



Data revenue, making up 22.6% of service revenue, continued to accelerate with growth of 59.2%
(+12.3% QoQ). This was achieved through increased data subscribers and improved 4G penetration,
which supported traffic growth of 130.4% YoY (25.2% QoQ). 1.6 million new smartphones were added
to the network, bringing smartphone penetration to 42.6% of the base.



The digital business returned to growth, with revenue increasing 63.7% (+8.0% QoQ) supported by a
rich portfolio of digital products and services and improvement in customer journey experience. There
was an improvement in the uptake of digital offerings and efforts to expand the active user base for
the digital business continued to yield positive results. During the quarter, 1.6 million new users were
added, bringing the active base for digital subscriptions to 3.8 million users.



Fintech revenue growth was 36.1% (+10.8% QoQ) in Q1 2020 driven by an increase in the adoption of
MTN Xtratime, an airtime lending service. 70,000 MoMo agents were added in the quarter, bringing
the total number of registered agents to 178,000 nationwide. The total volume of transactions
processed by agents during the quarter was over 5.6 million, about 80% of which were airtime
vending. Transaction fees for all money transfers using the MoMo agent network were suspended for
an initial period of one month starting 23 March, 2020 as part of the Y’ello Hope Package.



The enterprise business segment continued to improve, with revenue growth of 12.7%. Enterprise
business includes revenue from mobile and fixed connectivity, cloud and ICT solutions, and devices. It
cuts across voice, data and digital services for SMEs, public sector and large enterprise customers.



On the cost side, operating expenses increased by 22.3% driven mainly by an increase in lease rental
costs following an aggressive 4G roll site rollout. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 15.3%, while EBITDA margin moderated by 0.6pp to 52.7% due to the
increase in costs. Capital expenditure, excluding right of use assets, was N24.7 billion. Overall,
reported growth of 8.9% in profit before tax was impacted by an increase in finance costs due to higher
borrowings, while profit after tax and earnings per share both rose by 5.6%.




Funding and Liquidity



We are currently diversifying funding strategies and sources to fast track capital expenditure related
to hardware investment and to optimise our funding costs. We have strong free cash flow and
approved loan facility headroom to meet financial obligations. In line with existing banking covenants,
there is headroom to leverage the balance sheet optimally for strategic investments. Major credit
exposures are from trade partners, but these are secured by bank guarantees. This enables the trade
partners to improve sales turnover even in this period of lockdown. We have kept foreign currency
exposures within manageable limits so that the balance sheet can withstand currency volatility. The
debt split is 92% in local currency and 8% in foreign currency.



Tower Providers’ Contract



In 2014, we made a strategic decision to sell passive infrastructure to enable the company to focus on
its core business. Although MTN Nigeria continues to own a small number of towers, it currently has
lease agreements with various tower providers and this constitutes a significant portion of service
costs.



In terms of the agreement between MTN Nigeria and the tower companies, all payments are made in
Naira, but in certain instances some are quantified in foreign currency and converted into Naira at the
official exchange rate published by the CBN. This rate was recently reset from 305 to 360 and will
apply to the relevant contracts with effect from 1 April 2020. This will put pressure on margins going
forward. However, we are in continued discussions with our tower providers to optimise these long-
term contracts.



Outlook



We started the year with an upbeat view of the prospects for the business in 2020, which was
substantiated by the strong performance in service revenue delivered in the first quarter. However,
recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, oil price volatility and foreign exchange rates
and availability call for a more measured outlook in the near-term. The remainder of the year will be
shaped by the impact of these developments, which remains highly uncertain at this time.



Voice revenue has experienced an immediate impact from the current macro disruptions, based on
early trends, especially in the mass market segment. There has been a decline in voice traffic post-
COVID lockdown largely due to a slowdown in economic activity and a reduction in people’s earning
capacity. Although we have witnessed growth in data revenue, it does not fully offset the decline in
voice revenue. This may persist with the extension of the lockdown, and continued macroeconomic
and other challenges. The company continues to monitor and analyse these developments, and their
potential impact on our business.



We will continue to invest in the network to provide adequate capacity and resilience. This is key as
data traffic on the network continues to increase, not least because of COVID-19-related relief efforts.
Although the situation remains fluid due to uncertainties around the potential impact of COVID-19 as
well as oil price, foreign exchange rate volatility and foreign currency availability on the business, we
are continually assessing the situation and implementing mitigating interventions. We believe that the
business is well-placed to weather the current macroeconomic and social turmoil.

MTN Group Limited Credit Rating affirmed by Moody’s.

Noteholders are hereby advised regarding the rating affirmation
of MTN Group, being the Issuer’s Guarantor. Despite its
sovereign rating downgrade of South Africa, Moody’s has left
MTN’s rating unchanged and affirmed its Ba1 rating. Moody's has
also revised MTN's national scale CFR higher to Aa2.za from
Aa3.za to reflect the updated mapping of Global Scale Ratings
to NSR due to the downgrade of the sovereign rating.

Moody’s has also left the negative outlook unchanged to reflect
the exposure to weakening sovereign credit quality in some of
MTN's key markets such as South Africa (Ba1 negative) and Nigeria
(B2 negative).

Moody’s decision to affirm MTN’s rating resulted from Moody’s
view that the Company’s healthy credit metrics and good
liquidity will help to absorb the deterioration in the domestic
macroeconomic environment.

MTN Group Limited-Credit Rating Review by S&P Global(“S&P”)

On 1 April 2020, S&P took rating actions on Nigeria-exposed
corporate issuers that are rated at or above sovereign.

S&P also considered the effects that lower GDP growth, potential
currency movements, and lower oil prices could pose to issuers'
earnings prospects and leverage, within the context of their
exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)-related local and global
developments.

S&P’s rationale for the rating review was that the Nigeria-
exposed issuers would be facing the following conspicuous risks
that would have an impact on the issuers:

  •   lower demand for a wide variety of products and services
      due to a likely broad-based COVID-19-related economic
      recession, negative effects on Nigeria's government
      finances and
  •   oil-related industries following the recent slump in oil
      prices, and risks of Nigerian naira (NGN) depreciation
      versus other global currencies.

S&P, stated however, that they foresaw COVID-19 as having a
modest effect on MTN's financial metrics, given the heightened
importance of telecommunications during a period of restricted
movement.

MTN Group Ltd - S&P lowered the long-term issuer credit rating
to 'BB' from 'BB+' and maintained the negative outlook.

Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings Ltd - S&P lowered the issuer
credit and issue ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+' and maintained the
negative outlook.

MTN (Mauritius) Investments Ltd - S&P lowered the issue rating
to 'BB' from 'BB+'. The '3 (65%)' recovery rating is unchanged.

Furthermore, the South African national scale rating was also
lowered to 'zaAA' from 'zaAAA'.
Notwithstanding the above,   MTN   Group’s   stand-alone   credit
profile remains unchanged.

MTN South Africa (“MTN SA”) announces outcomes from engagements with the Competition
Commission (“CompCom”)


Further to the announcements on 4 December 2019 and 12 December 2019, MTN SA has today
announced the outcomes from its engagements with the CompCom and response to its Data Service
Market Inquiry (“inquiry”). MTN SA has developed a set of voluntary undertakings in the form of a social
compact to further address the affordability of data services for its customers and MTN remains in
discussion with the CompCom on the options to formalise these elective solutions and the
implementation thereof.

Included in these initiatives are three areas which focus on deepening MTN’s ongoing drive to reduce the
cost to communicate. These are: the affordability of monthly prepaid bundles, lifeline data and the zero-
rating of data for public benefit service websites.

With regard to monthly prepaid data bundles, MTN SA will, in April 2020, reduce the price of its monthly
bundles of 1GB and below by between 25-50% and specifically the 1GB monthly bundle will decrease by
33% to R99. This continues the work MTN SA has done to improve the affordability of data for its
customers, having already brought the effective rate of data on its network down by 76% between
February 2017 and February 2020.

In terms of lifeline data, MTN SA will provide each of its customers 20MB of free data daily – or the
equivalent of 600MB per customer every month – through its instant messaging platform, Ayoba. Ayoba
currently has 500 000 customers in South Africa and is expected to continue to scale through the lifeline
offering.

MTN currently offers zero-rated data access to a range of websites which includes schools, and
universities. These will form part of the broader public benefit website service. In April 2020, MTN will
extend the websites that form part of the public benefit service to also include health, public universities,
vocational colleges, educational resources as well as employment sites based on terms and conditions
and criteria defined by MTN and after application and approval from MTN.

From April 2020, MTN will launch the OpenTime service, which will be enable free access to public benefit
services through a link on this website. MTN SA will offer a monthly 500MB free data access to public
benefit services websites every month, amounting to 6GBs per year, for each of MTN SA’s 29 million
customers.

While there will be pressure on MTN SA’s short-term financial performance from these initiatives, MTN
believe that the reduction in pricing will be compensated over time by elasticity and customer growth,
and growth in prepaid data service revenue will return in a couple of quarters.

Radio spectrum is the digital highway upon which we depend to carry increasing mobile data at more
cost-effective prices. This is acutely felt in South Africa, which has among the lowest spectrum allocation
in all our MTN markets. The release of new spectrum in South Africa is urgently needed and will greatly
assist our ability to service increased customer demand in a more cost-effective manner.

MTN completes the sale of ATC joint ventures for R8,9 billion


Our asset realisation programme (“ARP”), introduced in March 2019, aims to reduce debt, simplify our
portfolio, reduce risk and improve returns.

Subsequent to MTN Group’s announcement on 11 March 2020 reporting its 2019 annual results and the
conclusion of the disposal of its stake in ATC Uganda for R2,2 billion, MTN confirms that regulatory
approvals have now been received for the disposal of its stake in ATC Ghana. MTN is due to receive further
transaction proceeds of approximately $384 million (R6,7 billion, based on an exchange rate of R17,4:$1)
in the next week. This takes the total proceeds received for the disposal of both ATC Uganda and ATC
Ghana to R8,9 billion, which will be applied to paying down US-dollar debt and general corporate
purposes.

On completion, the Group will have realised R15.0 billion within the first 12 months of its initial three-
year ARP. Consequently, MTN has enhanced its ARP guidance framework to a target of at least R25 billion
in further asset realisations over the medium-term (3-5 years), and a holding company leverage target
ratio of below 2,0 times.

MTN has strengthened its operational and financial position is well-placed to weather the prevailing
turbulent macroeconomic environment. The Group remains focused on its strategic execution and
committed to its clearly-defined and disciplined capital allocation framework.

MTN declared a final dividend of 355 cents per share on 11 March 2020, bringing the total dividend to
550 cents per share for the 2019 financial year.

Salient dates relating to the payment of the final dividend are as follows:

          constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure
          included in the audited summary group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. This pro forma
          financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments from the
          consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable YoY analysis. The pro forma adjustments have been
          calculated in terms of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year
          ended 31 December 2019, except for the changes in accounting policies as a result of the adoption of the
          accounting standards effective 1 January 2019.
     2.   Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the
          group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the prior financial reporting period's results
          have been adjusted to the current period average exchange rates determined as the weighted average of the
          monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially
          being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based
          on the prior year constant currency results compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN
          Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared
          excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be
          hyperinflationary for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
""In 2019, the 25-year anniversary of MTN Group, we delivered solid operational execution and
commercial momentum across most of our operations as well as a number of innovations that support
greater digital and financial inclusion.

In challenging trading conditions, we maintained operating leverage with a 9,8%* increase in service
revenue and a 13,6%* increase in EBITDA. The group's EBITDA margin improved by 1,2 pp* to 35,5%*
on an IAS 17 basis, in line with our medium-term guidance. Our holding company leverage remained
stable at 2,2x and we reduced our capex intensity to 17,5%, from 19,3%, also on an IAS 17 basis.

The group's results were supported by double-digit growth in service revenue by both MTN Nigeria and
MTN Ghana, while economic pressure, new data usage rules and a reassessment of recognition criteria
for roaming revenue from Cell C impacted our performance in South Africa.

We advanced our work to build a digital operator, adding 18,2 million subscribers to reach a total base
of 251 million, and recording 95 million active data users and 35 million active MoMo users. This
growth is central to our belief that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life. In
support of this, we launched a $20 smartphone during the year, following on from our $20 smart
feature phone developed in 2018.

To ensure Africa doesn't miss out on the instant messaging revolution, we launched our own instant
messaging platform, Ayoba, in March 2019. Ayoba is now live in 12 markets and has registered two
million monthly active users. Broadening our fintech offering remains a priority, and MoMo is now live
in South Africa. In Nigeria, we received our super-agent licence and by December 2019 had 108 000
registered agents.

We delivered approximately R14 billion of asset realisations within the first 12 months of our three-
year R15 billion asset realisation programme. We moved towards more localisation of operations,
most notably with the listing of MTN Nigeria, and recorded progress on various regulatory issues,
including the AGF matter on taxes in Nigeria. Relationships with stakeholders across our markets
improved, and we reported our highest employee engagement score yet.

Inspired to harness the pioneering spirit that has built MTN over the last 25 years we remain committed
to delivering on our strategy in a more agile way in close collaboration with our many partners, with
whom we are #GoodTogether.

Given the progress and momentum we are seeing in our commercial, financial and strategic initiatives,
we have enhanced our medium-term guidance framework. While we maintain our medium-term
service revenue, EBITDA, capex and ROE objectives, we are increasing our medium-term (3-5 years)
targets for our asset realisation programme to at least a further R25 billion and are reducing our
holding company leverage target ratio to below 2,0x.""

EPS
Basic earnings per share increased to 499 cents from 485 cents. These were negatively impacted by
77 cents or 13,4% because of the adoption of IFRS 16.

Dividends
The board has declared a gross final dividend of 355 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for
the year to 550 cents per share, up 10% from prior year.

Declaration of final ordinary cash dividend
Notice is hereby given that a gross final dividend of 355 cents per share for the period to 31 December
2019 has been declared and will be paid out of reserves. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the
date of this declaration is 1 884 269 758 (including 9 426 634 treasury shares held by MTN Holdings
and 76 835 378 shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net
dividend of 284 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend
withholding tax of 71 cents per share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories of
shareholders for the different dividend tax rates is as follows:
    * 0%                 355,00 cents per share
    * 5%                 337,25 cents per share
    * 7,5%               328,38 cents per share
    * 10%                319,50 cents per share
    * 12,5%              310,63 cents per share
    * 15%                301,75 cents per share
These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

Prospects and guidance

Well positioned to deliver growth
Our markets are growth markets. Our infrastructure and investments, our established leading position
as well as the characteristics of our markets - including significant population growth, low levels of
smartphone penetration and data and digital adoption as well as large unbanked populations - ensure
that we are well positioned for growth.

Guided by our well-defined BRIGHT strategy, we are optimising efficiencies, capex and cashflow as
well as creating sustainable economic value, enhancing sustainable societies and ensuring eco-
responsibility as we build a digital operator.

Following data price reductions in South Africa and Nigeria in 2019, we expect price elasticity to
improve data revenue growth in 2020. In Nigeria, expansion of our 4G network and migration of
incidental to active data users remain key priorities to drive data revenue growth.

We continue to work towards obtaining a payment service banking licence in Nigeria. We will further
scale the basic mobile financial services products, deepen advanced services as well as increase our
merchant base, as part of our plans to build a fintech ecosystem. Having met our initial milestone in
Nigeria, we will sustain this momentum to grow our network of agents to 300 000 in 2020.

We will further strengthen and grow our digital offerings. We plan to continue to roll out Ayoba into
our markets. We will also integrate payments into the Ayoba service as part of our broadening of the
fintech business, as well as integrating Ayoba into MTN segmented offers. After launching our time-
based music streaming service MusicTime! in six of our markets, we will expand market coverage and
improve the offerings as well as build our digital marketing business.

In 2020 we will continue to invest in our networks to ensure we are ready for the digital revolution
and plan to increase our capex spend by 13% to R28,5 billion.


Medium-term guidance
Given the pleasing progress and momentum we are seeing in our commercial, financial and strategic
initiatives, we have reviewed and enhanced our medium-term (3 - 5 years) guidance framework.

We will maintain our target of double-digit growth in group service revenue in constant currency
terms, MTN Nigeria's service revenue to grow above inflation with double-digit growth, and mid-
single-digit growth in service revenue from MTN South Africa.

Over this period, we expect to continue to improve our group EBITDA margin through our ongoing
efficiency programmes and delivering on our ROE target.

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an increasing revenue
contribution from our digital businesses, we expect the group capex intensity to improve steadily over
the medium term on an IFRS reported basis.

Our asset realisation programme (ARP) has performed better than anticipated. We have therefore
revised our medium-term target to secure at least a further R25 billion in asset realisations over the
medium-term. This is within the context of our localisation ambitions, MTN's portfolio of assets that
have been identified as not long-term strategic and market conditions being conducive. We have
further revised our holdco leverage ratio to  below 2,0x' and remain focused on delivering on our
capital allocation priorities as previously communicated.

The board remains committed to targeting growth of 10% to 20% in the dividend.

We note the developments around the Coronavirus outbreak, which has been an unexpected shock
for China's economy, as well as the global economy. While we acknowledge its potential impact on
our supply chain, we continue to monitor developments and are developing contingency plans to
mitigate the impact. Having assessed the impact on our supply chain, and assuming current conditions
do not worsen, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our near-term network rollout
plans.

Management succession
The MTN group president and CEO Rob Shuter will step down from his role at the end of his fixed four-
year contract in March 2021. Under his leadership significant progress has been made, including
establishing and effectively communicating a clear vision and strategy, driving the resolution of a
number of complex matters and delivering significant improvements in transformation, operational
performance and staff morale.

The MTN board thanks Rob for the contribution he has made, and continues to make, to MTN. The
board, led by the chairman, will manage the succession process and expects to conclude this during
the year, thus enabling a seamless handover.

In other changes, the group chief technology and IT officer Charles Molapisi has been appointed to
the group executive committee, reporting to the group president and CEO and the fixed contract of
the group chief operations officer, Jens Schulte-Bockum, has been extended until 31 March 2022.

Unless otherwise stated, financial and non-financial information is year-on-year (YoY, full-year 2019 versus 2018). In

MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria) is one of Africa's largest providers of communications
services with a clear vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new digital world. We announce our audited
results for the full year ended 31 December 2019.

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

""I am pleased with our performance in 2019, which demonstrates the progress we have made in the
implementation of our BRIGHT strategy. Despite a challenging operating environment, we continued
to deliver double-digit growth in service revenue in line with our medium-term guidance. Voice revenue
growth remained healthy, and data revenue continued to accelerate, supporting a 12.6% increase in
service revenue with an acceleration in growth to 14.0% YoY in Q4 2019.

Following the completion of the SIM re-registration exercise in Q3 2019, we recorded 2.7 million net
additions in Q4. In total, we added 6.1 million new subscribers to our network in 2019. Although the
last quarter is usually seasonally strong, service revenue growth (14.0%) in Q4 outpaced the seasonal
effect.

In the third quarter, we focused on several initiatives to enhance coverage and drive data usage
penetration. These initiatives include optimising frequencies, expanding our 4G network coverage with
over 6,000 additional sites leveraging 800MHz spectrum and repositioning our commercial data
offerings.

It is pleasing to note that the promising results we reported at the end of Q3 2019 accelerated in the
fourth quarter. Corresponding with the increase in our active data subscriber net additions by
2.9 million in Q4 2019, our 4G population coverage rose by 8.4 pp to 43.8%, giving people in 68
additional cities access to 4G. We closed the year with 132 cities covered by 4G and became the first
mobile network operator in West Africa to demonstrate the capability of 5G technology. We are excited
about its potential for our customers and Nigeria's overall national development plans.

At 20.9% on an IAS 17 basis (45.2% on reported IFRS basis), our earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose at a rate in excess of revenue growth and we recorded
an EBITDA margin of 44.8% (53.9% on reported IFRS basis). Our reported profit before tax rose by
31.1%, while profit after tax and earnings per share both rose by 38.8%. In line with our dividend policy,
the board has proposed a final dividend of N4.97 kobo per share to be paid out of distributable net
income. This brings the total dividend for the year to N7.92 kobo per share.

We are delighted with the progress made in resolving our dispute with the Attorney General of the
Federation (AGF) on the adequacy of taxes and duties paid. We have discontinued the legal action
against the AGF following the transfer of the matter to the relevant authorities and look forward to a
final resolution. We have always fulfilled our tax obligations and remain committed to maintaining
good relationships with all regulatory authorities.

Finally, we achieved a major milestone in the history of MTN Nigeria with the conversion from a private
company to a public limited company and the subsequent listing on the premium board of the Nigerian
Stock Exchange, which has led to a broader base of Nigerian shareholders for the company.""

Operational review

During the year, we focused on building our subscriber base, resulting in growth of 10.5% in net
additions to a total of 64.3 million subscribers. Our active data subscribers rose by 34.9% to
25.2 million on the back of several initiatives. As a result, the ratio of active data users to total mobile
subscribers increased by 7.1 pp to 39.2% in 2019 with strong potential for future growth.

Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 8.4% and accounted for 72.7% of service revenue. Voice
traffic increased by 7.6%, supporting revenue growth.

In addition, we have seen rapid acceleration in data revenue growth enabled by greater population
coverage, a revamp of our data portfolio and initiatives to drive 4G device penetration. We added 5.3
million new smartphones to our network, bringing smartphone penetration to 41.8% of our base,
while data traffic rose by 85.8%. Our interventions in the year helped to drive a 42.4% increase in data
revenue for the year (63.1% YoY in Q4 2019). Data contributed 18.8% to service revenue, up 3.9 pp
from 14.9% in 2018.

Digital revenue gained momentum as we started to see quarterly growth from Q3 2019. We further
focused on building a sustainable active user base for our digital business, while improving the
customer journey and experience on value-added services (VAS). In Q4 2019, we launched MusicTime,
one of our flagship digital offerings. The active base for our digital subscriptions surpassed 2.1 million
users during the year, as we continue to build critical mass for our portfolio of digital products and
services. On a sequential QoQ (quarter-on-quarter, Q4 19 vs Q3 19) basis, digital revenue increased
by 23.0% and we target sustained growth into 2020.

                                                                                                          
Fintech revenue growth was 23.3%, supported by increased adoption of MTN Xtratime, our airtime
lending service. We launched a super-agent service in August and are pleased with the initial rollout
and uptake of the service. We closed the year with a network of 108,000 agents registered nation-
wide. The agent network served almost one million customers in the first four months of operation,
and we are maintaining our focus on further expansion. To cater to a broader market and encourage
further adoption, we are also widening the service offering - from basic transfer service and
airtime/data sales to a more extensive bouquet, including cash deposit and withdrawal services, bill
payments and facilitating e-commerce.

Our enterprise business segment continued to deliver solid results, with revenue growth of 20.3%.

On the cost side, the increase in operating expenses on an IAS 17 basis was 4.4%, which was below
the rate of inflation. This reflects progress with our cost management initiatives and reduction of non-
recurring expenses. We maintained our leadership position in network net promoter score (NPS) as
we continued to invest to improve service quality and drive 4G expansion. This resulted in a 13.1%
increase in capital expenditure and capex intensity of 17.8% on an IAS 17 basis. Our overall cash flow
performance was pleasing, with a 26.6% growth in free cash flow to N316.1 billion (IFRS 16: 51.4% to
N378.0 billion).

Overall, our bottom-line remained strong with growth of 31.1% and 38.8% respectively in profit before
and after tax. Earnings per share increased by 38.8% to N9.9k.

Outlook

We are optimistic about the prospects for our business in 2020 and pleased with the continued
momentum from H2 of 2019, and particularly Q4. Expanding 4G network coverage to deliver high-
speed internet to more people nation-wide and data revenue growth remain in focus. We expect
growth in voice revenue to remain healthy. We continue to make good progress with the expansion
of our super-agent network and are confident that the expanded service offerings will position us to
effectively drive broader financial inclusion as well as roll out the payment service bank seamlessly,
once we receive a licence.

We acknowledge the outbreak of Corona Virus worldwide and its potential impact on our supply chain.
While we monitor unfolding developments, we are exploring multiple scenarios in a bid to mitigate
the impact.

Over the next three years, we plan to invest about N600 billion in our network. This investment will
enable us to accelerate our 4G network expansion, deepen population coverage and support the
Federal Government's broadband initiative. We are excited about the possibilities that the transition
to digital presents for our business, and the growth and development of Nigeria.

Commentary

MTN Ghana (Scancom PLC or MTNGH or the Company) delivered a strong performance for the year in a
competitive industry, maintaining market leadership with 55.21%** market share. Service revenue
increased by 22.8% year-on-year (YoY), underpinned by growth in revenue from voice, data and Mobile
Money (MoMo).

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 19.4% YoY) was driven by an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+11.2%), the benefits of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives and pro-
consumer activity, as well as continued improvements to our network. As new lines of revenue continued
to grow much faster than the traditional business, voice revenue's contribution to service revenue
decreased from 46.3% to 45.0%.

Solid data revenue growth (up 32.5% YoY) was attributable to growth in active data users# (+26.6%),
growth in the number of smartphones (+18.5%) on the network and an increase in data usage (up 85.9%
to 256,301 Terabyte). Data revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 26.3% to 28.4%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to grow strongly (up 28.0%) in a year in which we marked the 10th
anniversary of MoMo in Ghana. MoMo growth was attributable to an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+8.9%), commissions on cash-in-cash-out transactions, increased transactional activity of
person-to-person (P2P) transactions as well as good growth in more advanced services - such as retail
merchant payments. MoMo revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 17.9% to 18.6%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 65.7% with a YoY EBITDA
margin expansion of 13.2 pp to 50.8%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management fee, the like-for-
like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 pp to 43.5% (2018 EBITDA margin: 37.6%). The margin improvement
was supported by lower operating expenses, prudent revenue initiatives as well as distribution
efficiencies.

We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 280 2G, 557 3G, 900 4G and 100 rural telephony
sites.

On the regulatory front, during the year the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed into law.
This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required of existing players, we have
applied for the new licence.

MTN Ghana continues to engage with regulatory stakeholders and maintains a firm focus on achieving
continued improvements in customer experience.

Following the expiry of certain technology licences in 2019, the NCA has renewed our 2G licence for 15
years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our International Gateway and Fixed Access
licences, which are pending NCA approval.

We continued to invest in our communities, with the MTN Ghana Foundation support reaching a total of
149 projects since inception in 2007. In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education,
three in health and one in economic empowerment.

The board of MTN Ghana declared an interim dividend of 2 pesewas per share after reviewing the mid-
year performance of the Company. After reviewing the full year performance of the Company, the board
of MTN Ghana shall be recommending a final dividend of 4 pesewas per share, bringing the total dividend
for the 2019 year to 6 pesewas per share. This represents 73.1% of profit after tax and a 20.0% increase
in dividend per share.

2019 marked the  year of the customer' for MTN Ghana and in 2020 we are building on that foundation
as we transition from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an emerging digital operator.
In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the  year of the customer: the digital
experience' with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value
for our shareholders.

Commentary

MTN Ghana (Scancom PLC or MTNGH or the Company) delivered a strong performance for the year in a
competitive industry, maintaining market leadership with 55.21%** market share. Service revenue
increased by 22.8% year-on-year (YoY), underpinned by growth in revenue from voice, data and Mobile
Money (MoMo).

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 19.4% YoY) was driven by an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+11.2%), the benefits of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives and pro-
consumer activity, as well as continued improvements to our network. As new lines of revenue continued
to grow much faster than the traditional business, voice revenue's contribution to service revenue
decreased from 46.3% to 45.0%.

Solid data revenue growth (up 32.5% YoY) was attributable to growth in active data users# (+26.6%),
growth in the number of smartphones (+18.5%) on the network and an increase in data usage (up 85.9%
to 256,301 Terabyte). Data revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 26.3% to 28.4%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to grow strongly (up 28.0%) in a year in which we marked the 10th
anniversary of MoMo in Ghana. MoMo growth was attributable to an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+8.9%), commissions on cash-in-cash-out transactions, increased transactional activity of
person-to-person (P2P) transactions as well as good growth in more advanced services - such as retail
merchant payments. MoMo revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 17.9% to 18.6%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 65.7% with a YoY EBITDA
margin expansion of 13.2 pp to 50.8%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management fee, the like-for-
like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 pp to 43.5% (2018 EBITDA margin: 37.6%). The margin improvement
was supported by lower operating expenses, prudent revenue initiatives as well as distribution
efficiencies.

We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 280 2G, 557 3G, 900 4G and 100 rural telephony
sites.

On the regulatory front, during the year the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed into law.
This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required of existing players, we have
applied for the new licence.

MTN Ghana continues to engage with regulatory stakeholders and maintains a firm focus on achieving
continued improvements in customer experience.

Following the expiry of certain technology licences in 2019, the NCA has renewed our 2G licence for 15
years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our International Gateway and Fixed Access
licences, which are pending NCA approval.

We continued to invest in our communities, with the MTN Ghana Foundation support reaching a total of
149 projects since inception in 2007. In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education,
three in health and one in economic empowerment.

The board of MTN Ghana declared an interim dividend of 2 pesewas per share after reviewing the mid-
year performance of the Company. After reviewing the full year performance of the Company, the board
of MTN Ghana shall be recommending a final dividend of 4 pesewas per share, bringing the total dividend
for the 2019 year to 6 pesewas per share. This represents 73.1% of profit after tax and a 20.0% increase
in dividend per share.

2019 marked the  year of the customer' for MTN Ghana and in 2020 we are building on that foundation
as we transition from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an emerging digital operator.
In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the  year of the customer: the digital
experience' with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value
for our shareholders.

Trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2019


MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the year ended 31 December 2019, which
will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (""SENS"") on or about
Wednesday, 11 March 2020.


MTN has adopted the new accounting standard on leases, IFRS 16, with effect from 1 January 2019
and, as permitted by the standard, comparative numbers have not been restated and remain on the
previous accounting treatment of operating leases in accordance with IAS 17. The adoption of IFRS 16
has resulted in an approximately 13% reduction in the reported earnings numbers, arising primarily
from the net effects of (a) lower operating lease costs, (b) higher finance costs, and (c) higher
depreciation charges.

Shareholders are advised that MTN expects to report growth in headline earnings per share (""HEPS""),
on an IFRS reported basis (2018 on IAS 17 and 2019 on IFRS 16) of between 30% and 50%, i.e. HEPS of
between 438 cents and 506 cents for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared with HEPS of 337
cents for the prior financial year. The change in earnings per share (""EPS"") is expected to be between
0% and 10% i.e. a figure of between 485 cents and 534 cents compared with EPS of 485 cents for the
prior financial year.

Attorney General of Nigeria Withdraws USD2 billion Tax Demand Against MTN Nigeria and Refers
Matter to Tax Authorities


On 4 September 2018, MTN announced that MTN Nigeria Communications PLC (""MTN Nigeria"") was
disputing a claim for back taxes of approximately USD2 billion by the Attorney General of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria and Minister of Justice (the ""AGF""). Subsequent to this, MTN Nigeria commenced
legal action in Nigeria against the AGF, which court action was most recently postponed to 30 and
31 January 2020.


MTN Nigeria has been informed by means of a letter received by its legal counsel and dated
8 January 2020, that following careful review and due consultation with relevant statutory agencies,
the AGF has decided to refer the matter to the relevant authorities, being the Federal Inland Revenue
Service (""FIRS"") and Nigeria Customs (""NC""), with a view to them resolving the issues. Accordingly,
the AGF has withdrawn its letter of demand for the aforementioned USD2 billion that was issued in
August 2018.


MTN Nigeria will consequently follow due court process to withdraw its legal action against the AGF
and engage with FIRS and NC on this issue. MTN remains committed to building and maintaining
cordial relationships with all regulatory authorities in Nigeria.

Significant Progress in MTN's Asset Realisation Programme

MTN announced its Asset Realisation Programme (""ARP"") in March 2019 which aims to reduce debt,
simplify its portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise capital of at least R15 billion over three years
(excluding the IHS investment). MTN is pleased to announce the conclusion of two important transactions
reflecting the ongoing progress of this programme.

Firstly, and further to MTN's quarterly update for the period ended 30 September 2019 announcement
released on 31 October 2019, MTN has concluded an agreement to dispose of its 49% equity holdings in
Ghana Tower Interco B.V. (""Ghana Interco"") and Uganda Tower Interco B.V. (""Uganda Interco"") to AT Sher
Netherlands Cooperatief U.A. (""ATC"") for $523 million, approximately R7.3 billion, in cash.

The sale is conditional on customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in Q1 2020. On closing
MTN will record a profit on disposal of approximately R6 billion.

Secondly, as part of the ARP, the redemption of MTN Nigeria preference shares was envisaged as a
necessary part of the simplification of its capital structure.

MTN hereby confirms that the necessary processes have been finalised for the redemption of MTN
Nigeria preference shares for a consideration to MTN of US$315 million (approximately R4,4 billion),
which was received on 31 December 2019.

Following the completion of these transactions, MTN will have realised approximately R14 billion within
the first 12 months of its guided three-year ARP. MTN intends to use the proceeds to pay down US$ debt
and for general corporate purposes. We remain focused on continuing to execute on the important
strategic priorities of reducing debt, simplifying the portfolio and reducing risk.

About Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco

Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco were formed when MTN sold its towers in Ghana and Uganda to
its joint ventures with ATC in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

MTN holds 49% in Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco, and each of these companies hold 100% in ATC
Ghana Limited and ATC Uganda Limited respectively, which in turn own and lease tower assets in their
respective countries.

MTN Statement on Complaint for Violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act

On 27 December 2019 a complaint for violation of the anti-terrorism act was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia (""The Complaint""). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians, and their families, who were killed or wounded in
Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017.

The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making
payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure. The defendants named in the complaint are
six different groups one of which is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies including MTN
Afghanistan.

MTN is reviewing the details of the report and is consulting its advisers but remains of the view that
it conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories and so intends to
defend its position where necessary.

MTN Group shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 3 May 2019.

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, MTN Group
shareholders are advised of the following changes to the MTN Group board of directors (""Board"").

    1. The Chairman of MTN Group, Phuthuma Nhleko, has stepped down from the Board on 15
       December 2019 after overseeing an orderly transition of the Board including the establishment
       of the International Advisory Board.

    2. Further, Alan Harper, Jeff Van Rooyen and Koosum Kaylan have stepped down from the Board
       on 15 December 2019 after an orderly transition and handover to incoming directors.

    3. Mcebisi Jonas assumed the position of Chairman of MTN Group with effect from 15 December

MTN Group from a plucky start-up into one of Africa's largest multinational businesses.

Phuthuma expressed his gratitude to the retiring directors and the Board for persisting passionately on
a roadmap (with twists, turns and diversions) that they collectively forged at strategy sessions. He
wished the entire MTN Group family the very best in continuing to etch a Pan African vision, and
mentioned that there is still a lot to be achieved and celebrated in the future, and he has no doubt the
MTN Group ""can do spirit"" will prevail in realizing the full potential of this vision.

to MTN Group and across all the markets that MTN Group operates in.

Release of Competition Commission of South Africa's summary report on data services market
enquiry

MTN Group has noted the release of the Competition Commission of South Africa's summary report
on the final findings of the data services market enquiry, released on Monday, 2 December 2019.

The detailed report from the Competition Commission is yet to be released. We are currently studying
the summary report and will not be able to comment in more detail until we have seen the full
document. We are also reviewing the ICASA discussion document released last Friday.

We reiterate comments made earlier in the year that MTN South Africa has substantially reduced the
effective price of data in South Africa, having also invested heavily in the network to
accommodate growing data demand with limited spectrum availability. MTN Group has invested over
R50 billion in the South African network in the last five years and has pledged a further R50 billion of
investment over the next five years as part of delivering a world-class network for all South Africans.

We remain committed to providing high quality, affordable data and connectivity to our customers in
all our markets. We will continue with our pricing transformation initiatives across all our markets to
make our services more affordable for customers.

Radio spectrum is the digital highway upon which we depend to carry increasing mobile data at more
cost-effective prices. This is acutely felt in South Africa that has amongst the lowest spectrum
allocation in all our MTN markets. The release of new spectrum in this market will greatly assist our
ability to service more customers with more data traffic.

We respectfully disagree with the analysis and recommendations contained in the summary report
and, as we study the full report, will continue to engage constructively and vigorously defend against
overbroad and intrusive recommendations.

Mandatory audit firm rotation


The group is required to rotate its auditors by 2024 in accordance with mandatory audit firm rotation
regulations issued by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA). Both the current joint
group auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers and SNG Grant Thornton, are required to rotate off the
group audit. In addition, MTN Nigeria is required to rotate auditors following the introduction of the
Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance (NCCG) which became effective on 15 January 2019.

As a result of these regulations to strengthen the independence of the external audit function, and in
recognition of this emerging best practice governance trend, the group audit committee concluded a
comprehensive tender process and the board will be recommending Ernst & Young (EY) as the new
joint group audit firm for approval by shareholders at the AGM in May 2020.

The group audit committee also evaluated the best approach to reduce audit risk during the transition
of audit firms and concluded on a phased transition approach for the current joint audit arrangement.
The group will maintain its joint audit approach during the transition period and, following shareholder
approval, EY will replace SNG Grant Thornton for the 2021 financial period as the joint group audit
firm. PricewaterhouseCoopers will rotate off the MTN Group audit following the transition period. The
group will evaluate the continuation of a joint audit approach following this transition period.


The development of the audit profession remains a focus for the group and in this regard the group
will be monitoring certain internal transformation targets as committed by EY as well as initiatives
agreed on to build local audit knowledge, experience and capabilities in the telecommunications
sector.

MTN South Africa signs an expanded roaming agreement with Cell C

MTN Group confirms that MTN South Africa has signed a new long-form roaming and services
agreement with Cell C, subject to certain conditions precedent.

In May 2018, Cell C signed its first roaming agreement with MTN, providing Cell C with 2G, 3G and
4G roaming services on MTN's network in select areas of South Africa. The new agreement will see
this access expanded to enable Cell C to roam on MTN's network in all areas of the country.

This is aligned to MTN's strategy to further develop the group's wholesale business and will allow
both MTN and Cell C to harness greater efficiencies in providing telecommunications services, while
supporting a more sustainable and competitive industry.

MTN looks forward to transparent engagement with relevant stakeholders regarding this important
industry milestone.

As noted in our quarterly trading update for the period ended September 2019, MTN SA continues
to account for Cell C roaming revenue on a cash basis, and payments received since June 2019 have
remained on schedule. Cell C continues to work on its recapitalisation and liquidity challenges which,
if adequately resolved, would result in a change in MTN's accounting treatment of Cell C roaming
revenues back to an accrual accounting methodology.

LISTING OF MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI (RF) LIMITED ON THE EXCHANGE OPERATED BY THE JSE LIMITED


1. Introduction
   Holders of MTNZF ordinary shares (""MTNZF Shareholders"") are advised that the JSE Limited (""JSE"")
   has granted the approval of a listing of the entire issued ordinary share capital of MTNZF, being
   123 416 826 ordinary shares of no par value, (""MTNZF Shares"") as ""asset backed securities""
   (as defined in the JSE Listings Requirements) on the ""BEE Segment"" (as defined in the JSE Listings
   Requirements), and on the ""Nonequity Investment Instruments"" sector of the main board of the
   exchange operated by the JSE, from the commencement of trade on Monday, 25 November 2019
   (""BEE Listing""). The MTNZF Shares will be listed and admitted to trading on the JSE under the full
   name of ""MTN Zakhele Futhi"", the abbreviated name of ""MTNZFuthi"" and the JSE share code: MTNZF 
   and ISIN: ZAE000279402.

   This announcement does not constitute an offer to buy or sell MTNZF Shares but is for
   information purposes only.

2. Salient terms of and rationale for the BEE Listing
   MTNZF was established in 2016 as a ring-fenced special purpose vehicle for the specific purpose
   of facilitating the investment by previously disadvantaged South Africans in MTN Group Limited
   (""MTN""), a leading emerging markets telecommunications service provider, via MTNZF's
   approximate 4% stake in MTN. The BEE Listing will facilitate and enable trading in MTNZF Shares
   amongst qualifying Black Participants, as defined in the MTNZF memorandum of incorporation
   (""Black Participants"").

   MTNZF Shares will be traded on the exchange operated by the JSE only in uncertificated (i.e.
   dematerialised) form. MTNZF will list on the BEE Segment of the main board of the exchange
   operated by the JSE pursuant to the use of a ""BEE verification agent"" as contemplated in the JSE
   Listings Requirements. The BEE Listing is expected to endure for a period of five years from the
   date of listing (""BEE Listing Period""). Subsequent to the BEE Listing and for the duration of the BEE
   Listing Period, the trading in, and transfer of, MTNZF Shares will be subject to certain verification
   terms and conditions and to various restrictions set out in the MTNZF memorandum of
   incorporation and the Relationship Agreement concluded between MTNZF and MTN on 9 August 2016, 
   and to which each MTNZF Shareholder is or becomes a party, which stipulate, inter alia, that
   the MTNZF Shares may only be owned by Black Participants and may not be encumbered.

   Upon the expiration of the BEE Listing Period, i.e. from 25 November 2024, the MTNZF Shares will
   no longer be subject to the above terms, conditions and restrictions. MTNZF's listing on the JSE
   will not automatically discontinue after the expiration of the BEE Listing Period but may be subject
   to such alternative structure or arrangement collaboratively determined by MTNZF, MTN, the
   holders (if any) of cumulative redeemable non-participating, unlisted preference shares in the
   issued share capital of MTNZF, as applicable, and MTNZF Shareholders, in consultation with the
   JSE.

3. Share capital
   At the date of the BEE Listing, the authorised share capital of MTNZF will comprise 300 000 000
   MTNZF Shares and 3 200 000 cumulative redeemable non-participating, unlisted preference shares
   (""MTNZF Pref Shares""). The issued share capital of MTNZF will comprise 123 416 826 fully paid-up,
   listed MTNZF Shares and 1 172 468 fully paid-up, unlisted MTNZF Pref Shares.

4. Directors
   The board of directors of MTNZF (""MTNZF Directors"") comprise only independent non-executive
   directors, and MTNZF does not employ any employees.

   The details of the MTNZF Directors on the date of the BEE Listing are set out below. All the MTNZF
   Directors are South African citizens with their business addresses being the registered office of
   MTNZF (as detailed at the end of this announcement).

On 22 August 2016, MTN Group Limited (""MTN"") announced the details of
its 2016 Black Economic Empowerment (""BEE"")    ownership transaction
(the ""2016 MTN BEE Transaction""), in terms of which: (i) MTN Zakhele
Futhi (RF) Ltd (""MTN Zakhele Futhi"") issued ordinary shares to
qualifying members of the Black public; and (ii) MTN Zakhele Futhi
acquired   MTN  ordinary   shares,   at   a  discount,   constituting
approximately 4% of the issued share capital of MTN (using a
combination of notional vendor finance from MTN and third-party
preference share funding).
The MTN board of directors (""MTN Board"") passed a resolution approving
certain proposed voluntary amendments to the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction.
MTN has either already implemented or is in the process of finalising
the implementation of these voluntary amendments, in order to enhance
the MTN Zakhele Futhi BEE scheme, and to further strengthen the
governance and oversight of the MTN Zakhele Futhi board of directors
(""MTN Zakhele Futhi Board"") and its interaction with MTN, as follows
(the ""Amendments""):

  (i)   The annual general meeting (""AGM"") of MTN Zakhele Futhi will
        be held before the MTN AGM so that the MTN Zakhele Futhi Board
        can seek guidance from MTN Zakhele Futhi shareholders as to
        how resolutions at the MTN AGM should be voted. An MTN
        representative will attend MTN Zakhele Futhi AGMs to answer
        questions relating to MTN and the proposed MTN resolutions,
        if asked. Similar arrangements will be put in place with
        respect to MTN extraordinary general meetings (if any).

  (ii) MTN's veto with respect to the declaration of dividends by
        MTN Zakhele Futhi has been removed and replaced with a ratio-
        based dividends test for dividend declarations.

  (iii) MTN will engage with the MTN Zakhele Futhi Board (as it does
        with other substantial shareholders) with respect to MTN's
        financial results, strategy and other operational issues.
        This is usually done on a bi-annual basis when MTN's audited
        financial statements are released.

  (iv) The MTN Zakhele Futhi Board can appoint the Board chairperson
        from among its members (who accordingly need not be an MTN
        director, as was previously required).

  (v) Certain MTN Zakhele Futhi Board decisions used to require the
        approval of at least one of the MTN appointed directors. These
        veto rights have been removed.

  (vi) MTN, rather than directly appointing its nominees to the MTN
        Zakhele Futhi Board, would instead be entitled to propose
        such nominees to the MTN Zakhele Futhi Board for them to be
        appointed, if acceptable to the MTN Zakhele Futhi Board. Such
        directors would then stand for election by the MTN Zakhele
        Futhi shareholders at the next AGM, and thereafter would
        retire by rotation, as with the other MTN Zakhele Futhi
        directors.

  (vii) Previously at least one of the two MTN directors had to be
        present at MTN Zakhele Futhi Board meetings for a quorum to
        be constituted. The MTN director quorum requirement has been
        removed.

In addition to the above Amendments, the MTN Zakhele Futhi Board has
the right to nominate one of its members for appointment to the MTN
Board. Any such appointment will be subject to successful completion
of the usual MTN Board appointment and approval processes.
Based on confirmation from MTN and its legal advisers as well as the
pro forma financial effects of the Amendments reported on by MTN's
joint auditors (as required by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") Guidance
Letter: Amending Transaction terms as approved by shareholders dated
8 May 2012), MTN is comfortable that the Amendments, while they are
significant from an empowerment perspective, (i) do not conflict with
the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction as approved by MTN shareholders on 7
October 2016, and (ii) are not material to the MTN shareholders, as
the Amendments do not materially alter the economics of the 2016 MTN
BEE Transaction as approved by MTN shareholders on 7 October 2016.
The JSE issued a no objection letter, and accordingly, the Amendments
are not being referred back to MTN shareholders for approval.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
"" M TN grew service revenue and EBITDA in the third quarter, despite
challenging trading conditions. This was supported by solid
commercial momentum and operational execution in most of our
markets.

The group benefited from strong performances in Nigeria and Ghana,
which generated double-digit service revenue growth and improved
EBITDA margins, driving growth in group service revenue of 9,6%* YoY
and in EBITDA of 11,8%*. The group's EBITDA margin improved by 0.6pp
to 35,1%* on an IAS 17 basis.

The performance of MTN South Africa continued to be impacted by a
weak economy, the implementation of lower out-of-bundle data prices,
new data usage rules and unrecognised roaming revenue from Cell C.
MTN SA continues to account for Cell C roaming revenue on a cash
basis, and payments received since June 2019 have remained on
schedule. A change in the accounting treatment back to recognising
revenue on an accrual accounting methodology, will occur upon
adequate resolution of Cell C's liquidity challenges.

Across the group, we are on track with delivering our strategy. This
is reflected in ongoing voice, data and fintech revenue growth of
4,4%, 21,5% and 30,9% respectively. Digital revenue declined by
46,4% as we continued to optimise our legacy value-added services
(VAS) business. In Nigeria we have achieved a return to positive QoQ
digital revenue growth following completion of the VAS optimisation
in that market.

The group added 3,5 million subscribers in the third quarter, making
progress in building the digital operator with the addition of 4,7
million active data users and 2,2 million Mobile Money (MoMo)
subscribers. We have recorded 515 000 monthly active users on our
Ayoba messaging platform, now launched in five markets namely South
Africa, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Congo Brazzaville. We have
commenced scaling our MoMo agency network in Nigeria under our
super-agent licence with 66 282 agents now registered. We continue
to engage the Central Bank of Nigeria on our application for a
payment service bank licence.

MTN remains committed to delivering on our asset realisation
programme, which aims to simplify our portfolio, reduce risk,
improve returns and realise capital of at least R15 billion over a
three-year period.""




The group's results are presented in line with the group's operational
structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa and
Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the

Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau.
The MENA region includes Iran   (joint   venture   equity   accounted),   Syria,
Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan.
The operation in Cyprus was disposed of and is no longer included in the
results effective 4 September 2018. Although Iran, Botswana and eSwatini
form part of their respective regions geographically and operationally,
they are excluded from their respective regional results because Iran ,
Botswana  and   eSwatini  are   equity  accounted  for  by   the  group.




                                                                               4
MTN South Africa
MTN South Africa recorded service revenue growth of 0,4% in
difficult trading conditions. If an accrual basis of accounting
was applied to Cell C roaming revenue, MTN South Africa would have
recorded service revenue growth of 3,5%. Overall subscribers
reduced slightly by 0,3 million QoQ, ending the quarter with a
base of 28,9 million.

Service revenue growth was negatively affected by a 4,6% YoY
decline in consumer prepaid service revenue for the nine months to
September 2019. This was impacted by out-of-bundle (OOB) data
tariff reductions and ICASA's End User Subscriber Service Charter
regulations (which came into effect on 1 March 2019) against the
backdrop of a challenging economic environment.

The trend in consumer prepaid revenue in the September 2019
quarter was encouraging, with the decline in the three months
moderating to 2,7% YoY compared to a 5,1% YoY decline in the three
months to June 2019. We remain focused on returning to growth,
supported by stabilising trends in voice and improvements in data.
In the third quarter, data revenue showed encouraging YoY momentum
with a return to positive growth recorded      compared to a YoY
decline in the second quarter ended June 2019.

We discontinued the 1GB acquisition promotion in prepaid,
targeting distribution efficiencies, and this resulted in a 0,4
million QoQ reduction in subscribers in the quarter to a closing
base of around 23 million. We anticipate a normalisation of the
base and customer profile by the first half of 2020.

The consumer postpaid business delivered service revenue growth of
5,8% YoY in a highly competitive market. Net subscriber additions
of 80 620 QoQ were relatively muted, reflecting the tough trading
environment and lower acquisition volumes as we continued to
implement stricter vetting rules aimed at reducing credit risk and
enhancing subscriber quality. We recorded positive momentum in
postpaid data traffic, which increased by nearly 31% YoY in the
nine months to September 2019.

Wholesale revenue grew by 59,4% YoY, and included Telkom roaming
revenues for the first six months (Our network roaming agreement
with Telkom came to an end on 28 June 2019) as well as Cell C
roaming revenues for the first four months of the year. As a
result of delayed payments from Cell C during the first half, we
reassessed revenue recognition criteria and at end June 2019 we
recognised Cell C revenue on a cash basis in compliance with IFRS
15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For the nine months to
September 2019, we continued to recognise this revenue in line
with the treatment at June 2019.

Cell C has fulfilled all its commitments in line with the revised
payment plan agreed after MTN's interim period-end. We remain in
discussion with Cell C regarding a revised roaming agreement.
Further details on this matter are given later in this trading
update.


                                                                     5
The recovery in the enterprise business continued, with the
decline in service revenue slowing to 7,0% YoY in the nine months
to September 2019, compared to a 7,9% decline in June 2019. For
the three months to September 2019, the YoY decline was 5%. We are
focused on further improving this trend, supported by reduced
churn, strong growth in the enterprise business base with
significant contract wins across the large enterprises and public
sector segments. We expect these interventions to impact
positively on the next few quarters as we target a return to YoY
growth in the fourth quarter.

On an IAS 17 basis, MTN South Africa's EBITDA margin was 33,2%, a
decline of 1,3 percentage points (pp) resulting from the reduction
of OOB tariffs and higher handset costs as we sold more higher-
value 3G and 4G devices to enable our data growth efforts. The
expansion of our network footprint also increased associated
running costs. Payments received from Cell C in the quarter were
applied entirely against outstanding debtors, resulting in a
reversal of the impairment raised at the interim stage.

MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria delivered a solid performance in a competitive
environment, increasing service revenue by 12,1% YoY, in line with
our medium-term guidance of double-digit growth. This was driven
by growth in voice and data revenue.

Voice revenue grew by 10,1% YoY, supported by subscriber growth
and our customer value management (CVM) initiatives. At the end of
the quarter, MTN Nigeria recorded 61,6 million subscribers, up 0,1
million QoQ. We were required to undertake a SIM re-registration
process, which resulted in a disconnection of about 576,000 active
subscribers, negatively impacting base growth.

We continued to focus on maintaining our commercial momentum in
Nigeria, recording data revenue growth of 35,3% YoY in the nine
months to September 2019, which was driven by a 75,1% increase in
data traffic over the same period; an acceleration from the 67%
traffic growth in the six months to June 2019. This came on the
back of increased active data users on our network as we recorded
1,6 million more QoQ active data users, closing the quarter with
22,3 million users.

The acceleration in data traffic was assisted by the access to
additional 800MHz spectrum, granted in April 2019, as well as the
ramp-up in our 4G footprint, increasing our population coverage to
over 35% at September 2019, from 28,6% at June 2019. This
supported growth in the number of 4G devices and subscribers on
our network.

Our fintech business continued to expand, delivering revenue
growth of 21,7%. We note the granting by the Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN) in September of three approvals-in-principle for
payment service banking (PSB) licences. We continue to engage with
the CBN regarding our application for a PSB licence.

In the interim, we continue to roll out basic financial services

                                                                     6
under our super-agent licence. We currently have 66 282 registered
agents and target a total of 100 000 agents by the end of the
year. The super-agent licence allows us to leverage our
established distribution channels to offer basic banking products
including person-to-person money transfers. A PSB licence will
enable us in time to offer a broader and deeper range of mobile
financial services.

MTN Nigeria reported an EBITDA margin of 44,7% on an IAS 17 basis,
on the back of good revenue growth, effective cost management and
the benefits of our VAS optimisation initiatives.

In August 2019, MTN Nigeria declared dividends of which MTN Group's
portion amounting to c$116 million was upstreamed.

Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
The SEAGHA region continued to deliver strong results, with all
operations contributing positively to service revenue growth of
22,3%. Data and fintech revenue increased across the region and we
recorded a 1,0 million QoQ increase in subscribers to 47 million.

Ghana is the largest market within SEAGHA and performed strongly,
delivering local currency service revenue growth of 22,7% YoY
supported by resilient growth in voice, data and mobile financial
services. The EBITDA margin improved by 4,0pp to 41,5% on an IAS 17
basis.

West and Central Africa (WECA)
The WECA region delivered encouraging results, with service
revenue increasing by 1,9%, an improvement from the 0,5% recorded
in the first half. MTN Ivory Coast continued to record revenue
declines, mainly as a result of competitive pressures, although
the rate of decline is moderating. In Cameroon, the operating
environment remained challenging, with conflict in the Northwest
and Southwest regions. Total WECA subscribers increased by 0,8
million QoQ to 34,6 million.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
The MENA region recorded a pleasing performance in the quarter,
with service revenue up by 21% (excluding MTN Cyprus from the
prior year comparison). This was supported by solid growth in data
revenue. Subscribers (excluding Iran) increased by 0,8 million QoQ
to 25,8 million.

MTN Irancell delivered a solid performance considering the re-
introduction of US sanctions: service revenue grew in constant
currency at 21,1% YoY, with the EBITDA margin declining by 1,0pp
to 34,6% on an IAS 17 basis on the back of high inflation in the
market. MTN Irancell is a joint venture that is equity accounted
in our results.

Update on Cell C roaming agreement
In the 2019 interim results announcement, MTN reported that we had
reassessed the revenue recognition criteria relating to the
network roaming agreement with Cell C following delayed payments

                                                                      7
and, as a result, did not recognise revenue amounting to        R393
million.

In addition, we recognised an impairment of Cell C receivables
amounting to R211 million after taking into account cash received
subsequent to the 30 June 2019 reporting period.

The group received R451 million from Cell C during the 3rd quarter
which represents all amounts due from Cell C in accordance with
the agreed payment plan. These receipts were not recognised as
revenue but applied against the outstanding debtor's balance and
this resulted in a reversal of the R211 million impairment loss
recorded at 30 June 2019.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the group received a
further R291 million from Cell C, which will first be applied to the
outstanding debtor's balance with the remainder recognised as
revenue in Q4 based on the consideration received.

As at 30 September 2019 the unrecognised revenue amounted to R817
million.

The group will continue to recognise revenue based on non-refundable
consideration actually received on roaming services delivered to
Cell C and will only revert to recognising revenue as and when the
services are rendered when it is considered probable, as guided by
IFRS 15, that the group will collect all the consideration that it
is entitled to in terms of the roaming agreement. This will require
Cell C's liquidity challenges to be adequately resolved.

Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme
We continue to make progress on the asset realisation programme
that we announced in March 2019. The programme aims, over the next
three years, to simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve
returns and realise capital of at least R15 billion. This figure
excludes our investment in IHS, which we fair valued at R23
billion at end-June 2019.

In the first half, we realised a total of R2,1 billion through the
sale of our shareholder loan in ATC Ghana to American Towers (ATC)
for R900 million as well as the sale of our interests in
investment fund Amadeus and its associated holding in Travelstart
for net proceeds of R1,2 billion.

Following ATC's announcement of its acquisition of Eaton Towers, we
are in advanced discussions to sell our 49% holdings in ATC Ghana
Interco and ATC Uganda Interco to ATC, subject to the completion of
ATC's acquisition of Eaton Towers and relevant approvals. Should the
transaction be completed, we anticipate the valuation would be in
the range of R7 billion - R8 billion, and expect proceeds to be
received in Q1 2020.

The post-IPO lock up period for our 18.9% investment in Jumia
                            th
Technologies AG expired on 9 October 2019. Jumia's American
Depositary Share (ADS) price as at 29 October 2019 was $6.46,
valuing our stake at R1.4 billion.

We also continue to work on the redemption of MTN Nigeria
preference shares for a consideration of US$315 million. We expect

                                                                       8
this to be finalised after the necessary regulatory processes are
completed.

We previously announced our acceptance of an unsolicited offer for
the disposal of our 53% shareholding in Mascom Wireless Botswana
(Mascom) to Econet International Limited. As certain conditions to
the transaction were not met, a decision was reached during the
third quarter to terminate the planned disposal.    The accounting
treatment for Mascom will thus revert to being equity accounted as
a joint venture for the 2019 financial year, from being classified
as a non-current asset held for sale since 1 December 2018. Equity
accounting will be applied retrospectively as from the date of its
classification as held for sale. The equity accounted earnings
relating to Mascom amounted to R331 million for the nine months
ended 30 September 2019 and includes earnings of R81 million
relating to 2018 that was not previously recognised as a result of
the classification as a non-current asset held for sale.

Spectrum auction in South Africa
In July 2019, South Africa's Minister of Communications issued a
policy direction on the issuing of high-demand spectrum and
licensing of a proposed wholesale open access network (WOAN). The
regulator ICASA continues to work on the auctioning rules and on
defining the spectrum licensing process for both the proposed WOAN
and the existing operators, including MTN, who will be invited to
participate in an auction to obtain high-demand spectrum licences.

We continue to engage with the Minister and ICASA on the release
of further high-demand spectrum, including the 5G bands, which
will further enable the drive to lower the cost of data.

Tax dispute between MTN Nigeria and the Attorney General of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria
The hearing on the Attorney General of the Federation matter was set
down for hearing on 29 October 2019. The matter was adjourned to 30
and 31 January 2020 for commencement of trial. MTN maintains that it
has complied with its tax obligations and will continue to defend
this position vigorously.

Uganda licence renewal
We continue to engage with Ugandan authorities on renewing our
licence. An extension has been granted until the end of 2019.

Outlook
Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our BRIGHT strategy
to deliver sustainable growth in our operations and simplify our
portfolio to reduce risk and improve returns.

In South Africa, we are making progress in our turnaround
initiatives   against   a   challenging  macro   and   competitive
environment, with improving trends in enterprise service revenue
during the third quarter which we expect to continue and target a
return to positive YoY growth in the fourth quarter. We expect OOB
tariff reductions and end-user regulations to weigh on consumer

                                                                     9
prepaid revenue until early 2020 when the effects of these will
lap out of the base; in the meantime we are making further
progress in lowering churn and stabilising the quality of the
base.

Wholesale service revenue in South Africa will be impacted into
the year-end by the rolling off of our roaming agreement with
Telkom which ended in June 2019. As we recognise Cell C roaming
revenue on a cash basis, this will also impact service revenue
growth in the fourth quarter. We are focused on completing a
broader roaming agreement with Cell C by year-end, which would
help return our wholesale business to a more sustainable footing
beyond the current financial year. Wholesale revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2019 will measure against a strong base in the fourth
quarter of 2018 that included both Telkom and Cell C roaming
revenue.

In Nigeria, we have seen an acceleration in data revenue growth
since gaining access to additional 800Mhz spectrum and supported
by expanding our 4G footprint. We currently have 4G services
across 80 cities and plan to have covered an additional 122 cities
by the end of the year. We remain focused on expanding our super-
agent licence distribution and target having 100 000 agents
licensed by the end of 2019 as we execute on our Mobile Money
ambitions in Nigeria. We are confident in maintaining service
revenue and EBITDA growth in line with our medium-term guidance.

We remain committed to our medium-term guidance and dividend
policy, including asset realisation of cash to the holding company
of R15 billion over a three-year period (excluding IHS).

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based,
including constant currency information, has not been reviewed and reported
on by MTN's external auditors. Constant currency information has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the
group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the
current financial reporting period's results have been adjusted to the
prior period average exchange rates determined as the average of the
monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the
group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian
naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on
the current year constant currency results compared to the prior year
results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South
Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared
excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan
and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period under review
and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Commentary
MTN Ghana delivered a solid performance for the period. Service
revenue increased by 22.7% YoY, supported by resilient growth in
voice, data and mobile financial services. Voice revenue increased by
                                                           *
19.0% mainly attributable to good growth in subscribers , customer
value management and continued improvements made to our network. These
also contributed to a strong data revenue growth (+32.6%). Mobile
financial services revenue grew by 45.0% driven by innovations in
service delivery and deepening the ecosystem. An increase in active
                   *
mobile money users (+2.2%) also contributed to growth and benefited
from an increase in regional activations.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
grew by 63.0% with an EBITDA margin expansion of 12.4 percentage
points (pp) to 50.0%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management
fee, the like-for-like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.3 pp to 42.9%
mainly as a result of increased distribution efficiencies.
We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 350 2G, 627 3G,

MTN Nigeria is one of Africa's largest providers of communications
services, connecting over 61 million people in communities across the
country with each other and the world. Guided by a vision to lead
the delivery of a bold new digital world, MTN Nigeria's leadership
position in coverage, capacity and innovation has remained constant
since its launch in 2001. MTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group - a
multinational telecommunications group which operates in 21 countries
in Africa and the Middle East.

MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria) announces its unaudited
results for the nine months ended 30 September 2019. In January 2019,
MTN Nigeria adopted IFRS 16 and adjustments are reflected in the
results.

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

""Our performance was very encouraging, demonstrating the resilience
of our business despite a challenging operating environment. We
sustained double-digit growth in service revenue led by growth in
voice and data revenue.




                                                                                   1
We recorded 61.6 million subscribers, representing a 0.1 million
increase QoQ. We were required to undertake a SIM re-registration
process, which resulted in a disconnection of around 0.6 million
active subscribers, limiting base growth.

During the quarter, we focused on the end-to-end optimisation and
repositioning of our data offerings. We made significant investments
in accelerating 4G network expansion; and leveraging 800MHz spectrum
activated in Q2 2019, we launched enhanced 4G+ services in Lagos,
Abuja, and Port-Harcourt. We also changed our pricing strategy,
placing us in an even stronger competitive position going forward. As
a result, we have begun to see promising results with active data
subscriber net additions of 1.6 million and 4G population coverage at
over 35% in 64 cities. Data traffic volume also increased by over 68%,
while data revenue rose by 34.9% yoy.

We continued to sustain EDITDA margin expansion and operating leverage
with EBITDA growth ahead of revenue and inflation at 39.3%, while
growth in profit after tax and earnings per share remained strong at
29% apiece.

During the period, we obtained Platinum accreditation from Investor
in People (IiP), a global body that assesses the people practices of
companies across 75 countries. This achievement reflects the premium
we place on our people, and places MTN Nigeria among the best companies
to work for globally.""

Operational review

Service revenue grew in line with our medium-term double-digit
guidance to N854.9 billion (+12.1% yoy), driven by increases of 10.1%
and 34.9% respectively in voice and data revenue. Voice remains a key
contributor to service revenue at 73.5% (Q3 2018: 74.8%), with its
growth supported by an increase in subscribers, relatively stable
tariffs and our targeted segment offerings using our customer value
management toolkit.

Data contributed 18.0% (Q3 2018: 15.0%) to service revenue, with
strong growth attributable to the recent data price revamp, consumer
education and improved 4G coverage after we obtained access to the
800MHz spectrum in Q2 2019. We recorded a significant increase in both
active data users and the number of smartphones on our network, which
resulted in higher data usage. We added 1.6 million smartphones on
our network, increasing smartphone penetration to 41.7%. The number
of active data subscribers increased by 7.6% to 22.3 million, driving
data traffic growth of 68.9%.

Improving the customer journey and experience on value-added services
(VAS) remains a priority. Following the completion of our VAS
optimization, digital revenue returned to growth on a sequential QoQ


                                                                      2
basis, recording a 25.7% increase. We continue to focus on building a
sustainable active user base for our digital business.

Our fintech business continued to gain traction with 21.7% YoY growth
in revenue driven by increased adoption of the Xtratime service, which
allows subscribers to borrow airtime. We launched our super-agent
services in August 2019 and recorded 66,000 registered agents, giving
our customers access to financial services. We continue to focus on
expanding the number of agent touchpoints to more towns and cities to
achieve mass adoption; while exploring local remittances across
payment corridors.

Our enterprise1 business segment continued to deliver solid results,
with revenue growth of 28.7% to contribute 12.0% (Q3 2018: 10.5%) to
service revenue.

On an IAS 17 basis, we maintained operating expenses growth below
inflation at 9.3%. This reflects progress with our cost management
initiatives. Consequently, we achieved EBITDA growth ahead of revenue
at 15.8% with a 1.5pp margin improvement to 44.7%. Reported EBITDA
(IFRS 16) rose by 39.3% with a margin of 53.7%. During the period, we
made significant investment in our network to improve service quality
and drive 4G expansion, which resulted in a 3.6pp increase in capex
intensity to 18.0%.

Overall, our bottom-line remained strong with growth of 24.0% and
28.9% respectively in profit before and after tax. Earnings per share
increased by 29.0% to N7.29k.

    Corporate and legal matters

Appointment of external auditors

-   In accordance with the Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance,
     PricewaterhouseCoopers was not reappointed at our last Annual
     General Meeting held on 8 April 2019, having served as external
     auditors for over 10 years. Consequently, in accordance with the
     provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, the Board of
     Directors appointed Grant Thornton to fill the casual vacancy
     created in the role of external auditor and carry out the statutory
     audit of the financial statements for the year ending 31 December
     2019.


USSD billing

-   Our extensive engagements with banks over implementation of end
     user billing for USSD-based banking services reflects our
     determination to find a solution that is affordable for the consumer
     and drives maximum uptake and use of financial services. Banks had
     always been on a corporate billing plan that allows them to pay the
     USSD access fees at a wholesale price. We view this as an efficient
     model that eliminates separate charges by the banks and telecoms
     companies, which in the end ensures billing transparency. We
     believe that costs associated with USSD banking services should be
     charged to the consumer once as with other USSD services we provide.
     It is therefore imperative that all parties engage towards a
     solution, putting the consumer at the fore of all decisions. MTN
     remains committed to the most effective solution for our customers
     as we work each day to make their lives easier.


AGF matter

-   The hearing on the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) matter,
     which was scheduled to be held on 29 October 2019 was adjourned to
     30 and 31 January 2020 for commencement of trial.        We remain
     resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed any offence and will
     continue to defend this position.

-   The redemption notice relating to the MTN Nigeria preference shares
     remains in place, and we continue to await the completion of the
     necessary regulatory process. The preference shares are foreign
     currency denominated loan instruments and are exposed to exchange
     rate volatility.

Funding

-   We are currently exploring financing options, including the
     issuance of commercial paper as part of our debt strategy to
     diversify our funding sources and optimise overall funding costs.

Outlook

In the remaining quarter of the year, we will continue to prioritise
the expansion of our 4G network coverage and drive active data
subscriber growth. We expect voice and data revenue to continue to
grow on the back of subscriber growth and increasing demand for data
services. We are excited about progress with our digital services
following the completion of VAS optimisation and are focused on
sustaining the QoQ revenue growth we have seen. Having launched our
super-agent services, our goal is to build a network of 100,000 agents
by year-end. Super-Agent has always been a part of our MoMo business
plan and obtaining the licence shows we are on track with our plans.
While we continue to engage with the CBN regarding obtaining a Payment
Service Bank licence, we are fully harnessing opportunities that the
Super-Agent licence brings.

˜   EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income and finance costs (which includes gains or 
   losses on foreign exchange transactions), tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented 
   before recognising the following items: Impairment of joint venture and goodwill (MEIH); net monetary 
   gain resulting from the application of hyperinflation; share of results of associates and joint 
   ventures after tax; hyperinflation; tower sale profits; gain on disposal of subsidiary (Cyprus); 
   CBN resolution; and gain on dilution of investment in associates and joint ventures (Travelstart 
   and Jumia). EBITDA after once-off items increased 39,9%** 
   
ROE is calculated based on reported group HEPS of 195 cps plus non-operational impacts of 102 cps

Service revenue excludes device and SIM card revenue.

Data revenue is mobile and fixed access data and excludes roaming and wholesale.

Fintech includes Mobile Money (MoMo), insurance, airtime lending and ecommerce.

All financial numbers are year on year (YoY) unless otherwise stated.

All subscriber numbers are compared to end December 2018 unless otherwise stated.

Below provides the impact of IFRS 16 on the numbers disclosed in these results.

All prior period financial and non-financial numbers have been adjusted for the disposal of 
MTN Cyprus for comparability purposes.

Certain information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. This is 
presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information 
may not fairly present MTN's financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or 
cash flows. It has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors. 
1. The financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared 
   excluding the impact of hyperinflation and the goodwill and asset impairments, tower profits, the 
   Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered 
   into and the finance costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting of the 
   liability), gain on dilution of Jumia, impairment of investment in MEIH, gain on Travelstart and 
   impact of IFRS 16 (""the pro forma adjustments"") and constitutes pro forma financial information 
   to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the reviewed condensed 
   consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2019. This pro forma 
   financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments from 
   the consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable YoY analysis. The pro forma adjustments 
   have been calculated in terms of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial 
   statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except for the changes in accounting policies as a 
   result of the adoption of the accounting standards effective 1 January 2019, and the change in the 
   presentation of cash flows. 
2. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates 
   on the group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial 
   reporting period's results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined 
   as the average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the 
   group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency 
   growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year constant currency results compared to 
   the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and 
   MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. 
   The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period 
   under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.
   
This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors and represents only a summary of

encouraged to review the full interim financial results. This short-form announcement does not include 
the information required pursuant to paragraph 16A(j) of IAS 34. This short-form announcement is itself

The group's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, 
Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) 
region and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (held for sale), 
eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, 
Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region 
includes Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan. The operation 
in Cyprus was disposed of and is no longer included in the results effective 4 September 2018. 

Although Iran, Botswana and eSwatini form part of their respective regions geographically and 
operationally, they are excluded from their respective regional results because Iran and eSwatini 
are equity accounted for by the group and Botswana is held for sale.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments: 
""We delivered encouraging results for the period, against the backdrop of difficult trading conditions.
South Africa in particular was impacted by a weak economy as well as the implementation of lower out-of-bundle
pricing and the new ICASA subscriber regulations in the first quarter of the year. Despite these headwinds, we
progressed with our plans to build a digital operator, growing service revenue by 9,7%* and EBITDA by 10,2%*,
which supported solid growth in operational earnings. Our holding company leverage ratio remained stable at 
2,3x and we reduced our capex intensity to 16,9%^.

Commercial momentum continued, with growth in our subscriber base of 7,7 million, in our active data users
of 3,5 million, and in our Mobile Money users of 2,4 million. We now have leading network NPS in more than 
half of our markets, supported by the continued expansion and quality of our data networks. 

We delivered on several strategic projects including the listings of MTN Nigeria on the Nigerian Stock
Exchange and Jumia, our e-commerce venture, on the New York Stock Exchange. The asset realisation programme
delivered R2,1 billion to the group in the second quarter, we launched our Ayoba messaging platform in 
3 markets and we were awarded a super-agent licence in Nigeria, enabling the expansion of our fintech business.
We remain focused on building our digital operator strategy, focusing on being a scale player in both our
evolving telco services as well as digital and fintech and delivering on our medium-term targets.""

Overview
MTN reported encouraging operational results for the 6 months as we remained focused on executing our
BRIGHT strategy. We continued to grow service revenue ahead of inflation, to increase our margin on earnings
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) slightly and to reduce capital expenditure
(capex) intensity. 

Macroeconomic conditions were challenging, particularly in South Africa, with the economy contracting in the
first quarter and the rand weakening against the US dollar. 

Group service revenue increased by 9,7%* in constant currency terms. This was led by growth of 12,2%* by 
MTN Nigeria, 18,7%* by MTN Ghana and 3,3% by MTN South Africa. The performance of MTN South Africa was impacted
by changes to out-of-bundle (OOB) tariffs and a reassessment of revenue recognition criteria and adjustments
required due to delayed payments under the network roaming agreement with Cell C. As a result of the
reassessment and in compliance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we have not recognised 
revenue amounting to R393 million for network roaming services provided to Cell C during the period. We are 
evaluating a sustainable solution to the agreement with Cell C.

Voice revenue increased by 4,5%*. This was underpinned by customer growth, the benefits of our customer
value management (CVM) initiatives and our focus on segmented offers. Group subscribers increased by 
7,7 million to 240 million and we rolled out our Pulse youth offer in 16 markets.

Group data revenue expanded by 19,8%*, supported by healthy growth in active data users to 82 million as we
improved the coverage and quality of our data networks. Across our markets, we increased 3G and 4G population
coverage by 24,4 million and 32,5 million people respectively. The effective rate per megabyte across our
markets declined by 26,1%, with average usage up 24,6% at 2,7GB per month.

Digital revenue decreased by 42,5%*. This was largely the result of the continued optimisation of
traditional value-added services. In June, we recorded an increase in digital revenue month-on-month. We are 
focused on growing our modern digital offerings through our music, instant messaging and advertising platforms. 
We continued to expand MusicTime!, focusing on customer awareness and refining our go-to-market strategy. 
Following the launch of Ayoba in 3 markets, we recorded 300 000 monthly active users at the end of the period. 

Fintech revenue increased by 30,7%*, supported by customer growth of 8,9% to 30 million active Mobile Money
(MoMo) users with a monthly ARPU of US$1,30. The total value of transactions in the six months to June was
US$44,1 billion, and we processed 9 193 transactions per minute. In May, we launched Africa's first MoMo
artificial intelligence service or chatbot in Ivory Coast. Our aYo joint venture insurance business recorded 
almost 4,2 million registered policy holders across our African footprint in the first half, as we launched the
offering in Ghana. 

Enterprise revenue increased by 6,8%*, supported by 31,2%* growth in MTN Nigeria's enterprise revenue. We
continue to execute our turnaround plan in South Africa and month-on-month revenue trends improved in the
period. 

Wholesale revenue continued to grow, up by 127,9%*, driven by national roaming contracts in South Africa
(Cell C and Telkom), and solid growth in MTN GlobalConnect where we signed up more key accounts and grew our
application-to-person messaging services through the Yellow Connect platform. 

Improvements in the quality and capacity of our networks supported overall growth. We invested 
R12 244 million^, rolling out a total of 3 378 3G and 6 099 4G sites. Capex intensity reduced to 
16,9%^ from 19,3% in December.

The group's EBITDA margin in constant currency terms improved marginally to 35,2%*. A 1,5 percentage point
(pp)* improvement in the Nigerian margin was offset by the lower margin in MTN South Africa, impacted by the
reduction of OOB tariffs on data services and the Cell C receivable impairment. The group's reported EBITDA
margin was 43,1%** compared to 35,6%** in June 2018, impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16, foreign exchange 
gains on translation and the gain on dilution of our e-commerce venture Jumia upon listing.

Basic earnings per share increased to 247 cents** from 244 cents**. This was negatively impacted by 39 cents
or 13,6% because of the implementation of IFRS 16.

Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) were 195 cents** from 215 cents** in June 2018. 

HEPS were negatively impacted in aggregate by 102 cents from the following items: a 39 cents impact of IFRS
16; 8 cents relating to the Nigeria fine interest (from 17 cents in June 2018); hyperinflation (excluding
impairments) of 8 cents (from 27 cents in June 2018); the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of 
39 cents (from 21 cents in June 2018); and divestments of 8 cents (-15 cents in June 2018). HEPS were further 
impacted by the depreciation of the Iranian rial, which resulted in lower earnings from MTN Irancell.

On an IAS 17 basis, return on equity (ROE) increased to 12,9% from 11,5% in December 2018. Taking into
account the adoption of IFRS 16, ROE declined to 11,2%. 

Regulatory and legal considerations
We continued to work toward resolving various regulatory issues. 

In Uganda, we continue to engage with the Ugandan authorities on the licence renewal.

In Nigeria, the tax dispute between MTN Nigeria and the Attorney General is ongoing. In June the matter was
adjourned to 29 October 2019 for the purposes of trial. We remain resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed
any offence and will continue to defend this position.

Mobile money regulations issued by central banks are at various stages of development and implementation
across the group's operations. These regulations govern the way mobile money services are conducted as well as
the rights and obligations of all parties to the mobile money service offering, including rights to cash backing
the mobile money issued held with the banks and obligations to make payments to subscribers. Laws and
regulations differ from country to country and in some instances do not explicitly state who takes on the credit
risk. The group therefore applies a level of judgement and continues to monitor and assess these regulations to
determine the impact on its operations and results.

1 Represents the exclusion of the impact of goodwill, PPE and joint venture impairments. 2019: In relation 
  to impairments in MEIH (R191 million). 2018: In relation to MTN Yemen (R149 million) and reversal of the
  hyperinflation-related asset impairment in MTN Sudan (R306 million).
2 Represents the gain on dilution of the group's investments. In 2019: R1 188 million (Jumia: 
  R1 039 million, MEIH R37 million and a gain on disposal of TravelStart R112 million). 2018: Gain 
  on dilution of investment in IIG (R304 million share in group and R134 million in Iran).
3 Release of a deferred gain of R18 million (2018: R12 million) in Ghana on the sale of tower assets 
  during the prior period and offset by losses incurred on the disposal of items of property, plant and 
  equipment.
4 Exclusion of finance cost recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the financial
  liability created on conclusion of the Nigeria regulatory fine.
5 The impact of hyperinflation is excluded for the operations that are currently accounted for on a
  hyperinflationary basis (MTN Syria, MTN Sudan and MTN South Sudan) as well as those that have previously been
  accounted for on a hyperinflationary basis. The economy of MTN Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary 
  effective 1 July 2018. The economy of Iran was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 
  1 July 2015 and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this date onwards. For this operation 
  the impact of hyperinflation unwinds over time mainly through depreciation, amortisation or subsequent

Exchange rates 
The weaker average rand and stronger Nigerian naira had a positive translation impact on rand-reported
results, while the depreciation of the Iranian rial had a negative impact on rand-reported results. The average
naira remained flat against the US dollar YoY, and the closing rate at end-June 2019 was up 1,0% YoY. The average
rand weakened by 15,4% YoY against the US dollar and closed 1,9% stronger. 

Revenue
Group revenue increased by 10,2%* and service revenue increased by 9,7%*, supported by growth in MTN Nigeria
(up 12,2%*), MTN Ghana (up 18,7%*), MTN Uganda (up 13,7%*) and MTN South Africa (up 3,3%). Growth in MTN South
Africa was impacted by a decline in consumer prepaid revenue following the implementation of new rules and
the reduction of out-of-bundle tariffs, as well as lower revenue from Cell C. MTN Cameroon reversed service
revenue declines, reporting flat growth, while MTN Ivory Coast's service revenue declined by 10,1%*.

Voice grew by 4,5%* to R39,7 billion, data was up by 19,8%* to R16,1 billion, fintech grew by 30,7%* to 
R4,7 billion and digital declined by 42,5%* to R1,4 billion. Enterprise and wholesale grew by 6,8%* and 
127,9%* respectively to R6,5 billion and R2,6 billion.

Costs
Total costs increased by 9,2%*, mainly impacted by costs associated with the rollout of network sites. 

EBITDA
EBITDA excludes impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of associates and joint
ventures after tax. Group EBITDA increased by 10,2%*. It was driven by increases of 16,1%*, 24,2%*, 28,9%* 
and 32,4%* in MTN Nigeria, MTN Ghana, MTN Uganda and MTN Cameroon respectively, and lower head office costs. 
This was offset by the performance of MTN South Africa as well as a reduced contribution from MTN Ivory Coast. 
The group EBITDA margin increased by 0,1 percentage points* to 35,2%*.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill
The group depreciation charge increased by 7,0%* because of the higher capex over the past few years.
Amortisation costs increased by 10,9%*, after higher expenditure on software in the previous period. 

Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by 92,8%** to R7 088 million**, largely due to the adoption of IFRS 16 
(R2 688 million). 

Net interest expenses increased by 19,1%^ on a like-for-like basis (excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and Nigeria 
regulatory fine interest unwind), impacted by an increase in MTN Nigeria debt to R4 759 million from the 
R774 million reported in December 2018.

Net forex losses increased by 77,7%** to R1 066 million, largely due to a weaker average rand resulting in
foreign exchange losses on US dollar debt, R716 million net forex losses in head offices due to Nigeria
preference share redemption, the MTN Irancell receivable and MTN (Netherlands) BV US dollar-denominated loan. 

Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax
We reported a loss of R29 million** from associates and joint ventures, compared to a profit of R197 million** 
in June 2018. This was because of a lower profit contribution from MTN Irancell following the marked
depreciation in the rial, as well as the change in accounting for Mascom which is now held for sale on the 
statement of financial position. As of 12 April 2019, Jumia was no longer equity accounted. This contributed 
to lower losses from the e-commerce group.

Taxation
The reported effective tax rate was 37,5%**, higher than the prior year's rate of 34,1%** mainly due to
higher non-deductible MTN Sudan expenses and higher withholding taxes driven by higher cash upstreamed in the
period. For the six months to end-June 2019, the group's reported taxation charge increased by 25,1%** YoY to 
R3 180 million**.

Cash flow
Cash inflows generated from operations increased by 24,8%** to R20 906 million**. Key cash outflows included
cash capex of R13 587 million** and dividends paid to equity holders of R5 851 million**. This was also
impacted by the final Nigeria fine payment (R4 440 million) and the CBN resolution payment (R731 million). 

Financial position
Group net debt increased to R70 872 million** from R63 546 million**. This was largely impacted by increased
borrowings by MTN Nigeria, as the Nigeria business made progress in optimising its capital structure.

Holdco borrowings increased to R59 695 million** from R57 508 million** in December 2018. Gearing at the
holdco remained stable at 2,3x from year-end.

Operational review

MTN South Africa
- Service revenue increased by 3,3%
- Data revenue increased by 5,6%
- Fintech revenue increased by 21,6%
- Digital revenue decreased by 34,5%
- EBITDA increased by 0,2%* to R7 462 million
- EBITDA margin decreased by 1,9 pp* to 33,3%*
- Capex decreased by 13,8%*

MTN South Africa reported improved service revenue in the period. Growth in wholesale and consumer postpaid
revenue supported service revenue growth but was offset by a 5,5% reduction in prepaid service revenue coupled
by the Cell C adjustments made. 

The prepaid business negatively impacted service revenue growth mainly as a result of the implementation of
ICASA's End User Subscriber Service Charter regulations and the reduction of out-of-bundle (OOB) tariffs on
data services, as well as the impact on consumer spending of the contraction of the economy.

The consumer postpaid business remained resilient in tough conditions delivering a 7% service revenue
growth. Consumer additions were muted on the back of stricter vetting rules targeting a reduction in credit 
risk due to tougher economic times. 

A combination of changes in the acquisition strategy in consumer postpaid as well as the discontinuation of
the 1GB acquisition promotion in prepaid in order to drive distribution efficiencies resulted in a 1,9 million
decrease in the subscriber base from December 2018 to a closing subscriber base of 29,2 million.

We continued to execute on the turnaround of the enterprise business, leading to lower service revenue
reductions of -7,8% from -11,3% in the 2018 full year as we stabilised churn and added new corporate customers. 
We are confident that this trend will gain further traction in the second half of the year. 

The 1,9pp decline in the EBITDA margin was a result of the reduction of OOB tariffs and the Cell C
adjustments. MTN South Africa increased the distribution of 3G and 4G devices by 22% as enablers of future 
data growth. Operating expenses were impacted by a number of external factors such as load shedding, battery 
theft and site vandalisation. These, together with the progressively expanding network footprint, resulted in 
a 3,7% (+ 8,9%^) increase in total costs YoY. MTN South Africa's network investments continue to deliver 
network leadership endorsement from subscribers and industry bodies such as MyBroadband and Ookla. 
Subscribers ranked MTN South Africa as having the best customer service, reflected in our move to the 
market's leading net promoter score.

After the end of the period, the Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies issued a policy on
high-demand spectrum and policy direction on the licensing of a Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN). This policy
direction initiates a process by which ICASA will license spectrum from various bands. We note the policy
direction and will have further engagements with the authorities. We are also engaging with the Minister and ICASA
on the release of further high-demand spectrum including the 5G bands, which will further enable the drive to
lower the cost of data.

MTN Nigeria
- Service revenue increased by 12,2%*
- Data revenue increased by 31,8%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 21,2%*
- Digital revenue decreased by 64,3%*
- EBITDA grew by 16,1%* to R8 623 million* 
- EBITDA margin increased by 1,5 pp* to 44,6%* 
- Capex increased by 37,5%* 

MTN Nigeria delivered a solid performance, with strong voice (+11,4%) and data revenue (+31,8%) driving
double-digit service revenue growth and further improving the EBITDA margin.

Voice revenue growth was supported by an increase in subscribers (+5,7%), relatively stable tariffs and our
focus on pro-consumer activities. This was boosted by our targeted customer value management (CVM)
initiatives. 

Data revenue growth was driven by an increased number of smartphones on the network, greater data usage and
growth in the number of active data users. We added 2,5 million smartphones, increasing smartphone penetration
by 2,1pp to 39,2%. Active data users increased by 11,0% to 20,7 million and data traffic rose by 67% YoY. 

Our fintech business continued to gain momentum with 21,2% growth in revenue YoY. The super-agent licence
will allow us to leverage our established distribution channels to offer a wide range of mobile financial
services. We will continue to work towards obtaining a payment service banking licence that we applied for 
in late 2018. Digital revenue continued to be impacted by the optimisation of value-added services (VAS). 
Our focus remains on building a sustainable base of active digital users in order to boost revenue growth.

Our enterprise business also delivered satisfactory results, with revenue increasing by 31,3%, to contribute
12,0% to service revenue.

The 1,5pp improvement in the EBITDA margin was supported by a stable naira against the US dollar benefiting
our operating expenses as well as lower digital expenses arising from our VAS optimisation initiatives.

Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
- Service revenue increased by 19,4%*
- Data revenue increased by 27,8%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 32,9%*
- Digital revenue declined by 32,8%*

The solid performance of the SEAGHA region was largely driven by MTN Ghana, which lifted service revenue by
18,7%*, supported by contributions from voice, data and fintech revenue. MTN Ghana and MTN Uganda continued to
drive fintech revenue growth, with an increasing contribution from MTN MoMo, lending, pension and insurance
services.

West and Central Africa (WECA) 
- Service revenue increased by 0,5%*
- Data revenue increased by 24,9%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 35,5%*
- Digital revenue declined by 58,8%*

We delivered on our plans to stabilise our WECA region, recording a stronger second quarter performance. 
In a highly contested market, MTN Ivory Coast returned to competitiveness and implemented an aggressive
efficiency programme to reduce costs in support of margin improvements. The operating environment in Cameroon 
remained challenging, given the conflict in the Northwest and Southwest, however we are encouraged by the 
positive YoY service revenue trends in the first half. We reported strong net additions and value share gains
in both MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast. Across the region we saw a sharp increase in MoMo users, which 
supported fintech revenue growth.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (excluding Iran)
- Service revenue increased by 19,8%*
- Data revenue increased by 45,6%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 80,8%*
- Digital revenue increased by 26,1%*

Despite the geopolitical challenges across the region, MTN operations in MENA delivered a strong
performance, largely driven by MTN Syria and MTN Sudan, delivering service revenue growth of 14,0%* and 
49,4%* respectively. This was supported by the solid growth in data and voice revenue. 

Associates, joint ventures and investments 

Telecoms operations
MTN Irancell recorded a pleasing result given the challenges the business faced following the
re-introduction of US sanctions, the depreciation of the currency and high inflation rates. Service revenue grew 
by 17,9%*, with voice up by 24,4%* and data revenue up by 22,4%*. The reported results from Iran were however 
negatively impacted on translation following the move to report exchange rates at the Sana rate as of August 2018. 
The average Sana rate in the reporting period was 51,3% weaker relative to the prior period. This added to the
additional forex losses against the Iranian receivable of R1 295 million at the end of the period. The value 
of the Irancell receivable as at 30 June 2019 was R3,0 billion.

E-commerce investments 
Following the Jumia IPO and making reference to the NYSE share price of the business at the end of the
period (30 June 2019), we now value our 18,9% stake at R5,5 billion at an American Depositary Share (ADS) 
price of $26,42. As at 6 August 2019 the Jumia ADS price was at $13,81.

Middle East Internet Holding disposed of online platform Wadi, simplifying the portfolio and reducing
ongoing capital requirements. Ride-hailing service Jeeny recorded a 75% YoY increase in ride numbers and 
bookings on cleaning service app Helpling increased by 54% YoY. As at 30 June 2019 an impairment of 
R191 million was recognised for MEIH.

Within IIG, ride-hailing app Snapp recorded 2 million rides daily, ranking it among the top ride-hailing
apps globally. Food delivery app Snappfood grew by 197% YoY and led the market with almost 80% market share.
Snapptrip grew by 116% YoY and is number 1 in the local hotel booking market. 

As MTN re-focuses its business on building an integrated digital operator, these e-commerce holdings, while
important investments, are not viewed as long-term strategic holdings for the group. 

Investments in tower companies
Our associate tower businesses include our 49% holdings in both ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda. During the first
half we saw a strong contribution from both of R58 million in June 2019. Our 29% investment in IHS was fair
valued at R23,1 billion at 30 June 2019.

Although towers are an important operational component of the business, the investments in the existing
tower companies are not viewed as long-term strategic holdings of the group.

Prospects and guidance 
Well positioned to deliver growth
Guided by our BRIGHT strategy, we are well positioned to grow by leveraging our scale and enhancing our
competitive position. Our markets are characterised by significant population growth, youthful demographics, 
low levels of smartphone penetration and data and digital adoption, as well as large unbanked populations. 
The enterprise and wholesale sectors are relatively undeveloped and growing fast. The combination of our large
customer base, extensive networks and deep distribution gives us access to large pools of revenue. We are 
committed to building a digital operator, being a scale player in both the evolving telco and fintech and 
digital services spaces. 

Following data price reductions in South Africa and Nigeria, we expect price elasticity in the second half
of the year to improve data revenue growth. We expect lower wholesale revenue in MTN South Africa to be a 
drag on service revenue following the end of the national wholesale deal with Telkom on 28 June 2019. 

We plan to launch MoMo in South Africa in the second half of the year. On the back of the award of the
super-agent licence in Nigeria, we will accelerate our fintech ambitions and now fully leverage the extensive
distribution we have across the country to offer a range of transfer and payment services to our GSM customer base.

We will continue to work towards obtaining a payment service banking licence in Nigeria. We will roll out our
MTN Homeland offering, allowing money to be sent to MoMo recipients in Africa from Europe quickly and
affordably.

We will continue to expand our insurance business and leverage the partnership with Sanlam that we announced
in July 2019.

We plan to roll out Ayoba in Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Liberia in the second half of the year. We
will also integrate payments into the Ayoba service as part of our broadening of the fintech business, as well
as integrate Ayoba into MTN segmented offers. After launching our time-based music streaming service MusicTime!
in South Africa in December 2018, we plan to launch this next in Nigeria and Ghana. 

Medium-term guidance
We reiterate our guidance for the medium term (3 to 5 years) of double-digit growth in group service
revenue in constant currency terms, double-digit growth in MTN Nigeria's service revenue and mid-single-digit
growth in service revenue from MTN South Africa. Over this period, we expect to continue to increase our group
EBITDA margin. 

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an increasing revenue contribution
from our digital businesses, we expect the group capex intensity to steadily improve over the medium term.

Our improving revenue growth, margins and capex intensity are anticipated to drive significant improvements
in group returns and cash flow. 

The board remains committed to targeting growth of 10% to 20% in the dividend.

Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme
In the first half, we made progress on the asset realisation programme that we announced in March 2019. 
The programme aims, over the next 3 years, to simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and 
realise capital of R15 billion, excluding IHS. 

In the first half, we realised R2,1 billion through the sale of our shareholder loan in ATC Ghana to
American Tower Corporation for R900 million and the sale of our interests in investment fund Amadeus and its
associated holding in Travelstart for net proceeds of R1,2 billion. 

In April 2019, Jumia Technologies AG successfully raised fresh capital and listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, resulting in a dilution of our shareholding from 29,7% to 18,9%. At 30 June 2019, this investment was
valued at R5,5 billion at an American Depositary Share (ADS) share price of $26,42. As of 6 August 2019 the
Jumia ADS price was $13,81.

The redemption of MTN Nigeria preference shares for a consideration of US$315 million has always been
envisaged as a necessary part of the simplification of our capital structure. The redemption process is underway and
will be completed after the necessary regulatory processes.

Our plan to dispose of our shareholding in Mascom Wireless Botswana for a consideration of US$300 million is
in progress. We expect this to be concluded during the second half of the year, subject to various conditions
precedents being met.

Board changes 
In May, we announced changes to the board. Chairman Phuthuma Nhleko will step down on 15 December 2019, when
chairman-designate Mcebisi Jonas will take the helm. This follows a specific request from our largest
shareholder that the board consider extending Nhleko's term beyond the date originally envisaged of 
31 December 2018.

On 15 December 2019, Dr Khotso Mokhele will assume the responsibilities of lead independent director and
Alan Harper, Jeff van Rooyen and Koosum Kalyan will step down from the board. Peter Mageza and Dawn Marole 
will retire as directors on 30 April 2020. 

On 1 July 2019 Lamido Sanusi and Vincent Rague joined the board as non-executive directors. 

We also announced the establishment of an international advisory board (IAB). The IAB is a non-statutory
entity which does not undertake fiduciary duties. It comprises prominent persons of considerable and wide-ranging
experience. The primary purpose of the IAB will be to counsel the MTN Group in fulfilling its objective of
being one of the premier African corporations and provide perspectives as it strives to contribute to certain
areas of development in the countries where MTN operates. While the IAB will be non-statutory in nature and not
have any fiduciary responsibility, it will make an important contribution in ensuring that the board is
assisted in achieving MTN's vision in a technically complex world with uncertain and shifting geopolitical
interests.

The IAB is chaired by His Excellency former President of the Republic of South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki
and constituted of:
- His Excellency President John Kufuor, former President of Ghana
- Dr Aisha Abdullahi, former African Union Commissioner for Political Affairs
- Dr Mohammed ElBaradei, former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
- Dr Momar Nguer, President of Marketing & Services, Total S.A. (France)
- Phuthuma Nhleko, Chairman of MTN Group

Declaration of interim ordinary cash dividend 
Notice is hereby given that a gross interim dividend of 195 cents per share for the period to 30 June 2019
has been declared. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration is 1 884 269 758
(including 9 430 246 treasury shares held by MTN Holdings and 76 835 378 shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net dividend
of 156 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend withholding tax of 39 cents
per share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories of shareholders for the different
dividend tax rates is as follows:
- 0%      195,00 cents per share
- 5%      185,25 cents per share
- 7,5%    180,38 cents per share
- 10%     175,50 cents per share
- 12,5%   170,63 cents per share
- 15%     165,75 cents per share

These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

MTN Group Limited's tax reference number is 9692/942/71/8. In compliance with the requirements of Strate,
the electronic settlement and custody system used by the JSE Limited, the salient dates relating to the payment
of the dividend are as follows:

MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance for the period. Service
revenue increased by 18.8% for the six-month period to June 2019 when
compared with prior period, supported by the continued expansion in
voice, data and mobile financial services. Solid voice revenue growth
(up 14.8%) benefited from a 6.1% increase in our active subscriber*
base, smart value propositions and continued improvements made to our
network. Data revenue grew 27.7% in a competitive environment and was
attributable to an increase in active data users# (+15.0%) and an
increased number of smartphones on the network.     MTN Mobile Money
revenue increased by 53.3% for the six-month period to June 2019 when
compared with prior period and was mainly attributable to a higher
number of person-to-person (P2P) transactions as well as good growth
in more advanced services such as retail merchant payments.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
grew by 50.3% with an EBITDA margin expansion of 10.4 percentage
points (pp) to 49.5%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management
fee, the like-for-like EBITDA margin expanded by 3.9 pp to 43.0% (2018
EBITDA margin: 39.1%). This was supported by savings in dealer
commissions arising from an increase in electronic airtime sales and
lower interconnect costs.

We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 280 2G, 557 3G,
900 4G and 100 rural telephony sites.

2019 is our ‘year of the customer' and MTN Ghana will continue to
pursue its BRIGHT strategy through the third quarter with the prime
focus on customer experience and creating value for shareholders.

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

""In the first half of 2019, we sustained a solid performance, delivering double-digit growth in service
revenue, underpinned by growth in voice and data revenue. We added 3.3 million customers to our
network, increasing our subscriber base to 61.5 million. Pleasingly, we saw data subscribers increase
in the period by 2.1 million to 20.7 million.

We made significant network investments to improve network quality and expand our 4G coverage.
Our recent work to revamp our data prices and accelerate our 4G network has put us in a strong
competitive position to offer more value to our customers, supporting data and voice revenue growth
which will ultimately strengthen our business.

We are pleased with obtaining a super-agent licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria, which will
enable us to build an agent network and accelerate the growth of our fintech business.

In May, MTN Nigeria was successfully listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), making us the
first mobile network operator to list on the NSE. The listing demonstrates our commitment to the
Nigerian market and provides local investors with an opportunity to participate in and benefit from
the company's growth prospects.

We made changes to our board following the retirement of six pioneer non-executive directors on the
expiration of their tenure and in compliance with applicable corporate governance codes. We express
our heartfelt appreciation to our outgoing directors for their contributions to the success of the
company. We also welcome the incoming directors whose combination of extensive experience
across the worlds of technology, finance, regulatory and policy development and corporate
governance offers a hugely synergistic set of skills that will be of great benefit to us as we move into
a new phase of growth.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Adekunle Awobodu has indicated his intention to resign from the
position of the CFO of the company in the second half of 2019 for family-related reasons. The
identification of a suitable successor has reached an advanced stage to facilitate a seamless
transition. To ensure continuity on certain projects, Mr Awobodu has graciously accepted to continue
to support the company on a consultancy basis. The board extends its appreciation to Mr. Awobodu
for his contributions to the growth of the company.

In line with our dividend policy guidance at listing, the board has approved a maiden interim dividend
as a listed company, of N2.95 kobo per share to be paid out distributable net income.""




                                                                                                      
Operational review

MTN Nigeria delivered a solid performance, with strong voice (+11.4%) and data revenue (+31.7%)
driving double-digit service revenue growth and further improving the margin on earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Voice revenue growth was supported by an increase in subscribers (+5.7%), relatively stable tariffs
and our focus on pro-consumer activities. This was boosted by our targeted customer value
management (CVM) initiatives.

Data revenue growth was driven by an increased number of smartphones on the network, greater
data usage and growth in the number of active data users. We added 2.5 million smartphones,
increasing smartphone penetration by 2.1pp to 39.2%. Active data subscribers increased by 11.0% to
20.7 million and data traffic rose by 67% YoY.

Our fintech business continued to gain momentum with 21.2% growth in revenue YoY. The super-
agent licence will allow us to leverage our established distribution channels to offer a wide range of
mobile financial services. We will continue to work towards obtaining a payment service banking
licence that we applied for in late 2018. Digital revenue continued to be impacted by the
optimisation of value-added services (VAS). However, our focus is to build a sustainable base of
active digital users in order to boost revenue growth.

Our enterprise business also delivered satisfactory results, with revenue increasing by 31.3%, to
contribute 11.9% to service revenue.

We recorded an EBITDA margin of 53.8% on account of the implementation of IFRS 16. On an IAS 17
basis, operating expenses increased by 9.7%, below inflation. The 1.5pp improvement in the EBITDA
margin was supported by a stable naira against the US dollar benefiting our operating expenses as
well as lower digital expenses arising from our VAS optimisation initiatives. Our bottom line
remained strong with 30.9% and 34.8% growth in profit before and after tax respectively, while
earnings per share increased by 34.8% to 486 kobo.

Progress on our asset realisation programme

MTN announced its asset realisation programme in March 2019. The programme
aims to simplify MTN's portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise
capital of R15 billion over 3 years. As part of this programme, MTN has agreed
to sell all of its interests in investment fund Amadeus and its associated
holding in Travelstart to HarbourVest, a global private equity firm, for net
proceeds of approximately R1,2 billion. The transaction is expected to close
within the next 3 months subject to customary closing conditions for a
transaction of this nature. MTN will maintain its commercial relationship with
Travelstart going forward.

Quarterly update for the period ended 31 March 2019

MTN is an emerging market mobile operator with a clear vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new digital
world to our 237 million customers across 21 operations. We are inspired by our belief that everyone deserves
the benefits of a modern connected life.

Salient features
- Group subscribers increased quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) by 4,0 million to 236,6 million
- Active data subscribers increased QoQ by 2,6 million to 81,3 million
- Active MTN Mobile Money customers increased QoQ by 1,2 million to 28,3 million
- Group service revenue increased year-on-year (YoY) by 10,0%
- MTN South Africa service revenue increased YoY by 4,6% with an earnings before interest, tax and
depreciation (EBITDA) margin of 38,8% (35,3%*)
- MTN Nigeria service revenue increased YoY by 13,4% with an EBITDA margin of 53,3% (44,2%*)
- Reported growth rates for both service revenue and EBITDA* were higher than constant currency rates 

These results are presented on an IFRS 16 basis adopted on 1 January 2019. 

* For comparative purposes IAS 17 numbers have been provided in brackets. A summary table below provides the 
impact of IFRS 16 on the numbers disclosed in these results. How the IFRS 16 standard being applied in MTN will 
be presented to investors at a pre-capital markets day on 24 May 2019. Full IFRS 16 numbers will be reported in 
our interim 2019 results.

Unless otherwise stated, financial growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis and are YoY 
(three-month period ended 31 March 2019 versus the three month ended 31 March 2018). Non-financial growth
rates are presented QoQ, or 1Q19 versus 4Q18. Data revenue refers to access data revenue only. 

IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been implemented with effect from 1 January 2018 and
comparative numbers have been restated where appropriate.

All prior period financial and non-financial numbers have been restated for the disposal of Cyprus for
comparability purposes.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
""MTN's positive commercial momentum continued in the first quarter with a pleasing operational performance
across the markets, led by South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana. Group service revenue grew by 10,0% YoY in line
with our medium-term guidance of double-digit service revenue growth. 

The growth in service revenue was supported by the continued expansion in voice, data and fintech revenue.
Outgoing voice revenue increased by 5,9%, data revenue increased by 18,3% and fintech revenue increased by
30,6%. Digital revenue declined by 45,4%, impacted by the work that continues around optimising our value-added
services business. Currency markets were favourable in the quarter, resulting in reported service revenue growth
higher than constant currency rates. 

We made good progress in our work to build a digital operator, adding 2,6 million active data subscribers
and 1,2 million MTN Mobile Money subscribers. 

We have launched Africa's first instant messaging platform ‘Ayoba' in Ivory Coast and Cameroon and plan
further roll out across other markets in the second half of the year. We will also integrate payments 
into the Ayoba service as part of our broadening of the fintech business.

We continued to invest in our network with reported capital expenditure to the end of March 2019 of 
R5,4 billion (R5,0 billion*). In the quarter, we led network NPS in nine of our markets.

We made further headway in our asset realisation programme. We signed an agreement with American Tower
Corporation (ATC) to buy out our shareholder loan in ATC Ghana.

The successful listing of our e-commerce joint venture, Jumia, provides a market value for our 18,9%
investment and we completed the conversion of MTN Nigeria to a public company ahead of the listing by 
introduction on the Nigerian Stock Exchange anticipated for May 2019. 

We remain committed to achieving our medium-term targets through delivering against all elements of our
BRIGHT strategy and in particular executing our plans to access our growth curves.""

MTN's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria
and three regions: Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture equity
accounted), eSwatini (joint venture equity accounted) and Business Group.

The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and
Guinea-Bissau. 

The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan.
 
MTN South Africa
MTN South Africa recorded YoY service revenue growth of 4,6%, within our medium-term guidance range of
mid-single-digit growth, buoyed by a strong performance from our wholesale business. Data and fintech revenue
increased by 3,1% and 21,1% respectively, while digital and outgoing voice revenue declined by 35,7% and 4,4%
respectively. 

Given out-of-bundle price reductions taken in the period, and a challenging economic environment, prepaid
service revenue decreased by 5,1%. As previously communicated, we expect that prepaid service revenue will
remain under pressure for a few quarters, before we see recharge resilience and changes in customer behaviour 
drive up in-bundle service revenue. Consumer postpaid service revenue increased by an encouraging 11,5%. 
The enterprise business continued to stabilise and the wholesale business recorded excellent growth with 
contribution from both Telkom and Cell C roaming traffic. 

At the end of the quarter, MTN South Africa had 24,1 million prepaid users (down 4,9% QoQ), 5,9 million
postpaid subscribers (up 1,2% QoQ) and 3,0 million IoT subscribers.

MTN South Africa maintained its position as the country's best network, and registered number one position
in NPS at the end of March 2019.

MTN South Africa's margin on EBITDA was 38,8%. On an IAS 17 basis the margin remained unchanged YoY at
35,3%. 

We note the provisional findings and recommendations of the Competition Commission in its data services
market inquiry and will engage with the Commission constructively, ahead of submitting our response in June 2019.
We remain of the view that significant reductions in data pricing have already been implemented subsequent to
the data analysed in the report, that the urgent release of high demand spectrum will result in lower cost of
data services, and that there is a viable wholesale market that enables smaller operators and MNVOs to provide
compelling propositions to their customers. 

MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria reported a solid quarter with service revenue increasing by 13,4% YoY, in line with our
medium-term guidance of double-digit growth. This was led by a 32,4% increase in data revenue and a 12,7% 
increase in voice revenue. A general slowdown in economic activities during the election period impacted 
voice revenue growth.

Growth in data revenue was supported by an increase in smartphone penetration, improved network quality and
a 9,1% increase QoQ in active data subscribers to 20,4 million.

Total subscribers increased by 3,6% QoQ to 60,3 million. 

MTN Nigeria reported an EBITDA margin of 53,3%. On an IAS 17 basis the margin increased to 44,2%, up 
2,4 percentage points YoY, driven by the growth in revenue and effective cost management. 

Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
The strong performance of the SEAGHA region was mainly driven by MTN Ghana, MTN Uganda and MTN Rwanda.
SEAGHA's service revenue increased by 21,2%. Data and fintech revenues increased across the region. 
Subscribers increased by 3,1% to 45,0 million, supported by MTN Ghana and MTN Uganda.

West and Central Africa (WECA)
Performance of the WECA region was negatively impacted by the underperformance of MTN Ivory Coast, mainly 
as a result of competitive pressures. This dragged WECA service revenue down by 1,4%, however, this is an
improvement from the 5,0% decline of service revenue in 2018. In Cameroon, the operating environment remained
challenging with conflict in the Northwest and Southwest regions continuing, however, MTN Cameroon is tracking 
ahead of our recovery plan. WECA subscribers increased by 5,6% to 32,4 million, led by MTN Cameroon.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (excluding Iran)
The MENA region reported a pleasing performance in the quarter, with service revenue up by 22,6% (excluding
MTN Cyprus from the prior year comparison), supported by solid growth in data revenue across the region.
Subscribers increased by 0,3% to 24,1 million.

Progress on our asset realisation programme
We advanced plans to dispose of our shareholding in Mascom Wireless Botswana for a consideration of 
US$300 million. This is expected to be concluded during the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals.

Early in the second quarter, our e-commerce joint venture, Jumia Technologies AG, successfully raised fresh
capital and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, resulting in a dilution of our shareholding from 29,7% to
18,9%. This investment is now valued at approximately US$560 million as at 6 May 2019. As of 12 April 2019, 
we will no longer equity account for the Jumia investment.

In May 2019, we signed an agreement with American Tower Corporation (ATC) to buy out our shareholder loan in
ATC Ghana at par plus accrued interest for proceeds of approximately US$61 million. The transaction is
expected to close during the second quarter.

In line with simplifying the capital structure of the business ahead of listing, MTN Nigeria is progressing
with the redemption of the preference shares, of which MTN Group's share is approximately US$315 million.

Update on the Attorney General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria matter
MTN took legal action after receiving a demand notice from the Attorney General of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria (AGF) alleging unpaid duties and taxes between 2007 and 2017. The lawsuit challenges the authority 
of the AGF to deal with issues around tax and custom duties. According to the law, oversight for this is the
responsibility of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).

The court heard arguments on the AGF's preliminary objection on 26 March 2019. At the time, the AGF
requested that MTN's lawsuit be dismissed because it was not filed within the appropriate timeframe, which the 
AGF asserted was within three months of receipt of the initial request for a self-assessment. Having considered 
the matter, the judge determined that MTN's lawsuit was not statute-barred, as the company was only required to
file its case within three months of receipt of the actual demand notice in August, which it did. The Federal
High Court delivered its ruling on 7 May 2019, rejecting the notice of preliminary objection filed by the AGF 
in response to MTN's lawsuit to have the AGF's demand for circa US$2 billion dismissed. 
 
We remain resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed any offence and will continue to defend this position.
 
Court was adjourned to 26 June 2019 for the trial of the substantive case.
 
The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information,
has not been reviewed and reported on by MTN's external auditors. Constant currency information has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the group's results. In determining the change
in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting period's results have been adjusted to the prior
period average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been
performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The
constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year constant currency results
compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and 
MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The
economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period under review 
and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Impact of the adoption of IFRS 16
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016, and is mandatory for financial years commencing 1 January 2019. 
Under the new standard, an asset (the right of use of the leased item) (ROU) and a financial 
liability to pay rentals are capitalised and recognised. The impact on the group's statement 
of comprehensive income, resulting from the adoption of the IFRS 16, is the depreciation and 
finance cost that replaced the rent charges under the IAS 17.

As at the reporting period, total recognised ROU assets and liability were N507,1 billion and 
N503,2 billion respectively. Total operating costs declined by N25,8 billion, improving EBITDA 
by same amount. On the other hand, depreciation and finance costs increased by N13,5 billion 
and N16,8 billion, following the adoption of IFRS 16, which depreciates the ROU asset as well 
as implicit finance cost charge on the ROU liability.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF MTN GROUP AND ESTABLISHMENT OF AN
INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD

Evolution of the Board of MTN Group

In recent years MTN Group has experienced challenging regulatory
environments and highly competitive trading conditions. The MTN Group
board of directors (""the Board"") has also managed the transition of
senior management during this period. The Board is of the view that
MTN Group has entered a more stable and settled phase, enabling it to
now affect an evolution of the Board.

Accordingly, in compliance with JSE Limited Listings Requirement 3.59,
MTN Group wishes to announce the following changes to the Board over
the next 12 months:


  1. The Chairman of MTN Group, Phuthuma Nhleko, who was anticipated
     to step down from his position at the Annual General Meeting to
     be held on 23 May 2019, will step down from the Board on 15
     December 2019 after overseeing an orderly transition of the Board
     including the establishment of the International Advisory Board.

  2. Mcebisi Jonas has been appointed Chairman-designate and will
     assume the position of Chairman of MTN Group effective on 15
     December 2019.

  3. Dr. Khotso Mokhele will assume the responsibilities of Lead
     Independent Director with effect from 15 December 2019.

  4. Further, Alan Harper, Jeff Van Rooyen and Koosum Kaylan will
     step down from the Board on 15 December 2019 after an orderly
     transition and handover to incoming directors.

  5. Peter Mageza and Dawn Marole will step down from the Board
     effective on 30 April 2020.

Further to the above, we are pleased to welcome onto the Board Lamido
Sanusi and Vincent Rague with effect from 1 July 2019.

  1. Lamido Sanusi is a Nigerian national, the Emir of Kano and a
     former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
    2. Vincent Rague is a Kenyan national who worked for the
       International Finance Corporation for 24 years in a number of
       senior positions.

We are confident that the incoming directors will bring a wealth of
experience, diversity of skills and geographical regional experience
to the Board.

Establishment of an International Advisory Board

The Board has resolved to establish an international advisory board
(IAB) of prominent persons of considerable and wide-ranging
experience. The primary purpose of the IAB will be to counsel, guide
and support the MTN Group from time to time in fulfilling its vision
and objective of being one of the premier African corporations with a
global footprint in telecommunications, contributing to increased
digital inclusion in Africa and the Middle East, a pivotal aspect of
the fourth industrial revolution.

Whilst the IAB will be non-statutory in nature and not have any
fiduciary responsibility, it will make an important contribution and
play a highly valued role in ensuring that the Board is guided and
assisted in achieving the company's vision in a technically complex
world with uncertain and shifting geopolitical interests. The IAB will
commence on 1 July 2019.

The IAB will be chaired by His Excellency former President of the
Republic of South Africa, President Mbeki and be constituted of the
following persons:

-   His Excellency President, John Kufuor, former President of Ghana

-   Dr. Aisha Abdullahi,    former   African   Union   Commissioner   for
    Political Affairs

-   Dr.   Mohammed  ElBaradei,   former   Director     General   of   the
    International Atomic Energy Agency

-   Dr. Momar Nguer, President of Marketing & Services Total S.A.
    (France)

-   Phuthuma Nhleko, Chairman of MTN Group


MTN Group Chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko commented ""MTN Group highly
appreciates and thanks the Group directors who will be stepping down
after many years of valued service to the Group. We are confident that
the incoming directors of the Board will bring a depth of skills and
regional insights that will continue to enrich the experience of the
board.
We are most privileged and honoured to have His Excellency former
President of the Republic of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, agree to Chair
the IAB and are grateful to all the distinguished persons of the IAB
who have agreed to give of their valuable time to contribute to the
development of telecommunications and connectivity in Africa and the
Middle East.""

Summary group financial results for the year ended 31 December 2018


MTN is a leading emerging market mobile operator, serving 233 million subscribers in 21 countries across 
Africa and the Middle East. We believe that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.


Highlights
- Service revenue up 10,7%*
- EBITDA margin up 1,7 percentage points* to 35,9%
- EBITDA^ (before once-off items) up 15,9%*
- Group HEPS up 85,2%** to 337 cents per share
- Group HEPS (after adjustments) 565 cents per share
- Holding Company leverage improves to 2,3x
- Capex intensity 19,3%**
- Final dividend of 325 cents per share
- Growth accelerating, medium-term targets raised and expanded

*  Constant currency information after accounting for the impact of the pro forma adjustments as defined
** Reported
^  EBITDA excludes impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of associates and 
   joint ventures after tax

Any forward looking financial information disclosed in this results announcement has not been reviewed or 
audited or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors
Service revenue excludes device and SIM card revenue
Data revenue is mobile access data
Fintech includes Mobile Money (MoMo), insurance, airtime lending and e-commerce
All financial numbers are year-on-year (YoY) unless otherwise stated
All subscriber numbers are compared to end-December 2017 unless otherwise stated
2017 comparatives are restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 and change in the presentation of cash flows

Certain information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. This is presented for
illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly present MTN's
financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma constant currency 
financial information contained in this announcement has been reviewed by the group's external auditors and their 
unmodified limited assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE 3420 is available for inspection at the company's 
registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00.
1. The financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared excluding the impact
   of hyperinflation and the goodwill and asset impairments, tower profits, the Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting 
   of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered into and the finance costs recognised as a result of 
   the unwind of the initial discounting of the liability), the profit from the sale of Cyprus, the CBN resolution and 
   in addition to the above, profit on the exercise of IHS exchange right, Loss on the de-recognition of IHS Loan 
   receivable and MTN Zakhele Futhi Share base payments, which relate to the 2017 year of assessment  
   (‘the pro forma adjustments') and constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted 
   from the segment disclosure included in the audited summary group financial statements for the year ended 
   31 December 2018. This pro forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma 
   adjustments from the consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable year-on-year analysis. The pro forma 
   adjustments have been calculated in terms of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial 
   statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except for the changes in accounting policies as a result of the 
   adoption of the accounting pronouncements effective 1 January 2018, and the change in the presentation of cash flows. 
2. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the
   group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting period's 
   results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly 
   exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the 
   US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year 
   constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, 
   MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of 
   hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period 
   under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.
   
The joint independent auditors' audit report by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Grant Thornton
Inc. does not report on all of the information contained in this announcement/financial results. Shareholders are 
therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the joint independent auditors' 
engagement they should obtain a copy of the joint independent auditors' audit report together with the accompanying 
financial information from MTN's registered office. The directors of MTN take full responsibility for the preparation 
of this abridged report and the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying audited financial 
statements. 

The group's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, 
the Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East 
and North Africa (MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted),
eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, 
Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity 
accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Cyprus was disposed of and is no longer included in the results 
effective 4 September 2018. 

Although Iran, Botswana and eSwatini form part of their respective regions geographically and operationally, they are
excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity accounted for by the group.


Results overview
Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
""MTN delivered a very encouraging performance in 2018, meeting our targets for growth in service revenue and EBITDA,
as well as those on reducing capex intensity and improving holdco leverage. The group has now delivered eight quarters 
of continued operational improvements. 

We continue to benefit from the demographic dividend in the countries in which we operate and, while the markets
remain challenging, we continue to target service revenue growth ahead of inflation. 

In the year we made good progress in resolving key regulatory challenges in markets including Benin, Cameroon and
Nigeria. Managing regulatory issues and improving relationships and risk management remains key focus areas for the group,
and we will continue to strengthen these areas in 2019.

Over the next few years, we see significant opportunity to grow subscribers and voice revenue as we also execute on
the large mobile data opportunity. We will also extend our BRIGHT strategy to build MTN into a digital operator with a
major focus on the fintech, digital, enterprise and wholesale business areas.

We believe everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life and see opportunity for MTN in providing this. We
are confident that MTN is well placed to continue to deliver on our medium-term guidance and the board remains
committed to targeting growth of 10% to 20% in the dividend going forward.""

Overview 
MTN reported improved constant currency results for the year ended 31 December 2018, delivering ahead of our
medium-term targets as we remained focused on executing our BRIGHT strategy. Growth in service revenue accelerated, the 
margin on earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased, and voice and data revenues
continued to expand.

Macroeconomic conditions were challenging in the second half of the year, particularly in the Middle East. In Iran,
the re-introduction of US sanctions resulted in material currency depreciation and increased inflationary pressures and no
further cash was repatriated in the second half. At 31 December 2018, group receivables of R2,8bn remained in Iran. 

Among key currency moves in the year was an 11,4% gain of the rand's average exchange rate against the Nigerian naira.
The average rate of the Iranian rial depreciated by 61,3% against the rand, with the closing rate down by 108,9%.
 
Against our medium-term target of upper-single-digit growth in group service revenue, we delivered a 10,7%* increase
in constant currency terms. This was led by growth of 17,2%* by MTN Nigeria, 23,0%* by MTN Ghana and 4,2% by MTN South
Africa. 

At 31 December 2018, the group had 233 million subscribers, up by 16 million from the end of 2017. Robust growth in
voice revenue, along with the continued expansion of data and the acceleration in wholesale revenue in the fourth 
quarter, supported overall service revenue growth. 

The markets in which we operate remain under-penetrated in terms of mobile services. As we benefit from Africa's young
and growing population, we expect to maintain growth in the core voice business over the medium term. In 2018, voice
revenue increased by 7,3%*. This was underpinned by subscriber growth of 16 million customers, our targeted customer 
value management (CVM) efforts as well as the continued shift in Nigeria to voice as we optimised our value-added service
(VAS) offerings.
 
Group data revenue expanded by 22,0%*, supported by improved coverage; growth in the subscriber base; increasing
handset penetration and the elasticity effects of lower data prices. The effective rate per megabyte across our footprint
declined by 39%.

We continued to record improvements in the quality and capacity of our networks after committing R26 018 million** in
capital expenditure (capex) in the year, rolling out a total of 8 295 3G and 7 257 4G sites. This supported data
adoption, and at the end of 2018 we had 79 million active data users. 

Digital revenue decreased by 32,9%* as a result of the ongoing VAS optimisation. Fintech revenue increased to 
R7 835 million, an increase of 46,8%*. By year-end, we had 27 million active MoMo users in 14 markets. Both the 
liberalisation of the mobile financial services market in Nigeria (through the offering of Payment Services Bank (PSB) 
licences) and the launch of MoMo in South Africa are expected to support an acceleration in our MoMo business in the 
next few years. 

Over the medium term, we will target improved EBITDA margins. In the year, the group's EBITDA margin in constant
currency terms expanded by 1,7 percentage points (pp) to 35,2%*. The reported EBITDA margin was 35,9%** compared to 
35,4%** in December 2017. This was largely driven by the improvement in margins in South Africa (+0,7pp) and Nigeria 
(+4,5pp excluding the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) resolution payment). 

The profit on the sale of MTN Cyprus and gains on the dilution of our investments in Iran Internet Group (IIG) and
Jumia Technologies AG further supported the reported EBITDA margin. 

Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased to 337 cents** from 182 cents** in 2017. Although significantly
stronger, HEPS were negatively impacted by a YoY swing of 76 cents in the contribution from associates and joint
ventures. 

HEPS was also impacted by an aggregate 228 cents by the following significant items: 36 cents relating to the Nigeria
fine interest (from 46 cents in 2017); hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of 45 cents (from 96 cents in 2017); the
impact of foreign exchange losses of 71 cents (from 159 cents in 2017); the impact of forex losses related to MTN
Irancell of 43 cents (from 3 cents in 2017) and the CBN resolution amount of 33 cents. Adjusting for these items, 
HEPS would have been 565cps.

As part of a review of our portfolio, in July 2018 we signed an agreement to sell 100% of MTN Cyprus, using the net
sale proceeds of €260 million to reduce holdco dollar debt. In September 2018, MTN Ghana listed on the Ghana Stock
Exchange after an IPO aimed at introducing a broad base of Ghanaian investors. 

Regulatory and legal considerations
We addressed various regulatory matters in the year. On 24 December 2018, we announced that MTN Nigeria had
successfully resolved the matter with the CBN related to the notional reversal of a 2008 private placement transaction. 
The tax dispute between MTN Nigeria and the Attorney General is yet to be resolved and will come before the Nigerian 
courts on 26 March 2019. The audit committees of both MTN Nigeria and MTN Group have assessed the Attorney General 
claims and remain of the view that all taxes due have been paid, and as such no provision or contingent liabilities 
need to be raised. We will vigorously defend our position on this matter.

In 2018, MTN Cameroon renegotiated its licence agreement as part of an addendum for the usage of 4G spectrum and MTN
Benin concluded a memorandum of understanding with the government as well as concluding negotiations around future
frequency fees. MTN Uganda was granted an extension of its existing operating licence to allow for the conclusion of
negotiations around the terms for the licence renewal. MTN is engaging extensively with the authorities in Uganda over 
the more recent developments in the market.

In South Africa, we welcome the recent withdrawal by the government of the proposed Electronic Communications
Amendment (ECA) Bill pending further consultation and we look forward to the speedy resolution of the issue of 
spectrum allocation.

In the matter relating to Turkcell's alleged grievances arising from its unsuccessful bid to obtain a mobile licence
in Iran, and the awarding of that licence to MTN Irancell in 2005, MTN continues to be of the strong view that there is
no legal merit to Turkcell's claim and we will continue to vigorously oppose it. 

On 8 May 2018, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the JCPOA agreement and to re-impose economic sanctions
against Iran. The sanctions limit the ability of the group to repatriate cash from MTN Irancell, including future
dividends. Sanctions also place pressure on the official exchange rate that is used to translate dividend and loan 
receivables as well as the equity-accounted results of MTN Irancell. MTN Group has not factored any cash upstreaming 
from MTN Irancell into our cash flow forecasts for the next three years.

Dividends
The board has declared a gross final dividend of 325 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 
500 cents per share. 

Prospects and guidance 
Well positioned to deliver growth
MTN is a leading operator in regions with the fastest growing telecoms markets. Guided by our BRIGHT strategy, we are
well positioned to grow by leveraging our scale and enhancing our competitive position. With our expanding population
coverage and drive to accelerate smartphone adoption, we will take advantage of the material data and digital opportunity
in our markets. In addition, the combination of our large customer base, extensive networks and deep distribution will
allow us to drive opportunities in fintech, digital, wholesale and enterprise delivering value for all stakeholders.

Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme
In 2018 we completed a review of the markets in which we operate to ensure an appropriate strategic and operational
fit, considering demographics, regional synergies, control position and business and regulatory environments.

We also reviewed our non-mobile assets, including our existing investments in tower companies and e-commerce ventures.
While these are important and material investments where we need a tight commercial and operational integration with
our mobile assets wherever possible, they are not viewed as long-term strategic holdings of the group. 

As a result of this review, we plan to realise at least R15,0 billion in asset realisations over the next three years
excluding any proceeds from IHS. Proceeds will be used to reduce holding company debt. The IHS investment was fair
valued on the balance sheet at R23,4 billion as at 31 December 2018.
 
Pursuant to the portfolio review MTN's 53% shareholding in Mascom Wireless Botswana (Pty) Limited (Mascom) has been
identified as non-core in light of the lack of control position (Mascom is a joint venture company and is not
consolidated) and inability therefore to execute the BRIGHT strategy. MTN has accepted an offer from Econet Wireless 
(Pty) Limited, our existing partner, to acquire Mascom and in line with IFRS recognition requirements, Mascom has 
been classified as an asset held for sale at 31 December 2018. The purchase consideration for MTN's shareholding is 
US$300 million representing an EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.1 times. The transaction is subject to various 
approvals and is anticipated to be concluded by June 2019.

MTN Nigeria listing
MTN Nigeria expects to list its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in the first half of 2019, subject to 
regulatory approvals. This will be achieved via a listing by introduction and will be followed by a public offer 
once market conditions are conducive. Over time, and subject to market conditions, we anticipate that the 
participation of Nigerians in the ownership of the business will increase from around 20% to 35%.

Revised medium-term guidance
We have revised our medium-term (three to five years) guidance on service revenue growth from upper-single-digit in
constant currency terms to double digit growth, driven by double-digit growth from MTN Nigeria and mid-single-digit 
growth from MTN South Africa. Over this period, we expect to continue to widen our group EBITDA margin.

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an increasing revenue contribution from our
digital businesses, we expect the group capex intensity to steadily improve over the medium-term following the
introduction of IFRS 16 effective from 2019. 

Our improving revenue growth, margins and capex intensity are anticipated to drive significant improvements in group
returns. We expect our adjusted ROE^ to improve from 11,5% in 2018, to above 20% over the medium term. 

While the board remains committed to targeting growth of 10% to 20% in the dividend going forward, for 2019 this is
likely to be towards the lower end of this range.

1. 2018: Reversal of the hyperinflation-related asset impairment in MTN Sudan (R306 million) and exclusion of the
   impact of other asset impairments. 2017: Exclusion of the impact of impairments of assets previously written up 
   for the impact of hyperinflation for MTN Syria (R1 348 million) and MTN Sudan (R1 690 million), partly offset by 
   a reversal of assets previously impaired.
2. Represents the exclusion of the impact of goodwill impairment recognised. 2018: In relation to MTN Yemen 
   (R312 million). 2017: In relation to MTN Yemen (R807 million), MTN Afghanistan (R841 million) and MTN Sudan 
   (R983 million). An amount of R192 million of the goodwill impairment on MTN Sudan relates to the carrying value of 
   goodwill previously written up for the impact of hyperinflation.
3. The financial impact relating to R6 017 million profit realised on the exercise of the exchange right where the
   interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for an increased shareholding in IHS Holdings is excluded.
4. Represents the gain on dilution of the group's investments in International Digital Services Middle East Limited
   following the entry of a new investor into that business.
5. The profit on sale of Cyprus (R2 112 million) is excluded
6. The sale of tower assets during the financial period. 2018: release of a deferred gain of R23 million 
   (2017: R27 million) in Ghana and offset by losses incurred on the disposal of items of property, plant and 
   equipment are excluded.
7. Exclusion of finance cost recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the financial liability
   created on conclusion of the Nigeria regulatory fine.
8. The impact of hyperinflation is excluded for the operations that are currently accounted for on a hyperinflationary
   basis (MTN Syria, MTN Sudan and MTN South Sudan) as well as those that have previously been accounted for on a 
   hyperinflationary basis. The economy of MTN Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2018 and 
   hyperinflation accounting was applied for the six months ended 31 December 2018. The economy of Iran was assessed 
   to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2015 and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this 
   date onwards. For this operation the impact of hyperinflation unwind over time mainly through depreciation, 
   amortisation or subsequent asset impairments. 
9. Adjustment for the net forex losses impacting earnings for the respective periods.
10.Represents the IFRS 2 Share-based payment impact of MTN Zakhele Futhi. MTN made an offer of ordinary shares to 
   qualifying BEE investors in 2016. During 2017, the group issued a portion of the shares previously underwritten 
   resulting in the recognition of a IFRS 2 Share-based payment expense of R434 million.
11.Represents the impact of the loss on the derecognition of the long-term loan receivable from IHS amounting to 
   R2 840 million
12.Represents the impact of the Nigeria CBN resolution (R744 million).

Exchange rates
The stronger average rand and the depreciation of the Nigerian naira and the Iranian rial had a negative translation
impact on rand-reported results for the period. The average naira depreciated by 10,1% against the US dollar YoY, and 
the closing rate at end-December 2018 was down 1,2% YoY. The average rand strengthened by 1,0% YoY against the US dollar
and closed 13,8% weaker.

Revenue
Group revenue increased by 10,2%* and service revenue increased by 10,7%*, supported by growth in MTN Nigeria (up
17,2%*), MTN Ghana (up 23,0%*), MTN South Africa (up 4,2%) and MTN Uganda (up 8,9%*). MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast
delivered a 7,3%* and 6,6%* decline in service revenue respectively. 

In 2018, voice grew 7,3%* to R82,2 billion, data was up 22,0%* to R28,5 billion, fintech grew 46,8%* to 
R7,8 billion and digital declined 32,9%* to R3,9 billion. Enterprise and wholesale grew by 8,4%* and 63,7%* 
respectively to R13,4 billion and R2,8 billion. 

Costs
Total costs were well contained, increasing by 8,3%*. They were negatively impacted by foreign-denominated 
expenses in Nigeria and costs associated with the rollout of network sites.

EBITDA
EBITDA excludes impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of associates and joint 
ventures after tax. Group EBITDA increased by 15,9%*. It was driven by increases of 30,7%*, 7,0%*, 15,2%* 
and 14,4%* in MTN Nigeria, MTN South Africa, MTN Ghana and MTN Uganda respectively, and lower head office 
costs, which were partially offset by the underperformance from MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast. The group 
EBITDA margin increased by 1,7 percentage points* to 35,9%.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill
The group depreciation charge increased by 12,6%* because of higher capex over the past few years. 
Amortisation costs increased by 12,0%*, after higher expenditure on software in the previous period. 
Non-hyperinflation-related goodwill impairments consisted of impairments in Yemen (R312 million**).

Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased by 10,1%**. 

Net forex losses decreased by 56,3%**, largely impacted by lower foreign-denominated debt in Nigeria. 
Net forex losses mainly included:
Head office forex losses of R1 058 million, and
Forex losses in Nigeria of R115 million incurred on US dollar-denominated third-party payables.

Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax 
We reported a loss of R527 million** from associates and joint ventures, compared to a profit of 
R840 million** in 2017. This was mainly impacted by the decline in the contribution from MTN Irancell 
following the marked depreciation in the rial.

The share of results of joint ventures was also affected by the increased reported loss in Jumia Technologies AG. 
The YoY comparison is impacted by a prior year adjustment on consolidation.

Taxation
The reported effective tax rate was 36,2%**, lower than the prior year mainly due to higher profit before tax 
and the impact of: the non-taxable gain from the sale of MTN Cyprus, lower non-deductible MTN Sudan expenses and 
lower Nigeria fine and expenses. The prior year's rate (52,5%**) had been mainly impacted by the lower profit before 
tax, combined with the impact of higher MTN Sudan non-deductible expenses and non-deductible goodwill impairments 
in MTN Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan. For 2018, the group's reported taxation charge increased by 8,2%** year-on-year 
to R5 430 million**.

Earnings
We reported basic earnings per share (EPS) of 485 cents** compared to 246 cents** in the prior year. HEPS were
negatively impacted by a swing of 76 cents in associates and joint ventures. HEPS of 337 cents were also impacted 
by in aggregate 228 cents by the following significant items: 36 cents relating to the Nigeria fine interest 
(from 46 cents in 2017); hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of 45 cents (from 96 cents in 2017); the impact of 
foreign exchange losses of 71 cents (from 159 cents in 2017) and 33 cents from the CBN resolution payment.

Cash flow
Cash inflows generated from operations for the year came in at R40 345 million**. The group repatriated 
R1 296 million** in cash from MTN Irancell in the first half of 2018. Key cash outflows included cash capex of 
R28 196 million** and dividends paid to equity holders of R11 236 million**.

Capital expenditure
Capex decreased by 10,6%* (decreased by 17,3%** to R26 018 million**) for the year.

Financial position
Gearing at the holdco improved to 2,3x from 2,9x at the interim period and we remain committed to our 
medium-term target of holdco gearing in the 2,0x to 2,5x range.

Net debt was R63 546 million** from R57 145 million** reported at the prior year-end and R69 831 million** 
reported at the interim period. This was negatively impacted by the weaker closing rand and the payment of the 
final dividend under the previous dividend policy, partially offset by cash from the sale of MTN Cyprus as well 
as the MTN Ghana IPO. 

Operational review
MTN South Africa
- Service revenue increased by 4,2%
- Data revenue increased by 12,7%
- Digital and fintech revenue increased by 4,7%
- EBITDA grew by 7,0% to R15 660 million
- EBITDA margin increased by 0,7pp to 35,1%
- Capex decreased by 17,6%

MTN South Africa reported a steady improvement in service revenue, cash generation and profitability for the 
year in line with our guidance on service revenue growth and EBITDA margin improvement. This was supported 
by strong growth in the consumer postpaid business, significant growth in the wholesale business on the back 
of the network roaming agreements and stability in the enterprise business in the second half of the year. 
The growth in customer service revenue was below expectations with the prepaid business being the main drag. 
The focus on stabilising and growing the enterprise business is delivering results and is expected to show 
traction in the year ahead, supporting service revenue growth. 

Prepaid service revenue increased by 0,2%*, while postpaid service revenue increased by 3,8%*: a strong 
improvement over the first half decline of 2,5%. The postpaid performance was supported by lower churn and 
strong data volumes, with data revenue up over 30%, well ahead of the market. There was a marked increase in 
competition which is expected to impact market growth in 2019.

The subscriber base increased by 5,7% from December 2017 to 31,2 million as we continued to record network
improvements and clearly brought market share losses to an end. 

MTN SA received various accolades as the best network service provider in South Africa. We are embarking on 
a further radio network modernisation programme that will ensure we remain at the forefront of technological 
development and future-ready for 5G services.

We implemented several changes to our pricing of data packages, and additional changes will be implemented 
in the coming months as we conclude our pricing transformation. We will launch our Mobile Money offering in 
the coming months. This, together with new media offerings, is expected to drive growth in digital revenue.

We note the withdrawal of the Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA) and we will in the coming months 
be working with the government and regulators on a framework to achieve a sustainable telecommunications 
industry for the country. We have implemented the revised end-user and subscriber service charter regulations.

MTN Nigeria
- Service revenue increased by 17,2%*
- Data revenue increased by 40,1%*
- Digital and fintech revenues decreased by 35,5%*
- EBITDA grew by 30,7%* to R18 394 million* (excl. CBN payment)
- EBITDA margin increased by 4,5 pp* to 43,5%* (excl. CBN payment)
- Capex decreased by 18,1%* 

MTN Nigeria extended the strong performance evidenced at the interim period and reported full-year results 
ahead of expectations, with double-digit growth in voice revenue (+18,7%*) driving strong service revenue growth 
and the further widening of the EBITDA margin. This was despite the margin being negatively impacted by once-off 
legal costs related to the resolution with the CBN as well as the planned listing costs. These costs totalled 
R194 million. MTN Nigeria is clearly benefiting from deliberate investments in our network, cost optimisation 
initiatives and human capital.
 
Increased usage and the growth in data subscriber numbers supported higher data revenue. Digital revenue declined
because of further optimisation of value-added services (VAS), but we expect a return to digital revenue growth 
in 2019. 

The subscriber base expanded by 11,3% from December 2017 to 58,2 million. The business has applied for a 
PSB licence and we are hopeful this will be awarded in the coming months, opening up a meaningful opportunity.

We plan to list by introduction on the Nigerian Stock Exchange during the first half of 2019 and are looking to
simplify the capital structure ahead of this listing.

In February 2019, MTN Nigeria resumed dividend payments to MTN Group and we anticipate further regular cash
upstreaming over the coming years.

Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
- Service revenue increased by 20,4%*
- Data revenue increased by 27,6%*
- Digital revenue declined by 22.5%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 47,5%*

The strong performance from the SEAGHA region was largely driven by MTN Ghana, which lifted service revenue 
by 23,0%*. The growth in data revenue across the region followed the increased network rollout across most 
markets. Both MTN Ghana and MTN Uganda continued to drive the strong performance in fintech revenue, with a 
growing contribution from MoMo. This remains a key focus area for the medium-term.

West and Central Africa (WECA) 
- Service revenue decreased by 5,0%*
- Data revenue increased by 16,2%*
- Digital revenue declined by 38,8%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 49,6%*

WECA's service revenue performance was negatively impacted by the under-performance of both MTN Cameroon and 
MTN Ivory Coast. The operating environment in Cameroon in particular was extremely challenging, particularly 
given the conflict in the Northwest and Southwest regions. We are encouraged by the positive YoY service revenue 
trends in recent months. Across the region we saw a strong increase in MoMo customers. This is expected to support 
an acceleration in fintech revenue in the coming year. The VAS optimisation across the markets drove the decline 
in digital revenues.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (excluding Iran)
- Service revenue increased by 20,4%* 
- Data revenue increased by 29,6%*
- Digital revenue increased by 27,0%*
- Fintech revenue increased by 4,5%*

Notwithstanding the geopolitical challenges across the region, the MENA region delivered a strong performance 
in the year, with service revenue growth in excess of 20% supported by the strong growth in data revenue across 
the region. 

Associates, Joint Ventures and Investments
Telecoms operations 
MTN Irancell recorded a satisfactory result given the challenges the business faced following the re-introduction 
of US sanctions. The business reported service revenue growth of 14,0%*, with data revenue growth of 34,6%*. The 
reported results from Iran were, however, negatively impacted on translation following the 61.3% decline in the 
average rate of the rial against the rand, as well as higher forex losses. 

MTN eSwatini also recorded satisfactory results. The results from Mascom, our associate in Botswana, were
de-consolidated in light of the impending sale of this business.
 
The aYo insurance operation performed very well and now has almost three million policies across our African
footprint. 

The carrier business BICS also traded well and we are in the process of extending our commercial agreements 
with BICS.

E-commerce investments
The e-commerce joint ventures continued to grow. Within Jumia Technologies AG, online shopping site Jumia 
continued to report solid top-line growth. During 2018, the increase in gross merchandise value was 63%. This 
was powered by an increase in unique active consumers to four million and active sellers to 59 000.

Within Middle East Internet Holding, online retailer Wadi's grocery delivery service is the market leader in 
Saudi Arabia. Ride-hailing service Jeeny recorded a 60% YoY increase in ride numbers and cleaning service app 
Helpling increased bookings by 63% YoY. 

Within IIG, cab-hailing and online food ordering service app Snapp reached 1,5 million daily rides and 44 000
delivered food orders a day. Hotel reservation app Snapptrip became the number one player in the Iran hotel 
booking market.

During the year the e-commerce joint ventures raised in aggregate €155 million in third-party funding. 

As MTN refocuses its business in the future on building an integrated digital operator, these e-commerce 
holdings, while important investments, are not viewed as long-term strategic holdings for the group.

Investments in tower companies
Our associate tower businesses include our 49% holdings in both ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda. During the year 
we saw a strong turnaround in the contribution from both tower businesses from a loss of R38 million in 2017 
to a profit of R268 million in 2018. Our 29% investment in IHS was fair valued at 23,4 billion at the year-end.

Although towers is an important operational component of the business, the investments in the existing tower 
companies are not viewed as long-term strategic holdings of the group.

Board changes
We announced the appointment of three new independent non-executive directors. Swazi Tshabalala and 
Mcebisi Jonas joined the board on 1 June 2018 and Khotso Mokhele joined the board on 1 July 2018.

Declaration of final ordinary dividend
Notice is hereby given that a gross final dividend of 325 cents per share for the period to 31 December 2018 
has been declared. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration is 1 884 296 758 
(including 9 791 839 treasury shares held by MTN Holdings and 76 835 378 shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net dividend of
260 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend withholding tax of 65 cents per 
share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories of shareholders for the different dividend 
tax rates is as follows:
0%            325,00 cents per share
5%            308,75 cents per share
7,5%          300,63 cents per share
10%           292,50 cents per share
12,5%         284,38 cents per share
15%           276,25 cents per share

These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation 
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

MTN Group Limited's tax reference number is 9692/942/71/8. In compliance with the requirements of Strate, the
electronic settlement and custody system used by the JSE Limited, the salient dates relating to the payment

The audited summary group financial statements have been independently audited by the group's external
auditors. The audited summary group financial statements have been prepared by the MTN financial staff 
under the guidance of the group finance operations executive, S Perumal, CA(SA) and was supervised by the

The results were made available on 7 March 2019.

Independent auditors' report on the summary consolidated financial statements

To the Shareholders of MTN Group Limited

Opinion
The summary consolidated financial statements of MTN Group Limited, contained in the accompanying
preliminary report, which comprise the summary consolidated statement of financial position as at 
31 December 2018, the summary consolidated income statement and the summary statements of comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and related notes, are derived from the 
audited consolidated financial statements of MTN Group Limited for the year ended 31 December 2018. 

In our opinion, the accompanying summary consolidated financial statements are consistent, in all material
respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note 3 to the summary consolidated
financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary 
financial statements.

Summary Consolidated Financial Statements
The summary consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International
Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to annual
financial statements. Reading the summary consolidated financial statements and the auditors' report thereon,
therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited consolidated financial statements and the auditors'
report thereon. 

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Our Report Thereon

Notes to the summary group financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2018

1.  INDEPENDENT AUDIT
    The summary group financial statements have been derived from the audited group financial statements. 
    The directors of the company take full responsibility for the preparation of the summary group financial 
    statements and that the financial information has been correctly derived and are consistent in all material 
    respects with the underlying audited group financial statements. The summary group financial statements for 
    the year ended 31 December 2018 have been audited by our joint auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and 
    SizweNtsalubaGobodo Grant Thornton Inc., who have expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditors 
    also expressed an unmodified opinion on the group financial statements from which the summary group 
    financial statements were derived. A copy of the auditors' report on the group financial statements 
    is available for inspection at the company's registered office, together with the financial statements 
    identified in the auditors' report.    

2.  GENERAL INFORMATION
    MTN Group Limited (the company) carries on the business of investing in the telecommunications industry 
    through its subsidiary companies, joint ventures, associates and related investments.

3.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
    The summary group financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited 
    Listings Requirements for preliminary financial statements and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable 
    to summary financial statements. The summary financial statements were prepared in accordance with the framework 
    concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
    and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee (APC) and the Financial 
    Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standard Council (FRSC), and to also, as a minimum, contain 
    the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

    The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the group financial statements from which the summary group 
    financial statements were derived, are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied 
    in the preparation of the previous group financial statements, unless otherwise stated.

    The summary group financial statements should be read in conjunction with the group financial statements for the
    year ended 31 December 2018, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. A copy of the full set of the 
    audited group financial statements is available for inspection from the company secretary at the registered 
    office of the company.

4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    The group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International 
    Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which were effective for the group from 1 January 2018. The following standards 
    had an impact on the group:
    - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9); and
    - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15).

    The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the summary group financial statements are in terms of IFRS 
    and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous group financial 
    statements except as previously stated and except for a change in the presentation of cash flows. Refer to 
    note 25 for the details.

5.  HYPERINFLATION
    The financial statements (including comparative amounts) of the group entities whose functional currencies are 
    the currencies of hyperinflationary economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of 
    the reporting period. The economy of Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2018, and 
    hyperinflation accounting was applied for the six months ended 31 December 2018. Upon first application of 
    hyperinflation, net prior period gains of R625 million were recognised directly in equity. The uplift of the 
    assets on initial adoption resulted in the net asset value of MTN Sudan Company Limited (MTN Sudan) exceeding 
    its estimated recoverable amount. As a result of this, the initial adjustment was capped to the recoverable 
    amount and the difference recorded directly to retained earnings. If the initial uplift had not been capped 
    the related increase in opening equity would have been R1,2 billion.

    As at 31 December 2017(1), the historical increase in the asset value as a result of hyperinflation accounting 
    had been fully impaired, which resulted in a R1 690 million decrease in EBITDA(2) during 2017. During the 
    six-month period ended 30 June 2018, R306 million of the impairment was reversed, resulting in an increase 
    in EBITDA(2). This amount represents the full impairment recognised during 2017, translated at a significantly 
    weaker exchange rate.

    The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation 
    accounting was applied since.

    In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was 
    discontinued effective 1 July 2015. The group's results from Irancell Telecommunication Company Services (PJSC) 
    (Iran) includes expenses resulting from the discontinuation of hyperinflation accounting mainly relating to the 
    subsequent depreciation of assets that were historically written up under hyperinflation accounting. The 
    additional income statement charge reduced equity-accounted earnings from Iran by R873 million for the year 
    ended 31 December 2018 (2017: R1 328 million).

    The economy of Syria was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2014, and hyperinflation 
    accounting has been applied since. The group's proxy indicator for inflation in Syria remained stable during 
    the year. Therefore, a hyperinflation adjustment factor of one was applied during the year.

    The impact of hyperinflation on the segment analysis is as follows:
                                                                    2018

    (1) Hyperinflationary accounting was applied previously in Sudan, up until 30 June 2016.
    (2) EBITDA is defined in note 6.                                                   

6.  SEGMENT ANALYSIS
    The group has identified reportable segments that are used by the group executive committee 
    (chief operating decision maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources 
    and assess performance. The reportable segments are largely grouped according to their 
    geographic locations and reporting lines to the CODM. The group's underlying operations 
    are clustered as follows:    
    - South Africa;
    - Nigeria;
    - South and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA);
    - West and Central Africa (WECA); and
    - Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

    South Africa and Nigeria comprise the segment information for the South African and Nigerian-based 
    cellular network services providers respectively.

    The SEAGHA, WECA and MENA clusters comprise segment information for operations in those regions 
    which are also cellular network services providers in the group.

    Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable 
    to a segment as well as those that are attributed on a reasonable basis, whether from external transactions 
    or from transactions with other group segments.

    A key performance measure of reporting profit for the group is EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before 
    finance income and finance costs (which includes gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions), tax, 
    depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented before recognising the following items:
    - Impairment of goodwill;
    - Loss on derecognition of a long-term loan receivable;
    - Net monetary gain resulting from the application of hyperinflation; and
    - Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax.

    For the purpose of the review of individual segment results by the CODM, EBITDA also excludes the following 
    items (CODM EBITDA):                                
    - Hyperinflation (note 5);                             
    - Tower sale profits;                                  
    - MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense;       
    - Profit on exercise of exchange right in IHS Group;         
    - Gain on dilution of investment in associates and joint ventures (note 13);
    - Gain on disposal of subsidiary (note 7); and
    - CBN resolution (note 8).

    These exclusions have remained unchanged from the prior year, apart from the gain on dilution of investment 
    in associates and joint ventures, gain on disposal of subsidiary and the CBN resolution which occurred 
    during the year.

    Iran proportionate results are included in the segment analysis as reviewed by the CODM and excluded from 
    reported results for revenue, EBITDA and capex due to equity accounting for joint ventures. The results 
    of Iran in the segment analysis exclude the impact of hyperinflation accounting.

    2 Subsequent to the publication of the interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2018, the group 
      updated its definition of digital and fintech revenue which resulted in a reclassification of revenue 
      from digital and fintech to other revenue. These included caller line identification (CLI), itemised

    On 30 August 2018, MTN Group announced that MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) received 
    a letter on 29 August 2018 from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) alleging that Certificates of Capital 
    Importation (CCIs), issued in respect of the conversion of shareholders loans in MTN Nigeria to preference

    paid by MTN Nigeria other than pursuant to CCIs issued by its bankers and with the approval of the CBN as 
    required by law.

    satisfactorily clarified its remittances.

    The CBN upon review of the additional documentation concluded that MTN Nigeria is no longer required to 
    reverse the historical dividend payments made to MTN Nigeria shareholders. However, the CBN maintained that 
    the proceeds from the preference shares in MTN Nigeria's private placement remittances of 2008 of circa 
    US$1 billion were irregular having been based on CCIs that only had an approval-in-principle, but not final 
    regulatory approval by the CBN.

    The CBN instructed MTN Nigeria to implement a notional reversal of the 2008 private placement of shares in 
    MTN Nigeria at a net cost of circa N19,1 billion (CBN resolution amount) (the CBN resolution amount was 
    equivalent to US$52,6 million at the time of the announcement). This was on the basis that certain CCIs 
    utilised in the private placement were not properly issued.

    MTN Nigeria and the CBN agreed to resolve the matter on the basis that MTN Nigeria had to pay the CBN resolution 
    amount without admission of liability. In terms of the resolution agreement, the CBN will regularise all the 
    CCIs issued on the investment by shareholders of MTN Nigeria of circa US$402,6 million without regard to any 
    historical disputes relating to those CCIs, thereby bringing to a final resolution all incidental disputes 
    arising from this matter.

    MTN Nigeria recognised an expense to the equivalent of R744 million in December 2018 and paid the CBN resolution 
    amount on 4 January 2019.

9.  GHANA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
    During the current year, Scancom PLC (MTN Ghana) completed an initial public offering of its shares which resulted 
    in a change in the group's shareholding in the company. MTN Ghana issued 1 530 474 360 shares for localisation 
    as part of the public offering which resulted in a change in the group's shareholding from 97,65% to 85,49%. 
    The investment in MTN Ghana is held by Investcom Consortium Holdings S.A. and MTN (Dubai) Limited, which are 
    indirect subsidiaries of the group. Proceeds generated from the sale of shares, net of transaction costs, 
    amounted to GHS1 096 million (R3 057 million) which has been included in cash flows from financing activities. 
    The share allocation was finalised on 29 August 2018. This was a transaction with shareholders and had no 
    impact on profit or loss.    

10. NIGERIA REGULATORY FINE
    On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria resolved the matter relating to the previously imposed regulatory fine with the 
    Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).

    In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria agreed to pay a total cash amount 
    of N330 billion over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion1) to the FGN as full and final settlement 
    of the matter.

    The regulatory fine was fully expensed in 2016. A discount unwind of R812 million (2017: R1,0 billion) was 
    recognised in finance costs during the current year relating to the outstanding liability. The balance of the 
    liability amounts to R4,2 billion (2017: R6,6 billion) after taking into account the payment of N55 billion 
    (R1,8 billion2) on 28 March 2018, the payment of N55 billion (R2,2 billion3) on 28 December 2018 and the 
    unwinding of the interest.
    1 Amount translated at the 10 June 2016 rate R1 = N13,15.
    2 Amount translated at the 28 March 2018 rate R1 = N30,61.
    3 Amount translated at the 28 December 2018 rate R1 = N25,33.

11. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
    Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, the recoverable amounts of CGUs were determined based on value 
    in use calculations, where future cash flows were estimated and discounted. The discount rates and the perpetuity 
    growth rates used in the value in use calculations of the operations impacted by impairment are as follows:

    In a number of the group's operations in the MENA region, the socio-political instability experienced in these 
    markets resulted in suppressed revenue growth and lower operating margins in the current year, resulting in 
    decreased forecast cash flows at 31 December 2018. An impairment charge amounting to R312 million 
    (2017: R807 million) was recognised against the goodwill of MTN Yemen. MTN Yemen continued to be plagued 
    by political instability and subdued economic conditions. As at 31 December 2018, the carrying value of 
    this CGU exceeded its recoverable amount, necessitating an impairment charge (disclosed above). The goodwill 
    balance for MTN Yemen at 31 December 2018 amounts to R1 123 million, after recognising a cumulative impairment 
    charge of R1 119 million.

    During March 2018, International Digital Services Middle East Limited (iME) issued shares to a new 
    investor. The group and Iran each owned a 33,3% shareholding in iME prior to this transaction. 
    After the new investor was introduced, the group and Iran's shareholding decreased to 29,5% each. 
    The group recognised a R304 million gain on dilution, which is included in other income. The group's 
    share of Iran's gain on dilution (R134 million) is included in the share of results of associates and
    joint ventures after tax.    

    During December 2018, Africa Internet Holdings GmbH (AIH) issued shares to a new investor. After the 
    new investor was introduced, the group's shareholding decreased to 29,69%. The group recognised a 
    R265 million gain on dilution, which is included in other income.

    For the year ended 31 December 2018, outstanding dividends of R1 296 million (2017: R6 509 million) 
    was received from Iran.

    Iran exchange rates and sanctions
    In August 2018, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) clarified that all future dividends can be expected 
    to be repatriated at the SANA rate (note 20). After the introduction of the SANA rate, the group 
    equity accounts the results and translates any receivable from Iran at the SANA rate. However, the 
    group continues to translate any receivables that have been approved by the Iranian government under 
    the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) at the CBI rate on the basis that management 
    expects these balances to be settled at the CBI rate.                      

    On 8 May 2018, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
    (JCPOA) agreement and to reimpose economic sanctions against Iran. The first round of these sanctions 
    became effective on 7 August 2018 and a second phase of sanctions became effective on 5 November 2018. 
    The sanctions may limit the ability of the group to repatriate cash from Iran, including future dividends.

    As at 31 December 2018, Iranian rial-denominated receivables2 amounted to R1 031 million and 
    Iranian-rial denominated loan3 amounted to R1 730 million. Sanctions may place pressure on the Iranian 
    rial exchange rate that is used to translate these receivables as well as the equity-accounted results 
    of Iran.

    3 Translated at CBI rate.

    for the borrowings set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values.
    
    Listed long-term borrowings
    The group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue which were issued 
    in prior years, with a carrying amount of R25 380 million (2017: R21 765 million) and a fair value of 
    R23 926 million (2017: R22 434 million). The fair values of these instruments are determined by 
    reference to quoted prices on the Irish bond market. The market for these bonds is not considered 
    to be liquid and consequently the fair value measurement is categorised within level 2 of the fair 
    value hierarchy.
    
    Financial instruments measured at fair value
    The fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined as follows:
    
    Treasury bills
    The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to published price quotations in an 
    active market. In 2017, the group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R343 million 
    as available-for-sale and the group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R307 million 
    as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of these investments is categorised within 
    level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
    
    Fair value measurement of investment in IHS Group
    Included in investments in the summary group statement of financial position is an equity investment in 
    IHS Group at fair value of R23 353 million (2017: R27 045 million). At 31 December 2018, the absence of 
    transactions between market participants resulted in the fair value being determined using models considered 
    to be appropriate by management. The fair value was calculated using an earnings multiple technique and was 
    based on unobservable market inputs including tower industry earnings multiples of between 10x to 15x 
    (2017: 13x to 17x) applied to MTN management's estimates of earnings, less estimated net debt of 
    R18 599 million (2017: R17 117 million). In addition, in 2018 the group has applied a 10% liquidity discount.
    
    Given the confidentiality restrictions in the shareholders' agreement with IHS Group, MTN does not have 
    access to the IHS Group business plans or 2018 actual financial information. Any estimated earnings used 
    to derive the existing fair value are therefore solely based on MTN management assumptions and market 
    estimates on financial growth, currency movements, costs and performance. The investment has therefore 
    been classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the current reporting period. An increase of 
    one in the low and high end of the multiple range, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in 
    an increase in the fair value of R2 316 million and a decrease of one in the low and high end of the 
    multiple range, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of 
    R2 316 million (2017: R2 148 million). An increase of 10% in the estimated earnings used, keeping other 
    inputs constant, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of R2 821 million and a decrease 
    of 10% in the estimated earnings used, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease
    in the fair value of R2 821 million (2017: R3 021 million). An increase of 1% to the liquidity discount, 
    keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of R259 million and a 
    decrease of 1% to the liquidity discount, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in an increase 
    in the fair value by R259 million as at 31 December 2018.     

    A decrease of R7 770 million (2017: R4 249 million increase) has been recognised for the year under review in 
    other comprehensive income resulting from the change in fair value.

    Uncertain tax exposures
    The group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and the group's interpretation and application of the 
    various tax rules applied in direct and indirect tax filings may result in disputes between the group 
    and the relevant tax authority. The outcome of such disputes may not be favourable to the group. 
    At year-end, there were a number of tax disputes ongoing in various of the group's operating entities, 
    the most significant of which relates to a transfer pricing dispute which the group is contesting. 
    At 31 December 2018, the contingency for the transfer pricing assessment has been significantly reduced, 
    following the group's review of the tax authority's submissions made in the course of preparing for 
    litigation. Based on internal and external legal and technical advice obtained, the group remains 
    confident that it has a strong legal case to contest the remaining exposure.    

    Legal and regulatory matters
    The group is involved in various legal and regulatory matters, the outcome of which may not be favourable 
    to the group and none of which are considered individually material.
    
    The group has applied its judgement and has recognised liabilities based on whether additional amounts 
    will be payable and has included contingent liabilities where economic outflows are considered possible 
    but not probable.

    At 31 December 2018, the ZAR to IRR exchange rate based on the CBI rate was ZAR1 = IRR2 919,91.

    The group's presentation currency is rand. The weakening of the closing rate in the rand against the 
    functional currencies of the group's largest operations contributed to the increase in consolidated 
    assets and liabilities and the resulting foreign currency translation reserve increase of R1 943 million 
    (2017: R12 417 million reduction) for the year.

    Net investment hedges
    The group hedges a designated portion of its dollar net assets in MTN (Dubai) Limited (MTN Dubai) for 
    forex exposure arising between the USD and ZAR as part of the group's risk management objectives. The 
    group designated external borrowings (Eurobonds) denominated in US$ held by MTN (Mauritius) Investments 
    Limited (MTN Mauritius) with a value of R23,9 billion (2017: R22,4 billion) and external borrowings 
    denominated in US$ held by MTN Nigeria with a value of R1,3 billion (2017: R2,6 billion) as hedging 
    instruments. For the period of the hedge relationship, foreign exchange movements on these hedging 
    instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation 
    reserve (FCTR), offsetting the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising 
    on translation of the designated dollar net assets of MTN Dubai to ZAR. The cumulative forex movement 
    recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon loss of 
    control over MTN Dubai. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss during the 
    current or prior year.    

21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    Transactions between members of the group
    MTN Ghana entered into operating lease agreements with Ghana Tower InterCo B.V in prior years. 
    The operating lease commitments amount to R9 468 million (2017: R8 446 million). The expense 
    recorded amounted to R1 016 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: R627 million). 
    The rental amounts escalate every year by inflation and the initial term is 10 years, followed 
    by four times five-year renewal periods.

    MTN Uganda Limited entered into operating lease agreements with Uganda Tower InterCo B.V in prior years. 
    The operating lease commitments amount to R1 988 million (2017: R1 636 million). The expense recorded 
    amounted to R439 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: R558 million). The rental amounts 
    escalate every year by inflation and the initial term is 10 years, followed by four times five-year 
    renewal periods.

    Transaction with an entity associated with a director
    On 29 June 2018, the group and Mainstreet 1561 Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned company of PF Nhleko, 
    Non-Executive Chairman of MTN Group, agreed not to proceed with the sale of 14 750 000 MTN Zakhele Futhi 
    shares. This is regarded as a cancellation of a share-based payment transaction. The related receivable 
    from Mainstreet 1561 Proprietary Limited was derecognised with a corresponding debit in equity. There was 
    no profit or loss impact arising from the cancellation.

22. BENIN FREQUENCY FEES
    Spacetel Benin S.A. (MTN Benin) and the government of Benin concluded a memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
    in April 2018 which includes the settlement of historical frequency fees, a five-year licence extension 
    and the addition of optical fibre to the existing licence conditions settled by the payment of CFA35 billion 
    (R802 million) in May 2018 and a second payment of CFA35 billion (R857 million) in February 2019. MTN Benin 
    and the government of Benin reached an agreement regarding ongoing frequency fees, which was subsequently 
    confirmed by the issue of a decree specifying the frequency fees calculation.

    The decree has confirmed the calculation methodology for allocating a portion of the payment to past 
    frequency fees. This resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset of CFA55,2 billion 
    (R1 370 million) relating to the extended licence and the right to deploy optical fibre.

23. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

    Botswana Proprietary Limited and its holding companies. Accordingly, the investment in joint venture 
    and related assets in holding companies have been presented as non-current assets held for sale.

    receivables amounting to R505 million, owed by Iran, into a loan. The loan has a two-year term and 
    accrues interest at 18% per annum.
    
25. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    The group has adopted the following new accounting pronouncements as issued by the International 
    Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which were effective for the group from 1 January 2018:
    - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15); and
    - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9).
    
    The group also implemented a voluntary accounting policy change relating to a change in the presentation  
    of cash flows. The changes in accounting policies were applied retrospectively. Comparative numbers 
    have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 and the change in the presentation of cash flows.

25.1   Adoption of IFRS 15
       The group principally generates revenue from providing mobile telecommunications services, such as 
       network services (comprising of data, voice and SMS), digital and fintech services, interconnect and 
       roaming services, as well as from the sale of mobile devices. Products and services may be sold separately 
       or in bundled packages. The typical length of a contract for postpaid bundled packages is 24 months.

       IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue 
       is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. 
       Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity 
       expects to be entitled for transferring goods or services to a customer.
       
       Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes 
       amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The group recognises revenue when it transfers control 
       over a product or services to a customer.

       For bundled packages, the group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are 
       distinct, i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled 
       package and if a customer can benefit from it. The consideration is allocated between separate products 
       and services in a bundle based on their standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are 
       determined based on the list prices at which the group sells mobile devices and network services 
       separately.    
       
       On adoption of IFRS 15, the group restated its retained earnings at 1 January 2017 as follows:

                                                                                                     2017

25.1.4 Capitalisation of subscriber acquisition costs                                             
       IFRS 15 introduced specific guidance on accounting for incremental costs of obtaining contracts with 
       customers. Under IAS 18, the group expensed subscriber acquisition costs at inception of the contract.

       The group expects that incremental subscriber acquisition costs for obtaining and renewing contracts are 
       recoverable. These costs include agents' commission on postpaid contracts and SIM activation costs on 
       prepaid contracts. The group has therefore capitalised these costs as contract costs. Capitalised contract 
       costs are amortised on a systematic basis over the average customer life and included in selling, 
       distribution and marketing expenses in profit or loss.

       In terms of a practical expedient, the group has elected to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining 
       contracts as a selling, distribution and marketing expense in profit or loss, when incurred, if the 
       amortisation period of the assets that the group otherwise would have recognised is 12 months or less.

       The impact of this change is a decrease in selling, distribution and marketing expenses and the recognition 
       of a new asset: capitalised contract costs.

25.1.5 Transition to IFRS 15
       In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the group has adopted the new rules retrospectively 
       and has restated comparative numbers for the 2017 financial year. The group applied the following practical 
       expedients when applying IFRS 15 retrospectively:
       - The group did not restate comparative numbers for contracts that were completed contracts at 1 January 2017;
       - The group did not restate comparative numbers for contracts that began and ended in the same annual 
         reporting period; and
       - For modified contracts, the group used the contractual terms that existed at 1 January 2017.

25.2   Adoption of IFRS 9
       The adoption of IFRS 9 had the following impact on the group:
       - Change from the IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) incurred loss model 
         to the expected credit loss (ECL) model to calculate impairments of financial instruments; and
       - Change in classification of the measurement categories for financial instruments.
       More detail on the impact from the adoption of IFRS 9 is provided below.

25.2.1 Impairment
       Before the adoption of IFRS 9, the group calculated the allowance for credit losses using the incurred loss 
       model. Under the incurred loss model, the group assessed whether there was any objective evidence of 
       impairment at the end of each reporting period. If such evidence existed the allowance for credit losses 
       in respect of financial assets at amortised cost were calculated as the difference between the asset's 
       carrying amount and its recoverable amount, being its present value of the estimated future cash flows 
       discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR).    

       Under IFRS 9 the group calculates the allowance for credit losses based on ECLs for financial assets
       measured at amortised cost, debt investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
       and contract assets. ECLs are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured 
       as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the group in 
       accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at 
       the original EIR of the financial asset.
       
       The group applies the simplified approach to determine the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets. 
       This results in calculating lifetime ECLs for these trade receivables. ECL for trade receivables is 
       calculated using a provision matrix. For contract assets and mobile trade receivables ECLs are determined 
       using a simplified parameter-based approach.
       
       Provision matrix - ECLs are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables 
       at each reporting date. The loss ratio is calculated according to the ageing/payment profile of sales by 
       applying historical/proxy write-offs to the payment profile of the sales population. In instances where 
       there was no evidence of historical write-offs management used a proxy write-off. Trade receivable 
       balances have been grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of receivables with 
       similar risk characteristics and ability to pay. Similarly, the sales population selected to determine 
       the ageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population and in line with 
       future payment expectations. The historical loss ratio is then adjusted for forward looking information 
       to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade receivables at the reporting date to the extent that 
       there is a strong correlation between the forward looking information and the ECL.
       
       Simplified parameter-based approach - ECL is calculated using a formula incorporating the following 
       parameters: exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) discounted 
       using the EIR (i.e. PD x LGD x EAD = ECL). Exposures are mainly segmented by customer type i.e. corporate, 
       consumer etc., ageing, device versus SIM only contracts and months in contract. This is done to allow for 
       risk differentiation. The probability of a customer defaulting as well as the realised loss with defaulted 
       accounts has been determined using historical data (12 months and 36 months respectively). The EIR represents 
       a weighted average rate incorporating a risk-free rate plus a risk premium on initial recognition of the 
       trade receivables.

25.2.2 Classification, initial recognition and subsequent measurement
       IFRS 9 introduces new measurement categories for financial assets. The measurement categories of IFRS 9 
       and IAS 39 is illustrated in the table below. From 1 January 2018 the group classifies financial assets 
       in each of the IFRS 9 measurement categories based on the group's business model for managing the 
       financial asset and the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

         instruments, gains or losses accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss.

       The reclassification into the new measurement categories of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on 
       the group. The group has designated the investment in IHS Group and other unlisted equity investments as  
       at FVOCI, as these instruments are not held for trading. Additionally, some of the group's treasury bills 
       are held with a business model to collect and sell and consequently have been classified as FVOCI debt 
       instruments.                                         

       Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost except for those designated as at FVTPL, which 
       are measured at fair value.

25.2.3 Transition to IFRS 9
       Changes in accounting policies from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively; however, 
       the group has elected to not restate comparative information. Differences between the carrying amounts as 
       at 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2018 resulting from the initial application of IFRS 9 are recognised 
       in retained earnings. Accordingly, information relating to 31 December 2017 does not reflect the 
       requirements of IFRS 9 but rather those of IAS 39.      

       The group has elected, as an accounting policy choice, to not adopt the hedge accounting requirements of 
       IFRS 9, but to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.

25.3   Presentation of cash flows
       During 2018, the group reviewed the classification of cash flows and aligned the external presentation of 
       cash flows with the internal presentation applied to manage the business and used for performance management. 
       The group voluntarily changed its accounting policy and reclassified:
       - Dividends paid to equity holders of the company and non-controlling interests from cash flows from 
         operating activities to cash flows from financing activities; and
       - Interest paid in the group's head office treasury function from cash flows from financing activities to 
         cash flows from operating activities.
       
       Comparative numbers have been restated accordingly.

25.4   Impact on the financial statements
       The following tables show the restatements recognised for each individual line item. Line items that were 
       not affected by the changes have not been included. As a result, the subtotals and totals disclosed cannot

growth in voice, data and digital revenue. Data revenue increased by 30,2% year on year (YoY) while digital

Adjusting for management fees, the EBITDA margin would have been higher by 3,1 percentage points to 40,7%.

customer experience and QoS significantly, leading to subscriber growth. During the period, 600 2G sites, 
1 100 3G sites and 250 4G sites were rolled out.

The improved network coupled with aggressive sales and product offers drove the improved subscriber growth. 

Subscribers increased by 12,7% YoY to 20,1 million (13,6% YoY to 17,8 million*). The number of active data 
subscribers in the same period was 6,4 million#.

MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) continued its positive momentum, adding 17,8% more active MoMo subscribers from

Further trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2018

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018.
These will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on or about
Thursday, 7 March 2019.

Following the trading statement published on Monday, 4 February 2019, shareholders are further
advised that MTN expects to report, for the 12-month period ended 31 December 2018, growth in
full year headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") of between 80% and 90% and growth in basic earnings
per share (""EPS"") of between 95% and 100%.

Considering the HEPS of 182 cents and EPS of 246 cents for the prior financial year this translates
into a range for HEPS of 328 cents to 346 cents and for EPS of 480 cents to 492 cents.

HEPS were impacted by a number of once-off and non-cash items totaling approximately 220 cents
per share in the financial year ended 31 December 2018. The adjustments for the year include costs
related to the Nigerian regulatory fine, hyperinflation adjustments, net foreign exchange losses and
the resolution payment to the Central Bank of Nigeria (""CBN""). The results for 2018 were also
impacted by the stronger rand and weaker currencies in the group's foreign entities.

Post year end and following the resolution of the dispute with the CBN, MTN Nigeria has resumed
dividend payments to its shareholders.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

Conclusion of resolution agreement with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and
withdrawal of cautionary announcement

As previously communicated, the Central Bank of Nigeria has alleged improper repatriation by
MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (""MTN Nigeria"") of US$8,1 billion between 2007 and
2015.

MTN Nigeria has held various engagements in order to find an equitable resolution to the matter.
In particular, a series of meetings were held in Lagos with CBN officials during November 2018.
At these meetings MTN Nigeria provided additional material documentation which satisfactorily
clarified its remittances. The CBN upon review of the additional documentation concluded that
MTN Nigeria is no longer required to reverse the historical dividend payments made to MTN
Nigeria shareholders. However, the CBN maintains that the proceeds from the preference shares
in MTN Nigeria's private placement remittances of 2008 of circa USD$ 1 billion were irregular
having been based on CCIs that only had an approval-in-principle, but not final regulatory approval
of CBN.

The CBN instructed MTN Nigeria to implement a notional reversal of the 2008 private placement
of shares in MTN Nigeria at a net cost of circa N19.2 billion - equivalent to US$52.6m (the notional
reversal amount). This is on the basis that certain certificates of capital importation (CCIs) utilised
in the private placement were not properly issued.

MTN Nigeria and the CBN have agreed that they will resolve the matter on the basis that MTN
Nigeria will pay the notional reversal amount without admission of liability. In terms of the
resolution agreement, the CBN will regularise all the CCIs issued on the investment by
shareholders of MTN Nigeria of circa $402,625,419 without regard to any historical disputes
relating to those CCIs, thereby bringing to a final resolution all incidental disputes arising from
this matter.

MTN Nigeria relied on certain commercial banks to ensure all approvals had been obtained prior
to the CCIs being issued and to ensure the CCIs were properly utilised in the private placement.
MTN Nigeria will be engaging with the banks in relation to the issues dealt with in the resolution
agreement.

Shareholders are advised that the legal process initiated by MTN Nigeria for injunctive relief
restraining the AGF from taking further action in respect of its orders for back taxes is continuing.
The AGF matter came up for initial mention before the Federal High Court of Nigeria Lagos
Judicial Division on 8 November 2018 and has been adjourned to 7 February 2019. MTN Nigeria
continues to maintain that its tax matters are up to date and no additional payment, as claimed by
the AGF, is due, and consequently no provisions or contingent liabilities are being raised in the
accounts of MTN Nigeria for the AGF back taxes claim.

As a result of the above, shareholders are no longer required to exercise caution in dealing with
the Company securities.

IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been implemented with effect from 1 January 2018 and 

comparative numbers have been restated where appropriate.



MTN Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:

""MTN recorded an improved operational performance in many markets in the third quarter. Group service revenue grew 

by 10,0% year on year, ahead of our medium-term target of upper-single-digit growth, supported by continued strong 

growth in voice and data revenue. These results were delivered in challenging operating and currency conditions.



Group outgoing voice revenue increased by 5,2% and data revenue increased by 23,9%. Higher digital revenue was led 

by robust growth in MTN Mobile Money.



The group benefited from the particularly strong performance of operations in Nigeria and Ghana, while some operations

in our West and Central Africa (WECA) region remained under pressure. MTN South Africa continues to execute on

operational improvements.



We made good progress on our key growth drivers of data and digital services, adding 5,0 million active data

subscribers and 1,7 million new MoMo subscribers in the quarter.



We successfully completed the listing of MTN Ghana. MTN Nigeria's plans to list have been challenged by the recent

Central Bank of Nigeria and Attorney General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria matters, however, MTN remains committed 

to the listing in Nigeria and work continues in this regard. In the quarter, the group engaged extensively with 

authorities in Nigeria to deal with the matters they raised.



Across our markets, we continued to invest in our networks, and now have the leading network net promoter score in 

10 of our markets. Reported capital expenditure to the end of the September 2018 was R16,4 billion, a group capex 

intensity of 16,9%.



We continued to optimise our balance sheet structure and reduced our gross US dollar debt by approximately 

US$400 million. This was supported by proceeds from the sale of MTN Cyprus of US$303 million, the settlement 

of a loan from our Ugandan Tower Company of US$34 million as well as the proceeds from the MTN Ghana listing 

of US$202 million received after the quarter's end. We also concluded the refinancing of our US$1,25 billion 

revolving credit facilities that are maturing in 2019 with a new five-year revolving credit facility of 

US$1,25 billion at an improved margin, and with an option to increase to US$1,5 billion.



We continue to focus on operational improvements across our business and continue to develop our digital 

businesses.""



MTN's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria and three

regions: Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle East and North Africa

(MENA) and their respective underlying operations.



The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture equity accounted),

eSwatini (joint venture equity accounted) and Business Group. 



The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau. 



The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan. 



MTN SOUTH AFRICA

MTN South Africa recorded YoY service revenue growth of 3,0%, edging closer to our medium-term target of

mid-single-digit growth. Data and digital revenue increased by 12,5% and 9,9% respectively, while outgoing voice 

revenue declined by 8,4%. 



In a weak economy, consumers felt the pressure of a higher VAT rate, becoming increasingly price sensitive. Prepaid

service revenue increased 0,5% and postpaid service revenue increased by 1,9%. MTN South Africa took steps to transform

data prices, including introducing attractive social media bundles and CVM offerings. As a result, customers optimised

their data and voice spend and the number of active data subscribers increased by 6,7% QoQ to 13,5 million.



The consumer postpaid business maintained its positive momentum; the stabilisation of the enterprise business

continued and the wholesale business gained traction. At the end of the quarter, we had 23,7 million prepaid 

users (down 3,4% QoQ), 2,9 million postpaid subscribers (up 2,1% QoQ) and 2,8 million telemetry subscribers.



The Cell C roaming agreement is contributing positively towards revenue and EBITDA and is expected to be fully

implemented in line with our planned timelines.



MTN South Africa's margin on earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was little

changed YoY at 34,5% from 34,8%. The lower sequential EBITDA margin was largely impacted by higher device prices 

following the weakness in the rand exchange rate and increased device sales in the quarter. 



In the quarter, OpenSignal rated MTN South Africa as having the widest 4G coverage, supporting our return to the

number one net promoter score (NPS) position.



We are in consultation with ICASA on the implementation of the new data pricing regulations and are proactively

implementing the various changes to which we have committed. We welcome the commitment by ICASA to license 

high-demand radio frequency spectrum by the end of March 2019.



MTN NIGERIA

MTN Nigeria had an excellent quarter, increasing service revenue by 17,4% YoY, towards the upper end of our

medium-term target for Nigeria of double-digit growth. This was led by a 52,5% increase in data revenue and 

21,5% increase in outgoing voice revenue. Data revenue growth was supported by an increase in active data 

subscribers as well as more smartphones on our network, the result of various CVM and OEM-partnership initiatives.



Digital revenue declined by 28,5% following the continued optimisation of our value-added services (VAS) 

business. We completed the final element of this optimisation, suspending auto-renewal of subscriptions, in 

mid-September which means that digital revenue will continue to be impacted by lower VAS revenue in the fourth 

quarter, after which we expect it to stabilise.



MTN Nigeria reported 17,2 million active data subscribers, up 15,1% QoQ, and 2,5 million MoMo customers, 

up 12,4% QoQ.



The EBITDA margin expanded to 43,2% in the first nine months of the year, up 4,7 percentage points from 

end-September 2017, driven by the strong growth in revenue, mix of revenue and further cost optimisation 

efforts. 



SOUTHERN AND EAST AFRICA AND GHANA (SEAGHA)

MTN Ghana

MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance, driven by robust service revenue growth of 22,9%. Data revenue 

increased by 30,9% YoY and digital revenue expanded by more than 28%, driven by MoMo.



MTN Ghana reported an EBITDA margin of 37,6% in the first nine months of the year. This is 1,3 percentage 

points lower than the margin in the first nine months of 2017. Excluding the impact of the reintroduction 

of management fees in May 2018, the EBITDA margin was 40,4%. 



Subscriber numbers increased to 17,1 million1, with 5,8 million active data subscribers and 7,9 million MoMo

customers. 



MTN Uganda

MTN Uganda recorded service revenue growth of 7,4%, led by growth in voice and data revenue, while MoMo revenue

declined following the implementation of new taxes. Outgoing voice revenue grew 5,1% and data revenue increased 

by 12,4% in the period. MTN Uganda reported nearly 2,0 million active data subscribers and 5,4 million 

MoMo customers, a QoQ increase of 10,8% and 1,9% respectively.



Other SEAGHA

Across the balance of the SEAGHA region the subscriber base increased by 4,7% QoQ, led by gains in Rwanda 

and Zambia.



WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA (WECA)

MTN Ivory Coast

MTN Ivory Coast's service revenue declined by 7,1% YoY, a result of a 24,2% decrease in outgoing voice revenue 

in a competitive market characterised by lower subscriber numbers after a nationwide subscriber re-identification 

process earlier in the year. Data and digital revenue increased by 13,8% and 27,9% respectively. 



The number of MoMo subscribers increased by 14,1% to 2,9 million and the number of active data users rose by 

12,2% to 3,1 million. 



Following a number of regulatory challenges, which we believe are now behind us, and the introduction of a 

new tariff structure, we expect the fourth quarter to deliver positive sequential revenue growth.



MTN Cameroon

In a difficult operating environment and amid competitive pressure, MTN Cameroon reported an 8,0% YoY decline in

service revenue. Outgoing voice revenue declined 11,8%. Data revenue increased 8,7% and digital, mostly MoMo, 

revenue grew by 41,1%. The number of active data users increased 8,2% QoQ to 2,3 million and the number of 

MoMo customers rose by 24,9% to 1,5 million. 



MTN Cameroon is in the process of a significant transformation, which includes a strengthened management team, 

led by Hendrik Kasteel, who joined as CEO in September 2018. A new organisational structure will improve the 

agility of the operation and reduce costs. We are also working hard to improve relations with our many 

stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, and are encouraged by recent trends, including customer 

net additions.



Other WECA

Across the balance of the WECA region the subscriber base increased by 4% QoQ, driven mainly by growth in Benin. 



1 These numbers are calculated using MTN Group definitions and may differ from those defined by the regulator 

  in Ghana.

  

MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA)

MTN Irancell (joint venture - equity accounted, 49%)                        

MTN Irancell reported service revenue growth of 14,1% YoY, supported by strong data growth of 40,6%. The operation

remained the market leader in data services, a result of continued network rollout and attractive segmented offers. 

The number of active data users increased by 0,9% QoQ to 19,4 million.



Digital revenue declined 15,5% as the regulator enforced strict additional opt-in measures, affecting all operators.

Outgoing voice revenue declined 5,0% YoY. 



Despite the strong service revenue growth, MTN Irancell had a tough quarter due to the impact on costs of the sharp

devaluation of the rial after the government announced a new exchange rate regime for regulating imports. 



For our accounting of the Iranian business we use the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) exchange rate until the end of 

July 2018 and have then adopted the SANA exchange rate. FIPPA-approved outstanding loans and dividends will 

continue to be translated at the CBI rate.



Other MENA

Across the rest of the MENA region the subscriber base increased by 1,2% QoQ, because of growth in Syria and

Afghanistan. 



UPDATE ON THE NIGERIAN MATTERS

During the quarter, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) alleged improper dividend repatriations by MTN Nigeria 

between 2007 and 2015 of US$8,1 billion while the Attorney General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (AGF) 

alleged unpaid taxes on foreign payments and imports of approximately US$2,0 billion.



MTN Nigeria continues to deny these allegations and claims. To protect MTN Nigeria's assets and shareholder 

rights within the confines of Nigerian law, we applied in the Federal High Court of Nigeria for injunctive 

relief restraining the CBN and the AGF from taking further action in respect of their orders, while we continue 

to engage with the relevant authorities on these matters. We remain resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed 

any offences and will continue to defend this position vigorously.



Shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcement dated 30 August 2018 and the subsequent renewal of cautionary

announcements, the latest of which was released on 23 October 2018. Shareholders are advised to continue to exercise

caution when dealing in the company's securities until a further announcement is made.



The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has not

been reviewed and reported on by MTN's external auditors. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate

the impact of changes in currency rates on the group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the

current financial reporting period's results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined

as the average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies,

materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated 

based on the current year constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN

Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the 

impact of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation accounting was discontinued for MTN Irancell and MTN Sudan on 1 July 2015 and 

1 July 2016 respectively. The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016, and

hyperinflation accounting was applied from December 2016 onwards. The economy of Syria was assessed to be 

hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2014, and hyperinflation accounting has been applied since.

Further announcement regarding Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Attorney General of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria (AGF) matters and renewal of cautionary announcement.

As previously disclosed the CBN has alleged improper dividend repatriations by MTN Nigeria
Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) and requested that $8,1 billion be returned “to the coffers of
the CBN” whilst the AGF has alleged unpaid taxes on foreign payments and imports and that
approximately $2,0 billion in relation to these taxes be paid to the Federal Government of Nigeria (and
now directed that the payment of the $8.1 billion is dealt with through his office rather than as
directed by the CBN). MTN Nigeria has denied these allegations and claims. Furthermore 4 commercial
banks were issued fines in respect of the administration of the CCI and irregular dividend repatriation
matter and requested to return, in aggregate, the same $8,1 billion.

In order to protect MTN Nigeria's assets and shareholder rights within the confines of Nigerian law,
we have applied today in the Federal High Court of Nigeria for injunctive relief restraining the CBN and
the AGF from taking further action in respect of their orders, while we continue to engage with the
relevant authorities on these matters. We remain resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed any
offences and will continue to vigorously defend its position.

We will provide further information as and when available. Shareholders are accordingly advised to
continue to exercise caution when dealing in the Company’s securities until a further announcement
is made.

Announcement regarding Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Attorney General (AG) letter
and renewal of cautionary announcement.

1. CBN CCI Matter

In the cautionary announcement of 30 August 2018, we communicated that MTN Nigeria
Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) had received a letter on 29 August 2018 from the CBN alleging
that Certificates of Capital Importation (CCI) issued in respect of the conversion of shareholders loans
in MTN Nigeria to preference shares in 2007 had been improperly issued. Therefore, the CBN claims
that historic dividends repatriated by MTN Nigeria between 2007 and 2015 amounting to $8,1 billion
need to be refunded to the ?coffers of the CBN?. We felt it appropriate to provide further background
on this matter and an update on progress to date.

For background on the CCI?s, Nigerian legislation provides that any person may invest in any enterprise
with foreign currency or capital imported into Nigeria through an Authorised Dealer which is then
converted into naira. Foreign currency imported into Nigeria and invested in an enterprise shall be
guaranteed unconditional transferability of funds through an Authorised Dealer in freely convertible
currency relating to dividends or profits attributable to the investment, and in respect of loan servicing
where a foreign loan has been obtained. For an individual or corporate entity in Nigeria to remit
dividends/loans/interest offshore, pursuant to their investment they are required to provide proof
that cash/equipment was brought into the country. The documentary evidence required by the CBN
for this proof is the CCI. The CCI is issued by the Authorised Dealer as evidence of the fact that the
investment was made and must be produced when any offshore remittance is made.

MTN Group and the original shareholders injected a total of $402, 625,419 into MTN Nigeria between
2001 and 2006 in the form of loans and equity. These initial inflows were the basis for the issuance of
various legacy CCI?s obtained from Authorized Dealers in accordance with regulations. The inflow of
capital has been confirmed by the CBN.

The CCI process is essentially in place both for the protection of investors as well as to provide the
CBN with documentary evidence for monitoring capital inflows and outflows. Although over time the
CCIs have been re-issued, consolidated and re-constituted to reflect the changing MTN capital and
shareholding structure, the amount of 402, 625,419, has remained the same.

One aspect of the changing capital structure was the conversion of shareholder loans to preference
shares. It is important to note that all the historic dividends were declared against valid equity CCI?s
and in fact no preference dividends were declared and no interest in respect of these preference
shares was paid.

2. AG Assessment of foreign Tax Compliance

In the context of the recent developments in Nigeria we felt it appropriate to update the market on
our engagement with the Attorney General (AG) and his investigation into tax compliance in Nigeria.

The Nigerian AG has in recent months been engaging various corporates in Nigeria on an assessment
of tax compliance relating to, inter alia, import duties, VAT and withholding taxes on foreign
imports/payments. In this process his office made a high-level calculation that MTN Nigeria should
have paid approximately $2,0 billion in taxes relating to the importation of foreign equipment and
payments to foreign suppliers over the last 10 years and he requested MTN Nigeria to do a self-
assessment of the taxes in this regard that have been actually paid.

In August 2018 MTN submitted comprehensive documentation to the office of the AG. MTN Nigeria
has also completed an initial assessment of the full period which indicates that total payments made
to the tax authorities in regard to these foreign imports and payments in aggregate are $700 million.
There are valid reasons for the differences between the actual payments and the AG high-level
assessment.

We were notified by the office of the AG last week that they have not accepted the documentation
presented and they have given notice of an intention to recover the $2.0bn from MTN Nigeria. Based
on the detailed review performed MTN Nigeria believes it has fully settled all amounts owing under
the taxes in question.

3. Summation

It is both regrettable and disconcerting that despite the historic engagements with the Nigerian
authorities by MTN Nigeria, the senate investigation into the CCI matter, and the multiple tax
assessments done by the Nigerian tax authority over many years that were satisfactorily concluded,
that these matters are being reopened.

MTN Nigeria will continue to engage with the relevant authorities on all these matters and we remain
resolute that MTN Nigeria has not committed any offences and will vigorously defend its position.

We will provide further information as and when available. Shareholders are accordingly advised to
continue to exercise caution when dealing in the Company?s securities until a further announcement
is made.

Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) correspondence regarding Certificates of Capital Importation (CCI’s)
in Nigeria and cautionary announcement

MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) received a letter on 29 August 2018 from CBN
alleging that CCI’s issued in respect of the conversion of shareholders loans in MTN Nigeria to
preference shares in 2007 had been improperly issued. As a consequence they claim that historic
dividends repatriated by MTN Nigeria between 2007 and 2015 amounting to $8,1 billion need to be
refunded to the CBN.

MTN Nigeria strongly refutes these allegations and claims. No dividends have been declared or paid
by MTN Nigeria other than pursuant to CCI’s issued by our bankers and with the approval of the CBN
as required by law.

The issues surrounding the CCI’shave already been the subject of a thorough enquiry by the Senate of
Nigeria. In September 2016 the Senate mandated the Committee on Banking, Insurance and other
Financial Institutions to carry out a holistic investigation on compliance with the Foreign exchange
(monitoring and miscellaneous) Act by MTN Nigeria & Others. In its report issued in November 2017,
the findings evidenced that MTN Nigeria did not collude to contravene the foreign exchange laws and
there were no negative recommendations made against MTN Nigeria.

MTN Nigeria, as a law-abiding citizen of Nigeria, is committed to good governance and to abiding by
the extant laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The re-emergence of these issues is regrettable as
it damages investor confidence and, by extension, inhibits the growth and development of the
Nigerian economy.

We will engage with the relevant authorities and vigorously defend our position on this matter and
provide further information when available. Shareholders are accordingly advised to exercise caution
when dealing in the Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

Certain information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. This is presented for

1. The financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared excluding the impact
   of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill and asset impairments, tower profits (including the profit realised on the
   exercise of the IHS exchange right whereby the group's interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for
   additional shareholding in IHS Holding Limited), and the Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting of the remeasurement impact 
   when the settlement was entered into and the finance costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting 
   of the liability) (the pro forma adjustments) and constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not
   extracted from the segment disclosure included in the reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial statements for
   the six months ended 30 June 2018. This pro forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the
   pro forma adjustments from the consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable analysis year on year. The pro
   forma adjustments have been calculated in terms of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial
   statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except for the changes in accounting policies as a result of the 
   adoption of the accounting pronouncements effective 1 January 2018.   

2. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the
   group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting period's results 
   have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates. 
   The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian
   naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year constant currency results
   compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, 
   the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of South Sudan
   and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was applied for the period under review.

The joint independent auditors' review does not report on all of the information contained in this announcement/financial
results. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the joint independent 
auditors' engagement they should obtain a copy of the joint independent auditors' review report together with the accompanying 
financial information from MTN's office.
  
The group's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the
Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture - equity accounted),
Swaziland (joint venture - equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin,
Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture - equity
accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 

Although Iran, Botswana and Swaziland form part of their respective regions geographically and operationally, they are
excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity accounted for by the group.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments: 
""MTN had an encouraging first half of 2018, with an acceleration in the second quarter, supported by an improved
operational performance across many markets. This was led by Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. Service revenue growth
increased, driven by robust voice revenue growth and the continued expansion of data and digital revenue. This in turn 
was supported by a 2,8% increase in subscriber numbers, continued network rollout, increasing 3G and 4G population 
coverage and improving customer service.

""We resolved some key regulatory issues in Cameroon and Benin, launched the initial public offering (IPO) of MTN Ghana 
and made progress on the IPO of MTN Nigeria. As part of our ongoing portfolio review, we agreed to the sale of MTN Cyprus.
In the period, we further strengthened our governance of risk, continued to boost our specialist skills base, recorded
improvements in employee engagement and extended mobile internet access to more people. 

""Despite continued challenges in repatriating funds from MTN Irancell, the board remains committed to plans to declare
a total dividend of 500 cents per share for 2018 and is targeting growth of 10% to 20% over the medium term. We believe
everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life and see opportunity to provide this. We are confident that 
MTN remains well placed to deliver on our medium-term guidance.""

Overview
MTN reported improved constant currency results for the six months ended 30 June 2018, delivering broadly on our 
medium-term targets as we remained focused on executing our BRIGHT strategy. Growth in service revenue accelerated, 
margins on earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased, and voice, data 
and digital revenue continued to expand.

Particularly noteworthy was the 38,6%* year-on-year (YoY) growth in second quarter EBITDA in Nigeria and 8,6%*
increase YoY in South Africa. In Ghana, the second quarter EBITDA was up 13,6%* YoY after the introduction of the 
management fee from 1 May 2018. 

Macroeconomic conditions remained challenging in South Africa, Iran and Cameroon; however, these were supportive in
Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda. The South African economy had a poor start to the year, contracting 2,2% in the first quarter.
Nigeria's economy expanded by 1,9% in the same period on the back of improved oil production and oil prices and greater
foreign exchange liquidity. Iran's economy felt the impact of the US decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, and foreign currency remained in short supply. Many markets, particularly those in the
Middle East, continued to experience socio economic challenges.

Among key currency moves, the rand's average rate strengthened 7,7% against the US dollar YoY and 22,6% against the
Nigerian naira. In April 2018, Iran unified the official and open market exchange rates of the rial, leading to an
effective 19,4% depreciation against the dollar. 

Against our medium-term target of upper-single-digit growth in group service revenue, we delivered a 10,2%* increase
in constant currency terms. This was led by growth of 17,0%* by MTN Nigeria, 27,9%* by MTN Ghana and 2,9% by MTN South
Africa. Among our large operations, MTN Uganda also contributed positively; however; MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast
reported declines.

At 30 June 2018, the group had 223,4 million subscribers. This compares to 217,2 million at the end of 2017. 

Robust voice revenue growth, along with the continued expansion of data and digital revenue, supported overall service
revenue growth. Voice revenue increased by 6,2%* in the period, evidence of our targeted customer value management
(CVM) efforts as well as the continued shift in Nigeria of voice growth as we optimised our value-added service (VAS)
offerings. Data revenue expanded 26,7%* as we continued to record improvements in the quality and capacity of our data networks
after committing R11 461 million** in capital expenditure (capex). We rolled out a total of 3 603 3G and 3 660 4G sites. 
This supported data adoption, and at the end of June 2018 we had 71,2 million active data users. 

Digital revenue increased by 7,6%*, underpinned by the greater uptake of MTN Mobile Money (MoMo), but negatively
impacted by lower VAS revenue. At the end of June 2018, we had 24,1 million active MoMo users in 14 markets. MoMo revenue 
increased by more than 50% YoY. We continued to focus on our rich-media service offerings. 

Over the medium term, we target improved profit margins. In the first half, the group's margin on EBITDA expanded by 
2,2 percentage points (pp) to 35,5%*.

The reported EBITDA margin was 35,6%** compared to 38,2%** in June 2017. It was positively impacted by a net gain on
the dilution of our investment in Iran Internet Group (IIG), following the entry of a new investor into that business. 
It was also supported by the reversal of fixed and intangible asset impairments (excluding goodwill) for MTN Sudan of 
R306 million** previously booked under hyperinflation accounting. The reported EBITDA margin was negatively impacted 
by currency fluctuations.

Reported basic headline earnings per share (HEPS) declined to 215 cents** from 231 cents** in the first half of 2017. HEPS
were negatively impacted by a swing of 21 cents in the contribution from associates and joint ventures. 

HEPS were also impacted by the significant items in the first half: 17 cents relating to the Nigeria fine
interest (from 24 cents in first half 2017); hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of 27 cents (from 42 cents in first 
half 2017); and the impact of foreign exchange losses and gains of 21 cents (from 49 cents in first half 2017). 
HEPS excluding these aforementioned items declined to 280 cents from 346 cents. 

On 29 May 2018, MTN Ghana launched its IPO. This is part of the operation's plan to introduce a broad base of
Ghanaians as investors and, in so doing, fulfil a requirement of its 4G licence. The offer period closed on 31 July 2018.
Potential investors could apply for shares using MTN Mobile Money - the first mobile financial services platform to 
be used for an IPO. MTN Ghana is expected to list on the Ghana Stock Exchange by 5 September 2018, subject to final 
regulatory and corporate approvals.

As part of the ongoing review of our portfolio, in July 2018 we signed an agreement to sell 100% of MTN Cyprus, which
is reflected in our accounts as a 'disposal group held for sale'. The net sale proceeds of approximately €260 million 
(approximately R4,17 billion using the closing exchange rate at 30 June 2018) will be paid upfront. We expect the sale 
to close within the third quarter of 2018. MTN Cyprus is MTN's only operating business in the European Union and falls 
outside our core footprint of Africa and the Middle East.

Our e-commerce joint ventures continued to grow. Within Africa Internet Holding (AIH), online shopping site Jumia
continued to report solid top-line growth. In the first half of 2018, it recorded a 92% YoY increase in new customers 
to more than a million and an 80% increase in orders to around four million. The increase in gross merchandise value 
was 66%. This was powered by a 50% increase in active merchants to 47 000 and an 880% increase in SKUs to more than 
12 million items.

Within Middle East Internet Holding, online retailer Wadi's recently launched grocery delivery service became the
market leader in Saudi Arabia. Ride-hailing service Jeeny recorded a 33% YoY increase in ride numbers and cleaning 
service app Helpling increased bookings by 70% YoY. 

Within IIG, in the first half of the year, cab-hailing and online food ordering service app Snapp reached 1,2 million
daily rides and 27 000 delivered food orders a day. Hotel reservation app Snapptrip became the number one player in 
the Iran hotel booking market.

Regulatory and legal considerations
We tackled various regulatory matters in the period. MTN Cameroon renegotiated its licence agreement as part of an
addendum for the usage of 4G spectrum. MTN Benin concluded a memorandum of understanding with the government as well as
negotiations around future frequency fees.

In South Africa, we continued to engage with the authorities on proposed amendments to the Electronic Communications
Act. We are working to find a solution that would best deliver the most cost-effective coverage for South Africans as
well as resources for the national fiscus. We await cabinet's decision on the future of spectrum allocation.

On 1 June 2018, representatives of the South African Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) visited
our offices and those of our external legal counsel to obtain documents relating to aspects of the Turkcell litigation
currently before the South Gauteng High Court. This lawsuit was initiated in 2013 by Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S.
and East Asian Consortium. It relates to Turkcell's alleged grievances arising from its unsuccessful bid to obtain a
mobile licence in Iran, and the awarding of that licence to MTN Irancell in 2005. MTN believes there is no legal merit to
Turkcell's claim and will continue to oppose it. 

On 8 May 2018, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the JCPOA agreement and to re-impose economic sanctions 
against Iran. The first round of these sanctions became effective on 7 August 2018 and a second phase of sanctions is 
expected to be effective on 5 November 2018. The sanctions may limit the ability of the group to repatriate cash from 
MTN Irancell, including future dividends. As at 30 June 2018, Iranian rial-denominated dividends receivable and loans 
amounted to R3,4 billion. The official exchange rate to the US dollar was 42 490 rials at 30 June 2018 and has remained 
largely unchanged since April 2018. Sanctions may place pressure on the official exchange rate that is used to translate 
dividend and loan receivables as well as the equity-accounted results of MTN Irancell. We will continue to monitor the 
situation including the response of the Iranian authorities and the other JCPOA members.

As previously reported, so far during 2018, MTN Group has repatriated approximately €88 million from MTN Irancell,
including €61 million relating to the full 2017 dividend due to MTN as well as a further €27 million of historic dividends.
Opportunities for repatriation within the legislative framework continue to exist, however MTN Group has not factored
these into our cash flow forecasts.

Dividends
The board has declared a gross interim dividend of 175 cents per share. 

Prospects and guidance 
Well positioned to deliver growth

MTN is a leading operator in one of the world’s fastest-growing regions. Guided by our clearly defined strategy, we are well 
positioned to grow by leveraging our scale and enhancing our competitive position. With our expanding data coverage and drive 
to accelerate smartphone adoption, we will take advantage of the material data and digital opportunity in our markets. As we 
build operational momentum, we will intensify our focus on our digital businesses in the future. 

In the next few years we expect to widen our group EBITDA margin. We also target upper-single-digit growth in constant currency 
service revenue, driven by double-digit growth from MTN Nigeria and mid-single-digit growth from MTN South Africa.

Our extensive capital investment programme in recent years has sharply improved our network performance in many markets. This has 
supported our efforts to provide the best customer experience and to grow through enabling greater adoption of data and digital services. 
We expect the group capex intensity, which measures our efficiency in deploying assets, to moderate over the medium term to within a 
target range of 20% to 15%. At end-June 2018 it was 18,3%**. Our improving group margins and declining capex intensity are expected 
to support improved cash flow generation for the group.

Portfolio review
We continue to review the markets in which we operate to ensure a good strategic and operational fit. We continue 
to assess the cash flow performance of our operations in conflict markets, focusing on ensuring that they remain
self-funded. We are also evaluating acquisition and partnership opportunities across Africa and the Middle East. 
These ongoing reviews could, over the medium term, result in some changes to our portfolio. 

Listing
MTN Nigeria expects to list on the Nigerian Stock Exchange before the end of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals and
appropriate market conditions. The MTN Group expects that any reduction in its ownership of MTN Nigeria will be
limited.

  of other asset impairments. 
  2017: Exclusion of the impact of impairments of assets previously written up for the impact of hyperinflation for MTN 
  Syria (R1 125 million) and MTN Sudan (R1 690 million), partly offset by a reversal of assets previously impaired.
2 Represents the exclusion of the impact of goodwill impairment recognised
  2018: In relation to MTN Yemen.
  2017: In relation to MTN Yemen (R807 million), MTN Afghanistan (R841 million) and MTN Sudan (R983 million). An amount of 
  R192 million of the goodwill impairment on MTN Sudan relates to the carrying value of goodwill previously written up for 
  the impact of hyperinflation.
3 The financial impact relating to the sale of tower assets during the financial period is excluded:
  2018: Release of a deferred gain of R12 million (2017: R13 million) in Ghana.
  2017: Release of a deferred gain of R13 million in Ghana and R6 017 million profit realised on the exercise of the exchange 
  right where the interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for an increased shareholding in IHS Holdings.
4 Represents the gain on dilution of the group’s investments in International Digital Services Middle East Limited following the

5 Profits earned on the disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are excluded.
6 Exclusion of finance cost recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the financial liability created on conclusion 
  of the Nigeria regulatory fine.
7 The impact of hyperinflation is excluded for the operations that are currently accounted for on a hyperinflationary basis 
  (MTN Syria and MTN South Sudan) as well as those that have previously been accounted for on a hyperinflationary basis. The economies 
  of Iran and Sudan were assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016 respectively and hyperinflation 
  accounting was discontinued from this date onwards. For these operations the impact of hyperinflation unwind over time mainly through 
  depreciation, amortisation or subsequent asset impairments. 
8 Adjustment for the net forex losses impacting earnings for the respective periods.
 
Exchange rates 
The stronger average rand and the depreciation of the Nigerian naira and the Iranian rial had a negative translation
impact on rand-reported results for the period. The average naira depreciated by 13,3% against the US dollar YoY, and the
closing rate at end-June 2018 was down 0,3% in the period. The average rand strengthened by 7,7% YoY against the US
dollar and closed 9,9% weaker in the period. 

Revenue
Group revenue increased 9,7%* and service revenue increased by 10,2%*, supported by growth in MTN Nigeria (up 17,0%*), 
MTN Ghana (up 27,9%*), MTN South Africa (up 2,9%) and MTN Uganda (up 8,8%*). MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast 
reported a 7,0%* and 6,6%* decline in service revenue respectively. 


Costs
Total costs were well contained, increasing by 6,8%*. They were negatively impacted by foreign-denominated 
expenses in Nigeria and costs associated with the rollout of network sites. 

EBITDA
EBITDA excludes impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of associates and joint 
ventures after tax. Group EBITDA increased by 17,0%*. It was driven by increases of 31,5%*, 5,7%* and 
34,7%* in MTN Nigeria, MTN South Africa and MTN Ghana respectively and lower head office costs, which 
were partially offset by the performance of the WECA markets. The group EBITDA margin increased by 
2,2 percentage points* to 35,5%*.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill
The group depreciation charge increased by 10,2%* because of higher capex over the past few years. Amortisation costs
increased by 17,6%*, after higher expenditure on software in the previous period. Non-hyperinflation-related goodwill
impairments consisted of impairments in Yemen (R149 million**).

Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by 6,4%**. This was mainly because of lower interest income in Nigeria after the early redemption 
by MTN Nigeria of treasury bonds. 

Net forex losses declined by 60,3%** because of lower losses in Nigeria, after the operation settled a number of
foreign-denominated expenses. Net forex losses mainly included:
- Head office losses of R425 million; and
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R175 million incurred on US dollar-denominated third-party payables.

Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax
We reported a profit of R197 million** from associates and joint ventures, compared to a profit of R579 million** in
the same period of 2017. This was mainly because of a 30,1%** decline in MTN Irancell's profits - a result of higher
depreciation related to network rollout, increased transmission costs and higher forex losses because of the weaker 
rial. The share of results of joint ventures was also affected by the increased loss in Africa Internet Holding (AIH) 
because of higher marketing and logistics costs.

Taxation                                                                                                          
The reported effective tax rate was 34,1%**, driven higher by lower profits from associates and joint ventures as 
well as non-deductible interest on the Nigeria fine. The prior year's rate had also benefited from non-taxable tower
profits. The group's reported taxation charge increased by 5,2%** YoY to R2 541 million**.

Earnings
We reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 215 cents** compared to 231 cents** in the comparable period. 
HEPS were negatively impacted by a swing of 21 cents in associates and joint ventures. HEPS were impacted by the 
following items: 17 cents relating to the Nigeria fine interest (from 24 cents in first half 2017); hyperinflation 
(excluding impairments) of 27 cents (from 42 cents in first half 2017); and the impact of foreign exchange losses 
and gains of 21 cents (from 49 cents in first half 2017), and reflected a decline to 280 cents from 346 cents. 

Cash flow
Cash inflows from operations were slightly lower at R16 757 million**. The group repatriated R1 296 million** 
in cash from MTN Irancell. Key cash outflows included cash capex of R12 549 million** and dividends paid to equity 
holders of R8 098 million**.
                                                         
Capital expenditure                                      
Capex increased by 20,0%* (increased by 11,2%** to R11 461 million**) for the first half.

Financial position
Net debt increased to R69 831 million** from R57 145 million** reported at year-end, impacted by the weaker closing
rand and the payment of the final dividend under the previous dividend policy.

Operational review of key markets

MTN South Africa
- Service revenue increased by 2,9%*
- Data revenue increased by 13,5%*
- Digital revenue increased by 17,9%*
- EBITDA grew 5,7%* to R7 450 million*
- EBITDA margin increased by 0,8pp* to 35,2%*
- Capex increased by 12,5%*

MTN South Africa reported improved profitability on a strong consumer business, supported by our CVM initiatives.
However, growth in service revenue was below expectations on the slow turnaround of the enterprise business. Despite 
this, we started to see a stabilisation of enterprise towards the end of the second quarter after the appointment of 
new leadership. Data usage was driven by the strong uptake of social media bundles. Digital revenue grew on demand 
for Xtratime and gaming.

Prepaid service revenue increased by 2,5%*, while postpaid service revenue declined by 2,5%*. Postpaid churn
stabilised. We expect an acceleration of service revenue growth in the second half, driven by improvements in the 
postpaid and enterprise segments.

The subscriber base increased by 2,2% from December 2017 to 30,2 million. We continued to record network improvements.
Boosted by these, we signed a deal to provide wholesale roaming services to Cell C, which will lead to incremental
growth in revenue and EBITDA from the fourth quarter. Following the introduction of new methodology to measure NPS, 
we moved to number two NPS. 

Ahead of the decision of the courts on the timeline for the implementation of new data regulations, over the next 
six months we will proactively implement the various changes to which we have committed. 

MTN Nigeria
- Service revenue increased by 17,0%*
- Data revenue increased by 63,7%*
- Digital revenue decreased by 24,8%*
- EBITDA grew by 31,5%* to R9 094 million*
- EBITDA margin increased by 4,7pp* to 43,0%* 
- Capex increased by 0,5%* 

MTN Nigeria performed ahead of expectations, with double-digit growth in voice revenue driving accelerated service
revenue growth and the further widening of the EBITDA margin. Increased usage and growth in data subscribers supported 
data revenue growth. Digital revenue declined as a result of further optimisation of our VAS business. Towards the end of
the second quarter, net additions and revenue growth slowed in line with economic activity, as well as some seasonality.
We expect this trend to continue in the third quarter, with an improved performance expected in the fourth quarter. 

The subscriber base expanded by 5,6% from December 2017 to 55,2 million. We continued work to improve customer
experience and recorded steady growth in overall NPS, supported by our increased efforts to improve network quality and
availability. We reported an increase in the number of active MoMo customers to nearly 2,2 million. The enterprise 
business performed well. We made good progress on our plans to list MTN Nigeria on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. We do 
not expect any material cash inflows to the group from the IPO.

MTN Ghana reported a very strong performance in the first half, continuing to benefit from the relatively buoyant
economy. Growth in voice, data and digital revenue drove a 27,9%* increase in service revenue and supported the 2,0pp*
widening in the EBITDA margin to 39,2%*. The new Ghana management fee agreement was put in place effective 1 May 2018. 
MTN Ghana's strong first half performance was supported by various attractive value propositions, including the youth
activation initiative MTN Pulse. Subscribers grew by 5,5% from December 2017 to 16,5 million. The number of active 
data subscribers increased by 6,1% in the same period to 6,9 million and data volumes more than doubled. This supported 
a 36,7%* increase in data revenue.

MTN Ghana continued to lead the group in terms of the total number and growth of MoMo subscribers, adding 10,7% more
active MoMo subscribers from December 2017 to 7,9 million, supported by consistent service delivery across all channels.
At end-June 2018, MoMo made up 15% of revenue. In May 2018, MTN Ghana's IPO was launched and the operation is expected
to be listed, subject to final regulatory and corporate approvals, by 5 September 2018. A new CEO, Selorm Adadevoh, joined in 
June 2018.

MTN Uganda increased service revenue by 8,8%*, led by a 19,7%* increase in digital revenue. Growth in MoMo revenue
exceeded expectations and profitability was supported by a reduction in commissions paid to MoMo agents. The number of
active MoMo customers on Uganda's leading brand and network NPS operator increased to 5,3 million. MoMo subscribers 
made up more than half the total subscriber base of 10,5 million, which declined by 1,8%, impacted by the regulator's 
ban on the sale and replacement of SIM cards between March and May 2018. The number of active data subscribers rose 
to 1,8 million, helping lift data revenue by 17,8%*.

- Digital revenue increased by 23,0%*

MTN Cameroon's subscriber base declined by 5,9% from December 2017 to 6,6 million in a difficult operating
environment, impacted by a data shutdown and weak economic activity. Service revenue decreased by 7,0%*, affected by 
the lower subscriber base and despite 15,0%* growth in data and 71,2%* growth in digital revenue. The number of active 
MoMo customers increased by 10,5% from December 2017 to 1,2 million, with revenue up by 404%* YoY. EBITDA declined 
by 44,1%* and the EBITDA margin narrowed 11,8pp* to 19,2%*. 

MTN Ivory Coast's service revenue declined by 6,6%* on weaker voice revenue in a competitive market. Digital and data
revenue continued to expand, up by 34,7%* and 15,4%* respectively. The EBITDA margin declined by 8,5pp* to 26,8%*
because of declining voice revenue and increased interconnect costs, most notably national interconnect costs. The 
subscriber base grew by 3,1% from December 2017 to 11,3 million. We led the market in brand NPS and the total number 
of active MoMo customers increased by 15,8% from December 2017 to 2,5 million. MoMo revenue grew by 48,7% and data 
volumes almost doubled. We completed subscriber re-identification in May 2018.

MTN Irancell had a good first half and remained the market leader in terms of data services. Strong growth in data
revenue was the result of the extensive network rollout and optimisation during 2017, as well as the additional rollout 
of 3G and 4G network sites in the first half and successful spectrum refarming, attractive segmented offers and strong
subscriber net additions as more subscribers moved to 3G-enabled devices. By end-June, of the total of 44,6 million
subscribers, 19,3 million were active data subscribers. Data traffic volumes increased by more than 110% YoY. The 
enterprise business continued to record good growth. The number of subscribers using the MyMTN app increased to 
6,7 million from 4,6 million in December 2017. MTN Irancell secured access to more spectrum in the 2 600MHz band. 
Despite an increase in transmission costs, optimisation in other areas of the business led to total costs being 
managed and this contributed to EBITDA of R6 745 million*. EBITDA was also supported by a net gain on the dilution 
of the investment in IIG. This was following the entry of a new investor into that business.

Following the decision of the US to withdraw from the JCPOA, the rial has depreciated sharply and access to foreign
exchange has become more difficult, pressuring economic growth.

Board changes
We announced the appointment of three new independent non-executive directors. Swazi Tshabalala and Mcebisi Jonas
joined the board on 1 June 2018 and Dr Khotso Mokhele joined the board on 1 July 2018. We wish them well in their 
new roles.

Declaration of interim ordinary dividend
Notice is hereby given that a gross interim dividend of 175 cents per share for the period to 30 June 2018 has been
declared. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration is 1 884 296 758 (including 9 791 839
treasury shares held by MTN Holdings and 76 835 378 shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net dividend of 140 cents per 
share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend withholding tax of 35 cents per share. 
The net dividend per share for the respective categories of shareholders for the different dividend tax rates is as follows:
- 0%            175,00 cents per share
- 5%            166,25 cents per share
- 7,5%          161,875 cents per share
- 10%           157,50 cents per share
- 12,5%         153,125 cents per share
- 15%           148,75 cents per share

These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation agreements
as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2018

1. Independent review
The directors of the company take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been reviewed by our joint auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Grant Thornton Inc., who have expressed an unmodified conclusion 
thereon. The joint external auditors have performed their review in accordance with International Standards on Review 
Engagements (ISRE) 2410.

A copy of the independent auditors' review report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is 
available for inspection at the company's registered office, together with the interim financial statements identified 
in the independent auditors' review report.                 
 
The joint independent auditors' review report does not report on all of the information contained in this 
announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the joint 
independent auditors' engagement they should obtain a copy of the independent auditors' review report together with 
the accompanying interim financial statements from the company's registered office.

2. General information
MTN Group Limited (the company) carries on the business of investing in the telecommunications industry through its 
subsidiary companies, joint ventures, associates and related investments.

3. Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2018 are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standard (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides 
as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee (APC), Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Standards Council (FRSC), and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.    

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

4. Principal accounting policies
The group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) which were effective for the group from 1 January 2018. The following standards had an impact 
on the group:
- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9).
- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15).

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in terms 
of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual 
financial statements except as previously stated above and except for a change in the presentation of cash flows. Refer to 
note 22 for details.

5. Hyperinflation
The financial statements of the group entities whose functional currencies are the currencies of hyperinflationary 
economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.

The economy of Sudan was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary, effective 1 July 2016, and hyperinflation accounting 
was discontinued from this date onwards. As at 31 December 2017, the historical increase in the asset value as a result 
of hyperinflation accounting had been fully impaired, which resulted in a R1 690 million decrease in EBITDA during 
2017. During the six months ended 30 June 2018, R306 million of the impairment was reversed, resulting in an increase 
in EBITDA. This amount represents the full impairment recognised during 2017, translated at a significantly weaker 
exchange rate.

The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation accounting 
was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016. As at 31 December 2017 and 30 June 2018, the property, plant and 
equipment of South Sudan was fully impaired, resulting in no hyperinflation adjustment on capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
for the respective period.

In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued 
effective 1 July 2015. The group's results from Iran include expenses resulting from the discontinuation of hyperinflation 
accounting mainly relating to the subsequent depreciation of assets that were historically written up under hyperinflation 
accounting. The additional income statement charge reduced equity-accounted earnings from Iran by R540 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2018 (June 2017: R640 million, December 2017: R1 328 million).    

The economy of Syria was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2014, and hyperinflation accounting has 
been applied since. The group's proxy indicator for inflation in Syria remained stable during the period. Therefore, 
a hyperinflation adjustment factor of one was applied during the period.

The impact of hyperinflation on the segment analysis is as follows:

6. Segment analysis
The group has identified reportable segments that are used by the group executive committee (chief operating decision 
maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The reportable segments are 
largely grouped according to their geographic locations and reporting lines to the CODM. The group's underlying operations 
are clustered as follows:    
- South Africa.
- Nigeria.
- South and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA).
- West and Central Africa (WECA).
- Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

June 2017 comparative numbers for the segments have been restated for changes to the group's segment presentation that 
were made during the second half of 2017.

Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that are attributed on a reasonable basis, whether from external transactions or from transactions with 
other group segments.

The measure of reporting profit for each segment, that also represents the basis on which the CODM reviews segment results, 
is EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest (which includes gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions), 
tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented before recognising the following items:
- Impairment of goodwill.
- Loss on derecognition of a long-term loan receivable.
- Net monetary gain resulting from the application of hyperinflation.
- Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax.

For the purposes of the review of segment results by the CODM, EBITDA also excludes the following items:
- Hyperinflation (note 5).
- Tower sale profits.
- MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense.
- Exchange right profit on IHS investment.

These exclusions have remained unchanged from the prior year.

Irancell Telecommunication Company Services (PJSC) (Iran) proportionate results are included in the segment analysis as 
reviewed by the CODM and excluded from IFRS reported results for revenue, EBITDA and CAPEX due to equity accounting for 
joint ventures. The results of Iran in the segment analysis exclude the impact of hyperinflation accounting.

8. Nigeria regulatory fine
On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) resolved the matter relating to the previously imposed 
regulatory fine with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).

In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria agreed to pay a total cash amount of N330 billion 
over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion1) to the FGN as full and final settlement of the matter.

The regulatory fine was fully expensed in 2016. A discount unwind of R396 million (30 June 2017: R537 million, 
31 December 2017: R1,0 billion) was recognised in finance costs during the current period relating to the outstanding 
liability. The balance of the liability at 30 June 2018 amounts to R5,7 billion (30 June 2017: R7,2 billion, 
31 December 2017: R6,6 billion) after taking into account the payment of N55 billion (R1,8 billion2) on 28 March 2018 
and the unwinding of the interest.

2 Amount translated at the 28 March 2018 rate R1 = N30,61.

12. Financial instruments
Financial instruments at amortised cost
The group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost except for the 
borrowings set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values.

Listed long-term borrowings
The group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue which were issued in prior 
years, with a carrying amount of R24 186 million at 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017: R23 117 million, 31 December 2017: 
R21 765 million) and a fair value of R23 255 million (30 June 2017: R23 036 million, 31 December 2017: R22 434 million). 
The fair values of these instruments are determined by reference to quoted prices on the Irish bond market. The market 
for these bonds is not considered to be liquid and consequently the fair value measurement is categorised within 
level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Financial instruments measured at fair value
The fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined as follows:

Treasury bills
The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 
The group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R370 million (30 June 2017: R293 million, 
31 December 2017: R343 million) as at fair value through other comprehensive income (2017: available for sale) 
and the group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R717 million (30 June 2017: R697 million, 
31 December 2017: R307 million) as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of these investments is 
categorised within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair value measurement of investment in IHS
Included in investments in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position is an equity investment in IHS 
Group at fair value of R24 544 million at 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017: R24 859 million, 31 December 2017: R27 045 million). 
The fair value was calculated using an earnings multiple technique and was based on unobservable market inputs 
including tower industry earnings multiples of between 11 times to 16 times applied to MTN management's estimates 
of earnings, less estimated net debt.

Given the confidentiality restrictions in the shareholders' agreement with IHS Group, MTN does not have access to the 
IHS Group business plans or 2018 actual financial information. Any estimated earnings used to derive the existing fair 
value are therefore solely based on MTN management assumptions and market estimates on financial growth, currency 
movements, costs and performance. The investment has therefore been classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 
for the current reporting period. An increase of one in the low and high end of the multiple range, keeping other 
inputs constant, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of R2 244 million and a decrease of one in the 
low and high end of the multiple range, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair 
value by R2 244 million as at 30 June 2018. An increase of 10% in the estimated earnings used, keeping other inputs 
constant, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of R2 949 million and a decrease of 10% in the 
estimated earnings used, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of 
R2 949 million as at 30 June 2018.    

A decrease of R5 469 million (June 2017: R817 million increase, December 2017: R4 249 million increase) has been 
recognised for the period under review in other comprehensive income resulting from the change in fair value that 
also included a liquidity discount.

Uncertain tax exposures                                                                        
The group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and the group's interpretation and application of the various tax rules 
applied in direct and indirect tax filings may result in disputes between the group and the relevant tax authority. 
The outcome of such disputes may not be favourable to the group. At year-end there were a number of tax disputes ongoing 
in various of the group's operating entities, the most significant of which related to a transfer pricing dispute which 
the group is contesting. At 30 June 2018, the contingency for the transfer pricing assessment has been significantly 
reduced following the group's review of the tax authority's submissions made in the course of preparing for litigation. 
Based on internal and external legal and technical advice obtained, the group remains confident that it has a strong 
legal case to contest the remaining exposure.

The group is involved in various legal and regulatory matters, the outcome of which may not be favourable to the group and 
none of which are considered individually material. 

The group has applied its judgement and has recognised liabilities based on whether additional amounts will be payable and 
has included contingent liabilities where economic outflows are considered possible but not probable.

The group's functional and presentation currency is rand. The weakening of the closing rate of the rand against the 
functional currencies of the group's largest operations contributed to the increase in consolidated assets and liabilities 
and the resulting foreign currency translation reserve increase of R5 235 million (June 2017: R3 874 million reduction, 
December 2017: R12 417 million reduction) for the period.

Net investment hedges
The group hedges a designated portion of its dollar net assets in MTN (Dubai) Limited (MTN Dubai) for FOREX exposure 
arising between the USD and ZAR as part of the group's risk management objectives. The group designated external borrowings 
(Eurobonds) denominated in USD held by MTN (Mauritius) Investments Limited with a value of R23,3 billion (June 2017: 
R23 billion, December 2017: R22,4 billion) and external borrowings denominated in USD held by MTN Nigeria Communications 
Limited with a value of R2,1 billion (June 2017: R3,5 billion, December 2017: R2,6 billion) as hedging instruments. 
For the period of the hedge relationship, foreign exchange movements on these hedging instruments are recognised in other 
comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), offsetting the exchange differences 
recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on translation of the designated dollar net assets of MTN Dubai to 
ZAR. The cumulative FOREX movement recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss 
upon loss of control over MTN Dubai. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss during the current 
or prior period.    

18. Related party transactions
Transactions between members of the group
Scancom Limited (MTN Ghana) entered into operating lease agreements with Ghana Tower InterCo. B.V. in prior years. The operating 
lease commitments amount to R11 042 million at 30 June 2018 (December 2017: R8 446 million). The expense recorded amounted to 
R350 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (June 2017: R348 million, December 2017: R627 million). The rental amounts 
escalate every year by inflation and the initial term is 10 years, followed by four times five-year renewal periods.

MTN Uganda Limited entered into operating lease agreements with Uganda Tower InterCo. B.V. in prior years. The operating lease 
commitments amount to R1 581 million at 30 June 2018 (December 2017: R1 636 million). The expense recorded amounted to 
R207 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (June 2017: R232 million, December 2017: R558 million). The rental 
amounts escalate every year by inflation and the initial term is 10 years, followed by four times five-year renewal
periods.

Transaction with an entity associated with a director
On 29 June 2018, the group and Mainstreet 1561 Proprietary Limited, a wholly owned company of PF Nhleko, non-executive chairman 
of MTN Group, agreed not to proceed with the sale of 14 750 000 MTN Zakhele Futhi shares. This is regarded as a cancellation 
of a share-based payment transaction. The related receivable from Mainstreet 1561 Proprietary Limited was derecognised with 
a corresponding debit in equity. There was no profit or loss impact arising from the cancellation.

19. Disposal group held for sale
In July 2018, the group entered into an agreement with Monaco Telecom S.A. (Monaco Telecom), in terms of which Monaco Telecom 
will acquire 100% of the group's subsidiary, MTN Cyprus Limited (MTN Cyprus). This subsidiary forms part of the MENA segment. 
Monaco Telecom will acquire MTN Cyprus for a net selling price of approximately EUR260 million (R4 174 million), adjusted for 
changes in MTN Cyprus's working capital between signature date and closing date. The group expects the sale to close within 
the third quarter of 2018. The estimated profit, based on net assets and exchange rates at 30 June 2018, after taking into 
account estimated warranties and indemnities, directly attributable transaction costs and FCTR that will be reclassified to 
profit or loss is approximately R2,1 billion.    

As at 30 June 2018, the following assets and liabilities were included in the disposal group:
                                                                       30 June 2018

20. Benin frequency fees
MTN Benin and the government of Benin concluded a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in April 2018, which includes the 
settlement of historic frequency fees, a five-year licence extension and the addition of optical fibre (FTTx) to the 
existing licence conditions settled by the payment of CFA35 billion (R802 million1) in May 2018 and a second payment of 
CFA35 billion (R857 million2) in December 2018. MTN Benin and the government of Benin reached an agreement regarding 
ongoing frequency fees, which was subsequently confirmed by the issue of a decree specifying the frequency fees calculation.     

The decree has confirmed the calculation methodology for allocating a portion of the CFA70 billion (R1,7 billion3) payment 
to past frequency fees (CFA14,8 billion, R351 million3). The balance of the payment relating to the extended licence and 
the right to deploy optical fibre (FTTx) was recognised as an intangible asset (CFA55,2 billion, R1,3 billion3).

21. Events after reporting period
Dividends declared
Dividends declared at the board meeting held on 7 August 2018 amounted to 175 cents per share.

Iran Sanctions
On 8 May 2018, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement and to re-impose 
economic sanctions against Iran. The first round of these sanctions became effective on 7 August 2018 and a second phase of sanctions is 
expected to be effective on 5 November 2018. The sanctions may limit the ability of the group to repatriate cash from MTN Irancell, 
including future dividends. As at 30 June 2018, Iranian rial-denominated dividends receivable and loans amounted to R3.4 billion. 
The official exchange rate to the US dollar was 42 490 rials at 30 June 2018 and has remained largely unchanged since April 2018. 
Sanctions may place pressure on the official exchange rate that is used to translate dividend and loan receivables as well as 
the equity-accounted results of MTN Irancell.

22. Changes in accounting policies
The group has adopted the following new accounting pronouncements as issued by the IASB, which were effective for the group 
from 1 January 2018:
- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15).
- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9).

The group also implemented a voluntary accounting policy change relating to a change in the presentation of cash flows.

The changes in accounting policies were applied retrospectively. Comparative numbers have been restated for the adoption of 
IFRS 15 and the change in the presentation of cash flows.

Adoption of IFRS 15
The group principally generates revenue from providing mobile telecommunications services, such as network services 
(comprising data, voice and SMS), digital services, interconnect and roaming services, as well as from the sale of mobile 
devices. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical length of a contract for postpaid 
bundled packages is 24 months.

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced 
IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount 
that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for transferring goods or services to a customer.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. The group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a product or services to a customer.

For bundled packages, the group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, i.e. if a 
product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from 
it. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their standalone selling 
prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the group sells mobile devices 
and network services separately.     

On adoption of IFRS 15, the group restated its retained earnings as at 1 January 2017 as follows:
                                                                               2017

                     provide services to these 
                     debtors (due to regulatory 
                     requirements) where the 
                     recovery of principal is 
                     significantly delayed beyond 
                     the contractual terms. The 
                     group has considered this 
                     historical payment pattern 
                     in assessing whether the 
                     contract contains a 
                     significant financing 
                     component.

22.1.4 Capitalisation of subscriber acquisition costs
IFRS 15 introduced specific guidance on accounting for incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers. 
Under IAS 18, the group expensed subscriber acquisition costs at inception of the contract.

The group expects that incremental subscriber acquisition costs for obtaining and renewing contracts are 
recoverable. These costs include agent's commission on postpaid contracts and SIM activation costs on prepaid 
contracts. The group has therefore capitalised these costs as contract costs. Capitalised contract costs are 
amortised on a systematic basis over the average customer life and included in selling, distribution and 
marketing expenses in profit or loss.

In terms of a practical expedient, the group has elected to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining 
contracts as a selling, distribution and marketing expense in profit or loss, when incurred, if the 
amortisation period of the assets that the group otherwise would have recognised is 12 months or less.

The impact of this change is a decrease in selling, distribution and marketing expenses and the recognition 
of a new asset: capitalised contract costs.

22.1.5 Transition to IFRS 15
In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the group has adopted the new rules retrospectively 
and has restated comparative numbers for the 2017 financial year. The group applied the following practical 
expedients when applying IFRS 15 retrospectively:
- The group did not restate comparative numbers for contracts that were completed contracts at 1 January 2017.
- The group did not restate comparative numbers for contracts that began and ended in the same annual reporting period.
- For modified contracts, the group used the contractual terms that existed at 1 January 2017.

22.2 Adoption of IFRS 9
The adoption of IFRS 9 had the following impact on the group:
- Change from the IAS 39 incurred loss model to the expected credit loss (ECL) model to calculate impairments of 
  financial instruments.
- Change in classification of the measurement categories for financial instruments.

More detail on the impact from the adoption of IFRS 9 is provided on the following pages.

22.2.1 Impairment
Before the adoption of IFRS 9, the group calculated the allowance for credit losses using the incurred loss model. 
Under the incurred loss model, the group assessed whether there was any objective evidence of impairment at the 
end of each reporting period. If such evidence existed the allowance for credit losses in respect of financial 
assets at amortised cost was calculated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its recoverable 
amount, being its present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest 
rate (EIR).

Under IFRS 9 the group calculates allowance for credit losses as ECLs for financial assets measured at amortised 
cost, debt investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and contract assets. ECLs are a 
probability weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash 
shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and 
the cash flows that the group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the original EIR of the financial 
asset.

The group applies the simplified approach to determine the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets. 
This results in calculating lifetime expected credit losses for these trade receivables. ECL for trade 
receivables is calculated using a provision matrix. For contract assets and mobile trade receivables, ECLs 
are determined using a simplified parameter-based approach.

Provision matrix - ECLs are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of trade receivables 
at each reporting date. The loss ratio is calculated according to the ageing/payment profile of sales 
by applying historic/proxy write-offs to the payment profile of the sales population. In instances where 
there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy write-off. Trade receivable 
balances have been grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of receivables with 
similar risk characteristics and ability to pay. Similarly, the sales population selected to determine 
the ageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population and in line with 
future payment expectations. The historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward looking information 
to determine the ECL for the portfolio of trade receivables at the reporting period to the extent that 
there is a strong correlation between the forward looking information and the ECL.      

Simplified parameter-based approach - ECL is calculated using a formula incorporating the following 
parameters: exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and the 
effective interest rate (EIR) (i.e. PD x LGD x EAD = ECL). Exposures are mainly segmented by customer 
type, i.e. corporate, consumer, etc., ageing, device versus SIM only contracts and months in contract. 
This is done to allow for risk differentiation. The probability of a customer defaulting as well as the 
realised loss with defaulted accounts have been determined using historical data (12 months and 36 months 
respectively). The EIR represents a weighted average rate incorporating a risk-free rate plus a risk premium.

22.2.2 Classification, initial recognition and subsequent measurement
IFRS 9 introduces new measurement categories for financial assets. The measurement categories of IFRS 9 and 
IAS 39 are illustrated in the table below. From 1 January 2018 the group classifies financial assets in each 
of the IFRS 9 measurement categories based on the group's business model for managing the financial asset and 
the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

IAS 39 category                                                      IFRS 9 category

                                                                     comprehensive income (FVOCI)*    
Held to maturity
* This includes both debt and equity instruments. The biggest change is that on derecognition of equity instruments 
  gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss.

The reclassification into the new measurement categories of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the group. 
The group has designated the investment in IHS and other unlisted equity investments as at FVOCI, as these instruments 
are not held for trading. Additionally, some of the group's treasury bills are held with a business model to 
collect and sell and consequently have been classified as FVOCI debt instruments.

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost except for those designated as at FVTPL, which are measured 
at fair value.

22.2.3 Transition to IFRS 9
Changes in accounting policies from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively; however, the group 
has elected not to restate comparative information. Differences between the carrying amounts as at 31 December 2017 
and 1 January 2018 resulting from the initial application of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings. Accordingly, 
information relating to 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2017 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 but rather 
those of IAS 39.      

The group has elected an accounting policy choice not to adopt the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, but 
to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
       
22.3 Presentation of cash flows
During 2018, the group reviewed the classification of cash flows and aligned the external presentation of cash flows 
with the internal presentation applied to manage the business and used for performance management. The group voluntarily 
changed its accounting policy and reclassified:
- Dividends paid to equity holders of the company and non-controlling interests from cash flows from operating activities 
  to cash flows from financing activities.
- Interest paid in the group's head office treasury function from cash flows from financing activities to cash flows 
  from operating activities.

Comparative numbers have been restated accordingly.

MTN sells 100% of MTN Cyprus to Monaco Telecom for approximately
R4,1bn

MTN Dubai Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Group, has entered
into an agreement in which it has sold 100% of MTN Cyprus to Monaco
Telecom S.A. (“Monaco Telecom”) (the “Transaction”) as part of an
ongoing review of its portfolio. The net sale proceeds of €260 million
(approximately R4,1 billion) will be paid upfront in cash. The
Transaction values MTN Cyprus at approximately 8x reported 2017
EBITDA.

In addition, MTN has agreed to allow Monaco Telecom to use the MTN
brand in Cyprus for up to three years in return for a commercial fee.
MTN Cyprus is MTN’s only operating business in the European Union,
and was acquired as part of MTN Group’s acquisition of telecoms holding
company Investcom LLC in 2006. It falls outside the group’s core
footprint of Africa and the Middle East. The Transaction, which is
subject to various closing adjustments, allows MTN to realise an
attractive valuation for the asset.

MTN expects the Transaction, which is not subject to any completion
conditions, to close within the third quarter of 2018.

The accounting effects of the Transaction will be communicated with
the 2018 interim results that will be released on 8 August 2018.

The Transaction does not classify as a categorised transaction as
per the JSE Listings Requirements.

Exchange rates as at 11/7/2018 translated at R15.79: €1. Transaction amounts agreed

MTN GHANA HAS COMMENCED OFFER FOR SHARES IN GHANA

On 29th of May 2018 MTN Group’s subsidiary, Scancom PLC (MTN Ghana) launched an Initial Public
Offer (IPO) in Ghana with the intention of listing on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE). The offer is
expected to be open for nine weeks and close on 31 July 2018.

As previously communicated to the market, a successful listing would meet the required localisation
condition under which MTN Ghana secured its 4G licence in late 2015. A key objective of the listing is
to target a broad base of Ghanaian investors to share in the risks and rewards of ownership of MTN
Ghana.

In 2015, MTN Ghana won a bid for a 4G/LTE licence in the 800 MHz spectrum. The National
Communications Authority (NCA) required MTN Ghana to offer Ghanaian investors an opportunity to
own up to 35% of its shares. Listing on the GSE was also confirmed by the NCA as an option to meet
the localisation requirement.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the GSE have approved the IPO and the listing
respectively.

Under the IPO, MTN Ghana is offering up to 4,637,394,533 MTN Ghana shares, consisting of a
combination of newly issued shares and a sale of existing shares held by MTN Group Limited through
its wholly-owned subsidiary Investcom Consortium Holding SA. The public offer represents up to 35%
of the issued shares of MTN Ghana, which implies an enterprise valuation of approximately
GHS 10 billion for MTN Ghana. As per Ghana market standards, the offer is a fixed price offer where a
volume of shares is made available at a fixed price. The minimum amount to be raised for the offer to
be deemed successful and for the listing to proceed is approximately GHS 0,35 billion, which
represents approximately 10% of the total offer size. Given the objective of targeting a broad base of
Ghanaian investors, allocation to non-Ghanaian investors is to be restricted to 5% of the issued shares
of MTN Ghana.

As per the requirements of the Ghana SEC, the Prospectus to be issued by MTN Ghana in respect of
the IPO includes forward-looking statements (Appendix A) that reflect MTN Ghana's intentions, beliefs
or current expectations and projections about its future results, operations, financial condition,
liquidity, performance, prospects, anticipated growth, strategies, plans, opportunities, trends and the
market in which it operates.

These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions and are subject to known and
unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause MTN Ghana's actual
results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements and speak only as
of the date of the Prospectus. As such no assurances can be given in respect of these forward-looking
statements which speak only as of the date of the Prospectus and which may be impacted by various
risks and uncertainties. No undertaking or obligation is assumed to update these forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements are as at the date of the initial submission of the
Prospectus in February 2018.
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has been notified of the transaction. The Prospectus provides
that the allotment of shares will be conducted at the discretion of the MTN Ghana Board, and the
MTN Ghana Board will apply its discretion to (among other things) ensure compliance with the JSE
Listings Requirements, including with respect to related party transactions as contemplated in Section
10 of the JSE Listings Requirements.

This SENS announcement is not an offer of shares as contemplated in the Prospectus but a notice to
the market that there is information about MTN Ghana contained in the Prospectus which MTN Group
may not have publicly disclosed previously.

The Prospectus is included on the following website for information purposes only, is not intended to
market the IPO in any way and the contents of the website do not form part of the Prospectus:

23rd ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING BUSINESS UPDATE

At the annual general meeting to be held later today, MTN Group President and CEO Rob Shuter will
make the following comments regarding the group’s performance for the first four months of 2018:

“We continue to make encouraging progress with the execution of our BRIGHT strategy across MTN
Group’s 22 operations. Following the solid start to the year as reported in our quarterly update on 3
May 2018, the business maintained its positive operational momentum in April 2018.

We are also pleased with the progress made in resolving a number of complex regulatory matters. In
Benin on 3 May 2018 we concluded a memorandum of understanding with the government of Benin,
resolving the frequency fees dispute. In Cameroon we concluded a revision of our licence agreement
on 7 May 2018. The initial public offering (IPO) processes in Ghana and Nigeria are progressing well
and we plan to launch the Ghana IPO in May 2018 and conclude the Nigeria IPO within the 2018
calendar year.

On 8 May 2018, the US announced its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement and to re-impose economic sanctions against Iran. We will continue
to monitor the situation. This includes the response of the Iranian authorities and the other JCPOA
members, who have to date indicated that they will continue to be party to, and comply with, the
agreement.

Considering the strong operational performance and notwithstanding the potential impact from
changing US sanctions on Iran, we remain committed to delivering our medium-term guidance of
upper-single-digit constant currency service revenue growth for the group as well as expansion in the
group’s EBITDA margin. We also remain committed to the group’s stated dividend policy. As stated in
the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017, at the discretion of the board of directors
of MTN Group and taking into consideration market conditions, the board anticipates declaring a total
dividend of 500 cents per share for 2018, growing at 10% to 20% over the medium term.”

The financial information on which this business update is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by MTN Group’s external auditors.

On 8 May 2018 the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA) agreement and to re-impose economic sanctions against Iran. These sanctions may
limit the ability of MTN Group to repatriate cash, both dividends and loans, from MTN Irancell. We
will continue to monitor the situation including the response of the Iranian authorities and the other
JCPOA members.

During 2018 MTN Group has repatriated approximately €88 million from MTN Irancell including €61
million relating to the full 2017 dividend due to MTN as well as a further €27 million of historic
dividends. The remaining balance due to MTN is approximately IRR10,000bn (approximately €200
million).

MTN Group remains committed to our investment in Irancell and to repatriating the balance of legacy
cash in Iran whilst remaining compliant with appropriate legislation.

MTN Nigeria CEO Ferdi Moolman comments:

the second half of 2017 following a period of increased investment and renewed focus on operational execution.
             
We continue to evolve our data pricing aligned to the Group's dual-data strategy. With the strong progress made on
both network quality, availability and coverage, we believe the business is well positioned to benefit from the 
material data opportunity the Nigerian market presents. 

We are making good progress towards concluding the IPO process in Nigeria and we remain committed to executing on

MTN NIGERIA
In the first quarter of 2018, MTN Nigeria continued with the positive momentum of 2017, increasing naira service
revenue by 14,5% year-on-year, led by a 73,2% increase in data revenue and 15,2% growth in voice revenue. The 
improving macroeconomic environment and consumer sentiment across the country supported the positive revenue 
trends evidenced in recent months.

While the increase in voice revenue was encouraging, it was partially supported by the lower customer spend on 
digital services. As the growth in digital services is expected to resume in the latter part of the year, this may 
impact growth rates in voice revenue. In the first quarter, our revenue from these services was dampened, amongst 
others, by the double opt-in feature, which limited the uptake of new services. As customers get used to this 
requirement, we expect quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue for the digital services to resume in the second 
half of the year.

In the first quarter, a 62,2% increase in billed data volumes drove the strong growth in data revenue supported by
data price optimisation. 

MTN Nigeria reported net additions in the quarter of 2,3 million following on from the 2,0 million adds in 4Q17 
as the business benefited from the increase in our SIM registration footprint and extended customer value management 
(CVM) campaign's supporting a marked increase in gross connections. 

Focused on retaining network leadership, we rolled out 298 3G and 174 4G sites in the quarter. The 4G rollout remains
centred on the top 10 cities across the country. MTN Nigeria was ranked number 1 on network NPS in the period. 

MTN Nigeria's stronger-than-expected growth in revenue allowed the business to benefit from increased scale. 
With expenses well controlled, and the naira stable, the EBITDA margin continued to expand in the quarter, to 
41,8%. The margin benefited from further optimisation of our distribution channels and reduced bad debt provisions 
as we saw an improvement in interconnect payments.

We secured approval from the Nigerian Communications Commission to use the 700MHz spectrum for the deployment of
telecoms services and continued to engage with the regulatory authorities on our rollout obligations as well as on
interference on the spectrum band. In our work to ensure we remain compliant with all appropriate regulations, 
we continue to proactively engage with the regulatory authorities.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based has not been reviewed and reported on by 
MTN's external auditors.

Quarterly update for the period ended 31 March 2018

MTN is a leading emerging market mobile operator, serving 221,3 million people in 22 countries across Africa and

QoQ growth rates refer to 1Q18 vs 4Q17. Data revenue refers to access data revenue only. Digital revenue refers to 
Mobile Money (MoMo), rich media services and value-added services (VAS) revenue.

numbers have been restated where appropriate.

MTN Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
""During the quarter, the group continued to focus on operational execution across our markets, leveraging off the
strong network investment of the past few years. This allowed us to deliver an acceleration in service revenue 
growth to 9,1% (constant currency), led by MTN Nigeria and MTN Ghana.
            
Group voice revenue growth of 5,4% benefited from strong growth in Nigeria and Ghana of 15,2% and 20,6% respectively.
Group data revenue grew by 26,9% as we executed on our dual-data strategy, ensuring appropriate data coverage across
our footprint. Digital service revenue is a material opportunity for the group, led by MTN Mobile Money and rich-media
services. MoMo revenue increased by 52,4% YoY. 

The group-wide network investment enhanced data quality in metro areas. In both South Africa and Nigeria, 
MTN maintained network leadership.

In Nigeria and Ghana we made good progress on the IPO processes, which we aim to conclude during 2018. To this end,
we will be releasing full financial results for MTN Nigeria on 7 May 2018. On 20 April 2018, we received all required
regulatory approvals to proceed with the IPO in Ghana, which we expect to launch in late May 2018.

MTN Cameroon is well advanced in agreeing the terms of its licence amendments and expects to sign the revised licence
during May 2018. 

MTN Benin and the government of Benin have concluded a memorandum of understanding which includes the settlement of
historic frequency fees, a five-year licence extension and the addition of FTTx to the existing licence conditions settled 
by the payment of XAF35 billion (US$63 million) in May 2018 and a second payment of XAF35 billion in December 2018. 
Negotiations around future frequency fees are continuing and expected to be concluded by the end of June 2018.

In South Africa, we are engaging with the authorities on the proposed amendments to the Electronic Communications Act
to find a solution that would best deliver the most cost-effective coverage for South Africans as well as much needed
resources for the national fiscus.

Following the recent denial order issued by the US Department of Commerce, we are assessing both the impact and
contingency planning given our exposure to ZTE in our networks."" 

MTN's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria and three
regions: Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture equity-accounted),
Swaziland (joint venture equity-accounted) and Business Group. 

The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau. 

The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture equity-accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 
 
MTN SOUTH AFRICA
MTN South Africa recorded first quarter YoY service revenue growth of 2,5%. While lower than our full-year
expectations, this improving QoQ performance follows the more muted performance in the prior quarter (4Q17). The growth 
was supported by data and digital revenue, which increased by 12,1% and 17,7% respectively, while outgoing voice revenue 
decreased by 9,2%. Data traffic increased by 49%, supported by a 14% increase in active data users.

MTN South Africa's EBITDA margin expanded to 35% YoY, supported by continued cost efficiencies and the increase in
service revenue. Our customer value management (CVM) platform is now in place with a focus on managing the core voice
business while driving overall customer spend and offerings.

Following the marked improvement in our network in 2017, we invested R1,7 billion in capex in the first quarter of
2018, maintaining our leading network position.

The South African postpaid business continued to focus on customer acquisition, CVM, improving channel footprint and
reducing churn. To this end, we reported 132 000 postpaid net additions on the back of a continued improvement in the
consumer segment. While our enterprise business remains challenged, we now have the leadership team in place, and are
executing on a turnaround plan focused on improving customer retention and acquisition. Prepaid net additions in the 
quarter came in at 536 000.

On 30 April 2018 the regulator published the End User and Subscriber Service Charter Amendment Regulations which
included amended rules around the roll over of unused data. We are currently reviewing these regulations to assess their
impact.

MTN NIGERIA
MTN Nigeria continued with the positive momentum of 2017, increasing service revenue by 14,4% YoY, led by a 73,2%
increase in data revenue and 15,2% growth in voice revenue. While the increase in voice revenue was encouraging, it 
was supported by the lower customer spend on VAS. As growth in our digital services is expected to resume in the latter 
part of the year, this may impact growth rates in voice revenue. 

MTN Nigeria reported net additions in the quarter of 2,3 million following on from the 2,0 million adds in 4Q17 as 
the business benefited from the increase in our SIM registration footprint. Focused on retaining network leadership, 
we rolled out 298 3G and 174 4G sites in the quarter. The 4G rollout remains centred on the top 10 cities across 
the country.

MTN Nigeria's stronger-than-expected growth in revenue allowed the business to benefit from increased scale. With
expenses well controlled, and the naira stable, the EBITDA margin expanded in the quarter to 41,8%. 

SEAGHA REGION
MTN Ghana
MTN Ghana benefited from the improving macroeconomic environment and stable competitive environment. The operation
reported strong service revenue growth of 29,3% YoY, led by a 51,5% increase in data revenue. MoMo was a stand-out
performer, accounting for 15% of MTN Ghana's total revenue. The EBITDA margin increased further in the period to 42,0%. 
The recently agreed technical services arrangement will reduce the margin by 5% from May 2018.

MTN Ghana reported good growth in subscribers in the quarter, with net additions of 484 000 to reach a total of 
16,2 million subscribers. Active MoMo subscribers increased to 7,4 million and there were 6,6 million active data 
subscribers.

MTN Uganda
Following a slower prior quarter (4Q17), MTN Uganda experienced a positive first quarter with service revenue growth
of 8,0%. MoMo revenue increased by 21,8% to contribute 25% of total revenue. Voice revenue growth in the period was more
muted, with growth of 3,4% despite a 33,6% increase in billable minutes. Tariffs declined by 32,6% YoY. MTN Uganda
reported net additions for the quarter of 149 000.

Other SEAGHA
Across the balance of the SEAGHA region the subscriber base increased by 3,6% QoQ, with Rwanda, Zambia, Swaziland and
South Sudan all contributing positively to subscriber growth.
            
WECA REGION
MTN Ivory Coast
After a challenging second half period in 2017, MTN Ivory Coast service revenue remained under pressure, declining 
by 2,6% YoY. This was largely on the back of a 11,4% decline in voice revenue. Data and digital revenue increased by 
13,0% and 34,2% respectively. 

Total subscribers increased in the period with net additions of 49 000. The business recorded continued growth in MoMo
subscribers to 2,3 million and an increase in active data users to 2,7 million. 

Regulatory rules disallowing differential pricing for on-net and off-net tariffs and the significant reduction in
leased line prices at the end of 1Q17 are now behind us and we should see improving trends for the balance of the year.

MTN Cameroon
As noted at our full-year results, MTN Cameroon remains a challenged market which recorded a worsening operating
performance throughout 2017. Service revenue in the current period declined by 6,8% YoY with the associated pressure on 
YoY margins. Notwithstanding the weaker start to the year, we remain confident of the business returning to positive growth
in the second half of the year.

Voice revenue declined by 16,6% YoY while data and digital revenue grew by an encouraging 15,7% and 106,0%
respectively. MoMo revenue increased by 700% to account for 4,1% of service revenue.

Other WECA
Across the balance of the WECA region the subscriber base declined by 2,3% QoQ, driven by a decline in subscribers in
Congo-Brazzaville. Guinea-Conakry, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau all contributed positively in the period.

MENA REGION
MTN Irancell
MTN Irancell reported service revenue growth of 15,2%, supported by data and digital growth of 50,7% and 21,3%
respectively. The data growth was affected by the restriction of select internet services during January as well as 
increased competitive activities in the period. Voice revenue remain under pressure and declined by 12,9% YoY. 

At the beginning of April 2018 the Iranian government announced that there would be a single currency rate going
forward, effectively merging the official central bank rate and the open market rate at 42 000 rials to the US dollar. 
This was an effective 11,4% decline in the central bank rate. MTN Irancell repatriated approximately €30 million in the
quarter.

Other MENA
Across the balance of the MENA region the subscriber base declined by 1,3% QoQ, led by a decline in subscribers in
Yemen and Afghanistan. Sudan and Cyprus contributed positively to the region's subscriber base.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has not
been reviewed and reported on by MTN's external auditors. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate
the impact of changes in currency rates on the group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, 
the current financial reporting period's results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined
as the average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies,
materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated 
based on the current year constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN
Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the 
impact of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation accounting was discontinued for MTN Irancell and MTN Sudan on 1 July 2015 and 
1 July 2016 respectively. The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016, and
hyperinflation accounting was applied from December 2016 onwards.

Certain financial information presented in these consolidated annual financial results constitutes pro forma 
financial information. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's board of 
directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial 
information may not fairly present MTN's financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or 
cash flows. The forward looking financial information incorporated in these consolidated financial results; 
has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors. An assurance report 
has however been prepared and issued by our joint auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc. 
in respect of the pro forma financial information included in this announcement that is available for inspection 
at the registered office of the company.

1. The financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared excluding the impact
   of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill and asset impairments, tower profits (including the profit realised on 
   the exercise of the IHS exchange right whereby the group's interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for 
   additional shareholding in IHS Holding Limited), the loss on derecognition of the long-term loan receivable from IHS, 
   the Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered into and the 
   finance costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting of the liability) and IFRS 2 
   share-based payment expense related to Zakhele Futhi (""the pro forma adjustments"") and constitutes pro forma 
   financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the audited 
   consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. This pro forma financial information 
   has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments from the consolidated financial results 
   in order to achieve a comparable analysis year on year. The pro forma adjustments have been calculated in terms 
   of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
   31 December 2017. 

2. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the 
   group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting period's 
   results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly 
   exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of 
   the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the 
   current year constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of 
   MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared 
   excluding the impact of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation accounting was discontinued for MTN Irancell and 
   MTN Sudan on 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016 respectively. The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be 
   hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation accounting was applied from December 
   2016 onwards.

The group's results are presented in line with the group's operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria,
Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted),
Swaziland (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, 
Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint 
venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 

Although Iran, Botswana and Swaziland form part of their respective regions geographically and operationally, 
they are excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity accounted for by the group.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments: 
""MTN delivered a solid overall performance for the year, with progress on many fronts, despite difficult economic
conditions as well as operational and regulatory challenges in certain markets. MTN Nigeria showed strong constant 
currency revenue growth and MTN South Africa's postpaid business displayed encouraging improvements. The group's 
top-line growth was driven by robust growth in data revenue (on a constant currency basis), supported by the 
combination of improving customer service and more stable and competitive networks. MTN Mobile Money and rich-media 
services supported growth in digital revenue, however, this slowed in the second half as we optimised our value-added 
services (VAS) subscription business. Encouragingly, on a constant currency basis, outgoing voice revenue was flat 
relative to the prior year. Over the year, we further strengthened our management structures and specialist skill 
capabilities to drive operational execution and to support our risk management processes."" 

""We are confident that the foundation is in place for MTN to deliver strong growth over the medium term. Through the
continued execution of our BRIGHT strategy we anticipate improved top-line and EBITDA growth supporting an acceleration
in cash flows and improving returns over the medium term.""

Overview 
MTN reported improved results for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017, delivering on guidance communicated in March
2017 and returning to profitability in headline earnings. Macro-economic conditions were challenging across a number 
of our markets. Nigeria experienced a markedly weaker naira as well as hard currency liquidity challenges earlier in the
year, but this showed signs of improvement as the year progressed. Although South Africa entered a technical recession 
in the first quarter of 2017, growth resumed in the second quarter and the rand strengthened considerably against the 
US dollar during the latter part of the year. Many of the currencies in our other markets weakened. In Iran, economic 
growth slowed somewhat and the rial weakened. Despite these macro challenges, the group continued to deliver on its 
operational targets.

Following a thorough review of group strategy in the first half of the year, MTN operationalised its BRIGHT
strategy. This is arranged under six pillars comprising: Best customer experience; Returns and efficiency focus; 
Ignite commercial performance; Growth through data and digital; Hearts and minds; and Technology excellence. 

Group service revenue in constant currency grew by 7,2%*, underpinned by 11,2%* growth 
in service revenue in Nigeria and a 3,9%† (on an organic basis) growth in service revenue in South Africa. 
MTN Uganda, MTN Ghana and MTN Ivory Coast also contributed positively to the group's top-line growth on a 
constant currency basis. 

MTN Cameroon experienced a particularly challenging year, negatively impacted by the data network shutdown in 
some parts of the country in the first quarter, as well as regulatory and operational challenges. 

The improvement in group revenue was mostly attributable to strong growth in data and digital revenue, supported by
stable outgoing voice revenue. Data revenue increased by 34,2%*, supported by the improved quality
and capacity of our data networks in key markets. Digital revenue increased by 14,2%*, driven mainly by mobile financial
services (MFS). The group added 5,7 million active MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) customers during the year. Outgoing voice
revenue was stable, increasing 0,1%* in the year. 

The group's margin on reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, impairment of goodwill,
the loss on derecognition of the long-term loan receivable, net monetary gains and share of results of joint ventures 
and associates after tax (EBITDA) was 35,4%**. This was positively impacted by the once-off profit (R6 017 million**)
realised on exercising the right to exchange the group's interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. (INT) for a higher
shareholding in IHS Holding Limited (IHS). This was partly offset by fixed and intangible asset impairments (excluding 
goodwill) for MTN Sudan (R1 690 million**) and MTN Syria (R1 348 million**) relating to the carrying value previously 
written up for the impact of hyperinflation. 

On a constant currency basis, the group's EBITDA margin declined by 1,4 percentage points (pp) to 34,0%*. MTN Nigeria's 
EBITDA margin (excluding the impact of the regulatory fine) declined by 7,5 pp* to 38,9%*. This was largely a result
of higher foreign-currency-denominated expenses in Nigeria because of the depreciation of the naira against the US
dollar. The EBITDA margin in South Africa improved by 2,0 pp* to 34,6%*. It was supported by lower handset subsidies 
and volumes, as well as the benefit of a stronger rand on the cost of handsets in the period. MTN Irancell's EBITDA 
margin declined by 3,4 pp* to 35,6%* because of higher transmission costs. MTN Uganda's margin increased by 4,9 pp* 
to 34,5%* and MTN Ivory Coast's margin remained flat, while the margin for MTN Cameroon declined mainly as a result 
of lower revenue growth.

Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) were 182 cents** compared to a 77 cents** headline loss per share in 2016
when performance had been impacted by the Nigerian regulatory fine of 500 cents** (455 cents** of the Nigerian fine
fully expensed and 45 cents** of interest). In 2017, the Nigerian regulatory fine interest reduced HEPS by 46 cents**. 

HEPS were impacted by a number of once-off and non-cash post-tax items totalling 483 cents in the financial year ended
31 December 2017. The adjustments include costs related to the Nigerian regulatory fine of 46 cents, hyperinflation
adjustments excluding impairments of 96 cents, net foreign exchange losses of 159 cents, MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based
payment expense of 24 cents and a loss on the derecognition of a loan to an IHS tower subsidiary of 158 cents, 
respectively.

At 31 December 2017, the group had 217 million# subscribers, based on the new modernised definitions. We will 
provide comparisons for full year 2018 using the new base. In 2017, subscriber numbers in Cameroon in particular 
were further affected by the disconnection of approximately three million subscribers to ensure adherence with 
regulatory requirements on subscriber registration. We also saw regulatory related disconnections in Uganda 
where we disconnected 750 000 subscribers. 

The group continued to invest in the rolling out of network and information technology across its markets. We spent
R31 461 million** in capital expenditure (capex), rolling out a total of 8 583 3G and 8 611 4G co-located sites. 
This investment has resulted in a marked improvement in network quality and capacity across a number of our markets. 

Regulatory and legal considerations
The Turkcell lawsuit currently before the South Gauteng High Court in South Africa is not a new action and was
initiated by Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S (""Turkcell"") and East Asian Consortium (""EAC"") in 2013. It relates 
to Turkcell's alleged grievances arising from its unsuccessful bid to obtain a mobile licence in Iran, and the 
awarding of that licence to MTN Irancell in 2005. MTN continues to believe that there is no legal merit to 
Turkcell's claim and will oppose it accordingly.

With reference to our Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) announcement on 24 October 2017 related 
to the sanction from the Telecommunications Regulatory Board in Cameroon, MTN Cameroon continues to engage with the
relevant authorities to find an amicable solution to the matter.

With reference to our SENS announcement on 9 November 2017 related to the dispute with regulatory authorities in 
Benin on frequency fees, MTN Benin continues to engage with the relevant authorities in Benin to find an amicable 
solution to the matter. 

Prospects and guidance 
MTN Group well positioned to capture growth
Africa and the Middle East are forecast to remain among the world's key growth regions over the medium to long term.
We are confident that MTN is well placed to benefit from this opportunity. We will continue to leverage our scale and
enhance our competitive position, benefiting from favourable demographic growth, low data penetration in our markets 
and the unique opportunity we have to provide our customers with a range of digital services.

In the second half of 2017, we established clearly defined initiatives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each
of the six areas of BRIGHT. We expect these initiatives to support improved top-line growth, EBITDA margins and cash
flow over the medium term. 

Over the next few years we expect to deliver upper-single-digit constant currency service revenue growth for the
group, driven by mid-single-digit growth from South Africa and double-digit growth from Nigeria. Over the same 
period we expect to see an expansion in group EBITDA margins.

Our extensive capex investments across our operations in 2017 allowed us to show a credible improvement in our
networks across a number of our markets. This will be important in ensuring the business is able to provide a 
superior customer experience and competitive data networks which will support the growing demand for data and 
digital services. Over the next few years we expect group capex intensity (which measures our efficiency in 
deploying assets) to moderate within a range of 20% to 15%.

Portfolio review
We continue to review the markets in which we operate to ensure an appropriate strategic and operational fit taking
into account demographics, regional synergies and business and regulatory environments. At the same time, we continue 
to evaluate opportunities across the Middle East and Africa. This ongoing review could, over the medium term, result 
in some shifts in the current portfolio. 

Additionally, MTN Group operates in a number of conflict markets. While the performance of operations in these markets
has resulted in a drag on overall group performance, this has been a result largely of the prevailing geopolitical
conditions rather than poor operational execution. We continue to track in particular the cash flow performance of 
these operations, with a focus on ensuring that they remain self-funded. We are closely monitoring those operations 
that are not cash flow positive and will take appropriate action as required.

Capital management
We are confident the foundation is now in place for MTN to deliver strong growth in the medium term. Through 
the continued execution of our strategy, we anticipate improved service revenue and EBITDA growth as well as 
accelerating free cash flows over this period. Going forward, we will manage our holding company gearing at 
levels that are appropriate for a business with our corporate structure and risk profile and will adopt a 
rebased progressive dividend policy. 

At the discretion of the board and taking into consideration market conditions, the board anticipates declaring a
total dividend of 500 cents per share for 2018, growing at 10% to 20% over the medium term. The rebasing 
of the dividend follows the marked changes in currency exchange rates across a number of our markets. 
This will allow us to ensure that the dividend is funded from operational cash flows over the medium term. 

Listings
MTN Nigeria continues to make good progress with the preparations for its listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange
(NSE). Extensive local marketing to target Nigerian investors is planned as part of a retail offer and institutional
bookbuild, which may also involve selected international institutions.

The operation anticipates that the listing will take place during 2018 subject to appropriate market conditions and
requisite regulatory approval. MTN Nigeria has engaged with Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission and the NSE
extensively on the structure and parameters of the listing. The operation has also obtained its shareholders' approval 
in principle to prepare for the listing, including amendments to its corporate structure. It is expected that the 
application to the NSE will commence in due course and management has already initiated its Corporate Governance 
Rating Scoring with the NSE with a view to listing on the NSE's Premium Board. Any reduction in ownership by 
MTN Group in MTN Nigeria is expected to be limited.

MTN Ghana is also moving forward with its localisation and we expect this process to be completed in the first 
half of 2018. Under the terms of its 4G licence, MTN Ghana is required to introduce Ghanaian investors as 
shareholders. As a result, the MTN Group board has approved a public offer through a listing on the Ghana 
Stock Exchange (GSE), subject to final approval by the GSE and the Securities and Exchange Commission in 
Ghana. A key objective of the listing is to target a broad base of Ghanaian investors to share in the risks 
and rewards of ownership of MTN Ghana. 

Dividends
The board has declared a final dividend of 450 cents per share. This is in line with the 2017 guidance 
of a total dividend of 700 cents per share communicated in March 2017.

Reconciliation of pro forma financial information 
(1) Represents the exclusion of the impact of hyperinflation and related goodwill and fixed asset impairments 
    for certain of the group's subsidiaries (MTN Syria, MTN South Sudan and MTN Sudan) being accounted for on a 
    hyperinflationary basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the 
    respective financial statement line items affected. The economies of Iran and Sudan were assessed to no 
    longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016 respectively and hyperinflation accounting 
    was discontinued from these dates onwards. The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary 
    effective 1 January 2016 and hyperinflation accounting was applied from this date onwards. Included in 
    EBITDA is fixed and intangible asset impairments (excluding goodwill) for MTN Sudan (R1 690 million) and 
    MTN Syria (R1 348 million) relating to the carrying value previously written up for the impact of 
    hyperinflation.
    # R192 million of the goodwill impairment on MTN Sudan relates to the carrying value previously written up 
      for the impact of hyperinflation.

(2) Represents the exclusion of the financial impact relating to the sale of tower assets during the financial 
    year on the respective financial line items impacted, which includes:
    - Tower profits, including R6 017 million relating to the profit realised on the exercise of the exchange 
      right where the interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for an increased shareholding in 
      IHS Holding.
    - Release of Ghana deferred gain of R27 million (2016: R31 million).

(3) Represents the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine subsequent to conclusion of the settlement agreement 
    during 2016 on the respective financial line items impacted, which includes:
    - 2016: The remeasurement impact when the settlement agreement was entered into on 10 June 2016, constituting 
      the difference between the balance of the provision recorded on this date (after taking into account the 
      finance cost accrued from the beginning of the financial year up to 9 June 2016) and the present value of 
      the financial liability arising on this date in accordance with IFRS (included in the EBITDA line);
    - 2016 and 2017: The finance cost impact recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the 
      provision (for the period from 1 January to 9 June 2016) and the financial liability (for the period 
      from 10 June 2016 to 31 December 2016 and from 1 January 2017 to reporting date).

(4) Represents the IFRS 2 Share-based payment impact of MTN Zakhele Futhi. MTN made an offer of ordinary shares 
    to qualifying BEE investors during the prior financial year. During 2017, the group issued a portion of the 
    shares previously underwritten resulting in the recognition of a IFRS 2 Share-based payment expense of 
    R434 million (2016 - R1 008 million).

(5) Represents the impact of the loss on the derecognition of the long-term loan receivable from IHS amounting
    to R2 840 million.

Exchange rates
The stronger rand and the significant year-on-year (YoY) depreciation of the naira against the US dollar had a
negative translation impact on rand-reported results for the period. The average naira depreciated by 25,8% 
against the US dollar in the year, and the closing rate was down 13,1% YoY. The average rand strengthened by 
9,6% against the US dollar YoY and the rand closed 10,7% stronger. In light of recent developments in 
South Africa we expect the rand to remain robust throughout 2018.

Revenue
Group total revenue increased by 6,8%*, supported by encouraging revenue growth in 
MTN Nigeria (up 11,4%*), MTN Uganda (up 10,0%*), MTN Ghana (up 23,3%*) and MTN Ivory Coast (up 11,0%*). 
This was mainly a result of strong data and digital revenue growth in these markets. MTN South Africa 
grew total revenue by 3,0%** while MTN Cameroon reported a 6,6%* decline in revenue. 

Outgoing voice revenue remained largely flat. This is a positive re-enforcement of our work to stem the 
decline in the contribution of voice to the business, particularly in Nigeria where outgoing voice 
revenue increased by 7,5%*. 

Data revenue increased by 34,2%*, benefiting from significantly improved data network quality and capacity 
across our key markets and a continued increase in active data users to 69,1 million. Data revenue increased 
in South Africa (up 25,8%†), Nigeria (up 86,6%*), Uganda (up 41,4%*), Ghana (up 50,6%*), Cameroon (up 21,1%*) 
and Ivory Coast (up 87,5%*). 

Digital revenue increased by 14,2%*, underpinned by solid growth in MFS. This was partly offset by slower 
growth in VAS revenue, impacted by the optimisation of the VAS business across our markets, in particular 
Nigeria. Our e-commerce JVs, while being equity accounted as opposed to consolidated within the results, 
remain an important element of our digital strategy. We will work to further enhance synergies between 
our existing platform and our e-commerce businesses. 

Costs
Total costs increased by 9,5%*, negatively impacted by foreign-denominated expenses in Nigeria and costs 
associated with the rollout of network sites in the year. In South Africa, lower handset cost subsidies 
and volumes, as well as a strong rand, led to a lower total cost of handsets.

EBITDA
Group EBITDA increased by some 2,5%*, held back by a 6,6%* decrease in MTN Nigeria's EBITDA as a result 
of higher foreign-denominated expenses following the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar. 
This was, however, offset by a 9,5%* increase in MTN South Africa's EBITDA. MTN Uganda (up 27,8%*), 
MTN Ghana (up 19,4%*) and MTN Ivory Coast (up 9,1%*) contributed positively to group EBITDA while 
MTN Cameroon recorded a 30,1%* decline in EBITDA. Head office costs were lower than those in 2016 
mainly as a result of a number of once-off costs incurred in the prior year. Consequently, the 
group EBITDA margin decreased by 1,4 percentage points* to 34,0%*.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill
The group depreciation charge increased by 6,2%* as a result of higher organic capex 
over the past 24 months. The growth in depreciation was to some extent mitigated by the stronger rand. 
Amortisation costs increased by 9,5%*, mainly because of higher spend on software 
in the previous period. Non-hyperinflation-related goodwill impairments consisted of impairments in 
MTN Sudan (R983 million**), MTN Afghanistan (R841 million**) and MTN Yemen (R807 million**).

Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased by 11,7%**. This was mainly due to a 26,2%** reduction in 
net foreign exchange (forex) losses for the year. The decline in forex losses was 
largely a result of lower foreign-denominated receivables in Mauritius following the repatriation of 
funds from MTN Irancell in 2016. The group's net interest charge increased by 6,9%**,  supported by 
the stronger rand against the US dollar, resulting in lower finance costs paid on US dollar bonds as 
well as the translation of the Nigeria finance charge relating to the weaker naira against the rand. 
South Africa and Dubai reported forex gains in the year.

Net forex losses mainly included:
- Forex losses in head office of R1 822 million because of the Iran dividend repatriation and the short-term 
  loan to MTN Irancell;
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R1 731 million incurred on US dollar-denominated third-party payables; and
- Forex losses of R363 million in Sudan on foreign-denominated third-party funding and payables.

Share of results of joint ventures and associates after tax
We reported a profit of R841 million** from joint ventures and associates, compared to a loss of R127 million** 
in 2016. This was mainly because we exercised a right to exchange 51% of our shares in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. 
for an increased equity stake in IHS. Following this transaction (which was effective February 2017), we no longer 
own and equity account for a share of the results of INT. 

MTN Irancell's earnings declined largely impacted by lower net interest income following the repatriation of R6,5 billion
of MTN Group cash from MTN Irancell. The reported share of associate income was further impacted by the depreciation 
of the rial against the rand. 

The digital business continued to incur losses in line with budget. Jumia benefited from Black Friday promotions 
in November and December 2017. MEIH is becoming the leading e-commerce and marketplace platform in the Middle East. 
Within IIG, Snapp continues to see strong growth and customers are at an all-time high with daily rides peaking at 850 000 
and 1,2 million food orders in Q4 2017. We continue to focus on growing these businesses in line with the long-term 
strategy for our e-commerce ventures.

Taxation 
The reported effective tax rate was 52,5%**, impacted by lower profit before tax (PBT) and the effects of
tax-efficient tower profits, the turnover-based tax system in Sudan, the Sudanese impairments, as well as 
withholding taxes on upstreamed dividends and other fees. The group's reported taxation charge decreased 
by 39,9%** to R5 014 million** for 2017, after reporting higher taxable income in 2016.

Earnings 
We reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 182 cents** compared to a 77 cents** headline loss per share 
a year earlier. 

Cash flow 
Cash inflows from operations decreased to R38 484 million**. This was mainly a result of lower attributable 
profits in Nigeria. The repatriation of cash from MTN Irancell of R6 509 million** supported cash inflows 
for the year. Key cash outflows included cash capex of R26 661 million** and dividends paid of R13 521 million**.

Capital expenditure
Capex increased by 2%* (decreased by 10,8%** to R31 461 million**) for the year, in line with guidance given 
at the interim period. We saw a marked increase in capitalisation during the second half, particularly in both 
South Africa and Nigeria.

Financial position 
Net debt increased to R57 145 million** from R51 902 million** for 2016. The increase was mainly a result of 
lower cash generated from operations offset by cash repatriated from Iran amounting to R6 509 million** and 
an increase in head office net debt.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW OF KEY MARKETS

MTN South Africa
- Subscribers# at 29,5 million
- Revenue increased by 3,0%*
- Service revenue increased by 3,9%*†
- Data revenue increased by 25,8%*†
- Digital revenue increased by 22,3%*
- EBITDA margin increased by 2,0 pp* to 34,6%*
- Capex increased by 4,4%* to R11 470 million**

† On an organic basis, organic revenue adjusts for prior year acquisitions, disposals and alignment of 
  postpaid carry over rules.

MTN South Africa reported improved profitability with EBITDA up 9,5%* YoY, a strong result. However at 3,9%*†, 
the growth in service revenue was lower than management expectations. While the lead indicators for the postpaid 
business are encouraging, it is taking longer for the postpaid revenue improvement to impact the reported numbers. 
Total revenue increased by 3,0%*. Service revenue increased by 3,9%*†, supported by strong growth in data revenue 
and digital revenue, up 25,8%*† and 22,3%* respectively. Prepaid service revenue increased by 7,7%*†, while 
postpaid service revenue declined by 0,6%*†, largely because of the underperformance of the enterprise segment. 
The increased investment in the network resulted in MTN South Africa having the leading data network in the 
country, according to MyBroadband and P3, and co-best according to Ookla.

MTN Nigeria
- Subscribers# at 52,3 million 
- Revenue increased by 11,4%*
- Data revenue increased by 86,6%*
- Digital revenue decreased by 3,5%*
- EBITDA margin declined by 7,5 pp* to 38,9%* (excluding the impact of the regulatory fine)
- Capex increased by 38,2%* to R8 953 million** 

MTN Nigeria maintained positive momentum during the year, with the overall macro-economic environment 
stabilising and the increased oil price and production offering some relief. During the year the operation 
focused on operational performance, network quality, customer experience and churn management. The subscriber 
base at year end was 52,3 million, following both the definition review as well as lower gross connections as 
a result of new regulations that require all subscriber connections to take place in permanent structures. 
During the last quarter of 2017 the Nigerian business recorded net additions of 1 965 518, a strong result. 
Total revenue increased by 11,4%*, driven by strong data revenue growth. Data revenue increased 86,6%*, 
benefiting from customised data offerings and improved network quality driving data usage. Digital revenue 
decreased by 3,5%* because of the optimisation of our VAS business and despite a 27,2% increase in the 
number of active MoMo customers to 2,0 million.

Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
- Subscribers# at 38,7 million
- Revenue increased by 17,3%*
- Data revenue increased by 38,1%*
- Digital revenue increased by 29,7%*

MTN Ghana continued to benefit from a positive macro-economic environment, and closed the year with a subscriber 
base of 15,7 million following the internal review of subscriber definitions. Focused value propositions and 
improving NPS supported the good subscriber growth. Strong growth in revenue, up by 23,3%*, was underpinned 
by data and digital revenue growth. Data revenue increased by 50,6%*, supported by re-pricing that was 
implemented in the second half. The business reported active data subscribers of 6,5 million. Digital 
revenue grew by 37,7%*, with the number of active MoMo subscribers expanding by 25,7% to 7,1 million. 
In the year, MoMo made up 13,6% of revenue. 

MTN Uganda's subscriber base closed the year at 10,7 million, driven by attractive personalised bundled products 
introduced at the end of 2016, improved network quality and effective distribution. Total revenue increased by 
10,0%*, supported by the strong growth in data and digital revenues. Data revenue increased by 41,4%*, underpinned 
by an increase in data traffic and good growth in data bundle adoption. Active data subscribers closed the year 
at 1,5 million. Digital revenue increased by 16,1%*, supported mainly by MFS (+21,9%*). In the year MFS revenue 
contributed 23% of total revenue. The number of active MoMo customers increased by 27,6% to 5,2 million.

West and Central Africa (WECA) 
- Subscribers# at 29,1 million
- Revenue decreased by 2,8%*
- Data revenue increased by 32,1%*
- Digital revenue increased by 32,5%*

MTN Cameroon continued to experience a challenging operating environment, following the data shutdown and a 
slowdown in economic activity which had a material impact on subscriber and revenue growth in the year. 
The business also experienced a number of operational challenges. The subscriber base closed the year at 
7,1 million, after the disconnection of approximately 3,0 million subscribers in early October to ensure 
the business remained aligned with regulatory requirements on subscriber registration. Total revenue 
decreased by 6,6%*, impacted by the lower subscriber base and offset by solid growth in data (+21,1%*) 
and digital revenue (+27,4%*). Active MoMo customers increased 194,2% to 1,1 million, with revenue up 
767%* YoY.

MTN Ivory Coast reported solid full-year results notwithstanding a more challenging second half. The business 
saw benefits from significant network investments, with its closing subscriber base at 10,9 million. Total 
revenue increased by 11,0%*, underpinned by good growth in outgoing voice and data revenue, up by 5,5%* and 
87,5%* respectively. Digital revenue accelerated by 32,8%*, with active MoMo customers increasing by 75,1% 
to 2,2 million.

year-end subscribers of 43,3 million following the review of subscriber definitions. During the year the postpaid 
base increased by 164% while prepaid subscriber numbers benefited from lower churn. MTN Irancell reported YoY 
growth in revenue of 17,8%* with data revenue increasing 66,3%* and now contributing 42% of total revenue. 
Data traffic volumes increased more than 2,5x YoY with the data revenue benefiting from the marked increase 
in network rollout during the year. The business brought 7 352 sites on air versus the 5 398 in the prior year 
and closed the year with the number one network NPS.

Board changes
Alan van Biljon retired on 31 December 2017 after many years of dedicated contribution to MTN, in which he served 
in various roles including chairing the audit committee and as lead independent director. The board thanks him 
and wishes him all the best and a well-deserved rest in his retirement. Alan Harper was appointed as the new 
lead independent director of the board with effect from 25 May 2017. 

Phuthuma Nhleko reverted to his role as non-executive chairman on 12 March 2017 with Rob Shuter assuming the 
group president and CEO position and becoming an executive director on 13 March 2017.

Ralph Mupita was appointed as group CFO and an executive director of the board with effect from 3 April 2017.

Declaration of final ordinary dividend
Notice is hereby given that a gross final dividend of 450 cents per share for the period to 
31 December 2017 has been declared. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration 
is 1 884 296 758 (including 9 983 286 treasury shares held by MTN Holdings and 76 835 378 shares held by 
MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net dividend 
of 360 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend withholding tax of 
90 cents per share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories of shareholders for the 
different dividend tax rates is as follows:
0%            450,00 cents per share
5%            427,50 cents per share
7,5%          416,25 cents per share
10%           405,00 cents per share
12,5%         393,75 cents per share
15%           382,50 cents per share

These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation 
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

Financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017, which comprise the summary consolidated statement of financial
position as at 31 December 2017, the summary consolidated income statement and the summary consolidated statements of

Summary consolidated financial statements
The summary consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International Financial
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to annual financial
statements. Reading the summary consolidated financial statements and the auditors' report thereon, therefore, is

The audited consolidated financial statements and our report thereon
We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on the audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated 
7 March 2018. That report also includes communication of key audit matters. Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. 

Directors' responsibility for the summary consolidated financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the summary consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the JSE's requirements for summary financial statements, set out in note 3 to the summary consolidated financial
statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary financial statements. 

Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the summary consolidated financial statements are consistent,

4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    The group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International 
    Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which were effective for the group from 1 January 2017, none of which had a 
    material impact on the group.      

5.  HYPERINFLATION 
    The financial statements of the group entities whose functional currencies are the currencies of 
    hyperinflationary economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the year.   

    The economy of Sudan was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary, effective 1 July 2016, and 
    hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this date onwards. As at 31 December 2017 the historical 
    increase in the asset value as a result of hyperinflation accounting has been fully impaired, which resulted 
    in a R1 690 million decrease in EBITDA during the year. 

    The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation 
    accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016. Upon first application of hyperinflation, prior 
    period losses of R123 million arising from the net monetary position have been recognised directly in equity. 
    As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017, the property, plant and equipment of South Sudan was fully impaired, 
    resulting in no hyperinflation adjustment on capital expenditure (capex) for the respective year.

    In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was 
    discontinued effective 1 July 2015. The group's results from Iran includes expenses resulting from the 
    discontinuation of hyperinflation accounting mainly relating to the subsequent depreciation of assets that 
    were historically written up under hyperinflation accounting. The additional income statement charge reduced 
    equity accounted earnings from Iran by R1 328 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 (December 2016: 
    R1 853 million). 

    The economy of Syria was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2014, and hyperinflation 
    accounting has been applied since. As at 31 December 2017, R1 348 million of assets previously written 
    up for hyperinflation has been impaired with the impact being included in EBITDA during the year 
    under review.   

    The impact of hyperinflation on the segment analysis is as follows:                               
                                                             2017

6.  SEGMENT ANALYSIS
    The group has identified reportable segments that are used by the group executive committee (chief 
    operating decision maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess 
    performance. The reportable segments are largely grouped according to their geographic locations and 
    reporting lines to the CODM. The group's underlying operations are now clustered as follows:                               
    - South Africa                                           
    - Nigeria                                                
    - South and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)               
    - West and Central Africa (WECA)                         
    - Middle East and North Africa (MENA). 
    
    The following changes to the group's segment presentation were made during 2017: 
    - The results for MTN South Africa and MTN Nigeria are reported separately. These results were previously 
      reported in the SEA (now SEAGHA) and WECA regions respectively. The group appointed regional vice-presidents 
      in 2017 to manage the rest of the operations in the three regions as part of its strategy to bolster 
      leadership in each region                                                                                
    - The group reallocated its operations in Ghana, which was previously included in the West and Central Africa 
      region (WECA), to the South and East Africa (SEA) region and subsequently renamed this regional grouping 
      (SEAGHA). The reallocation was performed to balance the operational requirements of each region under 
      each vice- president to further optimise the oversight responsibilities of the regional vice- presidents    
    - In addition, during 2017, management changed the way it presents segment results for South Africa. 
      Previously, the South African operating segment included the results of the MTN South Africa sub-group 
      of companies. In 2017, the segment results presented for South Africa only include the results of the 
      MTN South Africa operating company.                                                                               
    
    Comparative numbers for the segments have been restated accordingly. 
    Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable to 
    a segment as well as those that are attributed on a reasonable basis, whether from external transactions or 
    from transactions with other group segments.  

    The measure of reporting profit for each segment, that also represents the basis on which the CODM reviews 
    segment results, is EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest (which includes gains and losses 
    on foreign exchange transactions), tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented before 
    recognising the following items:                                      
    - Impairment of goodwill                                                      
    - Loss on derecognition of a long-term loan receivable                        
    - Net monetary gain resulting from the application of hyperinflation          
    - Share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax.                

    For the purposes of the review of segment results by the CODM, EBITDA also excludes the following items: 
    - Hyperinflation (note 5)                                                           
    - Tower sale profits                                                                
    - Nigeria regulatory fine (note 8)                                                  
    - MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense (note 21)                           
    - Exchange right profit on IHS investment (note 7).                                 

    These exclusions have remained unchanged from the prior year apart from the exchange right profit on the 
    IHS investment that occurred during the year.

    Irancell Telecommunication Company Services (PJSC) (Iran) proportionate results are included in the segment 
    analysis as reviewed by the CODM and excluded from IFRS reported results for revenue, EBITDA and CAPEX due 
    to equity accounting for joint ventures. The results of Iran in the segment analysis exclude the impact of 
    hyperinflation accounting.    
                                                                             2017         20161

7.  INVESTMENT IN IHS 
    In January 2017, the group exchanged its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., the parent company of 
    INT Towers Limited (INT), the Nigerian telecom tower operator, for an additional shareholding in IHS Holding 
    Limited (IHS Group) (the transaction). As a result of the transaction, the group's economic interest in the 
    IHS Group increased from approximately 15% class B non-voting shares to an economic interest of approximately 
    29% comprising class A voting shares and class B non-voting shares. The original IHS Group shareholders' 
    agreement remains in place and there are no changes to IHS Group's independence as an operator. Neither the 
    interest prior to, nor the interest obtained subsequent to the transaction will allow the group to appoint  
    a board member. In addition, IHS Group has the right to decide what strategic, financial and operational 
    information is shared with the group. As a result of these restrictions, the group's vote is limited to 
    matters which relate to fundamental changes in the business or which apply in exceptional circumstances 
    and are considered to be protective in nature. The group's rights do not constitute significant influence 
    to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of IHS Group. Consequently, the group 
    continues to account for its investment in IHS Group as an available-for-sale financial instrument.    

    The exchange, which closed on 23 February 2017, has been accounted for as a disposal of the group's equity 
    accounted interest in INT and an acquisition of an additional investment in the IHS Group. The net impact 
    on profit before tax is R6 017 million, which was determined as the difference between the fair value of 
    the new interest obtained and the carrying value of the equity accounted interest in INT and after recycling 
    the applicable amount included in the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) (note 19) to the income 
    statement. This resulted in a decrease of R4 452 million in investments in associates and an increase of 
    R13 767 million in available-for-sale investments.  

    The decision to exchange the shares was made following a thorough review of the commercial benefits of 
    the exchange and an agreement on the number of shares that the group will qualify for in IHS Group. 
    Consensus on these matters and board approval for the transaction was obtained in January 2017. As a 
    result, the investment in INT was not accounted for as held for sale in accordance with the requirements 
    of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations at 31 December 2016.

    The transaction had no tax impact. 
    
8.  NIGERIA REGULATORY FINE
    On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) resolved the matter relating to the 
    previously imposed regulatory fine with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) after the completion of 
    an extensive negotiation process.  

    In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria agreed to pay a total cash 
    amount of N330 billion over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion1) to the FGN as full and 
    final settlement of the matter. 

    The regulatory fine was fully expensed in the prior years with an additional expense recognised in the 
    income statement amounting to R10,5 billion for the year ended 31 December 2016. A discount unwind of 
    R1,0 billion (31 December 2016: R1,0 billion) was recognised in finance costs during the current year 
    relating to the outstanding liability. The balance of the liability at 31 December 2017 amounts to 
    R6,6 billion (31 December 2016: R8,7 billion) after taking into account the payment of N30 billion 
    (R1,3 billion2) on 24 March 2017 and the unwinding of the interest.     
    1 Amount translated at the 10 June 2016 rate R1 = N13,15

9.  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT                                  
    Current year                                                      
    In a number of the group's operations in the MENA region the socio-political instability experienced in 
    these markets resulted in suppressed revenue growth and lower operating margins being experienced resulting 
    in decreased forecasted cash flows at 30 June 2017. This necessitated impairment reviews being performed on 
    the group's operations in Guinea-Bissau, Guinea-Conakry, Liberia, Ghana, Afghanistan, Sudan, Yemen and Syria 
    where the carrying amounts of these cash generating units were compared to their respective recoverable 
    amounts. The recoverable amounts were determined through value-in-use calculations where future cash flows 
    were estimated and discounted at the weighted average cost of capital discount rates. The discount rates 
    and the perpetuity growth rates used in the value-in-use calculations of the operations impacted by 
    impairment are as follows:

    1 The net impairment of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets of R3 045 million as per

    MTN Sudan was operating in a hyperinflationary economy up to 30 June 2016 while MTN Syria (JSC) continues 
    to operate in a hyperinflationary economy. Hyperinflation accounting resulted in the write up of non-monetary 
    assets and a resulting increase in the carrying value of these operations. The total impairment of property, 
    plant and equipment, and intangible assets amounting to R3 038 million and R192 million of the MTN Sudan 
    goodwill impairment for the current year relates to the carrying value previously written up to account for 
    the impact of hyperinflation, exceeding the calculated value in use.                                                          

    The goodwill of MTN Sudan and MTN Syria was fully impaired as at 30 June 2017. The impairment amount recognised 
    at 30 June 2017 relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of MTN Syria has been adjusted 
    as required for the impact of hyperinflation accounting at 31 December 2017. The remaining goodwill in 
    MTN Afghanistan and MTN Yemen amount to R490 million and R1,2 billion at 31 December 2017, respectively.

    The group performed impairment assessments on all goodwill balances at 31 December 2017 and have not identified 
    any further impairments at that date. The goodwill impaired at 30 June 2017 can not be reversed in subsequent 
    periods. The impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets can be reversed in subsequent 
    periods to the depreciated carrying values at that point in time if the outlook in these markets changed 
    sufficiently to confirm that the discounted future cash flows, or fair values less costs of disposal, 
    exceed the carrying values of these cash generating units.

    Prior year 
    Areeba Guinea S.A. 
    Areeba Guinea S.A. (Conakry) experienced a decline in EBITDA and Guinea-Conakry experienced poor economic 
    performance countrywide. Consequently, a review of the recoverable amount of Conakry was undertaken during 2016 
    subsequent to which an impairment loss amounting to R402 million was recognised. As at 31 December 2016, the 
    goodwill balance relating to Conakry was fully impaired. No further impairments were deemed necessary as at 
    31 December 2017. 

    Afrihost
    Based on an agreement concluded by the group to sell its 50,02% investment in Afrihost Proprietary Limited 
    (Afrihost) for R325 million, a goodwill impairment loss of R202 million was recognised at 30 June 2016 on the 
    remeasurement of the assets to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held 
    for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The investment was disposed of during the second half of 2016.

    With effect from 27 December 2017 MTN Nigeria Towers SPV B.V. assigned its shareholder loan of R2 840 million 
    to IHS Group. The shareholder loan arose as part of MTN Nigeria's tower transactions whereby MTN Nigeria 
    sold a portfolio of towers to INT in 2014 and 2015 which, through Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., was 51% owned 
    by MTN Nigeria Towers SPV B.V. and 49% by IHS. When forming INT, MTN Group (through MTN Nigeria Towers SPV B.V.) 
    as well as IHS Group, provided proportionate shareholder loans to INT. These loans were subordinated and due for 
    repayment in 2024 and 2025 with interest capitalised until two years prior to repayment. In return for the 
    assignment of the loan, IHS has facilitated certain network volume commitments and provided more attractive 
    terms for MTN Nigeria's future network rollout, applicable from 2018 onwards.  
   
    The cash flow benefits to be realised from the improved commercial terms of the future rollout have not been 
    capitalised as a prepayment, and will be accounted for as and when they are realised. This is due to MTN 
    contractually not controlling the realisation of the future economic benefits referred to above. However, 
    the group believes it will obtain economic benefits through IHS being incentivised economically to transact 
    with MTN under the current master services agreement.

14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS       
    Financial instruments at amortised cost 
    The group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost as their 
    carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values, except for the borrowings set out below.     

    Listed long-term borrowings 
    The group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue which were issued 
    in prior years, with a carrying amount of R21 765 million at 31 December 2017 (December 2016: R24 059 million) 
    and a fair value of R22 434 million (December 2016: R23 179 million). The fair values of these instruments 
    are determined by reference to quoted prices on the Irish bond market. The market for these bonds is not 
    considered to be liquid and consequently the fair value measurement is categorised within level 2 of the 
    fair value hierarchy.     

    Financial instruments measured at fair value 
    The fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined as follows:
    Treasury bills
    The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active 
    market. The group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R343 million (December 2016: 
    R282 million) as available for sale and with a carrying amount of R307 million (December 2016: R669 million) 
    as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of these investments is categorised within level 1 
    of the fair value hierarchy.    

    Fair value measurement of investment in IHS 
    Included in investments in the consolidated statement of financial position is an equity investment in 
    IHS Group at fair value of R27 045 million at 31 December 2017. As stated in note 7, the group increased its 
    interest in IHS Group during the year under review following an exchange of its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower 
    InterCo B.V. Prior to the increase, the group reported a fair value of R11 240 million at 31 December 2016 for 
    the investment classified as available for sale. The fair value at 31 December 2016 was determined with reference 
    to recent transactions between market participants, consequently the investment was previously categorised within 
    level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. At 31 December 2017, the absence of transactions between market participants 
    resulted in the fair value being determined using models considered to be appropriate by management. The fair
    value was calculated using an earnings multiple technique and was based on unobservable market inputs including 
    tower industry earnings multiples of between 13x to 17x applied to MTN management's estimates of earnings, 
    less estimated net debt.

    Given the confidentiality restrictions in the shareholders' agreement with IHS Group, MTN does not have access 
    to the IHS Group business plans or 2017 actual financial information. Any estimated earnings used to derive the 
    existing fair value are therefore solely based on MTN management assumptions and market estimates on financial 
    growth, currency movements, costs and performance. The investment has therefore been transferred from level 2 
    to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the current reporting period. An increase of one in the low and high 
    end of the multiple range, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value 
    of R2 148 million and a decrease of one in the low and high end of the multiple range, keeping other inputs 
    constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value by R2 148 million as at 31 December 2017. An 
    increase of 10% in the estimated earnings used, keeping other inputs constant, would have resulted in an 
    increase in the fair value of R3 201 million and a decrease of 10% in the estimated earnings used, keeping 
    other inputs constant, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of R3 201 million as at 
    31 December 2017. An increase of R4 249 million (December 2016: R 2 672 million) has been recognised for 
    the year under review in other comprehensive income resulting from the change in fair value.

    Uncertain tax exposures                                  
    The group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and the group's interpretation and application of the 
    various tax rules applied in direct and indirect tax filings may result in disputes between the group 
    and the relevant tax authority. The outcome of such disputes may not be favourable to the group. At 
    year-end there were a number of tax disputes ongoing in various of the group's operating entities, the 
    most significant of which relates to a transfer pricing dispute which the group is contesting.     

    The group has applied its judgement and has recognised liabilities based on whether additional amounts 
    will be payable and has included contingent liabilities where economic outflows are considered possible 
    but not probable.

    The group's functional and presentation currency is rand. The strengthening of the closing rate of the rand 
    against the functional currencies of the group's largest operations contributed to the decrease in consolidated 
    assets and liabilities and the resulting foreign currency translation reserve reduction of R12 376 million 
    (December 2016: R22 907 million) for the year. Following the exercise of the exchange rights in INT (note 7), 
    a foreign currency translation loss of R3 298 million was released to the consolidated income statement.     

    Nigeria and Sudan exchange rates 
    Following a review of the liquidity and sustainability of quoted exchange rates introduced in Nigeria and 
    Sudan, the group changed the rates applicable to the relevant transactions and balances as well as the 
    translation of the results, cash flows and financial position of these operations in the last quarter of 
    2017. The new quoted rates applied are considered to represent more appropriately the rate at which the 
    future cash flows on the relevant foreign denominated transactions or balances could have been settled 
    if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date or the rate at which dividends can be remitted 
    in respect of the translation of foreign entities. For MTN Nigeria, the group changed its reference rate 
    from the Interbank rate to the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) rate and in MTN Sudan the 
    group changed from the Central Bank rate to the Margin Resource Incentive Rate. 

    Net investment hedges   
    During 2016 and for the year ended 31 December 2017, the group hedged a designated portion of its dollar 
    net assets in MTN (Dubai) Limited (MTN Dubai) for forex exposure arising between the USD and ZAR as part 
    of the group's risk management objectives. The group designated external borrowings (Eurobonds) denominated 
    in USD held by MTN (Mauritius) Investments Limited with a value of R22,4 billion (December 2016: R23,2 billion) 
    and external borrowings denominated in USD held by MTN Nigeria Communications Limited with a value of 
    R2,6 billion (December 2016: R4,5 billion) as hedging instruments. For the period of the hedge relationship, 
    foreign exchange movements on these hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income as part 
    of the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), offsetting the exchange differences recognised in other 
    comprehensive income, arising on translation of the designated dollar net assets of MTN Dubai to ZAR. The 
    cumulative forex movement recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or 
    loss upon loss of control over MTN Dubai. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss 
    during the current or prior year.

Trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2017

MTN is currently in the process of finalising results for the 12 months ended 31 December
2017, which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on
Thursday, 8 March 2018.

Following the trading statement published on Monday, 29 January 2017, shareholders are
further advised that MTN expects to report, for the 12-month period ended 31 December
2017, full year headline earnings per share (HEPS) of between 170 cents per share (cps) and
190cps and basic earnings per share (EPS) of between 235cps and 255cps. This compares with
a headline loss per share of 77cps and attributable loss per share of 144cps for the prior
financial year. The negative performance in the comparable period was mainly as a result of
non-recurring costs, including those related to the Nigerian regulatory fine and losses on
MTN’s 51% equity interest in the Nigerian tower company.

HEPS were impacted by a number of once off and non cash items totaling 483cps in financial
year ended 31 December 2017. The adjustments for the financial year ended 31 December
2017 (financial year ended 31 December 2016) include costs related to the Nigerian
regulatory fine 46cps (500cps), Hyperinflation adjustments excluding impairments 96cps
(37cps), net foreign exchange losses 159cps (235cps), Zakhele Futhi share-based payment
expense 24cps (88cps) and a loss on the derecognition of a loan to an IHS tower subsidiary
158cps (0cps), respectively. The results for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 were
also impacted by the stronger rand and weaker currencies in the foreign entities.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

MTN Group assigns its long dated $231m shareholder loan to IHS Holding Ltd and agrees to
improved and volume-based commercial terms for MTN Nigeria’s future network expansion plans,
resulting in a once-off accounting charge to HEPS and EPS for 2017.

Shareholders are advised that MTN Group (through MTN Nigeria Towers SPV B.V.) has assigned its
shareholder loan of approximately $231m (R2.8bn) which was due in 2024/2025 to IHS Holding Ltd
(together with other group companies, “IHS”) and IHS has facilitated certain network volume
commitments and provided more attractive terms for MTN Nigeria’s future network rollout applicable
from 2018 onwards. The agreement allows MTN Nigeria to continue to invest in its network more
efficiently, and further simplifies MTN’s interests in IHS. The agreement will enable MTN and IHS to
mutually benefit from continued investment and commitment to the rollout of broadband and data
services in Nigeria.

Under International Financial Reporting Standards, the operational cash flow benefits to be realised
from the improved commercial terms of the future rollout are not capitalised as a prepayment and
will be accounted for as and when they are realised. As a result, the assignment of the loan to IHS
leads to a loss on transfer of the carrying value of the loan of approximately ZAR2.8bn or 158 cents
per share for 2017 for MTN Group. This accounting loss on transfer will impact earnings per share
(EPS) and headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 2017 but not earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

In February 2017, MTN Group exchanged its interest in Nigeria Tower Interco B.V. (“Interco”) resulting
in MTN Group having an economic interest of 29% in IHS and no longer being a shareholder of Interco.
MTN Group realised a profit of approximately R6bn on this transaction recorded in its 2017 first half
results.

The combination of the profit from the exchange of Interco shares for IHS shares in the first half of the
2017 financial year and the loss on assignment of the shareholder loan in the second half of the year
has a combined positive impact of R3.2bn to earnings in 2017.

The shareholder loan arose as part of MTN Nigeria’s tower transactions whereby MTN Nigeria sold a
portfolio of towers to INT Towers (Nigeria) (“INT”) in 2014 and 2015 which, through Interco, was 51%
owned by MTN Nigeria Towers SPV B.V. and 49% by IHS. At the time of the original transaction MTN
also acquired an approximate 15% interest in IHS. When forming INT, MTN Group (through MTN
Nigeria Towers SPV B.V.) as well as IHS, provided proportionate shareholder loans to INT. These loans
were subordinated and due for repayment in 2024 and 2025 with interest capitalised until 2 years
prior to repayment.

Note: Using an FX rate of US$:ZAR 12.31 as at 27 December to convert the US$ value of the loan to
ZAR.

NOTICE OF REGULATORY HEARING IN BENIN

MTN Benin has received notification from the telecoms regulator (ARCEP) on the 8th November 2017
that a process was being initiated to review the reasons why MTN Benin has not paid outstanding
invoices on frequency fees for 2016 and 2017.

On 30 March 2017, the Government of Benin issued MTN Benin frequency fees invoices for an amount
equivalent to approximately USD 213 million for the period March 2016 to December 2017.

Whilst the license agreement prescribes the calculation methodology for frequency fees it also
provides that fees should take into account regional benchmarks, international practises and the local
economy.

MTN Benin has contested this amount on the basis that, inter alia, the amount is excessive which has
been confirmed by an independent benchmark report commissioned in terms of MTN Benin’s license.

We will continue to engage with the regulatory authorities in Benin to find an amicable solution to
this matter.

Quarterly update for the period ended 30 September 2017


MTN is a leading emerging markets mobile operator, connecting approximately 230 million people in 22
countries across Africa and the Middle East. We are at the forefront of global technological changes, 
delivering a bold, new Digital World to our customers.


Salient features
- Group subscribers declined marginally by 0,7% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 230,2 million, largely 
  driven by lower reported subscribers in Nigeria as we continue to refine our active subscriber 
  definitions as well as the disconnection of approximately 750 000 subscribers in Uganda as a result 
  of regulatory SIM registration requirements.
- Active MTN Mobile Money customers increased QoQ by 10,6% to 19,8 million.
- Voice traffic (billable minutes) increased by 9% and data traffic continued to grow strongly up by 
  some 125% year-on-year (YoY).
- On a reported basis Group total revenue and Group service revenue reduced by 13,4% and 14,0% 
  respectively largely due to exchange rate movements.
- On a constant currency basis Group total revenue increased by 6,9%, with Group service revenue up 7,4%. 
  Data revenue increased by 31,4% and digital revenue was up 19,6%.
- MTN South Africa's organic service revenue increased by 5,2%*.
- MTN Nigeria reported an 11,2% increase in total revenue supported by data revenue growth of 72,1%.
- MTN Irancell total revenue increased by 16,8% and;
- MTN Group year-to-date capital expenditure was R18 billion, up 1,1%. 

Unless otherwise stated financial growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis. Financial 
growth rates are year-on-year (the nine-month period ended 30 September 2017 versus the nine months ended 
30 September 2016) unless otherwise stated. QoQ growth rates refer to 3Q17 vs 2Q17. Data revenue refers to 
access data revenue only. Digital revenue refers to Mobile Money (MoMo) and value-added services (VAS) 
revenue.
*Organic revenue adjusts for prior year disposals and alignment of post-paid carry over rules.


MTN Group president and chief executive officer, Rob Shuter comments:
""The Group continued to make steady progress in implementing our BRIGHT strategy with a strong focus on
operational execution across the Group. Our key growth drivers of data and digital services performed well 
with revenue growth of 31,4% and 19,6% respectively. In the quarter, we have accelerated our network 
investment programme, rolling out 1 641 3G and 2 102 4G sites (including co-located sites), supporting the 
demand for data services. In South Africa and Nigeria the network investments are showing encouraging 
improvements in network quality and NPS.

In South Africa the prepaid business performed well and progress is being made in the postpaid segment
particularly in consumer  postpaid where we now have positive net-adds year to date. In Nigeria, our 
month-on-month gross connections have increased, and we experienced stable subscriber market share over the 
quarter while driving increased value share.

In line with our strategic initiative to drive a dual-data strategy, we are working on reducing the
out-of-bundle data pricing across our markets to stimulate usage from inactive and low usage customers. This 
is expected to have a short-term impact on data revenue growth but we anticipate elasticity in the mass 
and high-value segments will continue to drive data revenue growth in the medium term.

We further strengthened our management structure to support our BRIGHT strategy. The appointment of 
Ebenezer Asante as vice-president (VP) of our new South and East Africa and Ghana Region, effective 
1 October 2017 completes the Group executive structure. Ebenezer was previously the chief executive officer 
of MTN Ghana, a position he held from July 2015 to September 2017.

Other Group senior appointments in the quarter included:
* Fred Scheppens as Group executive: MTN GlobalConnect, effective 15 October 2017;
* Dirk Karl as Group executive: Procurement and Supply Chain Management, effective 1 October 2017;
* Serigne Dioum as Group executive: Mobile Financial Services, effective 26 September 2017; and
* Ankur Bajpai as Group executive: Customer Value Management, effective 1 September 2017.

We continue to work on the modernisation of our subscriber definitions which we expect to complete by
year-end.

We remain on track to meet our financial year 2017 guidance despite continued challenging economic growth
across our markets.""

SEA REGION

SOUTH AFRICA
MTN South Africa recorded organic service revenue growth of 5,2%*. Data and digital services revenue which 
increased by 21,0% and 27,7% respectively, were supported by a strong prepaid performance as well as the 
continued recovery of the postpaid consumer segment. NPS continued to improve driven mainly by network NPS.

Subscriber numbers decreased by 1,0% to 30,9 million, impacted by a 1,3% decline in the prepaid segment
(mainly the result of higher churn following the withdrawal of a Q2 2017 promotion). Postpaid subscriber 
numbers were stable.

The postpaid consumer segment recorded positive net additions in quarter, demonstrating a continued
encouraging recovery in this segment. This was supported by improvements made in customer value management 
(CVM), increased channel footprint and enhanced churn management. The growth in consumer net additions was 
partly offset by the disconnection of subscribers through certain on-biller partnerships and churn in the 
enterprise segment. 

MTN South Africa continued to make good progress in improving the quality and capacity of its 3G and 4G
network in the quarter with leading network metrics in three of the four metros in the country.

UGANDA
MTN Uganda delivered encouraging revenue trends, underpinned by strong growth in data and MoMo revenue. Data
revenue increased by 29,8%, supported by improved 3G coverage, implementing new CVM including contextualised
pricing, and increased smartphone penetration. MoMo contributed 23% to total revenue. On-net voice revenue
continued to show positive growth following the launch of personalised voice bundles earlier in the year. 

The operation’s NPS improved further in the quarter, supported by stronger value and billing NPS (QoQ).

At the end of August 2017, MTN Uganda disconnected approximately 750 000 subscribers as a result of
regulatory SIM registration requirements. As a result, the subscriber base declined by 3,2% to 10,8 million.

SEA EXCLUDING SOUTH AFRICA - across the rest of the SEA region the subscriber base declined by 0,7% QoQ.
Rwanda, Zambia, Swaziland and South Sudan contributed positively, however the growth was offset by the
disconnections in Uganda.

WECA REGION

NIGERIA
MTN Nigeria continued to deliver healthy revenue growth of 11,2%, supported by 5,4% growth in voice revenue
and 72,1% growth in data revenue. Voice revenue growth was driven by effective price optimisation, increased
minutes of use and higher interconnect revenue. Data revenue benefited from investments made on expanding 
and improving the 3G and 4G network quality, and increased 4G device penetration. Digital revenue growth, 
however, continued to be negatively impacted by the ongoing optimisation of VAS services. NPS showed 
incremental improvements, driven by network NPS (QoQ).

MTN Nigeria decreased its subscriber base by 5,2% to 50,3 million impacted by the modernisation of
subscriber definitions. On a like-for-like basis MTN Nigeria reported positive net additions and continued 
to gain value share in the quarter. To further drive subscriber growth increasing the SIM registration 
footprint remains a priority.

MTN Nigeria made good progress in the quarter in executing on network investment, improving network quality
and capacity in key cities.

GHANA
MTN Ghana delivered strong growth of 51,1% and 39,7% respectively in data and digital revenue. This was
supported by an increase in the number of data users following the introduction of new data bundles. MoMo
continued to make sound progress and contributed 13% to total revenue. 

MTN Ghana increased its subscriber base by 1,6% to 17,6 million. The operation showed some improvements in
overall NPS, supported by an increase in network NPS (QoQ).

IVORY COAST
MTN Ivory Coast recorded good growth in revenue, led by an acceleration of both data and MoMo revenue. Data
revenue increased by 70,1%, benefiting from the expansion of the operation’s 3G network. Digital revenue
continued to gain traction and increased by 33,5%.

MTN Ivory Coast increased its subscriber base by 5,5% to 11,6 million in the quarter, underpinned by the
introduction of attractive data value propositions. NPS, however, was negatively impacted by higher on-net 
voice pricing as a result of regulatory requirements disallowing differential pricing for on-net and 
off-net tariffs. This adversely affected value NPS in the quarter (QoQ).

CAMEROON
MTN Cameroon continued to operate in a challenging economic environment which negatively impacted on
consumer spending. Despite this, data and digital revenue increased by 18,2% and 13,2% respectively. Data 
revenue was supported by strong growth in data users and smartphone penetration while digital revenue was 
underpinned by significant growth in MoMo revenue in the quarter.

The operation’s subscriber base declined by 1,0% in the quarter due to lower gross connections as a result
of continued implementation of the subscriber registration rules. MTN Cameroon recorded continued 
improvements in NPS in the quarter, supported by network NPS (QoQ).

MTN Cameroon, together with other industry operators, received a sanction from the Republic of Cameroon
Telecommunications Regulatory Board for allegedly not complying with spectrum and subscriber registration
regulations. The penalty was equivalent to approximately US$6,6 million and a one-year reduction in its 
licence term (which extends to 2030). MTN is engaging with the regulator and the highest authorities of 
Cameroon on this matter.

WECA EXCLUDING NIGERIA - across the rest of the region, subscribers increased by 2,6% in the quarter. Ghana,
Ivory Coast, Guinea-Conakry, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau and Liberia contributed positively to the
region’s subscriber base. This was partly offset by a decline in subscriber growth in Cameroon and a 
relatively flat performance in Benin.

MENA REGION

IRAN
MTN Irancell delivered robust revenue growth in the period. This was supported by 64,5% growth in data
revenue. The operation’s subscriber base expanded by 1,0% in the quarter. Improving NPS in MTN Irancell 
remains a priority.

OTHER MENA - across the rest of the region, subscribers decreased by 0,4% in the quarter, led down by
declines in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan. Sudan and Cyprus contributed positively to the region’s 
subscriber base.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
MTN’s external auditors.

Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on 
the Group’s results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting 
year’s results have been adjusted to the prior year’s average exchange rates, determined as the average of 
the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the Group’s currencies, 
materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been 
calculated based on the current year constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In 
addition, in respect of MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been 
prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
Group President and CEO, Rob Shuter comments: 
""We are seeing pleasing progress in our key growth drivers of data and digital services against headwinds of
challenging macro-economic conditions and foreign exchange currency pressures. We continue to strengthen our 
focus on operational excellence with our six strategic pillars integrated in our new BRIGHT strategy. Our 
focus during the second half of the year will be to entrench our BRIGHT strategy, complete our network 
investment programme and build medium-term financial KPIs and targets for the BRIGHT strategy.""

Note: Certain financial information presented in these interim financial results constitutes pro forma 
financial information. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the Group’s Board of 
directors (the Board) and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma 
financial information may not fairly present MTN's financial position, changes in equity, results of 
operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial information, including the constant currency information 
(refer below) as well as any forward looking financial information incorporated in these condensed 
consolidated interim financial results, have not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by 
our external joint auditors.
1. The financial information presented in these condensed consolidated financial results has been prepared 
   excluding the impact of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill and asset impairments, tower profits 
   (including a profit of R6 017 million relating to the profit realised on the exercise of the IHS exchange 
   right whereby the Group's interest in the Nigeria Tower Company was exchanged for additional shareholding 
   in IHS Holdings) and the Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the 
   settlement was entered into and the finance costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial 
   discounting of the liability) (the pro forma adjustments) and constitutes pro forma financial information 
   to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the reviewed condensed 
   consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017. This pro forma financial 
   information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments from the financial 
   results in order to achieve a comparable analysis period on period. The pro forma adjustments have been 
   calculated in terms of the Group's accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
   for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
2. Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on 
   the Group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting 
   period's results have been adjusted to the prior period average exchange rates determined as the average 
   of the monthly exchange rates which can be found on www.mtn.com/investors. The measurement has been performed 
   for each of the Group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant 
   currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year constant currency results compared 
   to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, 
   the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation 
   accounting was discontinued for MTN Irancell and MTN Sudan on 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016 respectively. 
   The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation 
   accounting was applied from December 2016 onwards.
*  Constant currency information. 
** Reported – includes the impact of the pro forma adjustments as defined.

The Group's results are presented on a regional basis in line with the Group's operational structure. 
This comprises South and East Africa (SEA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) and their respective underlying operations as further outlined below.

The SEA region includes: South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture, equity 
accounted), Swaziland (joint venture, equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes: Nigeria, 
Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau. The MENA 
region includes: Iran (joint venture, equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 
Although Iran, Botswana and Swaziland form part of their respective regions geographically and operationally, 
they are excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity accounted for by the Group.

OVERVIEW
MTN delivered improved results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 and is on track to meet the financial 
year 2017 (FY2017) guidance communicated in March 2017. Macro-economic conditions remain challenging across 
a number of our markets, with Nigeria continuing to experience a weaker naira as well as hard currency 
liquidity challenges. Although South Africa entered a technical recession in the first quarter, the rand 
strengthened considerably against the US dollar during the period, while many of the currencies in our 
other markets weakened. Despite these macro-challenges, the Group continues to deliver on its 
operational targets.

During the past six months the management team undertook a thorough review of the Group strategy and developed 
a clear growth plan for MTN that will be arranged under six strategic pillars comprising: Best customer experience; 
Returns and efficiency focus; IGNITE commercial performance; Growth through data and digital; Hearts and minds; 
and Technology excellence. We refer to this as the ""BRIGHT"" strategy. 

BRIGHT builds on work done over the past 18 months, in particular the Project IGNITE, our operational execution
programme embarked on last year, in our two largest markets MTN South Africa and MTN Nigeria.

Group revenue in constant currency grew by 6,7%* to R64 315 million, underpinned by 10,8%* growth in revenue in
Nigeria and a 5,2% (on an organic basis) improvement in service revenue growth in South Africa. MTN Uganda, MTN 
Ghana and MTN Ivory Coast also contributed positively to the Group's top-line growth. MTN Cameroon experienced 
a challenging period, negatively impacted by the data network shutdown in some parts of the country in the 
first quarter.

The improvement in Group revenue was mostly attributable to strong growth in data and digital revenue, supported 
by stable outgoing voice revenue. Data revenue increased by 31,9%* to R13 952 million, supported by the improved 
quality and capacity of our data networks in key markets. Digital revenue increased by 24,7%*, driven mainly by 
mobile financial services (MFS). MFS continued to gain traction, with the Group adding 2,7 million active MTN 
Mobile Money (MoMo) customers in the first half of the year. Outgoing voice revenue remained flat for the period 
at R32 768 million. 

The Group's reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, impairment of goodwill, net
monetary gains and share of results of joint ventures and associates after tax (EBITDA) margin was 37,9%**. This 
was mainly as a result of the once-off profit (R6 017 million) realised on the exercise of the exchange right 
where the Group's interest in the Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. (INT) was exchanged for a higher shareholding in 
IHS Holding Limited (IHS). This was partly offset by fixed asset impairments for MTN Sudan (R1 690 million) and 
MTN Syria (R1 125 million) relating to the carrying value previously written up under hyperinflation. 

On an operational basis (excluding pro forma adjustments), the Group's EBITDA margin declined by 4,2 percentage points
(pp) to 32,9%. MTN Nigeria's EBITDA margin (excluding the Nigerian regulatory fine) declined by 11,5pp* to 38,3%*. 
This was largely as a result of higher foreign-currency-denominated expenses in Nigeria following the depreciation 
of the naira against the US dollar. This was partly offset by a 3,4pp growth to 33,5% in the EBITDA margin in 
South Africa. The MTN South Africa margin improvement was largely supported by lower handset subsidies and volumes, 
as well as a strong rand benefiting the cost of handsets in the period. MTN Uganda, MTN Ghana and MTN Ivory Coast 
reported an increase in EBITDA margins while MTN Cameroon's margin declined largely as a result of lower 
revenue growth.

Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) were 217 cents** compared to a 271 cents** headline loss per share in 
the comparable period, impacted by the Nigerian regulatory fine of 474 cents** (454 cents of the Nigerian fine fully
expensed and 20 cents of the interest unwind). In the current period, the Nigerian regulatory fine interest unwind 
reduced HEPS by 24 cents. 

Subscriber numbers in the period decreased by 3,6% to 231,8 million impacted by a decline in subscriber numbers in 
MTN Nigeria and MTN Ghana. This was largely a result of the Group's initiative to modernise subscriber definitions 
to reflect the business's changing mix of revenue streams. The implementation of the modernised definitions continues 
and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

The Group continued to invest in the roll out of network and information technology across its markets. Capital
expenditure (capex) was lower than expected, impacted by limited foreign currency availability in Nigeria, some 
execution challenges as well as the seasonality of the capex cycle. In the period, a total of 4 404 3G and 
3 478 4G co-located sites were rolled out. 

PROSPECTS AND GUIDANCE 
Africa and the Middle East remain among the world's key growth regions over the medium to long term. As the prospects
for telecommunications are closely aligned to this growth trajectory, we see a number of opportunities and believe that
MTN is well placed to benefit given our unique position in the markets in which we operate. 

With a strengthened leadership team, the Group continues to work towards achieving our vision ""to lead the delivery of
a bold, new Digital World to our customers"". We will continue to leverage our scale and enhance our competitive
position, benefiting from favourable demographic growth (that will mitigate expected future declines in voice revenue), 
low data penetration in our markets and the unique opportunity we have to provide our customers with a wide range of 
digital services across our operations.

To ensure that management remains focused on delivering on the BRIGHT strategy to the benefit of our stakeholders, 
we will establish clearly defined initiatives and KPIs for each of the six areas of ""BRIGHT"" in the second half 
of the year. We expect these initiatives to support improved top-line growth, EBITDA margins and cash flow over 
the medium term. 

Our recent extensive capex investments across our operations will enable the business to provide a superior customer
experience and competitive data networks. This will support the increasing demand for data and digital services. 
We have reduced our capex guidance for 2017 to R30,0 billion from previous guidance of R34,8 billion. We expect 
to accelerate expenditure in the second half and meet the revised capex guidance for the full year.

MTN Nigeria continues to make progress with preparations to list MTN Nigeria shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. 
We anticipate completing this process in 2018, should market conditions permit. MTN Ghana is working with relevant
regulators on a transaction to increase Ghanaian ownership of MTN Ghana shares. We expect to complete this in the 
course of 2017.

We remain on track to meet our FY2017 guidance despite the muted economic growth forecast across our markets. 

In South Africa, we expect mid-single-digit service revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion of 50 and 100 basis
points year-on-year (YoY). This will be supported by a strong focus on customer service and significantly improved 
network quality, capacity and speed. Targeted cost-optimisation initiatives will support EBITDA growth. We do not 
expect the recent credit ratings downgrade of MTN following the sovereign downgrade of South Africa to have a 
material impact on existing facilities or the cost of new funding in 2017.

In Nigeria, we anticipate upper single-digit revenue growth YoY. This will be supported by an improved competitive
position, improved network quality and capacity, smartphone penetration and an increased focus on growing data and 
digital revenue. We expect continued improvement in foreign currency liquidity following central bank interventions 
since February 2017. Encouragingly, post period end MTN Nigeria declared an interim dividend which after adjusting 
for withholding taxes and minorities will result in USD95 million being received by MTN Group.

In Iran, we expect to benefit from growth in the Iranian economy and from the country's youthful population,
particularly in the digital services space. The Group will continue to focus on the upstreaming of dividends across 
all operations, including MTN Irancell.

Any forward-looking financial information disclosed in this results announcement has not been reviewed or audited 
or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

DIVIDENDS
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 250 cents per share. This is in line with the FY2017 guidance 
of 700 cents per share communicated in March 2017.

    line items affected. 

    The economies of Iran and Sudan were assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2015 and 
    1 July 2016 respectively  and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this date onwards.

    The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016 and hyperinflation
    accounting was applied from this date onwards.

    Included in EBITDA is the fixed asset impairments for MTN Sudan (R1 690 million) and MTN Syria (R1 125 million)
    relating to the carrying value previously written up for the impact of hyperinflation. 

#   An amount of R192 million of the goodwill impairment on MTN Sudan relates to the carrying value previously written
    up for the impact of hyperinflation. 

(2) Represents the exclusion of the financial impact relating to the sale of tower assets during the financial period
    on the respective financial line items impacted, which include: 
    - Tower profits, including R6 017 million relating to the profit realised on the exercise of the exchange right
      where the interest in the Nigeria tower company was exchanged for an increased shareholding in IHS Holdings.
    - Release of Ghana deferred gain of R13 million (1H16: R18 million). 

(3) Represents the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine subsequent to conclusion of the settlement agreement during
    2016 on the respective financial line items impacted, which include: 
    - 2016: The remeasurement impact when the settlement agreement was entered into on 10 June 2016, constituting the
      difference between the balance of the provision recorded on this date (after taking into account finance cost 
      accrued from the beginning of the financial year up to 9 June 2016) and the present value of the financial 
      liability arising on this date in accordance with IFRS (included in the EBITDA line);
    - 2016 and 2017: The finance cost impact recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the provision
      (for the period from 1 January to 9 June 2016) and the financial liability (for the period from 10 June 2016 
      to 30 June 2016 and from 1 January 2017 to reporting date).

EXCHANGE RATES
The stronger rand and the significant year-on-year (YoY) depreciation of the naira against the US dollar had a
negative translation impact on rand reported results for the period. The average naira depreciated by 35,3% against 
the US dollar in comparison to the prior period. The average rand strengthened by 14,7% against the US dollar YoY 
and closed 5,2% higher than the previous period.

REVENUE
Group total revenue increased by 6,7%* to R64 315 million. This was supported by encouraging revenue growth in 
Nigeria (up 10,8%*), Uganda (up 9,4%*), Ghana (up 22,6%*) and Ivory Coast (up 13,0%*). This was mainly a result 
of strong data and digital revenue growth in these markets. MTN Cameroon reported a 4,2%* decline in revenue, 
while total revenue growth in MTN South Africa increased by 1,6%. 

Data revenue increased by 31,9%*, benefiting from significantly improved data network quality and capacity across 
our key markets and a 9,1% increase in data users to 122,7 million. Data revenue increased in South Africa 
(up 14,4%), Nigeria (up 70,4%*), Uganda (up 29,2%*), Ghana (up 65,9%*), Cameroon (up 14,1%*) and Ivory Coast 
(up 74,6%*). 

Digital revenue increased by 24,7%*, underpinned by solid growth in MFS. This was partly offset by slower growth in
value-added services (VAS) revenue, impacted by the ongoing review of VAS across our markets, in particular Nigeria.

Outgoing voice revenue remained flat. This is a positive reinforcement of our work to stem the decline in the
contribution of voice to the business, particularly in Nigeria. 

COSTS
Total costs increased by 12,5%*, negatively impacted by foreign-denominated expenses in Nigeria and costs 
associated with the rollout of network sites in the period. Lower handset cost subsidies and volumes as well 
as a strong rand benefited the total cost of handsets in South Africa. 

EBITDA
Group EBITDA declined by 3,1%*, mainly impacted by a 14,8%* decrease in MTN Nigeria's EBITDA as a result of higher
foreign-denominated expenses following the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar. This was, however, 
offset by a 13,1% increase in MTN South Africa's EBITDA. MTN Uganda (up 20,5%*), MTN Ghana (up 15,6%*) and 
MTN Ivory Coast (up 10,2%*) contributed positively to Group EBITDA while MTN Cameroon recorded a 22,1%* 
decline in EBITDA. Head office costs were lower than the prior comparable period mainly as a result of 
a number of once-off costs incurred in the prior period.

Consequently, the Group EBITDA margin decreased by 4,2 percentage points to 32,9%.

DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
The Group depreciation charge increased by 9,0%* to R9 123 million as a result of higher capex in 2016. 
Amortisation costs increased by 25,7%* to R2 090 million, mainly because of higher spend on software in the 
previous period. Non-hyperinflation-related goodwill impairments consisted of impairments in MTN Afghanistan 
(R841 million), MTN Sudan (R791 million) and MTN Yemen (R807 million).

NET FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs decreased by 46,3% to R2 935 million. This was mainly due to a 58,0% reduction in net foreign
exchange (forex) losses to R1 515 million for the period. The decline in forex losses was largely as a result 
of lower foreign-denominated receivables in Mauritius following the repatriation of funds from MTN Irancell 
in 2016. A 23,5% decrease in the Group's net interest charge was driven by the stronger rand against the 
US dollar, resulting in lower finance costs paid on US dollar bonds as well as the translation of the Nigeria 
finance charge following a weaker naira against the rand. South Africa and Dubai reported forex gains in
the period.

Net forex losses mainly included:
- Forex losses in head office of R578 million due to the Iran dividend repatriation and the short-term loan 
  to MTN Irancell;
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R893 million incurred on US dollar-denominated third-party payables; and
- Forex losses of R191 million in Sudan on foreign-denominated third-party funding and payables.

SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES AFTER TAX
Joint ventures and associates reported a profit of R1 242 million compared to a loss of R653 million in the
comparative period. This was mainly as a result of the exercise of the exchange right where MTN exchanged 
its 51% shares of Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. for an increased equity stake in IHS. Following this 
transaction (effective 1 February 2017), we no longer own and equity account for a share of the results 
of INT. 

TAXATION
The reported effective tax rate was 31,9%**, impacted mainly by lower normalised profit before tax (PBT) 
and the effects of tower profits, the turnover-based tax system in Sudan, the Sudanese impairments, as well 
as withholding taxes on upstreamed dividends and other fees.

The Group's reported taxation charge decreased by 51,1%** to R2 312 million for the period. This was impacted 
by higher taxable income in the prior period.

EARNINGS
Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) were 217 cents** compared to a 271 cents** headline loss per share 
in the comparable period. 

CASH FLOW
Cash inflows from operations decreased to R17 763 million**. This was mainly as a result of lower attributable 
profits in Nigeria. The repatriation of cash from MTN Irancell of R6 509 million supported cash flows for the 
period. Key cash outflows for the period included dividends paid of R8 475 million** and cash capex of 
R12 419 million**.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capex decreased by 25,2% (3,6%*) to R10 305 million. Capex in the first half of the year was slower than expected,
impacted by limited foreign currency availability in Nigeria, some execution challenges as well as the seasonality 
of the capex cycle.

FINANCIAL POSITION
Net debt increased to R52 337 million** from R51 902 million** reported at year-end. The increase was mainly impacted
by lower cash generated from operations offset by cash repatriated from Iran amounting to R6 509 million** and an
increase in head office net debt.

MTN Nigeria continued to focus on healthy growth despite a challenging macro-economic environment. The operation
continued to focus on reviewing and optimising both subscriber definitions and VAS subscriptions, placing some 
short-term pressure on subscriber net additions and VAS revenue. The subscriber base declined by 14,3% to 
53,1 million, following both this review as well as lower gross connections as a result of new regulations 
that require all subscriber connections take place in permanent structures. Total revenue increased by 10,8%*, 
largely attributable to strong data revenue growth. Data revenue increased by 70,4%*, benefiting from 
customised data offerings and improved network quality driving data usage. Digital revenue grew by 14,1%* 
with active MoMo customers growing by 22,9% to 1,9 million.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
The Turkcell lawsuit currently before the South Gauteng High Court in South Africa is not a new action 
and was initiated by Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S (Turkcell) and East Asian Consortium (EAC) in 2013. 
It relates to Turkcell's alleged grievances arising from its unsuccessful bid to obtain a mobile licence 
in Iran, and the awarding of that licence to MTN Irancell in 2005. Recent developments in the matter were 
procedural in nature and had nothing to do with the merits of the case. MTN continues to believe that 
there is no legal merit to Turkcell's claim and will accordingly oppose it.

30 June 2017 has been declared. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration

MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net 
dividend of 200 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend 
withholding tax of 50 cents per share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories 
of shareholders for the different dividend tax rates is as follows:

5%      237.50 cents per share
7,5%    231.25 cents per share
10%     225 cents per share
12,5%   218.75 cents per share
15%     212.50 cents per share

These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation 
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2017
1.  INDEPENDENT review                 
    The directors of the Company take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim 
    financial statements. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been reviewed by our joint 
    independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc., who have expressed an unmodified 
    conclusion. The joint external auditors have performed their review in accordance with International Standard on 
    Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410. A copy of the independent auditors' review report on the condensed consolidated 
    interim financial statements is available for inspection at the Company's registered office, together with the 
    interim financial statements identified in the independent auditors' review report.                 

    The independent auditors' review report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this 
    announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of 
    the independent auditors' engagement they should obtain a copy of the independent auditors' review report 
    together with the accompanying interim financial statements from the Company's registered office.     

2.  GENERAL INFORMATION       
    MTN Group Limited (the Company) carries on the business of investing in the telecommunications industry through 
    its subsidiary companies, joint ventures, associates and related investments. 

3.  BASIS OF PREPARATION 
    These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017 have been prepared 
    in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA 
    Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by 
    the Financial Reporting Standards Council (FRSC) and the requirements of the South African Companies Act, No 71 
    of 2008. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual 
    financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, which have been prepared in accordance with International 
    Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).    

4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    The Group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International Accounting 
    Standards Boards (IASB) which were effective for the Group from 1 January 2017, none of which had a material impact 
    on the Group. 

    The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in 
    terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated 
    annual financial statements.

5.  HYPERINFLATION
    The financial statements of the Group entities whose functional currencies are the currencies of hyperinflationary 
    economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.

    The economy of Sudan was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary, effective 1 July 2016, and hyperinflation 
    accounting was discontinued from this date onwards. As at 30 June 2017 the historical increase in the asset value 
    as a result of hyperinflation accounting has been fully impaired, which resulted in a R1 690 million decrease in 
    EBITDA for the period under review. 

    The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2016, and hyperinflation 
    accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016. Upon first application of hyperinflation, prior period 
    losses of R123 million arising from the net monetary position were recognised directly in equity. As at 31 December 
    2016 and 30 June 2017, the property, plant and equipment of South Sudan was fully impaired, resulting in no hyperinflation 
    adjustment on capital expenditure (capex) for the period under review or during the year ended 31 December 2016.

    In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued 
    effective 1 July 2015. The Group's results from Iran includes expenses resulting from the discontinuation of hyperinflation 
    accounting mainly relating to the subsequent depreciation of assets that were historically written up under hyperinflation 
    accounting. The additional income statement charge reduced equity accounted earnings from Iran by R640 million for the six 
    months ended 30 June 2017 (June 2016: R1 039 million, December 2016: R1 853 million).

    The economy of Syria was assessed to be hyperinflationary, effective 1 January 2014, and hyperinflation accounting has 
    been applied since. As at 30 June 2017, R1 125 million of assets previously written up for hyperinflation have been 
    impaired with the impact being included in EBITDA for the period under review. 

    The impact of hyperinflation on the segment analysis is as follows:

6.  SEGMENT ANALYSIS
    The Group has identified reportable segments that are used by the Group executive committee (chief operating decision 
    maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The reportable segments 
    are grouped according to their geographic locations.

    The MTN Group is clustered into the following three regions and their respective underlying operations:
    - South and East Africa (SEA)
    - West and Central Africa (WECA)
    - Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

    Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include external transactions or transactions 
    with other Group segments that can be attributable to a segment on a reasonable basis.

    EBITDA is used as the measure of reporting profit or loss for each segment and represents the basis on which the 
    CODM reviews segment results. It is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment 
    of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of joint ventures and associates after tax and further excludes 
    the following items:
    - Hyperinflation (note 5)
    - Tower sale and exchange right profit on IHS investment (note 7)
    - Nigeria regulatory fine (note 8)
    - MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense.

    Other than for the exclusion of the exchange right profit on the IHS investment during the period under review (note 7), 
    this measure has remained unchanged in comparison to prior periods.

    Irancell Telecommunication Company Services (PJSC) (Iran) proportionate results are included in the segment analysis 
    as reviewed by the CODM and excluded from IFRS reported results for revenue, EBITDA and capex due to equity accounting 
    for joint ventures. The results of Iran in the segment analysis exclude the impact of hyperinflation accounting.

7.  INVESTMENT IN IHS
    In January 2017, the Group exchanged its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., the parent company of INT Towers 
    Limited (INT), the Nigerian telecom tower operator, for an additional shareholding in IHS Holding Limited (IHS Group) 
    (""the transaction""). As a result of the transaction, the Group's economic interest in the IHS Group increased from 
    approximately 15% class B non-voting shares to an economic interest of approximately 29% comprising class A voting 
    shares and class B non-voting shares. The original IHS Group shareholders' agreement remains in place and there are 
    no changes to IHS Group's independence as an operator. Neither the interest prior to, nor the interest obtained 
    subsequent to the transaction will allow the Group to appoint a board member. In addition, IHS Group has the right 
    to decide what strategic, financial and operational information is shared with the Group. As a result of these 
    restrictions, the Group's vote is limited to matters which relate to fundamental changes in the business or which 
    apply in exceptional circumstances and are considered to be protective in nature. The Group's rights do not constitute 
    significant influence to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of IHS Group. Consequently, 
    the Group continues to account for its investment in IHS Group as an available-for-sale financial instrument.

    The exchange, which closed on 23 February 2017, has been accounted for as a disposal of the Group's equity accounted 
    interest in INT and an acquisition of an additional investment in the IHS Group. The net impact on profit before tax is 
    R6 017 million, which was determined as the difference between the fair value of the new interest obtained and the 
    carrying value of the equity-accounted interest in INT and after recycling the applicable amount included in the foreign 
    currency translation reserve (FCTR) (note 18) to the income statement. This resulted in a decrease of R4 452 million in 
    investments in associates and an increase of R13 767 million in available-for-sale investments.

    The decision to exchange the shares was made following a thorough review of the commercial benefits of the exchange and 
    an agreement on the number of shares that the Group will qualify for in IHS Group. Consensus on these matters and board 
    approval for the transaction was obtained in January 2017. As a result, the investment in INT was not accounted for as 
    held for sale in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
    at 31 December 2016.

    The transaction had no tax impact.

8.  NIGERIA REGULATORY FINE
    On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) resolved the matter relating to the previously imposed 
    regulatory fine with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) after the completion of an extensive negotiation process. 

    In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria agreed to pay a total cash amount of 
    N330 billion over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion 1) to the FGN as full and final settlement of the matter.

    The regulatory fine was fully expensed in the prior period with an additional expense recognised in the income statement 
    amounting to R10,5 billion for the periods ended 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016. A discount unwind of R537 million 
    (June 2016: R452 million; December 2016: R1,0 billion) was recognised in finance costs during the current period relating 
    to the outstanding liability. The balance of the liability at 30 June 2017 amounts to R7,2 billion (December 2016: 
    R8,7 billion) after taking into account the payment of N30 billion (R1,3 billion 2) on 24 March 2017 and the unwinding

9.  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
    Current period impairments     
    In a number of the Group's operations in the MENA region the socio-political instability experienced in these 
    markets resulted in suppressed revenue growth and lower operating margins being experienced resulting in decreased 
    forecast cash flows. This necessitated impairment reviews being performed on the Group's operations in Guinea-Bissau, 
    Guinea-Conakry, Liberia, Ghana, Afghanistan, Sudan, Yemen and Syria where the carrying amounts of these 
    cash-generating units were compared to their respective recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts were 
    determined through value-in-use calculations where future cash flows were estimated and discounted at the weighted 
    average cost of capital discount rates. The discount rates and the perpetuity growth rates used in the value-in-use 
    calculations of the operations impairment changes were recorded during the period under review are as follows:

    MTN Sudan was operating in a hyperinflationary economy up to 30 June 2016 while MTN Syria (JSC) continues to 
    operate in a hyperinflationary economy. Hyperinflation accounting resulted in the write up of non-monetary 
    assets and a resulting increase in the carrying value of these operations. The total impairment of property, 
    plant and equipment and intangible assets amounting to R2 815 million and R192 million of the MTN Sudan goodwill 
    impairment for the current period relate to the carrying value previously written up to account for the impact 
    of hyperinflation, exceeding the calculated value in use.

    The goodwill of MTN Sudan and MTN Syria has been fully impaired as at 30 June 2017 and the remaining goodwill 
    in MTN Afghanistan and MTN Yemen amount to R527 million and R1 984 million at 30 June 2017 respectively.

    Prior period impairments
    Areeba Guinea S.A.
    Areeba Guinea S.A. (Conakry) experienced a decline in EBITDA and Guinea-Conakry experienced poor economic 
    performance countrywide. Consequently, a review of the recoverable amount of Conakry was undertaken during 
    2016 subsequent to which an impairment loss amounting to R402 million was recognised. As at 31 December 2016, 
    the goodwill balance relating to Conakry is fully impaired. No further impairments were deemed necessary 
    as at 30 June 2017.

    Afrihost
    Based on an agreement concluded by the Group to sell its 50,02% investment in Afrihost Proprietary Limited 
    (Afrihost) for R325 million, a goodwill impairment loss of R202 million was recognised at 30 June 2016 on 
    the remeasurement of the assets to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets 
    Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The investment was disposed of during the second half of 2016.

13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    Financial instruments at amortised cost
    The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost except for 
    the borrowings and the loan set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values.

    Listed long-term borrowings
    The Group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue which were issued in 
    prior years, with a carrying amount of R23 117 million at 30 June 2017 (June 2016: R11 031 million, 
    December 2016: R24 059 million) and a fair value of R23 036 million (June 2016: R10 731 million 
    December 2016: R23 179 million). The fair values of these instruments are determined by reference to 
    quoted prices in the Irish bond market. The market for these bonds is not liquid and consequently the 
    fair value measurement is categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

    Loan to Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V.
    The Group has a loan to INT with a carrying amount of R2 864 million (June 2016: R2 877 million, 
    December 2016: R2 863 million) and a fair value of R2 982 million (June 2016: R3 373 million, 
    December 2016: R2 969 million). The fair value of this instrument is determined by a discounted cash 
    flow analysis using a market-related interest rate. The fair value measurement is categorised within 
    level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

    Financial instruments measured at fair value
    The fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined as follows: 

    Treasury bills 
    The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to published price quotations in an 
    active market. The Group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R293 million (June 2016: 
    R121 million, December 2016: R282 million) as available for sale and with a carrying amount of R697 million 
    (June 2016: R nil, December 2016: R669 million) as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of 
    these investments is categorised within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

    Fair value measurement of investment in IHS
    Included in investments in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position is an equity 
    investment in IHS Group at fair value of R24 859 million at 30 June 2017. As stated in note 7, the Group 
    increased its interest in IHS Group during the period under review following an exchange of its 51% interest 
    in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. Prior to the increase, the Group reported fair values of R11 240 million and 
    R11 354 million at 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2016 respectively, for the investment classified as available 
    for sale. The fair value at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016 was determined with reference to recent transactions 
    between market participants, consequently the investment was previously categorised within level 2 of the fair 
    value hierarchy. For 30 June 2017, the absence of transactions between market participants resulted in the fair 
    value being determined using models considered to be appropriate by management. The fair value was calculated 
    using an earnings multiple technique and was based on unobservable market inputs including tower industry 
    earnings multiples of between 13x to 17x applied to MTN management estimates of earnings, less estimated 
    net debt.

    Given the confidentiality restrictions in the shareholders' agreement with IHS Group, MTN does not have 
    access to the IHS Group business plans or 2016 actual financial information. Any estimated earnings used to 
    derive the existing fair value are therefore based solely on MTN management, market estimates and assumptions 
    on financial growth, currency movements, costs and performance. The investment has therefore been transferred 
    from level 2 to level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the current reporting period. An increase of one in the 
    low and high end of the multiple range would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of R1 014 million 
    and a decrease of one in the low and high end of the multiple range would have resulted in a decrease in the 
    fair value by R1 014 million as at 30 June 2017. An increase of R817 million (June 2016 and December 2016: 
    R2 672 million) has been recognised for the period under review in other comprehensive income resulting from 
    the change in fair value.

    The table below sets out the reconciliation of financial assets that are measured at fair value based on

    Uncertain tax exposures                                    
    The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and the Group's interpretation and application of the 
    various tax rules applied in direct and indirect tax filings may result in disputes between the Group 
    and the relevant tax authority. The outcome of such disputes may not be favourable to the Group. 
    At period end there were a number of tax disputes ongoing in various of the Group's operating entities, 
    the most significant of which relates to a transfer pricing dispute which the Group is contesting.

    The Group's functional and presentation currency is rand. The strengthening of the closing rate of the rand 
    against the functional currencies of the Group's largest operations contributed to the decrease in the 
    consolidated assets and liabilities and the resulting foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) reduction 
    of R3 866 million (June 2016: R11 077 million, December 2016: R22 907 million) for the current period. 
    Following the exercise of the exchange rights in INT Towers Limited (note 7), a foreign currency translation 
    loss of R3 298 million was released to the condensed consolidated income statement.

    Net investment hedges
    During 2016 and for the period ended 30 June 2017, the Group hedged a designated portion of its dollar net 
    assets in MTN (Dubai) Limited (MTN Dubai) for forex exposure arising between the USD and ZAR as part of the 
    Group's risk management objectives. The Group designated external borrowings (Eurobonds) denominated in USD 
    held by MTN Mauritius with a value of R23 billion (December 2016: R23,1 billion) and external borrowings 
    denominated in USD held by MTN Nigeria Communications Limited with a value of R3,5 billion (December 2016: 
    R4,5 billion) as hedging instruments. For the period of the hedge relationship, foreign exchange movements 
    on these hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency 
    translation reserve (FCTR), offsetting the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income, 
    arising on translation of the designated dollar net assets of MTN Dubai to ZAR. The cumulative forex 
    movement recognised in other comprehensive income will only be reclassified to profit or loss upon loss 
    of control over MTN Dubai. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss during the current 
    or prior period.    

    Nigerian exchange rate
    On 24 April 2017, a new quoted exchange rate window was established in Nigeria, the Nigerian Autonomous 
    Foreign Exchange Fixing (NAFEX). For the current reporting cycle, due to the short time period that has 
    elapsed between the introduction of this rate and period end, the Group has exercised judgement in determining 
    the most appropriate rate to be used to convert foreign denominated balances at period end in Nigeria, and 
    concluded to continue using the Interbank exchange rate for purposes of its interim results. The Group will 
    monitor the market liquidity in these quoted rates going forward in assessing the most appropriate rate at 
    which foreign denominated transactions and balances are to be translated for reporting purposes. The Interbank 
    exchange rate quoted was N325,00:USD1 and the exchange rate quoted in the NAFEX window was approximately 
    N366,41:USD1 as at 30 June 2017. 

19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    Transactions between members of the Group
    Scancom Limited (MTN Ghana) entered into operating lease agreements with Ghana Tower InterCo B.V. The expense 
    recorded amounted to R348 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (June 2016: R313 million, December 2016: 
    R532 million). The rental amounts escalate every year by inflation and the initial term is 10 years, followed 
    by four times five-year renewal periods.

    amounted to R232 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (December 2016: R432 million; June 2016:

    of the exchange right (note 7). The expense recorded from the beginning of the current reporting period to the 
    date of the exercise of the exchange right (note 7) amounted to R464 million (December 2016: R4 254 million; 
    June 2016: R2 502 million). The initial term is 10 years (extended to 15 years in 2016), followed by four times

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2017,
which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Thursday, 3 August
2017.

Following the trading statement published on Friday, 14 July 2017, shareholders are further advised
that MTN expects to report interim 2017 basic headline earnings per share of between 210 cents and
230 cents and basic earnings per share of between 280 cents and 300 cents. This compares with a
headline loss per share of 271 cents and attributable loss per share of 301 cents reported in the prior
comparable period.

The negative performance in the prior comparable period was mainly as a result of non-recurring
costs, including the Nigeria regulatory fine of 474 cents per share (cps) which was fully expensed in
prior periods, professional fees related to the fine of 73 cps and losses of 136 cps from MTN’s 51%
equity interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. mainly as a result of unrealised losses on US dollar-
denominated loans prior to the exercise of the exchange right where MTN exchanged its 51% shares
of Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. for an increased equity stake in IHS.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor
audited by MTN`s external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2017,
which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Thursday, 3 August
2017.

Paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements requires a trading statement to be published
as soon as an issuer and its directors are satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the
financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

Shareholders are therefore advised that MTN expects to report an improvement of at least 20% in
both headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS) for the six-month period ended
30 June 2017, compared with a headline loss per share of 271 cents and attributable loss per share of
301 cents reported in the prior comparable period. The negative performance in the prior year period
was mainly as a result of non-reccurring costs, including the Nigeria regulatory fine of 474 cents per
share (cps), professional fees related to the fine of 73 cps and losses of 136 cps from MTN’s 51% equity
interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. mainly as a result of unrealised losses on US dollar-denominated
loans.

A further trading statement will be issued once the Company obtains a reasonable degree of certainty
as to the likely range within which the HEPS and EPS are expected to be finalised.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor
audited by MTN`s external auditors.

DOWNGRADE OF MTN GROUP LIMITED’S CREDIT RATINGS

In accordance with paragraph 4.26 of the JSE Debt Listings
Requirements, noteholders are hereby advised of the amendment to
MTN’s credit rating effective on 13 June 2017.

Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s” or “the agency”) has
downgraded MTN Group Limited's senior unsecured notes issued by
MTN (Mauritius) Investments Limited to Ba1 from Baa3, and has
assigned MTN Group Limited a Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR)
and a Ba1-PD probability of default rating (PDR) and has
withdrawn MTN Group Limited ’s long-term Baa3 issuer rating. A
stable outlook was assigned.

This rating action follows the weakening of the South African
government’s credit profile, as captured by Moody’s lowering of
the South African sovereign rating to Baa3 from Baa2 on 9 June
2017.

Quarterly update for the period ended 31 March 2017

MTN is a leading emerging market mobile operator, serving approximately 237 million people in 22 countries across
Africa and the Middle East. Our vision is to deliver a bold, new Digital World to our customers.


Highlights
- In March 2017, we completed the evolution of the core senior management team. The new Group president and 
  chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer and chief operating officer are now in place and 
  have settled in, swiftly adjusting to their respective roles while beginning a review of the business to 
  see where further improvements can be made;
- Group total revenue increased by 7,1% with data revenues up 29,4% year-on-year YoY). Data revenue contributed 
  20% to total revenue;
- MTN South Africa reported a solid performance with a 4,1% increase in service revenue;
- MTN Nigeria delivered continued positive operational momentum and reported an 11,6% increase in total revenue;
- MTN Irancell increased total revenue by 19,3% benefiting from encouraging data revenue trends;
- On balance across the majority of our Tier 2 operations we have seen encouraging revenue trends; 
- Voice traffic (billable minutes) increased by 2% and total data traffic by 145%;
- Group subscribers decreased by 1,5% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) largely as a result of restatements to subscriber
  numbers in Ghana, Rwanda and Zambia; and
- Network improvement continued across the Group, particularly in the Nigerian, South African and Iranian operations
  supported by year-to-date capital expenditure at R4 619 million.

All financial growth trends are reported on an organic basis 
YoY - 1Q17 vs 1Q16
QoQ- 1Q17 vs 4Q16

Data revenue refers to access data only
Digital revenue refers to Mobile Money (MoMo) and value added services (VAS) revenue.


MTN Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:

“In the first three months of the year we saw a continuation of the improving operational momentum experienced in the
fourth quarter of 2016. While we still have work to do to meet our full-year targets, we continue to leverage off the
progress made during 2016 and are encouraged by the progress in project IGNITE* in both South Africa and Nigeria. 

The ongoing network investment in Nigeria is delivering continued improvements in data quality in the metro areas and
highlights MTN Group’s commitment to the Nigerian market notwithstanding the challenging macro environment. 

In South Africa we are making progress on tackling our underperformance in the postpaid segment although it will take
time for this to reflect in our financial performance. 

The Group continues to work towards achieving our vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new Digital World to our
customers. We will continue to leverage our scale and enhance our competitive position, benefiting from Africa’s low 
data penetration and the unique opportunity we have to offer our customers a wide range of digital services across 
our markets.

In our key markets of South Africa, Nigeria and Iran significant network investments made over the past few years are
underpinning the improving revenue trends. The network investment planned for 2017 is expected to support further market
share gains across our markets.

While our reported subscriber numbers are lower than we had expected, this is largely the result of an ongoing review
of subscriber definitions. We are planning to further modernise our internal subscriber definitions to more closely
align with the changing mix of revenue streams and will report on this at the end of the first half of 2017.” 

*Project IGNITE is the group transformation initiative designed to optimise operations in South Africa and Nigeria

SEA region comprises South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, Botswana (joint venture), Swaziland (joint venture) and
South Sudan. 
WECA region comprises Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and
Guinea Bissau. 
MENA region comprises Iran (joint venture), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 

SEA REGION

SOUTH AFRICA
MTN South Africa recorded a solid performance in the first quarter with service revenue up 4,1%. This was supported 
by data and digital revenue which increased by 17,8% and 20,3% respectively, while outgoing voice revenue declined 
5,4% YoY as billable minutes declined by 7,5%.

The priorities for the South Africa business remain driving network quality, offering attractive value propositions
and improving the customer experience. In the period we continued our network expansion with 515 LTE sites and 
53 3G sites going live. We now have very strong network performance in three of the four large metro areas 
(Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban) and expect this to support a continued improvement in our net promoter score (NPS).

While subscribers declined in the quarter as a result of traditional seasonality, we remain committed to our net
additions guidance of 630 000. We are encouraged by the progress made in our relationship with our franchise channel 
and this, together with the ongoing systems and process improvements should drive continued improvement in the customer
experience. 

UGANDA
Following a challenging 2016, MTN Uganda experienced a positive first quarter with encouraging revenue trends. 
Mobile Money revenue increased 34,0% and now contributes 22% of total revenue. The introduction of personalised 
voice bundles supported an 11,5% increase in on-net voice revenue.

MTN Uganda reported net additions for the quarter of 312 000. We expect subscriber growth to moderate as a result 
of the change in subscriber registration regulations which now require national identity (ID) numbers to be linked 
to individual subscribers. We have also commenced the process of retrospectively linking the historic subscriber 
base to the national ID system.

SEA excluding South Africa - across the rest of the region the subscriber base remained flat. Uganda, Rwanda and
Swaziland contributed positively, however growth was offset by a decline in subscribers in Zambia, South Sudan 
and Botswana.


WECA REGION

NIGERIA
MTN Nigeria had a strong start to the year with an 11,6% increase in total revenue supported by a 71,3% increase 
in data revenue. Whilst the momentum is encouraging the ongoing review of value added services (VAS) subscribers, 
will put pressure on digital revenue for the balance of the year. 

MTN Nigeria’s subscriber base declined by 2,3% in the quarter. This was impacted by new regulations that require 
all subscriber connections to take place in permanent brick and mortar structures. This led to a marked reduction 
in gross connections across the industry. MTN Nigeria has also continued with the process of excluding subscribers 
whose only activity is receiving incoming SMS.

Despite the challenging economic conditions MTN Nigeria continued to execute on its network rollout plans with 
a particular focus on the data network. This remains a key element in the Group’s medium-term growth strategy.

GHANA
MTN Ghana continued to benefit from the improving macro environment with solid revenue growth benefiting from a
55,2% increase in data revenue. Mobile money was a stand-out performer and now accounts for 13% of MTN Ghana’s 
total revenue. 

MTN Ghana reported a decline in subscribers in the quarter of 2,5 million. This was impacted by the review of
subscriber definitions resulting in the disconnection of 3,4 million subscribers. After adjusting for these net 
additions in the quarter were 893 000.

IVORY COAST
After a tough 2016 in which revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margins 
came under pressure, MTN Ivory Coast saw a marked improvement in the quarter, reporting 9,4% revenue growth. 
Data revenue increased 84,1% while mobile money revenue increased by 32,5%. A significant improvement in NPS 
supported the good progress made in gaining high value subscribers.

The regulator recently introduced rules disallowing differential pricing for on-net and off-net tariffs and
furthermore imposed a significant reduction in leased line prices. This is expected to impact our performance in 
the rest of the year.

CAMEROON
MTN Cameroon experienced a particularly challenging period with the data network shutdown in select areas impacting
all operators in the country. Data revenue growth was constrained to 9,8% as the data network shutdown affected in 
excess of 20% of our subscriber base. Encouragingly, the business was able to restore data services in these regions 
effective 21 March 2017 which should result in some improvement for the rest of the year. Mobile money revenue in 
Cameroon increased 390%.

MTN’s investment in the network over the past few years has delivered positively and MTN Cameroon is today the 
leading operator in terms of network NPS. 

WECA excluding Nigeria - across the rest of the region subscribers declined by 3,6% mainly as a result of the
disconnection of subscribers in Ghana. Ivory Coast, Benin and Guinea Bissau contributed positively to the region’s 
subscriber base.

MENA REGION

IRAN
MTN Irancell saw continued strong revenue momentum in the period with data revenue increasing by 76,7% YoY. 
NPS improved significantly with an improvement in network NPS a key driver. 

Other MENA - across the rest of the region subscribers decreased by 1,4% driven by a decline in Syria, Yemen 
and Afghanistan. Sudan and Cyprus contributed positively to the region’s subscriber base.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based has not been reviewed and reported on by MTN’s
external auditors.

Constant currency (organic) information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates 
on the Group’s results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting year’s 
results have been adjusted to the prior year’s average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly 
exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the Group’s currencies, materially being that of 
the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The organic growth percentage has been calculated based on the current year 
constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, 
MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of 
hyperinflation. In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be a hyperinflationary environment. 
MTN therefore discontinued hyperinflation accounting in that operation effective 1 July 2015. In addition, 
during 2016, Sudan was no longer considered to be a hyperinflationary economy from 1 July 2016 and hyperinflation 
accounting was discontinued from this date onwards.

Note: Certain financial information presented in these annual financial results constitutes pro
forma financial information. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the Group's
board of directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro
forma financial information may not fairly present MTN's financial position, changes in equity,
results of operations or cash flows. An assurance report has been prepared and issued by our joint
auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc. in respect of the pro forma financial
information included in this announcement that is available for inspection at the registered office of
the company.

1. The financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared
   excluding the impact of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill impairment, tower profits, the
   Nigerian regulatory fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered 
   into and the finance costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting of the
   liability) and the MTN Zakhele Futhi impact (consisting of the share-based payment expense, net of the
   deferred tax impact recognised by MTN Zakhele Futhi arising on the capital gain on the investment in MTN)
   and constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the
   segment disclosure included in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
   This pro forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of hyperinflation and
   the relating goodwill impairment, tower profits, the Nigerian regulatory fine (as defined above) and
   the MTN Zakhele Futhi impact (as defined above) from the financial results in order to achieve a
   comparable analysis year on year. Hyperinflation adjustments and the relating goodwill impairment,
   tower profits, the Nigerian regulatory fine (as defined above) and the MTN Zakhele Futhi impact (as
   defined above) have been calculated in terms of the Group accounting policies disclosed in the
   consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
2. Constant currency (""organic"") information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in 
   currency rates on the Group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms,
   the current financial reporting year's results have been adjusted to the prior year's average exchange
   rates determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates which can be found on
   www.mtn.com/investors. The measurement has been performed for each of the Group's currencies, materially 
   being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The organic growth percentage has been calculated based 
   on the current year constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect
   of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has
   been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no
   longer be a hyperinflationary environment. MTN therefore discontinued hyperinflation accounting in
   that operation effective 1 July 2015. In addition, during 2016, Sudan was no longer considered to be 
   a hyperinflationary economy from 1 July 2016 and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this
   date onwards. The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016, 
   and hyperinflation accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016.

*   Constant currency (""organic"") information. 
**  Reported-includes hyperinflation and the relating goodwill impairment, tower profits, the
    Nigerian regulatory fine (as defined above) and the MTN Zakhele Futhi impact (as defined above).
*** The forward-looking financial information disclosed in this results announcement has not been
    reviewed or audited or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

The Group’s results are presented on a regional basis in line with the Group’s new operational
structure. This is comprised of South and East Africa (SEA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) and their respective underlying operations further outlined below.

The SEA region includes: South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint
venture-equity accounted), Swaziland (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA 
region includes: Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea 
Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes: Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, 
Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Cyprus. 

Although Iran, Botswana and Swaziland form part of their respective regions geographically and
operationally, they are excluded from their respective regional results due to being equity accounted
for by the Group.


OVERVIEW
MTN Group’s financial results for 2016 reflect the most challenging year in the company's 22-year
history, precipitated by a number of material regulatory, macro-economic and political challenges
experienced across our regions. However, despite these difficulties, the business began to show
encouraging first signs of a turnaround. 

Following the conclusion of the settlement agreement relating to the Nigerian regulatory fine in
June 2016, the infusion of new senior management and the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) commencing on 13 March 2017, the MTN board of directors (Board) undertook a deep and
fundamental strategic review of the business and its processes to ensure MTN is operating far more
optimally in a complex and difficult operating environment. The outcome of this review illuminated
areas of the business which required urgent attention. It also highlighted the company’s unique 
position in a fast moving industry. As a result, the company embarked on a transformation initiative,
IGNITE, designed to optimise its operations and position the Group most favourably to participate 
in a rapidly evolving sector.

Much of 2016 was consumed with putting in place corrective measures to ensure the delivery of the
company strategy. Towards the end of 2016, our two largest operations and some of the tier two
operations began to show signs of a turnaround following an extended period of underperformance.

As previously reported, MTN South Africa delivered a sub-optimal result in the first six months of
2016, with network, systems and customer service challenges. While all these issues were not fully
resolved during the second half of 2016, MTN South Africa showed strong improvements in network
quality and capacity. The operation significantly increased its net promoter score (NPS) particularly 
in the fourth quarter where it increased its NPS by 8 percentage points (pp) to 81% when compared to
the same period in 2015. MTN South Africa’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation, impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and share of results of joint ventures and 
associates after tax (EBITDA) in the second half of the year increased by 31,0% (excluding the MTN 
Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense) compared to the first six months of the year.

Despite the impact of regulatory challenges and a disadvantaged competitive position in Nigeria,
the result of subscriber disconnections and the withdrawal of regulatory services in the first half
of the year, Nigeria continued to improve its competitive position throughout the year. While revenue
declined 6,3%* in the first quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter in 2015, revenue
growth improved steadily throughout the year and fourth quarter revenue increased by 4,0%* year-on-year
(YoY). This was attributable to improved network quality and attractive value propositions. This
trend continued in early 2017, with revenue in January 2017 up by approximately 16%* YoY as the
business continued to regain lost market share. We expect YoY growth to be maintained for the month of
February 2017***. NPS more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period
in 2015. However, the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar negatively impacted EBITDA
margin and drove US dollar-linked costs higher.

MTN Irancell and MTN Ghana reported a strong performance driven by data revenue growth. MTN
Irancell benefited from the country’s youthful demographics and higher smartphone penetration while 
MTN Ghana’s data revenue growth was attributable to low-cost smartphones sold following the successful
launch of its 4G network. Group data revenue increased 19.7%* YoY contributing 27% of total Group
revenue. This was supported by the Group’s strategic decision to accelerate network investment across 
our markets, particularly South Africa, Nigeria and Iran. This investment will be critical in
supporting the anticipated growth in data revenue.

MTN Uganda, MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast showed improved momentum towards the fourth quarter
of 2016 following a competitive environment and subscriber registration challenges in the first half
of the year.

Group revenue was negatively impacted by the depreciation of the rand against the US dollar as
well as lower-than-expected top-line growth in Nigeria and South Africa. Revenue increased marginally
to R146 894 million while organic revenue increased 2,9%*. 

The Group’s NPS improved from 24% in December 2015 to 35% in December 2016, closing the gap with
its competitors. This was mainly driven by improvement on the network, value offerings and brand
image.

The Group reported a number of once-off costs, which negatively impacted Group EBITDA. These 
costs include the Nigerian regulatory fine of R10 499 million**; professional fees related to 
the settlement of the Nigerian regulatory fine of R1 324 million**; MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based 
payment expense of R1 008 million**; the impairment of property, plant and equipment in South 
Sudan of R295 million (R2 679 million*) and Project Winback, relating to the reconnection of 
subscribers in Nigeria of R530 million**. As a result of these once-off costs, EBITDA declined 
by 31,1%** to R40 751 million**. Excluding the impact of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill 
impairment, tower profits, the Nigerian regulatory fine and the MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based 
payment expense, EBITDA declined 13,2%. 

Reported basic headline earnings per share (HEPS) declined by 110%** to a loss of 77 cents**. 
This was significantly impacted by the Nigerian regulatory fine, which had a 500 cents negative 
impact on HEPS. 455 cents was non-recurring and 45 cents related to the interest unwind of the fine. 
In addition, HEPS was negatively impacted by:
- Foreign exchange losses of 329 cents;
- Losses from MTN’s 51% equity interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., of 122 cents mainly as a
  result of unrealised foreign exchange losses on US dollar-denominated loans (non-recurring from 
  1 February 2017 when MTN exchanged its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., for an increased 
  stake in IHS Holdings Limited, now at approximately 29%);
- The MTN Zakhele Futhi impact of 88 cents;
- Professional fees related to the settlement of the Nigerian regulatory fine of 73 cents
  (non-recurring);
- Losses from our investments in Digital Group, mainly including Africa Internet Holdings (AIH),
  Middle East Internet Holdings (MEIH) and Iran Internet Group (IIG) of 39 cents; and
- Hyperinflation of 37 cents.

MTN repatriated R6 308 million (EUR425 million) from MTN Irancell up to 31 December 2016, being the
entire amount due under the loan advanced for the licence fee in 2005. Subsequent to year end, the
operational dividends of the last five years presently due to MTN were paid by MTN Irancell totalling
EUR468 million. This brings the total repatriation to EUR893 million. In 2015, MTN converted a portion
of the dividends due to an interest-bearing loan, totalling EUR135 million (at the 2016 year end
closing exchange rate). This loan is due for settlement on 30 September 2017. This will substantially
close the matter on the long outstanding payments due from MTN Irancell.

In addition, to meet our ongoing capex and working capital requirements we successfully refinanced
maturing facilities and secured additional long-term financing facilities from local and international 
sources, including a US$1 billion international debt capital market issuance. This activity aided in 
diversifying our sources of funding, improving our debt maturity profile and giving us access
to sufficient liquidity to speedily respond to the ongoing needs of the business.

OUR OPERATING CONTEXT
In 2016, the Group continued to operate in a challenging environment. Global economic growth
slowed, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where many countries rely on commodity exports. At the 
end of 2016, the oil price was 50% higher than at the same time a year earlier. Nigeria is yet to 
reap the full benefit of the stronger price. Iran, however, did benefit from the firmer price and 
higher crude output and exports, with the economy growing 4,5% in 2016 from 0,8% in 2015. 
In South Africa, gross domestic product (GDP) was broadly flat at 2015’s levels.

Weak economic conditions across our footprint resulted in volatile currencies, precipitating
higher foreign-denominated expenses as well as forex losses for the Group in the reporting period. 
The contraction of the Nigerian economy impacted consumer spending in that country, and had a knock-on
effect on the rest of West Africa, notably Cameroon and Benin.

Many governments implemented policy changes in response to lower commodity revenues, and
regulatory pressures continued to increase. SIM-card registration requirements, additional taxes in 
some markets and the obligation to list and/or localise subsidiaries were also features of the year. 
In South Africa, there were further delays in the awarding of spectrum and in Nigeria, the regulator's
2013 ruling declaring MTN a 'dominant operator' and the consequential restrictions continued to impact
our commercial success. 

In the quarterly update for the period ended 30 September 2016 published on SENS on 24 October 2017 
MTN advised shareholders that the Central Bank of Nigeria instructed various banks in Nigeria to
suspend any remittance of dividends by MTN Nigeria Communications Limited, until further notice. 
MTN is pleased to advise that the Central Bank of Nigeria has now lifted the aforesaid suspension. 

The industry continued its rapid evolution in both the traditional connectivity business as well
as in non-traditional businesses such as mobile financial services and content-based services.
Competition in the price of voice and data services intensified as economies were under pressure 
and more consumers used over-the-top services. This depressed traditional revenue streams. 

IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO DELIVER ON STRATEGY 
With a settlement agreement having been reached with the Nigerian regulatory authority in respect
of the fine, MTN spent much of 2016 implementing corrective measures to facilitate the delivery of
an effective and efficient strategy. We embarked on a wide-ranging strategic review of our operations
and processes to ensure that we execute our strategy far more optimally. The outcome of the review
prompted us to focus on four key areas: 
- our transformation initiative; 
- accelerating the growth of new revenue streams; 
- finalising the appointment of senior management; and
- including a more diverse skill set on the Board. 

The launch of IGNITE - our transformation initiative 
At the end of 2016, we launched IGNITE - our transformation initiative, starting with our two
biggest operations, MTN South Africa and MTN Nigeria. IGNITE is about shaping the future of MTN, by
proactively introducing special measures to accelerate our business and financial performance. These
measures, which have aggressive targets, will make our organisation more agile, and our business more
sustainable, efficient, innovative and profitable. IGNITE will be rolled out progressively to all
operations. The programme will ensure a well-coordinated approach throughout MTN, enabling operations
to execute their mandates effectively and deliver excellence in customer experience and value
propositions.

Through IGNITE, we aim to:
- create a path to accelerate our revenue growth;
- translate a greater percentage of our revenue into EBITDA and profit;
- improve the quality and effectiveness of our processes;
- deploy our capital more effectively;
- use more advanced data analytics to better inform our decision making, particularly around
  customers and network deployment;
- accelerate the diversification of revenue streams;
- focus on customer experience; and 
- ensure these changes are sustainable by striking the right balance between performance and the
  health of our organisation.

Our new Group transformation office is overseeing transformation offices in South Africa, Nigeria
and globally, ensuring the implementation of all related initiatives and enablers, and reporting
directly to a Group transformation board, chaired by the President and CEO.

Digital 
We recorded strong growth of 44,2% in digital services revenue, supported by our lifestyle and
mobile financial services offerings. MTN Mobile Money accounts for 20,2% of total digital revenue. 
MTN Games Club, our premium gaming proposition, grew significantly in the three largest markets 
and is now active in nine markets with a total of 5,4 million subscribers. We continued to be a 
leading distributor of digital music in Africa: our music streaming product recorded 4,0 million 
paying subscribers.

The number of MTN Mobile Money registered customers grew by 18,4% to 41 million, supported by a
strong performance from MTN Ghana and MTN Benin. The number of 30-day active customers increased 
by 55,3% to 15,4 million across 15 countries. MTN Mobile Money revenue increased by 50,7%* to 
R2 829 million off the 2015 base. Five operations (compared to two in 2015) had over a million 
active customers each. This is a critical tipping point for the product. We continued to focus 
on advanced financial services such as remittances (28 corridors have been established), micro-lending 
and savings offerings. We launched MoKash, an extension to the MTN Mobile Money wallet, in Uganda and 
Zambia, where there are over 1,5 million registered customers. Loans are financed by our lending 
partner the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) and the role of MTN is to market, originate and disburse 
the loans and collect the loan repayments using MTN Mobile Money. After launching in Uganda in 
August 2016, over 140 000 loans were disbursed in the month of December 2016. We are planning further 
pilots in Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Ghana. At year end, we had approximately 74 000 active MTN Mobile 
Money financial services agents in Uganda. Monthly airtime sales through the MTN wallet peaked in 
December 2016, demonstrating a lower cost distribution channel for core products. 

Ayo, our joint venture with MMI Holdings Limited, soft launched two mobile micro-lending products
in Uganda in the year.

Jumia (the unified brand of our e-commerce joint ventures AIH) and MEIH, experienced slower growth
in the Africa business largely on the back of Nigeria’s slowing economy. Despite this, by entering
new markets like Morocco and Ivory Coast, it was able to deliver nominal growth. MEIH continued to
exhibit double-digit monthly percentage growth in revenue and customer numbers across all business
lines. Unit economics in both AIH and MEIH continued to improve. In the year, Jumia recorded
approximately 3,2 million customers, 5,9 million transactions and 2,8 million leads on its classifieds
business, which expanded to eight new countries. MEIH, made up of seven companies in the Middle East, 
had approximately 600 000 customers and 3,3 million transactions during the period. 

Iran Internet Group (IIG), our Iranian e-commerce business that has become the largest business 
of its kind in Iran, gained strong momentum. It showed very strong growth across its portfolio 
of e-commerce companies, expanding 40 times in the period under review. Zoodfood, a restaurant 
delivery service app, grew by 400% in 2016 to achieve 85% market share. Snapp, a taxi hailing app 
with 85% market share, and an average of approximately 150 000 rides a day. It is the largest 
e-commerce company in Iran by revenue, in spite of being active only in Tehran. Expansion to other 
cities is currently under way. Bamilo, Iran’s largest online mall and marketplace, grew 60% in the 
fourth quarter of 2016. It has over 250 000 stock keeping units and hosts 1 500 merchants with 
online stores.

The TravelStart business, in which MTN acquired a 39,2% indirect interest through Amadeus,
recorded 560 000 bookings from 800 000 clients during the period.

MTN continues to bolster its compliance framework associated with our financial services business.

Enterprise Business Unit (EBU)
Operating in a tough economic environment, customers focused on optimising operational
efficiencies, which resulted in a consolidation of accounts. However, this presented opportunities 
for our EBU to explore and generate new revenues. In line with the Group strategy to accelerate growth 
in this area, we appointed a new executive head of Group EBU, Oliver Fortuin, who joined MTN on 1 March 2017.
Oliver will assist to formulate a more competitive business strategy for this area.

Investments in towers
During January 2017, MTN exchanged its 51% share of Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. (the parent of
Nigerian telecoms tower operator INT Towers Limited) for an increased stake in IHS Holdings Limited
(IHS). MTN’s stake in IHS increased to approximately 29% from approximately 15%. IHS is the largest
independent tower operator in Africa and the Middle East with over 23 000 towers. This transaction
enables MTN to simplify its tower ownership structure and diversify its exposure to tower infrastructure
across the IHS Group. Through this transaction (and with effect from 1 February 2017), MTN will no
longer equity account for INT. In addition, this exchange allows MTN to benefit economically from its
previously owned passive infrastructure and continued network investment. 

Senior management changes
In the year, we appointed a number of new senior executives with the requisite skills to take MTN
into a new growth phase. We also reinstated the regional vice president positions to ensure an extra
layer of regional, operational and governance oversight. These appointments position the Group to
capitalise on its many prospects and reach its full potential in a rapidly transforming and exciting
sector. At an opco level, we reviewed structures, introducing the position of chief operating
officer in our large opcos to ensure that increased operational oversight and coordination between
commercial and technical teams is enhanced, allowing country CEOs to focus on stakeholder matters. 

At a Group level, the MTN executive committee is made up of:
- Phuthuma Nhleko, who is executive chairman in an interim capacity and will hand over to the
  incoming Group President and CEO, Rob Shuter, on 13 March 2017, after which Phuthuma will revert

their valuable contribution over the years.

PROSPECTS
The MTN Group continues to work towards achieving our vision of “leading the delivery of a bold,
new Digital World to our customers”. Despite the recent disruptions in the markets in which we
operate, Africa is still expected to be a key growth region over the medium to long term. MTN’s 
unique position in Africa and the changes made in 2016 provide a solid platform for the Group to 
realise its vision.

The management team will continue to execute on IGNITE, focusing mainly on the transformation of
MTN’s operating model and accelerating growth of new revenue streams. With a strengthened management
team in place and new initiatives embarked upon, we are confident and are resolved to enhance our
competitive position across our markets and meet the aggressive targets set. 

New revenue streams, particularly digital services, are expected to increase their contribution
over the next 18 months, supported by a more focused approach and the process initiated to establish
an advanced analytics unit. We expect our e-commerce joint ventures with AIH, MEIH and IIG to
continue strong growth in customers and revenue, with improving unit economies. While AIH and 
MEIH are expected to be impacted by a slowing economy and the associated volatility of currencies 
in Nigeria and Egypt, IIG is expected to benefit from improving GDP growth.

Our extensive capex investments made over the past two years across our operations will enable the
business to provide superior customer experience and competitive data network. This will support
the increasing demand for data and digital services. 

MTN Nigeria continues to make progress with its preparations to list MTN Nigeria shares on the
Nigerian Stock Exchange. In addition to setting up a management task team, MTN Nigeria has appointed 
a lead issuing house, joint transaction advisors, global coordinators and legal advisors. While MTN
remains committed to the listing, it is subject to suitable market conditions, macro-economic
conditions. The listing is also subject to securing the appropriate approvals and certainty from 
relevant regulators and other stakeholders.

MTN Ghana is working with relevant regulators on its localisation transaction, which is expected
to be completed during the course of 2017.

In Nigeria, we expect to further improve our competitive position despite a weaker economic
environment. Network quality remains a priority. This improvement in competitive position, improved
network quality and capacity, smartphone penetration and increased focus on new revenue streams are
expected to support upper single-digit top-line growth***. We will continue to work closely with 
vendors to alleviate the current challenges with regard to the availability of US dollars. We expect 
the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar to negatively impact the EBITDA margin in 2017 
and 2018***. However, IGNITE initiatives to be implemented over the next two years will partly 
offset the drag on reported EBITDA by 15 to 20% by 2018***.

We anticipate a positive growth trend in South Africa. In 2017, we expect mid-single-digit revenue
growth and EBITDA margin expansion of between 50 and 100 basis points (bp) YoY*** supported by a
strong focus on customer service, improved billing, significantly improved network quality, capacity
and speed. A stronger network will facilitate greater customer retention. Cost optimisation and
outsourcing of non-core functions will also support EBITDA growth. Through IGNITE, we expect an
improvement in reported EBITDA of the 2016 base of between 15% and 20% by the end of 2018***.

Going forward, the repatriation of monies from MTN Irancell is expected to be normalised. We
expect growth in the Iranian economy (following the easing of sanctions) to offer significant
opportunities to expand our services, particularly in the digital space, and to benefit further 
from MTN’s strong position and the country’s youthful population. 

We will continue to review infrastructure investment opportunities, including Iran. 

DIVIDENDS
The Board has declared a second half dividend of 450 cents per share, which will bring the 
total dividend for 2016 to 700 cents per share. At the discretion of the Board and taking into
consideration market conditions, the Board anticipates declaring a total dividend of 700 cents 
per share*** during FY2017. The expected FY2017 dividend takes into consideration the continued 
uncertainty of the regulatory environments and dollar liquidity situation across many of our 
markets as well as the interest of the company’s shareholders and lenders.

(1) Represents the exclusion of the impact of hyperinflation and related goodwill impairment 
    for certain of the Group’s subsidiaries (MTN Syria, MTN South Sudan and MTN Sudan) and the 
    Group’s joint venture in Iran, being accounted for on a hyperinflationary basis in accordance 
    with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the respective financial statement 
    line items affected. During 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be 
    hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued effective 1 July 2015. 
    The economy of Sudan was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2016 and
    hyperinflation accounting was discontinued from this date onwards.
    The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016 and
    hyperinflation accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016.
 
(2) Represents the exclusion of the financial impact relating to the sale of tower assets during
    the financial year on the respective financial line items impacted, which include: 
    - Tower sale profits for the year related to the Ghana release of deferred profit of R31 million
    (2015: Nigeria tower profit of R8 233 million and Ghana release of deferred gain of R30 million). 

(3) Represents the IFRS 2 Share based payment impact of MTN Zakhele Futhi. MTN made a public offer
    of ordinary shares to qualifying BEE investors. The Group recognised an IFRS 2 Share-based payment
    expense of R1 008 million and a tax expense of R593 million. The deferred tax expense is recognised
    by MTN Zakhele Futhi mainly in respect of the capital gain on the investment in MTN and is not
    eliminated on consolidation.

(4) Represents the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine subsequent to conclusion of the
    settlement agreement during 2016 on the respective financial line items impacted, which include: 
    - The re-measurement impact when the settlement agreement was entered into on 10 June 2016,
    constituting the difference between the balance of the provision recorded on this date (after 
    taking into account finance cost accrued from the beginning of the financial year up to 9 June 2016) 
    and the present value of the financial liability arising on this date in accordance with IFRS 
    (included in the EBITDA line);
    - The finance cost impact recognised as a result of the unwind of the discounting of the provision
    (for the period from 1 January to 9 June 2016) and the financial liability (for the period from 
    10 June 2016 to reporting date).

##  Additional depreciation from hyperinflation adjustments related to the unwind of Sudan assets
    historically written up. R223 million of the goodwill impairment recognised in relation to MTN Syria
    relates to the previously recorded hyperinflation uplift.

REVENUE
Group revenue increased marginally to R146 894 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the
depreciation of the rand and the significant depreciation of the naira against the US dollar, 
particularly in the second half of 2016 (average exchange rate for the period). The average naira 
depreciated by 19% against the US dollar and was 36% down against the US dollar at 31 December 2016 
when compared to 2015. The average rand weakened by 16% against the US dollar, 6% against the 
Iranian rial, 10% against the Ghanaian cedi, 14% against the Central African franc, 8% against 
the Ugandan shilling and 9% against the Sudanese pound. The rand, however, strengthened 17% against 
the Nigerian naira and 50% against the Syrian pound.

On an organic basis, Group revenue increased by 2,9%*. WECA’s revenue decreased by 0,3%* and
remained the largest contributor to total Group revenue at 55% at the end of December 2016. 
SEA grew revenue by 7,9%* and contributed 36% to total Group revenue while MENA increased revenue 
by 3,8%* to contribute 10% to total Group revenue.

MTN’s top line was negatively impacted by a decline in revenue in Nigeria (down 1,4%*), Cameroon
(down 6,7%*), Ivory Coast (down 2,0%*) and Uganda (down 1,9%*). This was mainly as a result of
regulatory challenges including the disconnection of subscribers as well as aggressive competition 
in the first half of the year. However, these declines were partly offset by growth of 4,7% and 
19,8%* in revenue in South Africa and Ghana respectively. MTN South Africa’s increase was driven 
by higher handset sales and data revenue, which benefited from improved network quality, particularly 
in the second half. MTN Sudan and MTN Syria also made a contribution to total Group revenue growth, 
and increased their revenue by 18,8%* and 20,3%* respectively.

Total outgoing voice revenue declined 3,6%* to contribute 55% to total Group revenue and incoming
voice revenue declined 2,3%* and contributed 9% to total Group revenue. While average voice traffic
decreased 1,7%, the Group US dollar effective voice tariff in constant currency terms declined
14,3%*. This was largely due to price competition across markets and a tough economic environment.

Data revenue increased by 19,7%* to contribute 27% to total Group revenue. Data revenue growth was
supported by strong growth in most markets benefiting from significantly improved 3G and LTE
network quality. Data traffic increased 143% while the effective data tariff declined 56,1%* (in 
constant currency US dollar terms). Digital revenue contributed 36% to total Group data revenue. 
This was supported by increased smartphone penetration and our expanded digital services offerings 
in the year.

Device revenue increased 21,5%* and contributed 6% to total Group revenue. The remaining 4% of
total Group revenue comprised SMS and other revenue. SMS revenue decreased 20,0%*. 

COSTS
Group operating costs excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine, hyperinflation, tower
profits and the MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense, increased 9,8% to R94 913 million. 

On an organic basis, total Group costs increased by 17,7%*. Once-off costs included in organic
EBITDA include professional fees of R1 324 million** incurred, relating to the negotiations that 
led to the reduction of R34 billion in the Nigerian regulatory fine, Project Winback costs, relating 
to the reconnection of subscribers in Nigeria of R535 million* and a property, plant and equipment 
(PPE) impairment charge in South Sudan of R2 679 million*.

WECA increased its costs by 11,4%* and contributed 50% to total Group costs while SEA increased
its costs by 23,5%* and contributed 38% to total Group costs. MENA increased costs by 2,1%* and
contributed 10% to total Group costs. Head office costs contributed 2% to total Group costs.

The increase in total costs was mainly as a result of foreign-denominated expenses following the
depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar, particularly in MTN Nigeria where costs
increased 15,1%*. MTN South Africa costs were 5,4% higher as a result of higher subsidies on devices
mainly in the first half of the year as well as costs associated with aggressive network rollout and
increased staff costs. 

Total direct network operating costs increased 34,7%* and contributed 25% to total costs. This was
due to the increase in the number of sites rolled out as well as the US dollar-linked tower leasing
costs incurred in Nigeria. Device costs increased by 15,2%* and contributed 13% to total costs
mainly driven by South Africa’s increase in device sales. Interconnect and roaming costs increased 
5,2%* and contributed 14% to total costs, while staff costs increased 11,8%* and contributed 10% to 
total Group costs. Selling, distribution and marketing costs increased by 6,5%* and contributed 20% 
to total Group costs. This was due to an increase in digital services revenue share agreements entered
into with content providers and increased marketing spend in South Africa. Government and regulatory
costs declined 6,9%* and contributed 5% to total Group costs, while other operating costs increased
41,8%* and contributed 14% to total Group costs. Other operating expenses include the impairment of
PPE in South Sudan of R2 679 million* and professional fees incurred at a headoffice level mainly
relating to the negotiation of the settlement of the Nigerian regulatory fine.

We expect to improve cost optimisation through IGNITE initiatives over the next two years.

EBITDA
Group EBITDA decreased 13,2% to R51 981 million while EBITDA on an organic basis declined 18,5%*.
WECA EBITDA declined by 13,6%* and contributed 64% to total EBITDA. SEA’s EBITDA decreased by 
23,9%* and contributed 32% to EBITDA while MENA increased EBITDA by 7,5%* and contributed 9% to 
total EBITDA. Head office negatively impacted EBITDA by 4,0%.

Organic EBITDA was negatively impacted by once-off costs, foreign-denominated expenses in MTN 
Nigeria and device costs in MTN South Africa. Total Group EBITDA was supported by MTN Ghana (up
21,8%*), MTN Syria (up more than 100%*) and MTN Sudan (up 9,6%*). This was attributable to positive 
revenue growth and good cost optimisation.

Excluding the impact of the Nigerian fine, tower profits, MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based expense
and hyperinflation, the Group recorded a 5,5 pp decline in its EBITDA margin to 35,4%.

DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
Depreciation increased by 7,0% (8,2%*) to R20 483 million, impacted by the aggressive capex
programme in 2015. Amortisation costs increased by 27,5% (31,7%*) to R4 684 million, driven by 
higher spend on software in previous years. Impairment of goodwill consisted of impairments in 
Guinea Conakry (R402  million**), Afrihost (R202 million**) and MTN Syria (R269 million**).

NET FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs amounted to R9 679 million compared to R3 005 million in the previous year. This
was mainly due to an increase in net foreign exchange losses to R5 990 million from R1 409 million
in the prior period and an increase in net interest paid to R3 689 million from R1 596 million paid
in the previous period. The increase in the net interest expense is due to the higher net debt of
R51 902 million** compared to R31 635 million** reported in the previous period. 
Net foreign exchange losses include:
- Forex losses in Mauritius of R2 102 million mainly due to the foreign-denominated Iran
  receivables; 
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R1 786 million incurred on US dollar-denominated third-party
  borrowings and payables;
- Forex losses of R819 million in Sudan on foreign-denominated third-party funding and payables;
  and 
- Forex losses of R626 million in South Sudan as a result of US dollar-denominated third-party
  trade payables.

SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES AFTER TAX
Joint ventures and associates reported a loss of R127 million** compared to a gain of 
R1 226 million** in the previous year. This included a charge of R1 853 million incurred by 
our operation in Iran, mainly relating to the subsequent depreciation and amortisation of previously 
hyper-inflated assets that were historically written up under hyperinflation reporting. Losses of 
R2 227 million from MTN’s 51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V were mainly a result of the 
foreign exchange unrealised losses (R2 254 million) incurred on US dollar-denominated loans. 
Short-term losses from Digital Group, mainly AIH, MEIH and IIG, of R706 million also contributed 
to the overall loss.

TAXATION
The effective tax rate increased to 42,4% from 32,6% in the previous year, impacted by lower
profit before tax along with the effects of: Disallowance of deferred tax credits on assessed losses 
in MTN South Sudan and MTN Guinea Conakry; unproductive interest in MTN Holdings and MTN Mauritius;
education tax in MTN Nigeria; additional tax in MTN Ghana, MTN Syria and MTN Yemen; goodwill impairment
in MTN Guinea Conakry, MTN Syria and Afrihost as well as the effects of withholding taxes incurred.
The Group’s reported taxation charge decreased by 26,3%** (27,5%*) to R8 346 million for the
period. This was a result of lower current tax due to lower profit before tax in 2016, lower withholding
tax due to lower dividends up-streamed via MTN Mauritius and a higher deferred tax credit as a
result of an assessed loss and foreign tax credit in MTN Mauritius.

EARNINGS/LOSSES
The Group reported a basic headline loss per share of 77 cents** largely impacted by the Nigerian
regulatory fine. Excluding this impact in both years, HEPS declined 63,2% to 423 cents. The
attributable loss per share was 144 cents**, from attributable earnings per share of 1 109 cents 
in the prior year.

CASH FLOW
Cash inflows from operations decreased by 3,3% to R55 681 million**. This was mainly as a result
of the Nigeria payment on the regulatory fine of R5 870 million, which was offset by an increase in
working capital movements. Dividend payments of R19 792 million to equity holders, dividend payments
of R1 178 million** to minorities and tax payments of R11 704 million** also affected cash flows.
Group cash capex amounted to R35 247 million** and included the purchase of a 4G licence and spectrum
in Ghana (R973 million), a LTE and fibre licence in Congo-Brazzaville (R266 million) and a Nigeria
spectrum licence (R1 396 million).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capex increased 19,6% (28,7%*) to R34 920 million, of which R2 654 million was related to foreign
currency movements.

FINANCIAL POSITION
Net debt increased to R51 902 million** compared to net debt of R31 635 million** reported at the
end of December 2015. The Group reported a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1,01 excluding the Nigerian
regulatory fine. The net debt position at the end of the year was mainly impacted by the following:
- Nigeria regulatory fine payment of R5 870 million**;
- Dividend paid to minority shareholders of R1 178 million**;
- An increase in cash capital expenditure and licences of R35 247 million**;
- Investments made mainly in Amadeus (TravelStart), the Autopage acquisition, and cash paid to 
  AIH on capital calls of R1 867 million**.

  
OPERATIONAL REVIEW:
SEA
- Subscribers increased by 3,6% to 54,7 million
- Revenue increased by 7,9%*
- Data revenue increased by 14,5%*

South Africa
- Subscribers increased by 0,6% to 30,8 million
- Revenue increased by 4,7%
- Service revenue increased by 1,9%
- Data revenue increased by 11,4%
- EBITDA margin declined by 0,5 pp to 32,9%

MTN South Africa showed a positive turnaround in the second half of the year, benefiting from
improved 3G and LTE network quality and aggressive sales of smartphones. The operation’s subscriber 
base increased by 0,6% to 30,8 million, driven by the pre-paid segment, which increased its base 
by 0,9% to 25,6 million. The number of post-paid subscribers declined by 1,1% to 5,2 million, largely
impacted by network quality challenges experienced, systems and customer service issues in the first 
half of 2016.

Total revenue increased by 4,7% to R41 922 million mainly as a result of device revenue. Service
revenue, which excludes device revenue, increased by 1,9% for the period, driven by good growth in
data revenue. Data revenue increased by 11,4%, contributing 34% to total revenue. The number of
smartphones on the network increased by 15,3% (December 2015: 9,1 million restated to align to the 
Group definition) to 10,5 million while the number of megabytes per user increased 46,7% for the 
period. 

Digital revenue gained momentum and contributed 16% to data revenue. This was attributable to
local and international content. 

MTN South Africa’s EBITDA margin declined by 0,5 pp to 32,9%. This was impacted by foreign
exchange losses on the cost of devices, as well as an increase in the number of smartphones and the 
change in the device mix from 2G to 3G and LTE. This was further impacted by costs related to the 
expansion of our 3G and LTE network and increased marketing costs. However, the operation reported 
a 5,4 pp improvement in EBITDA margin in the second half of 2016 versus the first half.

Capex increased by 1,3% to R11 085 million for the year, and retained a strong focus on 3G and LTE
network investment. The operation rolled out 1 134 co-located 3G sites and 1 538 LTE sites. MTN
South Africa’s net promoter score (NPS) gained significantly in the fourth quarter of the year 
compared to the first half, increasing by 8 pp, mainly driven by value and service. Fibre to the 
home connections remain a priority with approximately 13 000 homes passed for the period. In addition, 
the Smart Village acquisition was completed in December 2016, adding 22 000 homes passed to the network 
with approximately 7 000 homes connected.

Other SEA-across the rest of the region the number of subscribers increased by 7,7% to 24,0 million, 
largely the result of a solid recovery in MTN Uganda’s subscriber growth in the second half of
the year.

MTN Uganda increased its subscriber base by 18,1% to 10,5 million. This was mainly attributable to
the reconnection of previously disconnected subscribers, who were disconnected during the
subscriber registration process in the second half of 2015. The performance was supported by new 
acquisitions on the all-net call per second price plan, segmented value propositions and a decline 
in churn. Market share grew to 53,3% from 51,1%.

Total revenue declined by 1,9%*, led lower by a decrease in outgoing and incoming voice revenue.
This was mainly impacted by the disconnection of subscribers in 2015 as well as the East African
Community’s One Network Area, which means that all calls between member countries are billed as 
though they were local. Data revenue increased by 18,8%* and contributed 34% to total revenue. 
This was supported by attractive data bundles with increased data usage, below-the-line campaigns 
and a LTE SIM swap campaign to drive LTE adoption and penetration. 

Digital revenue contributed 71% to data revenue, supported mainly by mobile financial service
revenue. E-commerce products, such as mobile advertising, and MTN Class which is a value-added 
service product in education, also contributed positively to digital revenue. The number of MTN 
Mobile Money active customers increased 12,4% to 4,1 million, as a result mainly of the introduction 
of savings and loan products. The launch of MoKash recorded approximately one million customers 
in under six months.

MTN Uganda’s EBITDA margin decreased by 4,9 pp to 29,6%, impacted by once-off subscriber
registration costs and an inventory impairment charge as well as higher maintenance and tower 
leasing costs.

Capex decreased by 23,7%* to R758 million. During the period, 375 co-located 3G and 110 LTE sites
were rolled out. These sites were rolled out as upgrades to existing sites, which will provide
future cost efficiencies as well as improving the quality and capacity on the network. NPS increased 
3,5 pp in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 11,7% in the same quarter of 2015.

MTN Nigeria showed a meaningful improvement in the second half following regulatory challenges
earlier in the year. The operating environment continued to be difficult with the contraction 
of the economy impacting consumer spending. However, we increased our subscriber base by 1,2% to 
62,0 million, and grew our market share to 48,0% from 44,8%. This was mainly due to the 
reconnection of previously disconnected subscribers as well as the aggressive drive to secure 
new connections with the MTN StartPack tariff plan. MTN Nigeria was voted the Most Valued Brand 
in Nigeria for 2016 in the Top 50 Brands Survey measured on key indicators such as customers’ 
brand awareness, network quality, market category leadership, innovation, spread and corporate

customised data offerings, the quality of the LTE network and the introduction of new data bundle 
plans, which allows eligible customers to borrow data on credit and pay it back at their next 
recharge. The number of smartphones on the network increased by 36,1% to 20,4 million.

than 100%* to R8 701 million, focused on LTE rollout. MTN Nigeria more than doubled its NPS in the

propositions, which contributed to its market share expanding to 56,4% from 52,2% at 31 December 2015.

Total revenue increased by 19,8%*, largely attributable to solid growth in data, outgoing voice
revenue and digital lifestyle-based services. Data revenue grew by 65,7%* and contributed 42% to 
total revenue, driven by expansion of network quality and coverage, increased distribution and 
marketing of low-cost smartphones, the introduction of higher spectrum technology and falling 
tariffs. There has been uptake in data usage supported by lifestyle bundles, specifically for 
social networks access, as well as new data bundles introduced with the launch of 4G. The number 
of smartphones on the network increased by 64,4% to 5,3 million.

lifestyle-based services, rich video and MTN Music. MTN Mobile Money active subscribers increased by
79,4% to 5,7 million, supported by strong regional innovation and marketing.

and utilities, impacted by the depreciation of the cedi and high inflation. The operation continued 
to successfully implement cost control initiatives.

subscriber registration campaigns as well as a reduction in churn following retention campaigns. 

Total revenue decreased by 6,7%* because of a decline in outgoing voice revenue, impacted in turn
by a decrease in the effective tariff as well as free minutes used in relation to the subscriber
registration process and below-the-line activities. This was offset by a 25,9%* increase in data
revenue that contributed 19% to total revenue, supported by an increase in data usage due to higher 
sales of specific data bundles. The expansion of 3G and LTE networks supported data growth. The number 
of smartphones on the network for the period was 1,3 million.

experience. During the period the operation rolled out 463 co-located 3G sites and 267 LTE sites.

MTN Ivory Coast increased its subscriber base by 13,6% to 9,5 million mainly as a result of strong
churn management. 

Total revenue decreased by 2,0%* because of lower outgoing voice revenue impacted by a drop in the
effective tariff. This was partially offset by an 18,4%* increase in data revenue, which
contributed 19% to total revenue. This was mainly as a result of increased data usage supported 
by WiMax swaps to LTE, residential offerings as well as LTE time division duplex (TDD) devices. 
The number of smartphones on the network increased by over 100% to 2,1 million. The increase in 
the net promoter score was largely as a result of the Perfect 10 initiative launched in the 
operation to boost customer experience.

debts.

4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   The Group has adopted all new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International 
   Accounting Standards Boards (IASB) which were effective for the Group from 1 January 2016, none of which had 
   a material impact on the Group.
   
5. HYPERINFLATION
   The financial statements of the Group entities whose functional currencies are the currencies of hyperinflationary 
   economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the year.

   The economy of Sudan was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary effective 1 July 2016 and hyperinflation 
   accounting was discontinued from this date onwards.

   The economy of South Sudan was assessed to be hyperinflationary effective 1 January 2016 and hyperinflation 
   accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2016. Upon first application of hyperinflation, prior 
   period losses of R123 million arising from the net monetary position have been recognised directly in equity. 
   As at 31 December 2016, the property, plant and equipment of South Sudan was fully impaired, resulting in no 
   hyperinflation adjustment on capital expenditure (CAPEX).

   In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was 
   discontinued effective 1 July 2015. The Group's results from Iran includes expenses resulting from discontinuation 
   of hyperinflation accounting mainly relating to the subsequent depreciation of assets that were historically written 
   up under hyperinflation accounting. The additional income statement charge reduced equity accounted earnings from 
   Iran by R1 853 million (2015: R1 768 million).

   The impact of hyperinflation on the segment analysis is as follows:

6. SEGMENT ANALYSIS
   The Group has identified reportable segments that are used by the Group executive committee (chief operating 
   decision maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The reportable 
   segments are grouped according to their geographic locations. 
   
   The Group has changed the composition and presentation of its segment analysis following the announcement of  
   a change in its operational structure subsequent to the 2015 year end with a view to strengthen operational 
   oversight, leadership, governance and regulatory compliance across the 22 operations in Africa and the Middle 
   East.
   
   The MTN Group is now clustered into the following three regions and their respective underlying operations based
   on the decision taken:           
   - South and East Africa (SEA)    
   - West and Central Africa (WECA) 
   - Middle East and North Africa (MENA).   
   
   Comparative numbers for the segments have been restated accordingly.  
   
   Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable as well 
   as those that are attributable on a reasonable basis to a segment, whether from external transactions or from 
   transactions with other Group segments. 
   
   EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amorisation, impairment of goodwill, net monetary gains and 
   share of results of joint ventures and associates after tax) excluding the following items is used as the measure 
   of reporting profit or loss for each segment and represents the basis on which the CODM reviews segment results:
   - Hyperinflation (note 5)            
   - Tower sale profits                 
   - Nigeria regulatory fine (note 15)  
   - MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense (note 16). 
   
   This measure has remained unchanged apart from MTN Zakhele Futhi share-based payment expense which was also 
   excluded in the current year. 
   
   Irancell Telecommunication Company Services (PJSC) (Iran) proportionate results are included in the segment analysis 
   as reviewed by the CODM and excluded from IFRS reported results for revenue, EBITDA and capex due to equity 
   accounting for joint ventures. The results of Iran in the segment analysis exclude the impact of hyperinflation 
   accounting.

7. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
   Areeba Guinea S.A.
   Areeba Guinea S.A. (Conakry) experienced a decline in EBITDA and Guinea-Conakry has experienced poor economic
   performance countrywide. Consequently, a review of the recoverable amount of Conakry was undertaken during 
   2016 subsequent to which an impairment loss amounting to R402 million (December 2015: R504 million) was 
   recognised. As at 31 December 2016, the goodwill balance relating to Conakry is fully impaired.
   
   Afrihost
   Based on an agreement concluded by the Group to sell its 50,02% investment in Afrihost Proprietary Limited 
   (Afrihost) for R325 million, a goodwill impairment loss of R202 million was recognised at 30 June 2016 on the 
   remeasurement of the assets to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held 
   for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The investment has been disposed of during the second half of 2016.
   
   MTN Syria (JSC)
   Syria has been experiencing poor economic performance countrywide due to political instability and on-going 
   conflict in the country. An assessment of the recoverable amount of the goodwill held in MTN Syria (JSC) 
   (MTN Syria) was performed for the year ended 31 December 2016, subsequent to which an impairment loss of 
   R269 million was recognised. As at 31 December 2016, the goodwill balance relating to MTN Syria is fully

    MTN Zakhele and MTN Zakhele Futhi
    The MTN Zakhele broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) transaction unwound during the current year 
    and all options outstanding were exercised. The Group implemented a new BBBEE transaction, structured 
    through MTN Zakhele Futhi (note 16). The shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi, although legally issued, are not
    deemed to be issued in terms of IFRS as the MTN Zakhele Futhi transaction has the substance of an option. As 
    at 31 December 2016, 42 508 806 potential ordinary shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi were not included in the 
    calculation of diluted loss per share as they are antidilutive. In addition, as at 31 December 2016, a total 
    of 1 042 243 potential ordinary shares in the form of share options and share rights issued in terms of the 
    Group's share schemes and performance share plan were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share 
    due to being antidilutive. These potential ordinary shares could dilute basic and headline earnings per share 
    in the future.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost except for 
    the borrowings set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values. 

    Listed long-term borrowings
    The Group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue which were issued in 
    prior years, with a carrying amount of R10 354 million (2015: R11 633 million) and a fair value of 
    R9 494 million (2015: R10 268 million) at 31 December 2016. The fair value of these instruments is 
    determined by reference to quoted prices in the Irish bond market. The market for these bonds is not liquid
    and consequently the fair value measurement is categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

    During the year, the Group issued a further USD1 billion of listed long-term fixed interest rate unsecured 
    notes. Notes with a face value of USD500 million are redeemable in 2022 (the 2022 notes), with the remaining 
    USD500 million redeemable in 2026 (the 2026 notes). As at 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of the 2022 
    notes is R6 849 million and the fair value is R6 958 million and the carrying amount of the 2026 notes is 
    R6 856 million and the fair value is R6 727 million. The fair values of these bonds are determined by 
    reference to quoted prices in the Irish bond market. The market for these instruments is not liquid and 
    consequently the fair value measurement is categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

    Loan to Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V.
    The Group has a loan to Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. with a carrying amount of R2 863 million (December 2015: 
    R2 704 million) and a fair value of R2 969 million as at 31 December 2016. The fair value of this instrument 
    is determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis using a market-related interest rate. The fair value 
    measurement is categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
    
    Financial instruments measured at fair value
    The fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined as follows:
    
    Treasury bills
    The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active 
    market. The Group has classified treasury bills with a carrying amount of R282 million as available for 
    sale and with a carrying amount of R669 million as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of 
    these investments is categorised within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

    Fair value measurement of investment in IHS
    The Group holds an equity investment in IHS at fair value of R11 240 million (December 2015: R9 250 million). 
    The investment is classified as available for sale. The fair value of the investment at 31 December 2016 was 
    determined with reference to recent transactions between market participants and has consequently been 
    transferred from level 3 to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy in 2016. 

    At 31 December 2015, the absence of transactions between market participants resulted in the fair value being
    determined using models considered to be appropriate by management. The fair value was calculated using an 
    earnings multiple technique and was based on unobservable market inputs, including average tower industry 
    earnings multiples of between 10 and 14. Consequently, the investment was categorised within level 3 of the 
    fair value hierarchy. An increase of one in the multiple would have resulted in an increase in the fair value 
    of R792 million and a decrease of one in the multiple would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of
    R792 million as at 31 December 2015.

      facilities, R2 billion (December 2015: R6,5 billion) on general banking facilities and R2,1 billion through 
      the Domestic Medium Term Programme                                    
    - MTN Holdings repaid R7,4 billion (December 2015: R500 million) of the syndicated loan facility, R2,9 billion
      (December 2015: R5,1 billion) of general banking facilities and R154 million (December 2015: R1,3 billion) of 
      the Domestic Medium Term Programme                                    
    - MTN (Mauritius) Investments Limited raised R14,2 billion (USD1 billion) debt through long-term fixed interest 
      rate unsecured notes. These notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange                                    
    - MTN International (Mauritius) Limited (MTN Mauritius) raised R11,2 billion (December 2015: R10,4 billion) and 
      repaid R12,9 billion on a revolving credit facility                                    
    - MTN Nigeria Communications Limited repaid R5,4 billion (December 2015: R4,2 billion) long-term borrowings
    - Other borrowings raised and repaid across the Group amounted to R12 billion (2015: R3,5 billion) and 
      R8,4 billion (2015: R3,7 billion), respectively.

15. NIGERIA REGULATORY FINE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES
    On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria) resolved the matter relating to the 
    previously imposed regulatory fine with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) after the completion of 
    an extensive negotiation process.

    In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria agreed to pay a total cash amount 
    of Naira 330 billion over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion1) to the FGN as a full and final 
    settlement of the matter. 

    In addition to the monetary settlement set out above:
    - MTN Nigeria subscribes to the voluntary observance of the Code of Corporate Governance for the 
      Telecommunications Industry in Nigeria and will ensure compulsory compliance when the said Code is made 
      mandatory for the Telecommunications Industry
    - MTN Nigeria undertakes to take immediate steps to ensure the listing of its shares on the Nigeria Stock 
      Exchange as soon as commercially and legally possible after the date of execution of the settlement agreement
    - MTN Nigeria shall always ensure full compliance with its licence terms and conditions as issued by the Nigeria 
      Communications Commission (NCC).
    
    The Naira 50 billion (the equivalent of R4 billion2 at the time) in good faith payment which was paid without 
    prejudice by MTN Nigeria on 24 February 2016 forms part of the monetary component of the settlement.

    On 10 June 2016, the nature of the fine changed from a provision under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
    Liabilities and Contingent Assets to that of a financial liability under IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
    Recognition and Measurement. As from this date onwards MTN Nigeria was contractually obliged to settle the 
    fine in cash. Consequently, the outstanding balance ceased to be discounted at a pre-tax risk-free rate (in 
    terms of IAS 37) and is instead discounted at MTN Nigeria’s incremental borrowing rate for a liability with 
    similar cash flows (in terms of IAS 39). As at 31 December 2015 an amount of R5,2 billion was recorded in 
    other current liabilities and R4,1 billion in other non-current liabilities relating to the fine. The Group 
    reclassified the previously recognised provision on 10 June 2016 to a financial liability of Naira 212,5 billion, 
    the equivalent of R16,2 billion1 for the outstanding cash payments using a discount rate of 14,71%. The 
    additional charge to the income statement amounted to R10,5 billion and a discount unwind of R1,0 billion was 
    recognised in finance costs during 2016. The balance of the liability as at 31 December 2016 amounts to 
    R8,7 billion3 (R7,4 billion recorded in other non-current liabilities and R1,3 billion in trade and other 
    payables), after taking into account the payment of Naira 30 billion (R1,9 billion4) on 24 June 2016.
    
    Professional service fees
    During the period R1 324 million costs (included in other operating expenses) were incurred on professional
    services relating to the negotiations that led to a reduction of R34 billion in the Nigeria regulatory fine. 
    The board had exercised its judgement and approved the quantum of the professional fees incurred taking into 
    account global benchmarks and the value delivered, culminating in the final settlement of the Nigeria fine.
    1 Amount translated at the 10 June 2016 rate R1 = N13,15.
    2 Amount translated at the 24 February 2016 rate of R1 = N12,55.
    3 Amount translated at the 31 December 2016 closing rate R1 = N22,81.
    4 Amount translated at the June 2016 average rate of R1 = N15,90.

16. MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI AND UNWIND OF MTN ZAKHELE

    and delisted the following shares received from MTN Zakhele:
    - 5 882 100 shares delivered to the Company in settlement of the outstanding NVF funding of R662 million;
    - 23 479 083 shares repurchased by the Company for cash; and
    - 7 253 510 shares to facilitate the reinvestment by existing MTN Zakhele shareholders into the new BBBEE 
      vehicle of the Group, as described below.
    
    As a consequence of the unwind of MTN Zakhele, a new BBBEE transaction was structured through a separate 
    legal entity, MTN Zakhele Futhi. MTN Zakhele Futhi is consolidated by MTN. The transaction is designed to 
    provide long-term, sustainable benefits to all BBBEE participants and will run for a period of eight years.

    MTN Zakhele Futhi acquired 76 835 378 of the Company's shares at a price of R128,50 per share. The 
    acquisition of 35 747 139 shares (and transaction costs of R36 million incurred by MTN Zakhele Futhi) was 
    funded using equity raised from the allotment of MTN Zakhele Futhi shares totalling R1 651 million (including 
    R557 million obtained from the Group for the purchase of MTN Zakhele Futhi shares in terms of its underwrite 
    option); re-investment of R817 million from the existing MTN shareholders and third-party preference share 
    funding of R2 161 million. The acquisition of 15 367 075 shares was funded through a donation of shares to 
    the amount of R1 975 million received from the Group. The Company also issued 25 721 164 notional vendor 
    finance shares (NVF shares) at par value to MTN Zakhele Futhi amounting to approximately R3 305 million.

    Although the day-to-day activities of MTN Zakhele Futhi are managed by its directors, the Group has 
    decision-making rights over the relevant activities of MTN Zakhele Futhi, including management of MTN Zakhele
    Futhi’s credit-risk and the associated BBBEE credentials. MTN Zakhele Futhi’s sole business is holding shares 
    in the Group and administering the associated funding of these shares. Its success is therefore dependent on 
    the success of the Group as well as the ongoing receipt of dividends from the Group to service and repay debt. 
    The Group therefore consolidates MTN Zakhele Futhi, a structured entity, in terms of IFRS 10.  

    MTN Zakhele Futhi must repay the preference shares and NVF before the Company's shares held by it become 
    unencumbered, while the Company's shares are the only security offered by MTN Zakhele Futhi for the debt 
    funding obtained. Until the Company's shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi become unencumbered, the ordinary 
    shareholders of MTN Zakhele Futhi are exposed to the gains on the Company's shares, while their exposure 
    to downside risk or risk of loss is limited to their equity contributions (i.e. the purchase price paid by
    them for the MTN Zakhele Futhi shares). Consequently, the Company does not recognise its shares issued to 
    MTN Zakhele Futhi and does not recognise the NVF as outstanding but treats it as an option for accounting
    purposes. 

    Further, no non-controlling interest is recognised in respect of the shares held by the ordinary shareholders
    of MTN Zakhele Futhi. From a consolidated perspective, their equity contributions (comprising cash received 
    from new investors and the re-investment by existing MTN Zakhele shareholders in MTN Zakhele Futhi) are in 
    substance treated as a premium paid for the option to acquire the Company's shares in future.

    During the year, and as a result of the option granted as described above, the Group recognised a share-based 
    payment expense of R1 008 million (included in other operating expenses). A further share-based payment expense 
    is expected when the shares of MTN Zakhele Futhi held by the Group resulting from the exercise of the underwrite 
    are issued to the public. Transaction costs amounted to R173 million and have been recognised as an expense 
    during the year.

    Share-based payment expense in respect of MTN Zakhele Futhi
    The grant date of the option is 23 November 2016. The fair value of the share-based payment at this date 
    was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.    
                                                                               2016

    Uncertain tax exposures
    The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and the Group’s interpretation and application 
    of the various tax rules applied in direct and indirect tax filings may result in disputes between
    the Group and the relevant tax authority. The outcome of such disputes may not be favourable to 
    the Group. At year-end there were a number of tax disputes ongoing in various of the Group’s 
    operating entities, the most significant of which relates to a transfer pricing dispute which 
    the Group is contesting. The Group has applied its judgement and has recognised liabilities for 
    anticipated issues based on whether additional amounts will be payable, and has included contingent 
    liabilities where considered possible but not probable.

18. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ACQUISITION OF JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
    Investment in Africa Internet Holdings GmbH (AIH)
    The Group's additional investment of R2 312 million in AIH, made in terms of the right obtained during 2015, 
    became effective during March 2016. This additional investment increased the Group's interest in this joint 
    venture from 33,3% to 41,4%. Subsequently AIH received additional investments from new investors which 
    became effective during April to July 2016. These additional investments diluted the Group's investment in 
    AIH from 41.4% to 31,28%. Following a share swap transaction with a Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) 
    shareholder of Africa eCommerce Holding GmbH (AEH), a subsidiary of AIH, AEH became a wholly owned 
    subsidiary of AIH and the NCI received shares in AIH in exchange. The Group recognised a net loss on 
    dilution of R349 million (comprising a gain of R277 million and a loss of R626 million). The Group retains 
    joint control over AIH. 

    Altech Autopage subscriber base
    In February 2016, the Group concluded the acquisition of its Altech Autopage subscriber base from Altron 
    TMT Proprietary Limited for R678 million. The acquisition of the subscriber base will enable the Group to 
    service and interact directly with its customers and allow the Group to consolidate the Mobile Telephone 
    Networks Proprietary Limited postpaid subscriber base in one entity. The acquisition has been accounted 
    for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The purchase price allocation has been finalised and 
    the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of R479 million resulted in goodwill of R199 million 
    being recognised. 

    Other acquisitions
    In January 2016 the MTN Group obtained joint control of TravelLab Global AB (Travelstart) through an 
    investment of R391 million. In November 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Smart Village 
    Proprietary Limited for a cash consideration of R220 million and a deferred consideration of R12 million.

    The Group's functional and presentation currency is rand. The strengthening of the closing rate of the 
    rand against the functional currencies of the Group's largest operations contributed significantly to 
    the decrease in assets and liabilities and the resulting foreign currency translation reserve reduction 
    of R22 907 million since 31 December 2015.
    
    Net investment hedges
    During 2016, the Group hedged a designated portion of its dollar net assets in MTN (Dubai) Limited 
    (MTN Dubai) for forex exposure arising between the USD and ZAR as part of the Group's risk management 
    objectives. The Group designated external borrowings (Eurobonds) denominated in USD held by MTN (Mauritius) 
    Investment Limited with a value of R23,1 billion and external borrowings denominated in USD held by MTN 
    Nigeria Communications Limited with a value of R4,5 billion as hedging instruments. For the period of the 
    hedge relationship, foreign exchange movements on these hedging instruments are recognised in other 
    comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), offsetting the exchange 
    differences recognised in other comprehensive income, arising on translation of the designated dollar net 
    assets of MTN Dubai to ZAR. The cumulative forex movement recognised in other comprehensive income will 
    only be reclassified to profit or loss upon loss of control over MTN Dubai. There was no hedge 
    ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss during the year.

20. EVENTS AFTER REPORTING PERIOD
    Nigeria Tower Interco B.V./IHS exchange right
    In January 2017 the Group exchanged its 51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., the parent company 
    of INT Towers Limited (INT), the Nigerian telecom tower operator, for an additional shareholding in IHS 
    Holding Limited (IHS Group). As a result of the transaction, the Group's economic interest in the IHS 
    Group increased from approximately 15% Class B non-voting shares to an economic interest of approximately 
    29% comprising Class A voting shares and Class B non-voting shares. The original IHS Group shareholders’ 
    agreement remains in place and there will be no changes to IHS Group's independence as an operator. 
    Neither the current nor the interest obtained subsequent to the transaction will allow the Group to 
    appoint a board member. In addition, IHS Group has the right to decide what strategic, financial and 
    operational information is shared with the Group. As a result of these restrictions, the Group's vote is 
    limited to matters which relate to fundamental changes in the business or which apply in exceptional 
    circumstances and are considered to be protective in nature. The Group's rights do not constitute 
    significant influence to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of IHS Group. 
    Consequently, the Group will continue to account for its investment in IHS Group as an available-for-sale 
    financial instrument.     
    
    The exchange, which closed on 23 February 2017, will be accounted for as a disposal of the Group's 
    equity-accounted interest in INT and an acquisition of an additional investment in IHS Group. The net 
    impact on profit before tax is estimated to be R5 579 million, which is determined as the difference 
    between the fair value of the new interest obtained and the carrying value of the equity-accounted 
    interest in INT and after recycling any amount in FCTR to the income statement. The financial effects 
    are estimated based on provisional 31 December 2016 carrying values translated at 31 January 2017 
    closing rates. 

    The decision to exchange the shares was made following a thorough review of the commercial benefits of 
    the exchange and an agreement on the number of shares that the Group will qualify for in IHS Group. 
    Consensus on these matters and board approval for the sale was obtained in January 2017. As a result, 
    the investment in INT was not accounted for as held for sale in accordance with the requirements of 
    IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations at 31 December 2016. 

    The transaction had no tax impact.
    
    Loan to Uganda Interco
    Subsequent to year-end the Group converted its variable interest loan to its associate, Uganda Tower 
    Interco B.V. (Uganda Towerco), a provider of telecommunications towers in Uganda, with a balance of 
    USD80,1 million, into additional equity of USD48,3 million and a replacement note in Uganda shillings 
    for the remaining balance, which will attract fixed interest. 

    Dividends declared
    Dividends declared at the board meeting held on 1 March 2017 amounted to 450 cents per share.

UPDATE ON TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the year ended 31 December
2016 (“FY2016”) which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on
Thursday, 2 March 2017.

Following the trading statement published on 8 February 2017, shareholders are further advised
that MTN expects to report for FY2016 a basic headline loss per share of between 74 cents and 81
cents and a basic loss per share of between 137 cents and 151 cents. In the prior year comparable
period MTN reported headline earnings per share of 746 cents and earnings per share of 1 109
cents.

The results for the year were impacted by the Nigerian regulatory fine, which had a 455 cents per
share (cps) negative impact. In addition, the results were negatively impacted by the following:

    -   Foreign exchange losses (324 cps);
    -   The ‘interest unwind’ related to the Nigerian regulatory fine (45 cps);
    -   The MTN Zakhele Futhi BBBBEE transaction charge (88 cps);
    -   Professional fees related to the settlement of the Nigerian regulatory fine(73 cps);
    -   Losses from our investments in Digital Group being mainly Africa Internet Holdings (AIH),
        Middle East Internet Holdings (MEIH) and Iran Internet Group (IIG) (39 cps);
    -   Hyperinflation impact(37 cps); and
    -   Losses from the Nigeria tower company mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses on US
        dollar denominated loans (122 cps); (following MTN exchanging its interest in the Nigeria
        Tower Company for the increased stake in IHS Holding this investment will be shown as “an
        asset available for sale”).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed and
reported on by MTN`s external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the year ended 31 December
2016 (FY2016) which will be announced on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on or
about Thursday, 2 March 2017.

Paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements require a trading statement to be
published as soon as an issuer and its directors are satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty
exists that the financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20%
from those of the previous corresponding period.

Shareholders are therefore advised that MTN expects to report a loss in basic headline earnings per
share (HEPS) and basic earnings per share (EPS) for FY2016. In the prior year comparable period
MTN reported HEPS of 1 204 cents and EPS of 746 cents.

The expected decline in the HEPS and EPS is mainly as a result of the regulatory fine imposed on
MTN Nigeria (the Nigerian regulatory fine) following a resolution with the Federal Government of
Nigeria on 10 June 2016. The Nigerian regulatory fine is expected to have an estimated negative
impact of approximately 474 cents on HEPS and EPS, respectively.

Other contributing factors to the negative HEPS and EPS for FY2016 were foreign exchange losses in
a number of operations, losses from joint ventures and associates, additional depreciation resulting
from prior hyperinflation adjustments in MTN Irancell ,the Zakhele Futhi tax and share-based
payment charges and professional fees incurred in respect of the settlement of the Nigeria
regulatory fine and planned listing.

FY2016 results are further expected to be negatively impacted by the under-performance of MTN
Nigeria and MTN South Africa in the first half of 2016. MTN Nigeria’s first half performance was
impacted by the disconnection of 4,5 million subscribers in February 2016 in compliance with the
Nigerian Communications Commission subscriber registration requirements. The withdrawal of
regulatory services, which was resolved in May 2016, the weak economy and the depreciation of the
Naira against the USD also negatively impacted MTN Nigeria’s performance. Consolidated results in
Rand terms from Nigeria were affected by the weaker Naira in the second half of the year. The
disappointing results from MTN South Africa in the first six months, were largely due to the poor
postpaid performance.

A further trading statement will be issued once the Company obtains a reasonable degree of
certainty as to the likely range within which the HEPS and EPS are expected to be finalised.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor
reported on by MTN`s external auditors.

Today, 1 February 2017, MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) announced that it will exchange its
51% interest in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., the parent company of INT Towers Limited
(“INT”), the Nigerian telecom tower operator, for an additional shareholding in IHS Holding
Limited (“IHS Group"") (the ""Transaction""). As a result of the Transaction, MTN’s economic
interest in IHS Group will increase from approximately 15% to approximately 29% (note
1). There are no conditions precedent to the Transaction and it is expected to close once the
new shares in IHS Group have been issued during Q1 2017.

In exchanging all of its interest in INT in Nigeria for additional shares in the pan-African IHS
Group, all of MTN's interest in IHS will sit alongside a world-class group of investors
including Wendel, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Government of Singapore
Investment Corporation (GIC), Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) and Emerging Capital
Partners (ECP), among other international investors.

The Transaction enables MTN to simplify its tower ownership structure and diversify its
tower infrastructure exposure across the IHS Group which operates in a number of markets
across Africa. Moreover, the Transaction will better enable MTN to crystallise value for
MTN’s shareholders in the future. The investment in IHS Group allows MTN to benefit
economically from its previously owned passive infrastructure and continued network
investment.

MTN’s Executive Chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko, said that “the transaction represents a
significant step in MTN’s long-standing partnership with IHS. It simplifies our ownership
structure and diversifies our tower investments across the IHS Group. IHS Group is
extremely well positioned for future growth and build-out from 3G upgrades and the move to
LTE across its key markets.”

Issam Darwish, Executive Vice Chairman and Group CEO of IHS Group, said: “The MTN
transaction and partnership was transformational for IHS and has allowed us to invest a
significant amount of capital to better serve our customers, accelerate our growth and the
development of critical telecommunications infrastructure across Africa. We are delighted to
announce the transaction which simplifies the shareholding structure of IHS Group and
marks an important milestone as we strengthen our capital structure and our position as the
leading independent tower company in EMEA.""
The Transaction is a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

About IHS Group: IHS Group is the largest independent tower operator in Africa, Europe and
Middle East and the tenth largest independent tower company in the world, with
over 23,300 towers. Founded in 2001, IHS Group provides services across the full tower
value chain – colocation on owned towers, deployment and managed services. IHS Group
continues to grow and develop its business with leading market positions in Nigeria,
Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Zambia and Rwanda and has also recently led in-market
consolidation in Africa through its acquisition of Helios Towers Nigeria in early 2016.

Note 1 - Prior to the Transaction, MTN's interest in IHS Group was non-voting. Post the
transaction, to ensure the continued independent and competitive proposition of IHS Group,
MTN's influence on IHS Group is significantly restricted by a number of limitations including
on voting rights, no board representation, and restrictions on access to information. These
restrictions do not impact MTN's economic interest. Given limitations on influence, MTN's
interest in IHS Group has to date been accounted for as a financial instrument “available for
sale” in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement,
whereby MTN only accounts for the fair value changes relating to its investment directly in
the statement of comprehensive income and does not consolidate or equity account the net
profits or net assets of IHS Group. Whilst MTN continually makes assessments of critical
judgments as it relates to its accounting treatment, the accounting treatment in respect of
IHS Group is not currently expected to change. MTN’s approximate15% interest in IHS
Group was held at fair value of ZAR11.4 billion at 30 June 2016. For further information
please refer to note 5 “fair value measurement of investments” in MTN’s consolidated
financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

Note 2 - The ratio at which shares in Nigeria Tower Interco BV were exchanged for new IHS
Group shares was based on historic financial performance adjusted for growth, leverage and
other adjustments.

Note 3 - About INT: INT is a Nigeria-based tower operator. The company was founded in
2014 by IHS Group and MTN which subsequently acquired 8,850 existing towers from MTN
Nigeria. As at 30 June 2016, MTN's stake in INT was equity accounted for in accordance
with IAS 28: Investments in Associates, and whose carrying value was approximately
ZAR4.6 billion. MTN recorded Net Losses of approximately ZAR2.5 billion in relation to INT
for the six months ended 30 June 2016. As a result of the transaction MTN will derecognise
its interest in INT.

     RESULTS OF THE MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI PUBLIC OFFER AND THE MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI RE-
     INVESTMENT OFFER

     FULFILMENT OF ALL OUTSTANDING TRANSACTION CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Unless defined in this announcement or if the context dictates otherwise, capitalised terms
     used in this announcement have the same meanings as given in the circular to MTN
     Shareholders dated 6 September 2016 (“Circular”).

     In terms of the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer, which closed at 16h00 on Friday, 28 October 2016,
     an invitation was made (i) to the black public (individuals and groups) to subscribe for MTN
     Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares; and (ii) to qualifying MTN Zakhele Shareholders to re-invest all
     or a portion of their investment in MTN Zakhele into MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares in
     accordance with the terms of the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme.

     MTN Shareholders are hereby advised that all of the Transaction Conditions Precedent, as set
     out in the Circular, and all outstanding conditions under the Finance Documents, have been
     met and as a result the final implementation of the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction has
     commenced, with closing expected to occur on 23 and 24 November 2016.

     MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares will be allotted and issued by MTN Zakhele Futhi to
     successful applicants on Wednesday, 23 November 2016. Information will be communicated
     to all applicants on or before 23 December 2016 to inform them, inter alia, of the status of
     their applications, including, where applicable, the extent to which their applications were
     accepted and the number of MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares that were allocated to them.
     To the extent that applications were not accepted, refunds will be paid on or before 23
     December 2016.

     MTN would like to thank every successful applicant for taking this opportunity to build their
     future with MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares.

2.   RESULTS OF THE MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI OFFER

     Since the closing of the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer, a detailed process of reconciliation has been
     undertaken to ensure that due process was followed during the finalisation of allocations of
     MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares to applicants who made valid applications.

     The MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer raised approximately R1.094 billion from more than
     81 000 applicants from across South Africa. In addition, applications were received from
     11 203 qualifying MTN Zakhele Shareholders holding in aggregate 13 479 330 MTN Zakhele
     Shares to re-invest the MTN Zakhele Scheme Consideration in respect of these MTN Zakhele
     Shares into MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares, equating to approximately R0.817 billion.

     Applications (in aggregate) from the black public and qualifying MTN Zakhele Shareholders,
     although exceeding the Minimum Equity Raise (being an amount of R1 234.1 million), were
     less than the Target Equity Raise (R2 468.3 million). The cash raised by MTN Zakhele Futhi
     under the MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer exceeded the minimum amount of cash required for
     the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction to proceed (being an amount of R250 million). As set out in
     paragraph 5 below, MTN has exercised the option for its nominee to subscribe for the MTN
     Zakhele Futhi Underwrite Shares and will accordingly subscribe for 27 848 672 MTN Zakhele
     Futhi Ordinary Shares for an aggregate consideration of R557 million.

     The total number of MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares to be issued and allotted on
     23 November 2016 is 123 416 822.

3.   REFUNDS

     Refunds will be made in respect of all applications which were unsuccessful in accordance
     with the provisions set out in the Prospectus. Refunds will be paid on or before 23 December
     2016 by electronic funds transfer into each affected applicant’s specified transactional bank
     account. Interest will not be paid on the refunded amounts.

4.   LETTERS OF ALLOCATION AND RELATED DOCUMENTS

     A welcome pack containing, inter alia, a welcome letter, confirmation of share issuance, a
     token share certificate and important MTN Zakhele Futhi shareholder information will be sent
     to all successful applicants on or before 23 December 2016.

5.   AMENDMENTS TO THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE MODEL

     The MTN Board has resolved to proceed with the implementation of the 2016 MTN BEE
     Transaction on the basis that MTN will (i) subscribe for MTN Zakhele Futhi Underwrite Shares
     to make up the equity shortfall (i.e. the difference between the equity actually raised pursuant
     to the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer and the Target Equity Raise); and (ii) provide additional
     Notional Vendor Finance to MTN Zakhele Futhi to ensure that the required 4:1 Inception Total
     Share Cover Ratio is achieved.

     In accordance with the Implementation Agreement, and having regard to (i) the transaction

MTN Group executive chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko, comments:

“During the quarter the Group embarked on a material transformation project, focusing initially on its key operations
of Nigeria and South Africa. A dedicated transformation office was established to drive this transformation to maximise
revenue growth, enable a distinct customer experience and ensure operational efficiencies, including concerted
initiatives to drive optimal return on investment, with hard targets set for the next 12, 18 and 24 months. Operations 
are expected to deliver the first results on clearly defined targets in the first half of 2017. 

Over the past 12 months the Group has made a number of senior management changes to ensure efficient operational
execution, enhance stakeholder engagement, manage reputational risk and ensure solid governance across its operations. 
The appointment of a new Group Chief Financial Officer as well as the few other outstanding senior management changes 
and appointments will be concluded by year end.

Following the announcement of senior management changes made on 20 June 2016 we are pleased to announce that the
starting date for new Group President and CEO Rob Shuter has been brought forward. Rob will be joining us on 
13 March 2017.

With the completion of my two key mandates of settling the Nigerian regulatory fine and appointing a new Group
President and CEO I will revert to my role as non-executive chairman as soon as Rob assumes his position as Group 
President  and CEO on 13 March 2017. In the interim, whilst I will continue as executive chairman to provide oversight, 
I will delegate more operational responsibilities to Gunter Engling, acting CFO and Stephen Van Coller, VP M&A and Strategy. 
I will also ensure that all outstanding senior management appointments are completed and the new senior management team is 
fully settled in before year end.

During the quarter, we appointed Felleng Sekha as Executive: Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy, effective 10
October 2016. Felleng brings experience in management of political, public policy, legal and regulatory affairs in the 
African ICT sector.

Despite a tough operating environment as a result of weaker macro-economic conditions, particularly in oil-dependent
economies, as well as the regulatory challenges experienced, we are confident that the fundamental changes implemented
over the past year position the Group well to participate efficiently and effectively in the data evolution and ensure
sound stakeholder relationships and governance processes.

During the period under review, the South African business delivered a pleasing QoQ sequential improvement in both
revenue and margin. Revenue improved by more than 3,6% QoQ while the EBITDA margin expanded by more than 200 bp QoQ. MTN
South Africa expects to maintain this improvement in EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. 

After reporting a YoY decline in revenue in the first and second quarter of 2016 of 6,2% and 3,3% respectively, in the
third quarter MTN Nigeria’s revenue YoY decline was limited to 1,2% as the business continued to experience incremental
improvements in revenues. We are confident of delivering positive YoY revenue metrics in the fourth quarter.

We are pleased to report that we have commenced the repatriation of cash from MTN Irancell to the Group and expect to
conclude the process over the next six months.

MTN issued a SENS announcement on 28 September 2016 in which MTN Nigeria’s CEO Ferdi Moolman refuted allegations made
on the floor of the Senate that MTN Nigeria had improperly repatriated funds from Nigeria. Ferdi Moolman said that 
“The allegations made against MTN Nigeria are completely unfounded and without any merit.” 

In the latest development on this matter, the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has through the Senate
Committee on Banking and Insurance and other Financial Institutions commenced an investigation into the alleged 
“unscrupulous violation” of the Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous) Act. MTN Nigeria, four commercial banks, 
certain MTN Nigeria directors and shareholders, the Central Bank of Nigeria and others appeared before the Senate on 
20 October 2016 at the outset of this investigation.

The allegations are that $13.97 billion was repatriated illegally by MTN Nigeria through its bankers. MTN Nigeria and
its bankers are cooperating with the investigation with a view to resolving the matter as expeditiously as possible. In
the interim the CBN has instructed the banks to suspend any remittance of dividends until further notice. MTN Nigeria is
committed to the payment of the N330bn fine related to the late disconnection of ‘improperly registered’ SIMS and as
such has not declared a dividend since April 2015 and MTN Nigeria has no intention to make any dividend payments over 
the next six months. MTN Nigeria continues to refute the allegations that MTN Nigeria had improperly repatriated funds 
from Nigeria. Consequently MTN Nigeria will strongly defend any action that would be prejudicial to its interest.""

SEA 
MTN South Africa reported a marginal decline in subscribers of 0,5% QoQ to 29,7 million. This was as a result of a
0,7% decline in the pre-paid subscriber base to 24,5 million, largely due to churn from low revenue-generating customers.
The post-paid subscriber base increased by 0,7% to 5,2 million, benefiting from an improved customer experience, network
quality, segmented customer offerings and attractive price plans.

Data revenue increased by 15,1% YoY and contributed 34,4% to total revenue. This was driven by the increased volumes
of high-denomination data bundles sold and attractive digital offerings. The increase in the number of smartphones and
improvements made on the network also contributed to data revenue growth. The number of smartphones on the network
increased by 9,3% to 9,2 million YoY. ARPU increased by 10,4% QoQ. 

Other SEA - across the rest of the region, the number of subscribers increased by 1,0% to 23,3 million, mainly driven
by good growth in Uganda. 

MTN Uganda increased its subscriber base by 2,9% QoQ to 10,2 million, supported by a special sales channel and a
reduction in churn. Constant currency data revenue increased by 20,4% YoY and contributed 33,7% to total revenue. This 
was supported by our LTE leadership position, smartphone subsidisation and attractive data bundles. The operation recorded 
1,3 million smartphones on the network . Local currency ARPU remained constant QoQ. 

WECA 
MTN Nigeria reported a 2,5% increase in its subscriber base to 60,5 million (QoQ). The reported subscriber base was
negatively impacted by the exclusion from our active base of approximately 3.1 million subscribers relating to a change 
in subscriber accounting rules where we no longer account for subscribers whose activity was based on the receipt of a
bulk SMS. On the upside subscriber numbers were supported mainly by reconnection through proactive engagement following
their disconnection in line with regulatory requirements earlier this year. MTN Nigeria continues to engage the 
regulatory authorities on improving the approval process for promotions, products and services following the 
re-instatement of regulatory services to MTN.

Constant currency data revenue increased by 6,7% and contributed 20,4% to total revenue. This is largely the result of
a weaker macro-economic environment negatively impacting consumers, a decline in the effective data tariff because of
competition and regulatory requirements impacting out-of-bundle billing. The data traffic increased by 43,8% YoY,
benefiting from an improved data network and increased smartphone penetration. The number of smartphones on the network
increased by 59,4% to 19,2 million YoY. Local currency ARPU decreased by 1,4% QoQ. 

Other WECA - the remainder of the region increased its subscriber base by 2,3% to 47,6 million, driven by growth in
MTN Ghana and MTN Ivory Coast. 

MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance and grew its subscriber base by 2,7% to 18,0 million. This was supported by
attractive voice and data bundle propositions. Constant currency data revenue increased by 72,8% and contributed 41,7% 
to total revenue. This was helped by strong growth in digital and mobile financial services as well as the launch of LTE
services. Local currency ARPU increased by 3,7% QoQ. The number of MTN Mobile Money customers increased by 10,7% QoQ to
7,8 million. 

MTN Cameroon’s subscriber base decreased by 1,3% to 9,5 million, impacted by the subscriber registration process.
Constant currency data revenue increased by 28,3% and contributed 19,0% to total revenue. The increased focus on the
monetisation of its LTE network together with higher volumes of LTE handsets during the quarter contributed positively 
to data revenue growth. The number of Mobile Money customers increased by 13,2% to 2,7 million QoQ, supported by 
improved distribution.

MENA
MTN Irancell increased its subscriber base by 1,1% QoQ to 47,8 million in a highly penetrated market. Constant
currency data revenue increased by 61,5% QoQ and contributed 41,5% to total revenue despite a decrease in data tariffs. 
This was largely due to a successful leadership position on its data network experience, aggressive 3G and 4G rollout 
as well as increased smartphone penetration. The number of smartphones on the network increased by 35,1% to 29,2 million. 
Local currency ARPU increased by 4,3% QoQ. 

Other MENA - the subscriber base in the remainder of the region decreased by 3,9% to 25,8 million. 

MTN Sudan’s subscriber base decreased by 13,0% to 7,7 million due to the subscriber registration process. However,
constant currency data revenue increased by 78,4%, driven by digital content, and contributed 28,2% to total revenue. 
Local currency ARPU increased by 7,7% QoQ.

     EXTENSION OF THE MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI OFFER PERIOD TO FRIDAY, 28 OCTOBER 2016
     (“EXTENSION”)

     UPDATED SALIENT DATES AND TIMES

1.   INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE FOR THE EXTENSION

     MTN shareholders (“MTN Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement relating to MTN’s
     proposed R9.9 billion broad-based empowerment transaction (“2016 MTN BEE Transaction”),
     as released by the Company on SENS on 22 August 2016 (“Terms Announcement”). Unless
     defined in this announcement or if the context dictates otherwise, capitalised terms used in this
     announcement have the same meanings as given in the Terms Announcement.

     As stated in the Terms Announcement, MTN intends to implement the proposed 2016 MTN BEE
     Transaction, through MTN Zakhele Futhi (RF) Limited (“MTN Zakhele Futhi”), by means of, inter
     alia, the following core elements: (i) a public offering in terms of which black participants will
     be invited to subscribe for and beneficially own MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares, subject to
     the qualification criteria set out in the prospectus published on 12 September 2016
     (“Prospectus”) in respect of the offer (“MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer”); (ii) the MTN Zakhele
     Re-investment Offer, if the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme proceeds; and (iii) the subscription
     for MTN Shares by MTN Zakhele Futhi using the funding raised through various sources. (The
     MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer and the MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer are, together, the
     “MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer”).

     The number of applications being received by MTN Zakhele and/or participating Nedbank
     branches) from (i) MTN Zakhele Shareholders wishing to make an election in terms of the
     election process afforded MTN Zakhele Shareholders; or (ii) investors wishing to participate in
     the MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer, has notably increased over the past week. As such, MTN
     and MTN Zakhele have agreed to extend the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer by a week to Friday, 28
     October 2016, largely to allow MTN Zakhele Shareholders, who wish to elect MTN Zakhele Futhi
     Ordinary Shares, additional time to complete their Re-Investment Offer election process, which
     includes completing their applications at a participating Nedbank branch.

     Potential new investors (Cash Applicants) and MTN Zakhele Shareholders are thus being
     afforded an additional week to participate in the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer and are encouraged
     to complete their applications and/or elections as soon as possible.

2.    REVISED CLOSING DATE FOR THE MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI OFFER

      Set out below are the revised salient dates and times pertaining to the implementation of the
      2016 MTN BEE Transaction (assuming an MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind):

                                                                                              2016

         -   A new employee share ownership plan (“ESOP”), excluding management and directors,
             requiring no equity contribution from eligible participants to augment MTN's South
             African BEE initiatives

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Since its incorporation in South Africa in 1994, MTN has been at the forefront of empowerment
     and remains fully committed to the principles of broad-based black economic empowerment
     (“BEE”). MTN also embraces the principles of BEE enshrined in the Codes of Good Practice on
     Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (“Codes”) and relevant industry transformation
     charters.

     A key pillar of BEE is black equity ownership. In 2010, MTN implemented a BEE transaction
     (“MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction”) in terms of which, inter alia, (i) MTN Zakhele (RF) Limited
     (“MTN Zakhele”), a special purpose vehicle, issued MTN Zakhele ordinary shares (“MTN
     Zakhele Shares”) to qualifying members of the black public; and (ii) MTN Zakhele acquired
     and/or subscribed for MTN ordinary shares (“MTN Shares”) at a discount, up to a maximum of
     4% of the then issued share capital of MTN (using a combination of equity funding, vendor
     facilitation through a donation from MTN, notional vendor finance from MTN and third-party
     preference share funding (“MTN Zakhele Pref Shares”)). The MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction is
     proposed to be unwound on 24 November 2016 (“MTN Zakhele Unwind”) when the MTN
     Zakhele Pref Shares and the notional vendor finance mature, through either the structured
     unwinding of MTN Zakhele (i) in the event that the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction is implemented
     (“MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind”) or (ii) in the event that the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction is
     not implemented (“MTN Zakhele Standalone Unwind”).

     Following the MTN Zakhele Unwind, MTN is required intends to maintain core BEE targets as
     set out in the Information and Communication Technology Sector Code (“ICT Charter”) in
     relation to its South African businesses by proposing and implementing the new BEE transaction
     outlined in this announcement (“2016 MTN BEE Transaction” or “Transaction”) together with
     the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind. The MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind is thus, for reasons
     set out in paragraph 3.1 below, inextricably linked to the proposed 2016 MTN BEE Transaction.
     If, however, the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction is for any reason not implemented at the time of
     the MTN Zakhele Unwind (whether it be due to the non-fulfilment of any of the conditions
     precedent to the Transaction (“Transaction Conditions Precedent”), or otherwise), then MTN
     Zakhele proposes to implement the MTN Zakhele Standalone Unwind.

     The 2016 MTN BEE Transaction is designed to offer the opportunity for long-term, sustainable
     benefits to the participants in the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction (“Black Participants”) during its
     proposed eight year duration (“Empowerment Period”). It is sized to ensure that, together with
     the continuing contribution of the MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction, if fully subscribed, it
     immediately translates to an effective indirect black ownership in excess of 30% of MTN's South
     African operations under relevant industry transformation charters.

     In addition to the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction, the MTN board of directors (“MTN Board”)
     proposes to establish a new employee share ownership plan (“2016 ESOP”) for the benefit of
     eligible MTN employees. Pursuant to the implementation of the 2016 ESOP, MTN will issue, in
     total, approximately 0.1% of its current fully diluted issued ordinary share capital (excluding the
     repurchase described in paragraph 3.2 below) to be held in a trust for the benefit of eligible
     MTN employees (pending vesting). Management and directors of MTN will not participate in
     the 2016 ESOP.

2.   RATIONALE FOR AND PRINCIPLES OF THE 2016 MTN BEE TRANSACTION

     BEE is integral to the ethos of MTN and MTN believes that broad-based BEE participation is
     important to its future success as a group. Following the MTN Zakhele Unwind in November
     2016, MTN intends to maintain its core BEE ownership targets through the proposed
     implementation of the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction.

     MTN has been guided primarily by the following principles in structuring the 2016 MTN BEE
     Transaction:

         -   affording existing participants in the MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction the opportunity to
             re-invest in the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction as part of the MTN Zakhele Integrated
             Unwind;

         -   the vesting (through a new company, MTN Zakhele Futhi (RF) Limited (“MTN Zakhele
             Futhi”)) of full voting and economic rights to the Black Participants from inception;

         -   achieving a sustainable and robust BEE transaction at a realistic economic cost (inclusive
             of any dilution) to MTN shareholders;

         -   broadening MTN’s South African BEE ownership by structuring the 2016 MTN BEE
             Transaction to include an offer to the black public; and

         -   giving effect to the terms and spirit of the Codes and relevant industry transformation
             charters and their requirements for the empowerment of MTN’s South African
             businesses.

3.    THE MTN ZAKHELE UNWIND

3.1    Background

       MTN Shareholders are referred to the announcement published by MTN Zakhele on SENS on
       22 August 2016, simultaneously with this announcement, for further information on the MTN
       Zakhele Unwind.

       The MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction was established as a 6-year scheme, with the requirement
       for MTN Zakhele ordinary shareholders (“MTN Zakhele Shareholders”) to be (and remain)
       qualifying black persons and groups to endure until, and for the third party preference share
       funding and notional vendor finance from MTN to mature on, 24 November 2016, being the
       6th anniversary of the start of the scheme.

       A key common element in both the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind and the MTN Zakhele
       Standalone Unwind is the possibility for MTN Zakhele to be efficiently and effectively unwound
       through a scheme of arrangement (pursuant to section 114 of the Companies Act, 2008 (No.
       71 of 2008), as amended (“Companies Act”)) facilitated by MTN (“MTN Zakhele Unwinding
       Scheme”). In broad terms, under the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme, MTN Zakhele will
       repurchase and cancel all of the MTN Zakhele Shares from MTN Zakhele Shareholders (save
       for a single share to be acquired by Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings Limited (“MTN
       Holdings”) and any shares held by dissenting MTN Zakhele Shareholders) in exchange for three
       consideration options in respect of each MTN Zakhele Shareholders' proportionate interest in
       such number of MTN Shares as remain in MTN Zakhele after taking into account, paying and/or
       providing for, all liabilities, costs/provisions and associated taxes of and incidental to the MTN
       Zakhele Unwind (“MTN Zakhele's Net Assets”).

       The following three options (or a combination thereof) are available for election by MTN
       Zakhele Shareholders in consideration for the disposal of their MTN Zakhele Shares to MTN
       Zakhele (subject to rounding and certain minimum election thresholds):

       Option 1

           -    A cash amount equal to the proceeds (net of all realisation costs and Securities
                Transfer Taxes (“STT”)) on disposal of their MTN Shares comprising their
                proportionate interest in MTN Zakhele's Net Assets.

       Option 2

           -    A number of MTN Shares equal to their proportionate interest in MTN Zakhele's Net
                Assets (net of STT).

       In addition, should the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction proceed, MTN Zakhele Shareholders will be
       offered an additional option, as follows:
      
       Option 3

           -   A re-investment alternative (“Re-investment Option”) in terms of which MTN Zakhele
               Shareholders will be given the option to elect to re-invest a portion (or, if applicable,
               all) of their proportionate interest in MTN Zakhele's Net Assets in the 2016 MTN BEE
               Transaction (“MTN Zakhele Re-investment” or “MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer”),
               such that the re-investing MTN Zakhele Re-investment Shareholders will (subject to
               applicable scaling principles and subsequent allocations) receive from MTN Zakhele a
               number of MTN Zakhele Futhi ordinary shares (“MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares”)
               in consideration for, and equivalent to the value, of their proportionate interest in
               MTN Zakhele's Net Assets (valued at the 30 trading day volume weighted average
               price (“VWAP”) of an MTN Share as at 17 November 2016 (“Repurchase Share
               Price”)). The Re-investment Option effectively allows MTN Zakhele Shareholders to
               elect to re-invest the “proceeds” received from the sale of their MTN Zakhele Shares
               to MTN Zakhele in MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares.

      Following the implementation of the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme (both in the event of
      the implementation of MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind or the MTN Zakhele Standalone
      Unwind, as the case may be), MTN Zakhele will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTN
      Holdings and MTN Holdings will undertake and manage the orderly unwinding and
      deregistration of MTN Zakhele in due course.

      If MTN Zakhele Shareholders do not approve the resolutions required to give effect to the
      MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme (or, for any other reason, the MTN Zakhele Unwinding
      Scheme fails to become operative), neither the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind nor the
      MTN Zakhele Standalone Unwind will proceed and none of the above unwind options will be
      available to MTN Zakhele Shareholders. However, to enable an orderly redemption by MTN
      Zakhele of the MTN Zakhele Pref Shares and related liabilities, the MTN Zakhele Specific
      Repurchase, as such term is defined in paragraph 3.2 below, will still be implemented should
      the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction proceed.

3.2   MTN Zakhele Specific Repurchase

      The specific repurchase of MTN Shares by MTN from MTN Zakhele (“MTN Zakhele Specific
      Repurchase”) is an integral part of the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction and is also one of the
      conditions to the third party funding of the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction. The MTN Zakhele
      Specific Repurchase will only occur if the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction proceeds.

      Under the agreement governing the MTN Zakhele Specific Repurchase, MTN will repurchase
      from MTN Zakhele such number of MTN Shares (“MTN Repurchase Shares”) at the
      Repurchase Share Price that will (i) enable MTN Zakhele to redeem the MTN Zakhele Pref
      Shares and pay or provide for other specified unwinding liabilities (settled in cash
      (“Repurchase Cash”)); and (ii) in the event the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme and the 2016
      MTN BEE Transaction proceed, facilitate the MTN Zakhele Re-investment (settled on loan
      account (“MTN Loan Claim”)).

      The number of MTN Shares repurchased for the MTN Loan Claim (“Repurchase Loan Shares”)
      will depend on the extent to which MTN Zakhele Shareholders elect the Re-investment Option,
      and on the levels of allocations made in respect thereof.

      The maximum aggregate number of MTN Repurchase Shares is 44,068,683 MTN Shares,
      representing approximately 2.4% of MTN's present fully diluted share capital (excluding the
      MTN Zakhele Specific Repurchase).

4.    SALIENT DETAILS OF THE 2016 MTN BEE TRANSACTION

4.1    MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer and the MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer

       MTN intends to implement the proposed 2016 MTN BEE Transaction, through MTN Zakhele
       Futhi, by means of the following core elements: (i) a public offering in terms of which black
       participants will be invited to subscribe for and beneficially own MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary
       Shares, subject to the qualification criteria set out in the prospectus to be published on or
       about 12 September 2016 (“Prospectus”) in respect of the offer (“MTN Zakhele Futhi Public
       Offer”); (ii) the MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer, if the MTN Zakhele Unwinding Scheme
       proceeds; (iii) MTN Zakhele Futhi raising third party finance through the issue of preference
       shares (“MTN Zakhele Futhi Pref Shares”); (iv) MTN providing MTN Zakhele Futhi with funding
       and vendor facilitation through, among others, notional vendor finance and the transaction
       discount provided by it; and (v) the subscription for MTN Shares by MTN Zakhele Futhi using
       the funding raised through these sources. (The MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer and the MTN
       Zakhele Re-investment Offer are, together, the “MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer”).

       The scheme is structured as an 8 year scheme, with the initial shareholders being locked-in for
       3 years, following which the shareholders may trade among other members of the black
       public.

       The 2016 MTN BEE Transaction is sized to ensure that, if fully subscribed and together with
       the continuing contribution of the MTN Zakhele BEE Transaction, it translates to an effective
       indirect black ownership in excess of 30% of MTN's South African operations under relevant
       industry transformation charters. It may be scaled down should public subscriptions under the
       MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer and/or the number of MTN Zakhele Shares in respect of which
       MTN Zakhele Shareholders elect the Re-investment Option not be sufficient. To the extent
       that the aggregate equity raised from (i) the black public in the MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer;
       and (ii) the level of the MTN Zakhele Re-investment under the MTN Zakhele Re-investment
       Offer is less than R1,234.1 million (representing an approximate 2% shareholding in MTN), the
       2016 MTN BEE Transaction will not be implemented.

       The MTN Share price at which the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction will be implemented is a 20%
       discount to the 10 day VWAP per MTN Share to 17 August 2016 of R128.50 (“Transaction
       Share Price”) i.e. R102.80.

        1. The size of the MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer component is indicative only and is
           provided merely for illustrative purposes. The portion available for re-investment is not
           presently fixed or subject to a minimum or maximum allocation. Any amounts not
           subscribed for through the MTN Zakhele Re-investment Offer will be available to the black
           public for subscription in the MTN Zakhele Futhi Public Offer.

5.   MTN ZAKHELE FUTHI PUBLIC OFFER

     The black public (including members of the black public participating via the MTN Zakhele Re-
     investment Offer) could ultimately have an economic interest in up to approximately 4% of
     MTN’s issued ordinary share capital on a fully diluted basis (excluding the MTN Zakhele Specific
     Repurchase) through their holding of MTN Zakhele Futhi Ordinary Shares through the MTN
     Zakhele Futhi Offer. It is anticipated that the MTN Zakhele Futhi Offer will be launched on or
     about 12 September 2016. The Prospectus, containing the details of the MTN Zakhele Futhi
     Public Offer, will be made available at participating Nedbank branches and MTN stores around
     South Africa to members of the black public who wish to participate. Presently, the MTN
     Zakhele Futhi Offer is expected to close on or about 21 October 2016, with a period of
     approximately 4 weeks thereafter to finalise the allocations.

     Only “black people” (or comparable term), as defined from time to time under relevant BEE
     legislation, and “black groups” (being black majority owned and majority controlled companies
     or entities) (collectively, “Black Public”) are eligible to participate in the MTN Zakhele Futhi
     Offer (“Black Participants”). Participants who are found to have misrepresented their BEE
     status or otherwise fail to qualify as part of the Black Public (or commit other material defaults
     during the Empowerment Period) may, at MTN's election, be forced to sell their MTN Zakhele
     Futhi Ordinary Shares to MTN, or persons identified by it, at a potentially significantly
     discounted price. In addition, Black Participants who are found to have misrepresented their
     BEE status may be guilty of a criminal offence (fraud).

6.   THE 2016 ESOP

     The purpose of the 2016 ESOP is to attract, motivate, reward and retain persons who contribute
     to the performance of the MTN Group on a basis which aligns their interests with those of the
     MTN Shareholders.

     MTN proposes to establish the 2016 ESOP for the benefit of eligible MTN employees (excluding
     management and directors). It is intended that the 2016 ESOP will be effective on or about 24
     November 2016. Participation in the 2016 ESOP is being facilitated by MTN and/or the relevant
     employer companies within the MTN group) and eligible MTN employees will not be required
     to contribute any funds to participate in allocations made to them.

7.   PRO FORMA FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE MTN ZAKHELE INTEGRATED UNWIND, 2016 MTN BEE
     TRANSACTION AND 2016 ESOP

     The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind,
     the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction and the 2016 ESOP on, inter alia, MTN’s net asset value per
     share, tangible net asset value per share, basic loss per share, diluted loss per share, headline
     loss per share and diluted headline loss per share, based on the most recently published
     reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial results of MTN for the 6 months ended 30
     June 2016.

     The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the MTN directors and was prepared
     for illustrative purposes only and may not, because of its nature, fairly present MTN’s financial
     position, changes in equity and results of its operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial
     information illustrates how the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind, the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction
     and the 2016 ESOP may have impacted the condensed consolidated statement of financial
     position and the condensed consolidated income statement of MTN assuming that the MTN
     Zakhele Integrated Unwind, the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction and the 2016 ESOP had occurred on
     30 June 2016 for purposes of the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial
     position and on 1 January 2016 for purposes of the pro forma condensed consolidated income
     statement. It does not purport to be indicative of what the financial results would have been,
     had the MTN Zakhele Integrated Unwind, the 2016 MTN BEE Transaction and the 2016 ESOP
     been implemented on a different date.

     The pro forma financial effects presented below have not been reported on by a reporting
     accountant. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. has been appointed to report on the
     compilation of the pro forma financial effects to be included in the circular to be posted to MTN
     shareholders (“Circular”), in due course, which Circular will contain their reasonable assurance
     report therein.

1. Certain financial information presented in these interim financial results has been prepared excluding
   the impact of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill impairment, tower profits and the Nigerian regulatory
   fine and constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment
   disclosure included in the reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial results for the six months ended 
   30 June 2016. This pro forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of hyperinflation
   and the relating goodwill impairment, tower profits and the Nigerian regulatory fine from the financial results
   in order to achieve a comparable analysis year on year. Hyperinflation adjustments and the relating goodwill
   impairment, tower profits and the Nigerian regulatory fine have been calculated in terms of the Group
   accounting policies disclosed in the previous consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
   The pro forma financial information including the constant currency information (refer below) incorporated in
   these condensed consolidated interim financial results has not been audited or reviewed by our external
   auditors. 
   
2. Constant currency (“organic”) information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in
   currency rates on the Group’s results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial
   reporting period’s results have been adjusted to the prior period’s average exchange rates determined as the
   average of the monthly exchange rates which can be found on www.mtn.com/investors. The measurement has been
   performed for each of the Group’s currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The
   organic growth percentage has been calculated based on the current period constant currency results compared to
   the prior period results. In addition, in respect of Irancell, MTN Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency
   information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. In 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed
   to no longer be a hyperinflationary environment. MTN therefore discontinued hyperinflation accounting in that
   operation effective 1 July 2015.

Overview
MTN continued to operate in a challenging environment for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The financial
performance for the period reflects the confluence of a number of material issues, which created the “perfect
storm”. The Group has made strides towards resolving these challenges although many of these factors fall
outside of its control.

The Group’s reported results were significantly impacted by the Nigerian regulatory fine. On 10 June MTN
Nigeria resolved this matter with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and agreed to pay the FGN a total cash
amount of 330 billion Nigerian naira (US$1,671 billion, using the exchange rate prevailing at the time) over
three years in a full and final settlement. This was agreed in addition to complying with certain other
regulatory conditions imposed as part of the settlement reached. The 50 billion naira (US$250 million) paid in good
faith and without prejudice by MTN Nigeria on 24 February 2016 forms part of the monetary component of the
settlement, leaving a balance of 280 billion naira (US$1,418 billion, using the exchange rate prevailing at the
time) outstanding. In June 2016 the first scheduled payment of 30 billion naira (US$124 million) was made. The
remaining cash payable at 30 June 2016 amounted to 250 billion naira (US$882 million). 

The Group has accrued the present value of 280 billion naira (US$1,418 billion, using the exchange rate
prevailing at the time), which in total had a negative impact of R10 499 million on reported earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and impairment of goodwill (EBITDA) and a R8 632 million negative
impact on the Group’s reported headline losses, or 474 cents on reported headline losses per share. The reported
impact on the Group’s statement of cash flow for the period amounted to R5 870 million, which equates to the 80
billion naira paid during the period. 

During the period, R1 324 million costs were incurred on a range of professional services relating to the
negotiations that led to a reduction of R34 billion in the Nigeria regulatory fine to 330 billion naira
(US$1,671 billion, using the exchange rate prevailing at the time). The board has exercised its judgement and 
approved the quantum of the professional fees incurred taking into account global benchmarks and the value 
delivered culminating in the final settlement of the Nigeria fine.

Apart from the Nigerian regulatory fine, the depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar had a
substantial impact on the Group’s results. This resulted in foreign exchange losses amounting to R3 606 million
during the period. MTN South Sudan reported an impairment on property, plant and equipment (PPE) of R259 million** 
(using a Rand/ Sudanese pound exchange rate of 0.376). When the impairment write-off is presented on an organic 
basis the impairment amounts to R2 632 million* (using a rand/Sudanese pound exchange rate of 3.837). This organic 
impairment write-off had a significant negative impact on organic EBITDA.

The Group’s underlying performance was impacted by weak macro-economic conditions affecting consumer
spending, the withdrawal of regulatory services in MTN Nigeria from July 2015 until May 2016 and disconnections of
subscribers related to subscriber registration requirements, mainly in Nigeria. MTN Nigeria disconnected the
last batch of 4,5 million subscribers in February 2016. MTN Uganda and MTN Cameroon were also impacted by
subscriber registration requirements. This resulted in significant free minutes provided for subscriber
re-registration campaigns, contributing to a 12,2%* decline in the effective voice tariff. The Group’s performance 
was further impacted by aggressive price competition and under-performance of MTN South Africa.

MTN Irancell (joint venture - equity accounted), MTN Ghana and MTN Cyprus delivered strong operational and
financial performances for the period.

EBITDA, excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine (R10 499 million), hyperinflation (R90 million)
and the realisation of the deferred profit from the sale of towers in Ghana (R18 million), declined 3,3%.
This was positively impacted by foreign exchange movements (23%). Organic EBITDA declined 25,9%*, negatively
impacted by R1 324 million in costs incurred on a range of professional services relating to the negotiations that
led to a reduction of R34 billion in the Nigerian regulatory fine and the impairment of PPE in South Sudan of
R2 632 million*. The impairment for PPE of South Sudan impacted organic EBITDA by 8,7%*. MTN South Sudan’s
full results impacted organic EBITDA by 9,8%*. Excluding the impact of professional fees relating to the
Nigerian regulatory fine negotiations and the MTN South Sudan impairment, EBITDA declined 12,8%*. 

The Group EBITDA margin declined 6,6 percentage points (pp) to 37,1%. This excludes the impact of the
Nigerian regulatory fine, hyperinflation and the realisation of the deferred profit from the sale of towers 
in Ghana.

Losses from joint ventures and associates amounted to R1 692 million**. This included a charge of R1 039
million** incurred by MTN Irancell, mainly relating to the depreciation and amortisation of hyper-inflated assets
that were historically written up under hyperinflation reporting. Upon the discontinuation of hyperinflation
accounting in Iran, effective 1 July 2015, hyperinflation adjustments are limited to the depreciation and
amortisation charges on previously hyper-inflated assets until 2033. The Group reported losses of R2 463 million
in relation to MTN’s share of Nigerian TowerCo losses, which were mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses
incurred on US dollar-denominated loans. In addition, the Group also reported short-term losses on MTN’s
share in Africa Internet Holdings (AIH), Middle East Internet Holdings (MEIH) and Iran Internet Group 
(IIG)(R494 million).

The Group reported a headline loss per share of 271 cents**, which was mainly as a result of the Nigerian
regulatory fine (474 cents**). Excluding the impact of the Nigerian fine, headline earnings per share (HEPS)
declined 69% to 203 cents. In addition, the headline number was negatively impacted by losses from joint ventures
and associates, which were negatively affected by hyperinflation of 20 cents** (positive impact of 40 cents**
in 2015), losses from the TowerCo’s of 136 cents** (3,5 cents** in 2015), AIH, MEIH and IIG of 27 cents** 
(18 cents** in 2015) and net forex losses of 135 cents** (52 cents** in 2015). This was further negatively
impacted by a range of professional services relating to the negotiations that led to the reduction in the Nigeria
regulatory fine (73 cents**). Excluding the impact of the fine, hyperinflation, losses from the TowerCo’s, AIH,
MEIH and IIG, forex losses and a range of professional fees relating to the fine negotiations, basic HEPS
declined 11,7% to 594 cents. 

Financial performance summary 
The Group continued to benefit from its significant scale and footprint, maintaining its leadership position
in 15 markets. Group subscriber numbers remained flat at 232,6 million following 6,6 million subscriber
disconnections over the six month period in Nigeria, Uganda and Cameroon. Since October 2015 approximately 
18 million subscribers across the Group were disconnected to ensure compliance with the subscriber registration
processes. MTN South Africa reported a decline in subscriber numbers mainly as a result of strong competition and
economic pressure in a highly penetrated market. 

Group revenue increased by 14,0% to R78 878 million, benefiting from the average exchange rate movement of
the rand against the naira. On an organic basis, Group revenue increased by 1,5%*, impacted by a decline in
outgoing voice and data revenue in Nigeria following the withdrawal of regulatory services from MTN Nigeria until
May 2016. This had a significant negative impact on MTN Nigeria’s revenue growth for the first four months of
the period. This was partly offset by higher revenue growth by MTN South Africa, supported by strong device
sales and an increase in data revenue during the period. 

The Group benefited from healthy double digit data revenue growth in the majority of the markets in which it
operates. Group data revenue increased by 32,2% (19,7%*) and contributed 25,2% to total revenue despite a
46,9% decline in the effective data tariff (in constant currency US dollar terms). Digital revenue, including
Mobile Financial Services revenue, contributed 32,1% to data revenue. This was supported by a 135% increase in
data traffic and the increased take up of digital lifestyle services. 

Outgoing voice revenue increased by 8,0% and decreased by 5,4%* on an organic basis. This was negatively
impacted by a 12,2%* decline in the effective voice tariff (average price per minute, in constant currency US
dollar terms) as a result of continued price competition, subscriber disconnections and free minutes used for
subscriber re-registration campaigns.  The use of multiple SIM cards, increased substitution for data services
and increased pressure on consumer spending also negatively impacted outgoing voice revenue.

MTN Nigeria’s competitiveness was compromised by the mandatory disconnection of subscribers and the
suspension of regulatory services until May 2016 when the operation attained the necessary approvals to introduce
market-related pricing plans and promotions. In addition, the introduction of regulatory restrictions on
“out-of-bundle” data tariffs impacted MTN Nigeria’s data revenue growth. 

MTN South Africa’s revenue increased mainly as a result of higher device sales and data revenue. These were
supported by our continued investment in our 3G and LTE network as well as attractive data and digital value
propositions. Growth in outgoing voice revenue remained a challenge, impacted by a 48 hour network outage
affecting approximately one million subscribers in February 2016 and higher churn in the post-paid segment.

Excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine, hyperinflation and tower profits, the Group EBITDA
margin declined by 6,6 pp to 37,1%. This was a result of the lower EBITDA margins in Nigeria and South Africa.
The EBITDA margin in Nigeria was impacted by the 4,8%* decline in revenue and an 11,3%* increase in costs mainly
as a result of the transfer of the second tranche of the previously sold passive infrastructure into the
TowerCo as well as US dollar-denominated expenses associated with the TowerCo and build-to-suit sites. Costs were
further impacted by increased marketing and commission spend related to re-connecting subscribers affected by
the subscriber registration process. MTN South Africa’s EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by lower handset
margins following aggressive handset sales and increased network-related costs associated with the expansion
of 3G and LTE sites.

Cash inflows generated by operations decreased by 9,2%** to R23 870 million** mainly as a result of the down
payment of R5 870 million** relating to the Nigerian regulatory fine during the period.

The Group continued to increase investment in the network with a focus on increasing coverage, speed and
quality of 3G and LTE in prime areas to support the increasing demand for data services. Capital expenditure
(capex) increased by 26,9% (15,4%*) to R13 772 million. MTN South Africa’s capex amounted to R4 773 million,
representing 34,7% of total capex. Capex in Nigeria amounted to R2 534 million and was impacted by delays in
network re-planning. More recently, our capex in Nigeria was impacted by the limited availability
of US dollars. During the period, the Group rolled out 873 2G sites, 3 660 co-located 3G sites and 2 691 LTE
sites. The Group also rolled out 1 132 km of long-distance fibre and connected a total of 422 sites to fibre. 
Capex spend included the purchase of LTE spectrum and licences in various markets to enable better quality
data networks across its operations.

Leadership changes 
During the period the Group announced the appointment of new executives and additional independent
non-executive directors to the board with the objective of strengthening management, enhancing governance and aiding
the strategy of the Group.

Management 
Following a widespread executive search, MTN announced the appointment of Rob Shuter as the new Group
president and CEO. Rob will join MTN as soon as is practically possible in 2017 but no later than 1 July 2017. 
Rob has extensive experience in telecoms and banking across Africa and Europe, including holding the position of
CEO, Vodafone Europe cluster. The Group also welcomes the newly appointed vice presidents (VPs): 
- Stephen van Coller, VP for M&A and Strategy, effective 1 October 2016, who brings with him commercial and
  banking experience, and will help broaden MTN’s skill set as the Company evolves beyond telecommunications;
- Godfrey Motsa, VP for the South and East Africa region (excluding South Africa), who brings vast
  experience in telecoms and operating within Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Kholekile Ndamase was appointed as deputy head of mergers and acquisitions, with effect from 10 September
  2016. Kholekile joins MTN from Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), where he led the equity based financing business.

The Group appointed Babak Fouladi as Group chief technology and information officer, effective 1 June 2016.
Babak will spend 12 months as chief and technology officer for the South African operation until the network
is operating at an optimum level and higher quality before taking on the Group role. Babak brings with him
global expertise and experience to build and lead strong teams to drive and implement on large-scale converged
networks, complex systems and applications.

Brett Goschen, the Group chief financial officer (CFO), will be leaving MTN after 14 years of service to
MTN, effective 30 September 2016. At the same time he will be stepping down from the board of directors of the
Group. The board of directors and management would like to thank Brett for his valuable contribution to the
Group.Gunter Engling, currently CEO of MTN Rwanda and previously Group finance executive, will assume the position
of Acting Group CFO on Brett’s departure until a permanent CFO is appointed. The Group hopes to appoint a new
CFO before the year-end.

After completing his two key mandates of settling the Nigerian fine and appointing the new Group CEO,
Phuthuma Nhleko will revert to his role as non-executive chairman as soon as Rob Shuter assumes his position as
Group president and CEO. In the interim, Phuthuma will hand over more operational responsibility to Stephen van
Coller and Gunter Engling and will continue to provide the necessary leadership as non-executive chairman for a
maximum period of two years (until no later than December 2018) when he plans to step down from this position.

Board of directors (appointments and resignations)
The Group also refreshed the composition of the board of directors for MTN Group and MTN South Africa,
providing more in-depth commercial, risk and governance skills and experience.

Specifically, the following individuals have been appointed to the Group board of directors as independent
non-executive directors effective 1 August 2016:
- Stan Miller has global experience in expanding businesses into new markets, exposure to convergence, as
  well as strong business and operational acumen. His telecoms experience ranges from co-founding subscription
  television channel M-Net to leading the growth of Dutch telecoms company KPN in the Netherlands. He is the
  executive chairman of AINMT A.B. Sweden and non-executive member of the board of MTS JSC. Russia, a
  telecommunications operator in Russia.
- Paul Hanratty brings a wealth of experience in financial services in the UK, US, Africa, Asia and Latin
  America. He has worked at Old Mutual for over 30 years and has sat on the boards of various other financial
  services companies. Paul has extensive M&A experience and has devised and implemented growth strategies for
  businesses in many countries.
- Nkululeko “Nkunku” Sowazi is the chairman of Kagiso Tiso Holdings, a leading South African investment
  holding company, with significant interests in the media, financial and industrial sectors. Nkunku was the
  executive chairman and co-founder of the Tiso Group and is currently a director of Grindrod Limited, a JSE listed
  company, and a non-executive director of listed and unlisted organisations spanning Ghana, the UK, the US and
  South Africa. Nkunku has had significant exposure to listed and non-listed Boards and has extensive experience in
  M&A and management transformation. He sat on the Nominations Committee, Audit & Risk Committees at Exxaro 
  and Aveng.

MJN Njeke and JHN Strydom, who served on the board of directors of the Group as independent non-executive
directors for an aggregate period in excess of nine years, retired as directors of the Group at the Annual
General Meeting held on 25 May 2016. The board of directors of the Group thanks them for their valuable
contribution over the years. 

Mike Harper, Mike Bosman, Lerato Phalatse and Trudi Makhaya have been appointed as independent non-executive
directors to the board of directors of MTN South Africa, effective 1 July 2016. The commercial experience of
these additional directors will greatly benefit MTN South Africa. These directors collectively have extensive
experience in the media, insurance, retail banking and FMCG sectors as well as in-depth knowledge of
stakeholder engagement.

Prospects 
The MTN Group continues to work towards achieving its vision of “leading the delivery of a bold, new Digital
World to our customers”. The Group is in the process of undertaking, with external assistance, a deep and
fundamental strategic review of its operations and processes  to ensure it is operating far more optimally given
the pressure on voice revenues, evolving customer needs for high quality data and more complex and competitive
market environments. This will reset and position the business for future growth in a rapidly evolving sector.
 
As part of the review, the following key areas will be addressed: 
- An advanced analytics unit will be established to support the business to drive network quality and
  high-speed data connectivity especially in key locations with high demand, provide compelling segmented offerings 
  to consumers and enterprises, improve customer service and increase targeted smartphone uptake.
- Operating efficiencies and improving customer service remain a priority with a focus on the service
  channels productivity through digitisation and leveraging Mobile Money as a distribution channel. Continued network
  optimisation and improved opex management, including the implementation of zero-based budgeting, will also
  contribute to improving efficiencies.
- The Group will continue to explore opportunities to create value through leveraging its extensive
  infrastructure across Africa and the Middle East.
- Improving the way of work through increased co-ordination between different parts of the business is key
  to the success of this strategy.
- The Group will embark on a process of housing new revenue streams, particularly Digital services, outside
  the core business. This will allow for more agility and greater flexibility to accelerate growth in these
  areas. New revenue streams are expected to increase their contribution to revenue over the next 12-18 months. 

The Group will also continue to seek value-accretive expansion opportunities in selected geographies across
Africa and the Middle East. 

MTN’s investments in towers with IHS Holding Limited are evidenced by our substantial ownership interest in
INT Towers Limited and our direct investment in IHS. IHS continues to grow and develop its business with
leading market positions in 5 markets and has recently led in-market consolidation in Africa through its
acquisition of Helios Towers Nigeria. IHS is now the largest independent tower operator in EMEA by tower count 
and the tenth largest independent tower company in the world, with more than 24,000 towers. IHS is extremely well
positioned for future growth and build-out from 3G upgrades and the move to LTE across its key markets. MTN will
benefit from IHS’ strong growth, IHS will also help us accelerate our network expansion in markets such as
Nigeria further improving the benefits and services for our customers.

MTN aims to list MTN Nigeria on The Nigerian Stock Exchange during 2017 and has established a management
task team with the responsibility to guide the company towards such a listing. The proposed listing is subject to
suitable market prevailing circumstances and conditions and the appropriate approvals from relevant
regulators and other stakeholders. 

MTN Ghana will proceed with the localisation of 35% of its shares during the course of 2016. This is a
requirement of winning the auction for a 4G/LTE licence earlier this year.  

We are confident that by year-end we would have successfully completed our proposed management changes. In
2017, we will have a permanent and refreshed senior management team to take the Group forward. 

In Nigeria, following the reinstatement of regulatory services, we expect to improve our competitiveness in
this market and anticipate an improved performance for the remainder of the year. Data growth will also
benefit from the increased investment in 3G and LTE networks in key cities and the utilisation of the recently
acquired spectrum. 

We anticipate a positive growth trend in South Africa, supported by a strong focus on customer service and
improving the network quality, capacity and speed. Data growth will continue to be underpinned by our on-going
significant investment in 3G and LTE.

The continued easing of sanctions in Iran and its related economic uplift offers significant opportunities
to expand services particularly in the digital space, benefiting from MTN’s strong position and a youthful
population. MTN continues to work towards remitting some of its cash amounting to approximately R15,4 billion from
MTN Irancell, although this a complex process. 

In November 2016, MTN’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) vehicle, MTN Zakhele will unwind.
Upon unwinding, MTN Zakhele shareholders will be given the option to receive cash, MTN shares or potentially
re-invest into a new scheme. MTN is currently reviewing various options to create a new scheme to maintain its
BBBEE ownership credentials in line with the BBBEE codes.

The Group has declared an interim dividend of 250 cps. The FY 2016 minimum dividend, as previously noted at
the Group’s FY2015 results, is anticipated to be 700cps. This takes into consideration the impact of the
Nigerian regulatory fine and the limited US dollar liquidity in Nigeria. The minimum dividend remains at the
discretion of the board. Should operating conditions improve materially, we would look to declare a higher dividend
than advised.

TO LEAD THE DELIVERY OF A BOLD, NEW DIGITAL WORLD TO OUR CUSTOMERS
The Group continues to focus on growing non-voice revenue given the rapid evolution of telecommunications
into a data-led industry. Revenue is no longer driven by subscriber numbers but rather by consumer spending
patterns towards data and digital services. MTN is more agile and innovative and has a deeper understanding of
customer needs, enabling it to compete effectively.

GROUP CONSUMER
The Group Consumer division’s focus for the period was to integrate customer analytics across the operations
to meet customers’ changing needs. Improving analytics is a key priority for the Group with substantial room
for improvement and will form part of the strategic review the Group is currently undergoing. 

During the period a number of global value propositions were introduced. “MTN Go”, a bundle plan focusing on
driving the transition to data, was launched in six markets and “MTN Hello World”, a global roaming
proposition, was launched in ten markets. 

The Group’s net promoter score (NPS) improved from 24% in December 2015 to 27% in June 2016, closing the gap
with its competitors. This was mainly driven by improvement on the network, value offerings and brand image.
Improving NPS remains a key focus.

GROUP DIGITAL SERVICES 
Group Digital Services continued to expand its e-commerce, digital media and mobile financial services
across Africa and the Middle East, leveraging MTN’s core competencies of a strong brand, knowledge of and access 
to customers, scale and distribution. MTN recorded strong growth in digital services revenue, supported by
lifestyle and Mobile Financial Services. MTN recently launched Games Club, our premium gaming proposition and
continued to gain strong momentum on its music offerings as one of the major distributors of digital music 
in Africa.

MTN Mobile Money registered customers increased by 5,0% to 36,5 million across 15 countries and increased
revenue by 40,8%* to R1 289 million when compared to June 2015. Active customers increased by 18,0%, supported
by a strong performance from MTN Uganda, MTN Ghana, MTN Rwanda and MTN Benin. Revenue growth was supported by
focused customer engagement and a common, more agile platform enabling converged campaigns and incentives. MTN
continues to focus on advanced financial services such as remittance services, micro-lending and saving
offerings and recorded 160 000 agents. 

AIH and MEIH, MTN’s e-commerce joint ventures, continue to deliver good growth. While performance in the AIH
business was negatively impacted by the macro-economic slowdown in Nigeria, MEIH continued to gain strong
momentum. Unit economics in both businesses continued to improve. AIH recorded approximately 3 million customers,
and approximately 2,5 million transactions and 1,3 million leads on its classified business in the six-month
period. In addition, MEIH comprises seven companies in the Middle East, with approximately 600 000 customers
and 3,3 million transactions during the period. IIG, our Iranian e-commerce business, gained strong momentum,
supported by its taxi-hailing business benefiting from a youthful population and high smartphone penetration.

The TravelStart business, in which MTN acquired a 37,3% indirect interest through Amadeus, recorded 259 000
bookings during the period.

ENTERPRISE BUSINESS UNIT (EBU)
In the six-month period, EBU continued to align operations to become the ICT partner of choice for corporate, 
multinational, SME and public sector customers. While there is a clear opportunity in this market, the EBU 
function continues to operate in a competitive environment with little traction gained. The Group, as part of
its strategic review, will embark on a process aimed at accelerating growth in this area. 

We continued to focus on the MTN Business Cloud, a hybrid platform using Windows Azure Pack, which is
available across all MTN operating companies offering infrastructure, platforms and databases as services. MTN
Business has also extended its Cloud Delivery Platform to provide various independent software vendor solutions,
particularly to SMEs in four markets. MTN Business invested in the rollout of Global MPLS (multiple protocol
label switching) across 27 points of presence together with centralised global monitoring and reporting services.
In addition, MTN Business has launched dedicated internet services to its clients in 11 markets. It also
extended its Pan African Internet of Things platform to Ghana and Cameroon during the period.

Financial review
Revenue 
Group revenue increased 14,0% to R78 878 million for the six-month period. This was positively impacted by
the average exchange rate movement of the rand against the naira when compared to the previous corresponding
period. Over the period, the average rand weakened against all our major revenue contributing currencies,
declining 22,3% against the US dollar and 18,5% against the naira. In addition, the rand weakened 16,0% against the
Iranian rial, 21,9% against the Ghanaian cedi, 21,8% against the Central African franc, 11,7% against the
Ugandan shilling and 20,0% against the Sudanese pound. The rand strengthened 36,6% against the Syrian pound.

On an organic basis, Group revenue increased by 1,5%*. WECA revenue decreased by 2,5%* and remains the
largest contributor to total Group revenue at 59% at the end of June 2016. SEA grew revenue by 7,6%* and
contributed 32% to total Group revenue while MENA increased revenue by 1,9%* and contributed 9% to total Group revenue.

The lower-than-expected revenue growth was negatively impacted by a decline in revenue growth in Nigeria
(down 4,8%*), Cameroon (down 8,7%*), Ivory Coast (down 3,9%*) and Uganda (down 2,3%*). Regulatory challenges and
aggressive competition negatively impacted revenue growth in these markets. This was partly offset by higher
revenue growth in South Africa and Ghana, which increased by 5,1% and 18,9%* respectively. South Africa’s
increase in revenue was driven by higher handset sales and data revenue growth during the period while Ghana’s
healthy revenue growth was attributable to competitive voice and data offerings. Sudan and Syria also supported
growth in total Group revenue and increased revenue by 15,7%* and 10,5%*, respectively.

Total outgoing voice revenue declined by 5,4%* and contributed 57% to total Group revenue while data revenue
increased by 19,7%* and contributed 25% to total Group revenue. Incoming voice revenue declined by 2,7%* and
contributed 10% to total Group revenue. Device revenue increased 36,5%* and contributed 5% to total Group
revenue. SMS and other revenue comprise the remaining 3% of total Group revenue. SMS revenue decreased 22,0%*.

Outgoing voice revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in Nigeria (down 5,6%*) and South Africa (down
6,1%). Nigeria was impacted by the subscriber disconnections related to the subscriber registration process and
the withdrawal of regulatory services until the beginning of May 2016. The decline in South African revenue
was negatively impacted by a 48 hour network outage in February 2016 and increased churn in the post-paid
segment due to competition. While average voice traffic increased 7,9%, the Group US dollar effective voice tariff
in constant currency terms declined 12,2%*. This was largely due to free minutes offered as an incentive to
win-back disconnected subscribers and price competition in the majority of the key markets.

Data revenue growth was supported by healthy double-digit growth in the majority of operations despite a
continued reduction in data pricing as a result of competition. Data traffic increased 135,3% while the effective
data tariff declined 46,9%* (in constant currency US dollar terms). This was partly offset by a decline in
data revenue in Nigeria (down 2,7%*) as a result of stringent regulatory restrictions when charging
“out-of-bundle” data rates. 

Digital revenue contributed 32,1% to total Group data revenue, supported by healthy growth in Mobile
Financial Services and an increased uptake of content services. These include entertainment, religious and
educational services. 

Costs 
Group operating costs excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine, hyperinflation and tower profits
increased by 27,4% to R49 605 million. This was impacted by average exchange rate movements of the rand against 
the operating currencies, which had a negative impact of R1,8 billion.

On an organic basis, total Group costs increased by 22,8%*. WECA increased its costs by 9,1%* and
contributed 52% to total Group costs while SEA increased its costs by 37,2%* and contributed 36% to total Group costs.
MENA increased costs by 1,9%* and contributed 10% to total Group costs. Head office costs contributed 2% to
total Group costs. 

Once-off costs included professional fees of R1 324 million and PPE impairment in South Sudan of R2 632
million*. Excluding these costs incurred, costs increased by 12,6%*. During the period R1 324 million* costs were
incurred on a range of professional services relating to the negotiations that led to a reduction of R34
billion in the Nigerian regulatory fine. 

The increase in total costs was mainly as a result of higher costs in Nigeria (up 11,3%*). This was largely
impacted by US dollar-denominated exposure mainly associated with the previously concluded tower transactions,
rent and utilities related to build-to-suit sites, as well marketing and distribution costs related to the
subscriber registration process. MTN South Africa costs were higher by 14,0%, impacted by the increase in
network-related costs associated with the network expansion during the period. In South Sudan, the impairment on PPE
of R259 million had a significant impact on SEA costs. 

Total direct network operating costs increased 33,3%* and contributed 25% to total costs while device costs
increased by 33,5%* and contributed 12% to total costs. Interconnect and roaming costs increased 2,3%* and
contributed 15% to total costs while staff costs increased 7,6%* and contributed 10% to total Group costs.
Selling, distribution and marketing costs increased marginally and contributed 19% to total Group costs. Government
and regulatory costs declined 5,3%* and contributed 6% to total Group costs while other operating costs
increased 93,9%* and contributed 13% to total Group costs.

The increase in direct network operating costs was due to aggressive 3G and LTE network expansion in key
markets, higher rent and utilities costs and foreign-denominated expenses mainly in Nigeria. The increase in
device costs was mainly a result of higher volumes of smartphones sold in South Africa.

EBITDA 
Reported Group EBITDA decreased 38,4%** to R18 882 million**. This was negatively impacted by the accrual
for the Nigerian regulatory fine (R10 499 million**) following the agreed settlement on 10 June 2016. The
deferred profit from the sale of towers in Ghana (R18 million**) and an adjustment for hyperinflation (R90
million**) positively impacted Group EBITDA. 

Excluding these, EBITDA decreased by 3,3% to R29 273 million. This was positively impacted by foreign
exchange movements of 23% of which South Sudan made up 8,7%.

On an organic basis, EBITDA declined by 25,9%*. WECA EBITDA declined by 14,0%* and contributed 70% to total
EBITDA. SEA’s EBITDA decreased by 47,3%* and contributed 25% to EBITDA while MENA increased EBITDA by 1,9%*
and contributed 8% to total EBITDA. Head office negatively impacted EBITDA by 3%.

Organic EBITDA was negatively impacted by once-off costs in the period. In addition, organic EBITDA was
negatively impacted by a decline in Nigeria (down 16,9%*) and South Africa (down 11,1%). MTN Nigeria’s decline in
EBITDA was as a result of the second tranche transfer of passive infrastructure into the TowerCo as well as US
dollar-denominated expenses associated with the TowerCo and build-to-suit sites. MTN South Africa’s EBITDA
was negatively impacted by higher device costs and an increase in network-related costs following aggressive
expansion of its 3G and LTE rollout. MTN Ghana (up 16,3%*), MTN Syria (up 94,9%*) and MTN Sudan (up 23,0%*)
supported total Group EBITDA. This was attributable to efficient cost control in Ghana, Cameroon and Sudan despite
the depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar. The growth in MTN Syria’s EBITDA was mainly due to
the decrease in revenue share to 30% from 50% following the conversion of the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
licence into a full licence. 

Excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine, tower profits and hyperinflation, the Group recorded a
6,6 pp decline in its EBITDA margin to 37,1%, largely impacted by lower margins in Nigeria and South Africa
and the once-off costs reported in the period.

Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation increased by 22,3% (8,1%*) to R10 858 million impacted by higher depreciation charges in South
Africa as a result of higher capex in 2015. Amortisation costs increased by 17,2% (3,9%*) to R2 152 million,
driven by higher spend on software in previous years and the goodwill impairments in Guinea Conakry (R402
million) and Afrihost (R202 million).

Net finance costs 
Net finance costs amounted to R5 461 million compared to R2 320 million recorded in the previous comparable
period. This was due to an increase in net foreign exchange losses to R3 606 million from R1 481 million in
the prior period, impacted by unfavourable exchange rates at the end of the period, in particular the
depreciation of the Nigerian naira against the US dollar and the Iranian rial against the rand. An increase in net
interest paid to R1 855 million from R839 million paid in the previous comparable period also contributed to the
increase in net finance costs. The increase in the net interest expense is due to the higher net debt of R49 257
million** compared to R17 161 million** reported in the comparable period.

Net foreign exchange losses include:
- Forex losses in Mauritius of R1 078 million relating mainly to the Iran receivables;
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R1 124 million incurred on US dollar-denominated intercompany loans and third
  party payables (R2 034 million of the losses on third party US dollar loans have been deferred in equity
  following the application of net investment hedge accounting);
- Forex losses of R408 million in South Sudan on third party US dollar payables;
- Forex losses of R395 million in Sudan mainly on settlement of third party trade payables; and
- Forex losses of R178 million in South Africa on foreign exchange contracts relating to foreign payables in
  respect of the purchase of handsets.
  
Following the significant depreciation of the Sudanese pound, MTN South Sudan’s foreign currency translation
reserves included in equity amounted to approximately R3 billion at 30 June 2016. Should the Group decide to
exit this operation, this amount will be recycled to the income statement as a loss.

Share of results of joint ventures and associates after tax 
Joint ventures and associates reported a loss of R1 692 million** compared to a gain of R2 027 million** in
the previous comparable period. This included a charge of R1 039 million** incurred by Iran mainly relating to
the subsequent depreciation and amortisation of previously hyper-inflated assets that were historically
written up under hyperinflation reporting. Iran hyperinflation accounting was discontinued effective 1 July 2015.
Losses of R2 463 million** from the Nigerian TowerCo were mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses (R2 282
million**) on US dollar-denominated loans and short-term losses from AIH, MEIH and IIG (R494 million**).

TAXATION 
The Group’s reported effective tax rate decreased to negative 309,5%** from 31,0%** in the previous
comparable period, impacted by the Nigeria regulatory fine and hyperinflation. Excluding this impact, the effective
tax rate increased to 49,2% from 32,9% in the previous comparable period. Lower profit before tax was due to the
reported losses in joint ventures and associates, which impacted profit before tax, the higher ratio of
withholding tax and denied assessed losses in Guinea Conakry  and South Sudan as well as by a range of professional
services relating to the negotiations that led to a reduction of R34 billion in the Nigerian regulatory fine.
If the loss before tax is further analysed and adjusted for the effects of losses from joint ventures and
associates, South Sudan unrealised forex losses, the Guinea  Conakry goodwill impairment, the South Sudan PPE
impairment and a range of professional fees relating to the Nigerian regulatory fine, the Group effective tax
rate decreases to 33,0%.

The Group’s taxation charge decreased by 24,6% (25,0%*) to R4 694  million for the period. This was a result
of lower profit before tax and a higher deferred tax credit due to increased unrealised foreign exchange
losses on US dollar-denominated intercompany loans and third party payables in Nigeria. 

Earnings/losses 
The Group reported a basic headline loss per share of 271 cents** largely impacted by the Nigerian
regulatory fine expense (474 cents**), hyperinflation (20 cents**), and losses incurred on the Group’s investments in
Rocket (27 cents**) and tower companies (136 cents**). The headline figure was further impacted by forex losses
(135 cents**) and by a range of professional services relating to the negotiations that led to a reduction in
the Nigerian regulatory fine (73 cents**). Excluding these impacts, HEPS declined 11,7% to 594 cents. The
attributable loss per share was 301 cents** from attributable earnings per share of 653 cents in the comparative
period.

MTN South Africa reported a lower-than-expected performance, negatively impacted by network outages in some
areas, competition and economic pressure impacting consumer spending. The result was supported by good growth
in data usage benefiting from aggressive smartphone device sales and continued efforts to improve 3G and LTE
network quality. The operation’s subscriber base declined 2,6% to 29,8 million. The pre-paid and post-paid
segments declined by 2,7% to 24,7 million and 2,1% to 5,1 million, respectively. 

Total revenue increased by 5,1% to R19 841 million mainly as a result of higher data and device revenue
growth. This was partly offset by a 6,1% decline in outgoing voice revenue. Service revenue, which excludes device
revenue, remained relatively flat. Data revenue increased by 19,2%, contributing 34,1% to total revenue. The
number of smartphones on the network increased by 18,4% to 9,3 million (restated to align with the Group
definition) while megabytes per user increased 53,8% for the period. Device sales in the previous comparable period
were impacted by the industrial strike action and supply chain challenges. 

Digital revenue gained momentum and contributed 13,5% to data revenue. This was attributable to additional
services being offered, including international content. EBU continued to operate in a competitive environment.
During the period the operation entered into a sales agreement to dispose of its 50,02% stake in Afrihost
(Proprietary) Ltd.

The EBITDA margin declined by 5,5 pp to 30,1% mainly as a result of increased device costs relating to
higher volumes sold and the impact of network-related costs as a result of the continued rollout of 3G and 
LTE sites.

Capex for the six months amounted to R4 773 million with the rollout of 369 co-located 3G sites and 284 LTE
sites. The operation continued to improve quality and capacity of the network in key cities to cater for
increased data traffic. In addition, 175 sites were connected to fibre. Fibre to the home connections remain a
priority with approximately 10 000 homes passed, of which 40% were rolled out during the period. 

On 15 July 2016, the national regulator, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA)
published an invitation to apply for high demand spectrum, in the 700MHz, 800Mhz and 2.6GHz spectrum bands. ICASA
expects to conclude the licensing by the end of March 2017. There are four lots on offer with a reserve price of
R3 billion. MTN has been analysing the invitation and is actively preparing documentation to meet the
deadline for enquiries relating to the Information Technology Act (ITA). MTN has noted, with interest, media reports
that the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services intends to challenge ICASA regarding the
abovementioned ITA and MTN will continue to monitor the developments.

Other SEA - across the rest of the region subscribers increased by 3,6% to 23,1 million for the period. This
was mainly underpinned by good growth in Uganda.

MTN Uganda increased its subscriber base by 10,8% for the six months to 9,9 million following the
disconnection of subscribers reported in the second half of 2015. This was supported by customer acquisitions through
voice bundle propositions and the continued success of MTN Zone, resulting in market share growth to 52,7%.

Total revenue declined by 2,3%* mainly as a result of a decline in both outgoing and incoming voice revenue
impacted by the implementation of the One Network Area, the decline in mobile termination rates and the impact
of the disconnections in the second half of 2015. Data revenue increased by 22,7%* and contributed 32,8% to
total revenue. This was supported by data bundles, including successful shorter-duration bundles. 

Digital revenue contributed 70,5% to data revenue, supported by local content services including MTN Play.
MTN Mobile Money customers decreased 24,4% to 7,2 million mainly as a result of the disconnections during the
subscriber registration process in the second half of 2015.

MTN Uganda’s EBITDA margin decreased by 6,0 pp to 30,0%, impacted by higher network operating costs and
associated US dollar-denominated expenses, as well as higher transmission costs following the rollout of a 3G and
LTE network. Higher marketing and distribution costs were incurred mainly as a result of the launch of 3G and
4G services. 

Capex decreased by 42,1%* to R364 million, impacted by a delay in the supply chain process. During the
period, 195 co-located 3G and 100 LTE sites were rolled out.

MTN Nigeria continued to experience a challenging operating environment impacted by the disconnection of the
final batch of subscribers in compliance with the subscriber registration process during the period. The
operation was also impacted by the inability to offer competitive prices as a result of the suspension of
regulatory services until May 2016, when the operation obtained the necessary approval to offer competitive pricing
plans and promotions. Tough economic conditions further negatively impacted consumer spending. MTN Nigeria
increased market share to 46,2%, despite the decline in its subscriber base by 3,7% to 58,9 million (including 
568 000 Visafone subscribers).

Total revenue declined by 4,8%* as a result of lower outgoing voice revenue and lower data revenue. These
were impacted by regulatory requirements to seek permission to charge “out-of-bundle” data rates, multi-SIMs and
delays in competitive offerings. Data revenue declined by 2,7%* and contributed 19,3% to total revenue. The
number of smartphones on the network increased by 11,2% to 16,0 million. 

Digital revenue continued to gain momentum and contributed 51,7% to data revenue. This was supported by good
growth in music and other lifestyle content services. 

The number of registered accounts on MTN Nigeria’s Mobile Money offering, Diamond Yellow, increased by 5,0%
to 6,5 million. 

The EBITDA margin declined by 7,5 pp to 49,8%, impacted by the transfer of the second tranche of passive
infrastructure into the TowerCo as well as US dollar-denominated expenses associated with the TowerCo and
build-to-suit sites. This was further impacted by a 13,8%* increase in marketing costs relating to the subscriber
registration process as well as a range of professional services fees incurred to the settlement of the
regulatory fine.

Over the six month period, 428 3G sites and 507 LTE sites were rolled out. The operation experienced some
delays in the network re-planning and a delay with equipment purchases as a result of foreign exchange
limitations. Capex for the period increased by 78,9%* to R2 534 million. Improving the quality of the 3G co-located
network and the rollout of LTE remains a priority. During the period, the operation purchased additional LTE
spectrum for a consideration of R1 billion. 

Other WECA - the remainder of the region increased its subscriber base by 2,8% to 46,6 million driven by
solid growth in Ghana and satisfactory growth in Cameroon. 

MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance and grew its subscriber base by 8,1% to 17,6 million. This was
supported by the launch of LTE services, the first operator to do so, as well as attractive value propositions,
which contributed to market share growth to 53,8%.

Total revenue increased by 18,9%*, supported by strong growth in data and outgoing voice revenue. Data
revenue grew by 68,0%* and contributed 38,5% to total revenue supported by data bundles, including 4G data bundles,
benefiting from superior data network quality and increased smartphone penetration. Smartphones on the
network increased by 21,7% to 3,6 million.

Digital revenue showed healthy growth, underpinned by attractive lifestyle content bundles and good momentum
gained in mobile financial services. Digital revenue contributed 47,9% to data revenue. MTN Mobile Money
subscribers increased by 23,3% to 7,0 million, supported by international remittances.

The EBITDA margin declined 0,9 pp to 38,8% mainly as a result of higher transmission costs and the impact of
foreign-denominated expenses following the depreciation of the cedi, as well as high inflation.

Capex increased by more than 100%* to R1 646 million with a key focus on the rollout of LTE sites. The
operation added 110 co-located 3G and 435 LTE sites during the period. Capex includes the 4G licence acquired 
in H2 15.

MTN Cameroon increased its subscriber base by 5,0% to 9,6 million despite the subscriber registration
process, which was relatively well managed and supported by aggressive subscriber registration campaigns. Market
share grew to 57,4% as a result of improved network quality, expansion of the LTE footprint and increased
smartphone penetration. 

Total revenue declined by 8,7%* mainly as a result of a decline in outgoing voice revenue impacted by price
competition and free minutes used in relation to the subscriber registration process. However, data revenue
increased by 49,5%* and contributed 18,8% to total revenue. This was supported by increased 3G device
penetration and the rollout of 3G and LTE networks. Smartphones on the network increased by 34,1% to 2,6 million.

period the operation rolled out 189 co-located 3G sites and 64 LTE sites.

MTN Ivory Coast reported a decline in its subscriber base of 1,3% to 8,2 million, negatively impacted by the
subscriber registration requirements and aggressive competition.

Total revenue decreased by 3,9%* mainly due to lower outgoing voice revenue impacted by a decrease in
minutes from a lower subscriber base. This was partially offset by a 13,4%* increase in data revenue, which
contributed 17,1% to total revenue. This was supported by the introduction of new segmented data bundles and an
increase in 3G and LTE coverage. Growth in data revenue was also attributable to a switch from WiMax devices to LTE
TDD devices.

Digital revenue contributed 50,2% to data revenue, driven by an increase in digital services offered. MTN
Mobile Money continued to make good progress and increased registered subscribers by 10,4% to 3,2 million.

(1) Represents the exclusion of the impact of hyperinflation and the relating goodwill impairment of certain of 
    the Group’s subsidiaries (MTN Sudan and MTN Syria) and the Group’s joint venture in Iran, being accounted
    for on a hyperinflationary basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the
    respective financial statement line items affected. During 2015, the Iranian economy was assessed to no
    longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued effective 1 July 2015.

(2)  Represents the exclusion of the financial impact relating to the sale of tower assets during the
     financial period on the respective financial line items impacted, which include:
     - Tower sales profits for the period related to the Ghana release of deferred profit of R18 million 
       (H1 15: The re-measurement of the contingent consideration receivable from the Nigeria tower transaction 
       (tranche 1) of R339 million and the Ghana release of deferred profit of R13 million).

(3)  Represents the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine subsequent to conclusion of the settlement
     agreement on the respective financial line items impacted, which include:
     - The re-measurement impact when the settlement agreement was entered into on 10 June 2016, constituting
       the difference between the balance of the provision recorded on this date (after taking into account 
       interest accrued from the beginning of the financial period up to 9 June 2016) and the present value of 
       the financial liability arising on this date in accordance with IFRS (included in the EBITDA line); 
     - The unwinding of the finance costs over the period due to the recognition of provision/financial
       liability at the present value of the future payments (included on the finance cost line);
     - The minority impact on the items noted above.

As the Group will continue in its strategy to monetise its passive infrastructure, similar tower sale
transactions may continue going forward. In addition, the impact of hyperinflation on the Group’s results will
continue for as long as certain of the Group’s operations are considered to be operating in hyperinflationary 
economies or the Group’s net assets include historic adjustments for hyperinflation that have not yet been fully
depreciated or amortised through profit or loss. Going forward, the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine will be
limited to the unwinding of the finance cost element of the future payments over the settlement period, net of
minority interests.

1 The decrease in investment in joint ventures and associates since 31 December 2015 is mainly due to the 
  Group’s share of the attributable loss, amounting to R2,5 billion (note 9) and foreign currency translation 
  loss amounting to R3,1 billion from its investment in Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V., offset by its increase in 
  investment of R2 312 million in Africa Internet Holding GmbH (AIH) (note 14) during the period.
2 Other non-current assets include the revaluation of the Group’s investment in IHS amounting to R2,7 billion.

The strengthening of the rand, which is the presentation currency of the Group, against the functional currencies 
of the Group’s largest operations contributed significantly to the decrease in assets and liabilities since 
31 December 2015 which are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at closing rates at the end of 
the reporting period.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2016

1. INDEPENDENT REVIEW
   The directors of the Company take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed consolidated 
   interim financial statements.
   
   The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been reviewed by our joint independent auditors, 
   PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc., who have expressed an unmodified conclusion thereon. 
   A copy of the auditors' report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements is available for 
   inspection at the Company's registered office, together with the interim financial statements identified in the 
   auditors' report. The joint external auditors have performed their review in accordance with International 
   Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410. Constant currency and other pro forma financial information 
   disclosure have not been reviewed by our joint external auditors.
   
2. GENERAL INFORMATION
   MTN Group Limited (the Company) carries on the business of investing in the telecommunications industry through 
   its subsidiary companies, joint ventures and associates.
   
3. BASIS OF PREPARATION
   These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared 
   in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IAS 34) Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial
   Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
   Reporting Standards Council (FRSC) and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The condensed consolidated 
   interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 
   31 December 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
   
4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   The Group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International Accounting 
   Standards Board (IASB) which were effective for the Group from 1 January 2016, none of which had a material impact on the Group.
   
   The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in terms of 
   IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
   for the year ended 31 December 2015.
   
5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
   The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost except for its loans and 
   borrowings set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values. Other than the equity investment 
   in IHS, there were no financial instruments measured at fair value that were individually material at the end of the 
   current reporting period.
   
   Listed long-term borrowings
   The Group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue with a carrying
   amount of R11 031 million (June 2015: R9 178 million, December 2015: R11 633 million) and a fair value of R10 731 million 
   (June 2015: R9 263 million, December 2015: R10 268 million) at 30 June 2016. The fair value of these instruments is determined 
   by reference to published market values on the relevant exchange.
   
   Loan to Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V.
   The Group has a loan to Nigeria Tower InterCo B.V. with a carrying amount of R2 877 million (June 2015: R1 092 million, 
   December 2015: R2 704 million) and a fair value of R3 373 million as at 30 June 2016. The fair value of this instrument is 
   determined using a discounted cash flow model. An external borrowing rate for funds advanced to the operating company, which 
   has been adjusted for differences in risk, has been used as a proxy for a market rate.
   
   Fair value measurement of investments
   The Group holds an equity investment in IHS at fair value of R11 354 million at 30 June 2016 (June 2015: R7 259 million, 
   December 2015: R9 250 million). The investment is classified as available for sale. The fair value of the investment at 
   30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 was determined with reference to recent transactions between market participants and has 
   consequently been transferred from level 3 to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.         
   
   At 31 December 2015, the absence of transactions between market participants resulted in the fair value being determined 
   using models considered to be appropriate by management. The fair value was calculated using an earnings multiple technique 
   and was based on unobservable market inputs including average tower industry earnings multiples of between 10 - 14. 
   Consequently, the investment was categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. An increase of one in the 
   multiple would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of R792 million and a one decrease in the multiple would 
   have resulted in a decrease in the fair value by R792 million as at 31 December 2015.

6. SEGMENT ANALYSIS
   The Group has identified reportable segments that are used by the Group executive committee (chief operating decision 
   maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The reportable segments are 
   grouped according to their geographic regions/locations.
   
   The Group has changed the composition and presentation of its segment analysis following the announcement of a change 
   in its operational structure subsequent to the 2015 year-end with a view to strengthen operational oversight, leadership, 
   governance and regulatory compliance across the 22 operations in Africa and the Middle East.
   
   The MTN Group is now clustered into the following three regions based on the decision taken:
   * South and East Africa (SEA)
   * West and Central Africa (WECA)
   * Middle East and North Africa (MENA).
   Comparative numbers for the segments have been restated accordingly.
   
   Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable to a segment 
   as well as those that are attributable on a reasonable basis, whether from external transactions or from transactions 
   with other Group segments. 
   
   EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, goodwill impairment, tower sale profits and the Nigeria 
   regulatory fine) is used as the measure of reporting profit or loss for each segment and has remained unchanged.

8.  Goodwill impairment
    Areeba Guinea S.A.
    Areeba Guinea S.A. (Conakry) experienced a decline in EBITDA since 2013 and Guinea-Conakry has experienced poor 
    economic performance countrywide. Consequently, a review of the recoverable amount of Conakry was undertaken 
    during the period ended 30 June 2016 subsequent to which an impairment loss amounting to R402 million (June 2015: 
    Rnil, December 2015: R504 million) was recognised. As at 30 June 2016, the goodwill balance relating to Conakry 
    is fully impaired.

    Based on an agreement concluded by the Group to sell its 50,02% investment in Afrihost Proprietary Limited (Afrihost) for

14. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ACQUISITION OF JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
    Investment in Africa Internet Holding GmbH (AIH)
    The Group’s investment of R2 312 million in AIH became effective during March 2016. This investment increased 
    the Group’s interest in the joint venture from 33,3% to 41,4%. AIH received additional investments from new investors
    which became effective during April, May and June 2016. These additional investments diluted the Group’s investment in AIH 
    to 31,28% and resulted in a profit on dilution of R277 million recorded during the current reporting period. The Group 
    retains joint control over AIH.
    
    Travelstart
    On 22 January 2016, the MTN Group made an investment in TravelLab Global AB (Travelstart) amounting to US$27 million. 
    Travelstart is an online travel agency focused on emerging markets. MTN Group jointly controls Travelstart indirectly 
    through funds managed by its venture capital fund manager, Amadeus Capital Partners.

    Altech Autopage subscriber base
    In March 2016, the Group concluded the acquisition of its Altech Autopage subscriber base from Altron TMT Proprietary 
    Limited for R678 million. The acquisition of the subscriber base will enable the Group to service and interact directly 
    with its customers and will reduce future commission expenditure. The purchase price allocation has been finalised and the fair 
    value of net identifiable assets acquired of R479 million resulted in goodwill of R199 million being recognised.

15. Events after reporting period
    Dividends declared
    Dividends declared at the board meeting held on 4 August 2016 amounted to 250 cents per share.

16.   Restatements
16.1  Reclassification of expenses
      Following the restatement of expenses disclosed in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2015, the expense 
      categories included below have also been disclosed separately or reclassified between expense categories for the June 2015 
      reporting period to present the expenses in more appropriate categories in accordance with the classification in the current period.

      Government and regulatory costs
      Government and regulatory costs that had previously been included in direct network operating costs (R2 534 million) and other 
      operating expenses (R301 million) have now been disclosed as a significant category of expense in the income statement.
 
      Value-added services (VAS) costs
      VAS costs amounting to R1 091 million were previously included in the costs of handsets and other accessories. Based on the 
      underlying nature of these costs, this has now been reclassified and included in selling, distribution and marketing expenses.

16.2  Reclassification of cash used in investing activities
      In line with the current year presentation, cash used in acquiring intangible assets of R4 194 million has now been disclosed 
      as a significant item separately from cash used in other investing activities.

17.   NIGERIA REGULATORY FINE
      On 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria Communication Limited (MTN Nigeria) resolved the matter relating to the previously imposed regulatory 
      fine with the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) after the completion of an extensive negotiation process.

      In terms of the settlement agreement reached on 10 June 2016, MTN Nigeria has agreed to pay a total cash amount of Naira 330 billion 
      over three years (the equivalent of R25,1 billion1) to the FGN as full and final settlement of the matter.

      In addition to the monetary settlement set out above:
      - MTN Nigeria subscribes to the voluntary observance of the Code of Corporate Governance for the Telecommunications Industry in 
        Nigeria and will ensure compulsory compliance when the said Code is made mandatory for the Telecommunications Industry.
      - MTN Nigeria undertakes to take immediate steps to ensure the listing of its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange as soon as 
        commercially and legally possible after the date of execution of the settlement agreement; and
      - MTN Nigeria shall always ensure full compliance with its licence terms and conditions as issued by the NCC.

      The Naira 50 billion in good faith payment which was paid without prejudice by MTN Nigeria on 24 February 2016 forms part of the 
      monetary component of the settlement. A further payment of Naira 30 billion was made on 24 June 2016 resulting in a remaining 
      cash balance of Naira 250 billion (the equivalent of R12,9 billion2) outstanding at period end.        

      On 10 June 2016 the nature of the fine changed from a provision under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
      Assets to that of a financial liability under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. As from this date 
      onwards MTN Nigeria was contractually obliged to settle the fine in cash. Consequently, the outstanding balance ceased to be 
      discounted at a pre-tax risk- free rate (in terms of IAS 37) and is instead discounted at MTN Nigeria’s incremental borrowing rate 
      for a liability with similar cash flows (in terms of IAS 39), which approximated 14,71% at the re-measurement date.     

      Professional services
      During the period R1 324 million costs were incurred on professional services relating to the negotiations that led to a reduction 
      of R34 billion in the Nigeria regulatory fine. The board has exercised its judgement and approved the quantum of the professional 
      fees incurred taking into account global benchmarks and the value delivered culminating in the final settlement of the Nigeria fine.
      1 Amount translated at the 10 June 2016 rate of R1 = N13,15.
      2 Amount translated at the 30 June 2016 closing rate of R1 = N19,33.

18 .  NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
      During the period under review, the Group concluded an agreement to sell its 50,02% investment in Afrihost for R325 million. The 
       transaction is subject to the fulfillment of applicable conditions relevant to the transaction.

UPDATE ON TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2016
(“HY2016”) which will be announced on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on Friday, 5 August
2016.

Following the trading statement published on 19 July 2016, shareholders are further advised that MTN expects
to report for HY2016 a basic headline loss per share of between 285 cents and 255 cents and a basic loss per
share of between 315 cents and 285 cents. In the prior year comparable period MTN reported headline
earnings per share of 654 cents and earnings per share of 653 cents.

These results were negatively impacted by the following:

    *   The Nigerian regulatory fine which had a material impact on results for the period. The income
        statement charge reflects the present value of the balance outstanding at 10 June 2016 of Naira 280
        billion (USD1,418 billion, using the exchange rate prevailing at the time), reduced by the reversal of
        the provision made in December 2015 of Naira 119,6 billion (USD 600 million, using the exchange rate
        prevailing at the time). In total the net effect of the Nigerian regulatory fine on the current period was
        a negative impact of 474 cents per share (cps).

    *   With the depreciation of the rand and operating currencies against the USD, earnings were further
        negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses of 135 cps.

    *   Losses from tower companies of 136 cps (largely impacted by foreign denominated loans);

    *   Increased short-term losses from the digital businesses (Africa Internet Holdings and Middle East
        Internet Holdings) when compared to the previous reporting period.

    *   Hyperinflation adjustments in respect of MTN Irancell contributed.

    *   Higher professional services charges were also a drag in the period.

    *   The underlying operational results for HY2016 were further affected by the under-performance of
        MTN Nigeria. MTN Nigeria’s performance was impacted by the disconnection of 4,5 million
        subscribers in February 2016, the final batch of subscribers to be disconnected in compliance with the
        Nigerian Communications Commission subscriber registration requirements. The withdrawal of
        regulatory services which were re-instated on 15 March 2016 with approval for promotions and price
        plans granted in early May 2016 also negatively impacting MTN Nigeria’s performance.

    *   The relatively weaker operational performance of MTN South Africa, which is expected to report a
        decline in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin, impacted by
        the marked increase in handsets sold during HY2016.

    *   The basic loss per share was in addition impacted by impairment on property, plant and equipment in
        South Sudan as well as goodwill impairments in Guinea Conakry and Afrihost Proprietary Limited.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor reported on
by MTN`s external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2016
(“HY2016”) which will be announced on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on Friday, 5 August
2016.

Paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements requires a trading statement to be published as soon
as an issuer and its directors are satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial results
for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
period.

Shareholders are therefore advised that MTN expects to report negative basic headline earnings per share
(HEPS) and basic earnings per share (EPS) for HY2016. In the prior year comparable period MTN reported HEPS
of 654 cents and EPS of 653 cents.

The expected decline in the HEPS and EPS is primarily as a result of the Regulatory fine imposed on MTN
Nigeria (“the Nigerian regulatory fine”) following a resolution with the Federal Government of Nigeria on
10 June 2016. The Nigerian regulatory fine is expected to have an estimated negative impact of 474 cents on
HEPS and EPS, respectively.

Foreign exchange losses in a number of operations, losses from joint ventures and associates and
hyperinflation adjustments on MTN Irancell are also expected to have a negative impact on HEPS and EPS for
HY2016.

HY2016 results are further expected to be negatively impacted by the under-performance of MTN Nigeria and
MTN South Africa. MTN Nigeria’s performance was impacted by the disconnection of 4,5 million subscribers in
February 2016, the final batch of subscribers to be disconnected in compliance with the Nigerian
Communications Commission subscriber registration requirements. The withdrawal of regulatory services
which was re-instated on 15 March 2016 with approval for promotions and price plans granted in early May
2016 also negatively impacted MTN Nigeria’s performance. MTN South Africa is expected to report a decline in
the Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin, impacted by the marked
increase in handsets sold during HY2016.

A further trading statement will be issued once the Company obtains a reasonable degree of certainty as to
the likely range within which the HEPS and EPS are expected to be finalised.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor reported on
by MTN`s external auditors.

MTN GROUP MANAGEMENT CHANGES


Pursuant to the MTN announcement of 10 June 2016 and with a view
to ensuring that the Group is well and appropriately capacitated
to take advantage of opportunities presented by a rapidly
changing sector, MTN is pleased to announce the appointment of
Stephen van Coller as Vice President of Strategy and Mergers &
Acquisitions effective 1 October 2016. Stephen will be the 4th
Vice   President  of   the   Group,  the   other  three   having
responsibility for the geographic operating regions of MTN. We
expect to announce a Deputy Head of Mergers & Acquisitions
shortly.

Stephen is a qualified chartered accountant. He has over two
decades in Financial Services, 10 years at Deutsche Bank (DB)
from 1996 as a Managing Director of Investment Banking, an
executive committee member and foundation trustee for DB in
South Africa. The last 10 years were at Barclays Africa Group
where he has held the positions of head of Primary Markets: Absa
Capital, and more recently CEO of the Corporate and Investment
Bank (CIB) overseeing over R250 billion in assets spanned across
13 African countries. Stephen was also part of the Barclays plc
EMEA CIB executive committee.

He serves as a member of the World Economic Forum, represented
on the Global Agenda Council (GAC) on Values as well as serving
on the GAC committee on the Future of Banking.

MTN will continue its efforts to develop participation in the
enterprise sector and adjacent sectors such as financial
services and media and entertainment. As the head of Strategy
and Mergers & Acquisitions, we are confident that Stephen's
experience will be instrumental in helping the Group realise its
ambitions and commitments.
Brett Goschen, the Group CFO, will be leaving MTN effective 30
September 2016 to pursue other interests. Consequently, he will
be resigning from the MTN Group board of directors (“the Board”)
as an executive director on the same day. We thank Brett for his
considerable contribution to the Group over a period of 14 years
and wish him well in his new endeavours.

Gunter Engling will assume the position of Acting Group CFO on
Brett's departure until a permanent CFO is appointed. Gunter is
a chartered accountant who is currently CEO of MTN Rwanda.   He
has held many positions in MTN, more relevantly Group Executive
Finance reporting to the Group CFO. He was responsible for the
management and coordination of all statutory accounting and
reporting to all stakeholders, including the Group Audit
committee and the Board. Gunter has also held the positions of
General Manager Finance of MTN Nigeria and CFO of MTN Ghana.
Gunter has extensive knowledge and understanding of MTN Group’s
financial matters, workings and stewardship and will have the
benefit of a close working relationship with Brett until his
departure at the end of September 2016.

MTN is confident that the process of reviewing its capacity,
resources,   governance  and   management   structures will be
substantially completed by year end and will leave the Group
well positioned to successfully face a highly competitive
environment and take advantage of new opportunities.

     Chairman said ? ?MTN has weathered a rather difficult storm and will continue to review its
     governance and management operating structure to ensure that it operates at an optimum level and
     continues to replenish management talent to ensure a sustained growth of the business. I warmly
     welcome Rob Shuter, the new VP M&A and Strategy, Godfrey Motsa and all the new non executive
     directors to MTN Group and MTN South Africa. I am confident that with the calibre of Rob Shuter as
     CEO, the group will resume its path to playing its rightful role in increasing connectivity and
     accelerating convergence across Africa and the Middle East.?


     Rob Shuter said ? ?I am honoured to have the opportunity and look forward to working with
     Phuthuma and the MTN Group board to ensure that we build on a strong foundation laid over the
     last 15 ? 20 years for the Group to realize its full potential.?

21st ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING – BUSINESS UPDATE

1. BUSINESS UPDATE

At the Annual General Meeting to be held later today, MTN Executive Chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko
will make the following comments regarding the Group’s performance for the first four months of
2016 in comparison with the same period for 2015:

As at 30 April 2016, the Group increased its subscriber base by approximately 1% to 230.3 million
year-on-year (YoY)*. This was largely impacted by the 7% decline in subscribers in MTN Nigeria and
the 11% decline in MTN Uganda, mainly as a result of the non-compliant subscriber deregistration
process in these countries which was only completed in quarter one of 2016. As noted in the 2016
quarter one trading update, the Group took an exceptionally conservative stance related to the
disconnection of subscribers that were deemed non-compliant in order to mitigate future regulatory
challenges. MTN South Africa reported a 7% increase YoY in subscribers supported by improvements
in the prepaid distribution channel while MTN Ghana showed a healthy subscriber growth increasing
its subscriber base by 20% YoY.

Reported Group revenue increased by 15% YoY supported by a 21% decline in the average rand
exchange rate against the naira together with a 23% decline in the average rand exchange rate
against the US dollar compared with the previous period.


Organic revenue increased marginally by 1%, impacted by lower revenue growth in MTN Nigeria,
MTN Uganda and MTN Cameroon.

Organic data revenue across the Group continued to deliver satisfactory growth in most of our
markets, increasing by 19% YoY. Data now contributes 24% to total revenue compared with 21% for
the same period last year. Data revenue was supported by healthy growth in MTN South Africa and
                                                 1
MTN Ghana. MTN Nigeria’s data revenue declined 12% mainly due to the withdrawing of regulatory
services.

MTN Nigeria’s organic revenue was down 6% YoY mainly due to uncompetitive pricing arising from
the suspension of regulatory services and regulatory restrictions that obliged operators to seek
permission from customers to charge out-of-bundle rates upon the depletion of data bundles.
Revenue was also impacted by subscriber disconnections and an increase in promotional minutes to
encourage subscribers to complete their SIM registration details. Despite the decline in MTN
Nigeria’s organic data revenue data traffic increased by 27% YoY, supported by the continued
improvements made to the data network. This was further enhanced by the lifting of regulatory
services at the end of March 2016 and the approval of price plans in early May. May daily data
volumes are up approximately 20% month-on-month with nearly 4 million subscribers taking up the
new offers, following the introduction of the new price plans. The early signs are positive on both
voice traffic as well as new subscriber acquisition volumes, where month-on-month gross
connections are showing positives signs with an increase of almost 13%.

MTN South Africa continued to show positive momentum and increased revenue 4% YoY. This was
supported by a 17% increase in handset revenue and 23% growth in data revenue driven by a 59%
YoY increase in data traffic as well as a 55% increase in digital revenue. Outgoing revenue was
impacted by a 48-hour network outage in some key areas in February 2016 as well as a decrease in
consumer spend over the period.

MTN Irancell recorded satisfactory organic revenue growth for the period with an increase of 7%
YoY. The growth was impacted by reductions in data tariffs by the regulator and increased over-the-
top activity due to the 3G/LTE licence award. Organic data revenue increased 66% YoY supported by
a 50% increase in digital revenue, largely due to a significant increase in smartphone penetration.

MTN Ghana showed healthy double digit growth and increased 19% YoY supported by a 96%
increase in organic data revenue. This was mainly driven by strong growth in digital revenue, up
more than 200% and mobile financial services revenue, up 94%. MTN Uganda’s organic revenue was
mainly impacted by the disconnection of subscribers while organic revenue at MTN Cameroon was
impacted by a challenging competitive environment.

The Group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin remains
under pressure. MTN Nigeria’s EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by dollar denominated costs
related to the weaker exchange rate, costs associated with the second tranche of the tower

                                                  2
transaction, increased use of build-to-suit sites and costs associated with the subscriber registration
process. Revenue share linked to digital services and higher interconnect costs as a result of free off-
net minutes awarded to subscribers to encourage registration, also impacted MTN Nigeria’s EBITDA
margin. The EBITDA margin in MTN South Africa was negatively impacted by a once off cost related
to managed services, the increase in handset costs to accelerate 3G and LTE handset adoption and
free minutes associated with the network outage.

The Group continued to focus on network quality and the aggressive roll out of the 3G and LTE
networks in key markets to ensure it remains competitive in voice and data offerings. Total capital
expenditure (capex) increased by 22% YoY on an organic basis reflecting the strong resolve to
manage capacity and we expect full year capex of approximately R34 billion. MTN South Africa has
increased its capex for 2016 to approximately R12 billion.

2. NIGERIA FINE

We continue our engagement with the Nigerian authorities and are awaiting feedback. We remain
optimistic on reaching a conclusion on this matter in the short term. We will continuously monitor
developments with regards to the Nigerian fine and will review the adequacy of the provision at the
end of the reporting period.



3. NEW GROUP PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) APPOINTMENT

The search for a new MTN Group CEO is well underway and as previously noted we hope to make an
announcement on this matter prior to the end of June 2016 at the latest.

4. PROSPECTS

We expect the Group’s performance to be impacted by the weak macro environment in key markets
as well as by tough competition. We, nevertheless, remain confident about the longer term
prospects of the countries in which we operate.

While not without challenges we expect MTN Nigeria’s performance to improve given the focus on
reconnecting subscribers and the re-instatement of regulatory services enabling the operation to
provide more competitive tariffs and promotions. Early indications of tariff changes are positive for
both data and voice revenue. Improvements made on the data network as well as once-off costs in
early 2016 associated with the registration process, will also contribute to improved performance in
the second half of 2016.

                                                   3
We expect the South African operation to report improved revenue growth through the rest of the
year supported by 3G and LTE network roll out, improvements in network quality and competitive
offerings. Data revenue in South Africa is also expected to benefit from aggressive handset sales.


Following the partial removal of sanctions in Iran, we expect to see an opportunity to expand
services and more appetite for growth in this market. While it has taken longer than initially
expected, MTN continues to engage the various related parties in an effort to repatriate
approximately US$1 billion equivalent from MTN Irancell (where it holds a 49% share). We expect
MTN Ghana to continue with its positive momentum with a key focus on LTE roll out.


In addition, we are confident that our operations will continue to benefit from strong growth in data,
our investments in the online and e-commerce players, African Internet Holdings and Middle East
Internet Holdings, and related activities in the digital space. In light of this, MTN is well positioned to
become the leading digital global player across our markets in the next few years.


The financial information on which this business update is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by MTN’s external auditors.

MTN Group executive chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko comments:
“During the first quarter of 2016, the Group was impacted by the ‘after shocks’ of the events that took place towards
the end of  2015, mainly  the subscriber registration process in many of the countries in which we operate, with Nigeria
being the largest. In order to mitigate any future regulatory challenges, the Group took an exceptionally conservative
stance by disconnecting all subscribers who could possibly be deemed to be non-compliant. This has had a significant
unfavourable impact on total subscriber growth and revenue in Q1 16. Nonetheless, we believe this resolve to address
compliance matters decisively, has put the Group on a solid footing as regards the subscriber registration process and
regulatory matters in general. Further, the Group has undertaken a number of ‘back to the basics’ structural and 
operational initiatives that will hopefully reset and position the Group for future growth in a rapidly evolving sector. 
Subscriber growth was also impacted by the weak macro-environment, particularly in those markets reliant on oil exports. 
The trading environment was highly competitive. 

Data revenue remains a key priority. We delivered strong growth during the quarter. This was largely supported by
targeted campaigns, the aggressive roll out of 3G and LTE in key markets and increased smartphone uptake. 

MTN South Africa’s performance was encouraging despite a marginal decline in subscriber growth, impacted by seasonal
trends and an alignment of the subscriber base, particularly the recently acquired subscriber base from Autopage.
Improved data performance in South Africa was supported by significant investment in the network. MTN Nigeria’s 
performance was impacted by the subscriber registration process and regulatory restrictions during the quarter. The 
operation, however, continues to invest heavily in the network to improve quality and support data growth.”

The analysis below is presented on a regional basis in line with the Group’s new operational structure. This comprises
South and East Africa (SEA), West and Central Africa (WECA) and Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Commentary is
mainly provided for South Africa, Nigeria and Iran, which are the largest contributors to the Group’s performance. It 
also highlights key aspects from other operations that impacted performance. 

The SEA region includes: South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, Botswana (joint venture) and Swaziland (joint venture).
The WECA region includes: Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea-Conakry and
Guinea-Bissau. The MENA region includes: Iran (joint venture), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Cyprus and South Sudan.

SEA 
MTN South Africa reported a marginal decline in subscribers of 1,7% QoQ to 30,1 million. The prepaid subscriber base
declined by 1,8% QoQ to 24,9 million, largely impacted by seasonal trends following strong promotions in Q4 15. The
postpaid base decline of 0,8% to 5,2 million was impacted by the alignment of the Autopage subscriber base to MTN’s, 
the disconnection of telemetry SIMs and the expiration of legacy low-cost packages. In addition to seasonality, quarterly
average revenue per user (ARPU) was impacted by the exceptionally unfortunate 48-hour network outage experienced in 
February 2016. This had a negative impact of approximately 3% on revenue for the month while billable minutes for the 
quarter declined by 11,3% YoY. In March we saw an encouraging 10,3% month-on-month (MoM) increase in revenue.

Data revenue continued to show strong growth increasing by 22,9% YoY and contributed 32,8% to total revenue. This was
supported by a 12% QoQ increase in the value of data bundles sold as well as an increase in smartphones to 9,2 million.
Improved 3G and LTE coverage supported a 29% increase in ARPU for those customers who moved from 2G to 3G and an
increase of 19% for those customers who moved from 3G to LTE. Data usage increased by 58,5% YoY. ARPU declined by 9,2% 
QoQ. 

Other SEA - across the rest of the region subscribers increased by 2,0% to 22,7 million in Q1 16. This was mainly
driven by strong growth 
in Uganda. 

MTN Uganda increased its subscriber base by 7,8% QoQ to 9,6 million supported by MTN Zone and attractive bundled
offers. In Uganda constant currency data revenue increased by 23,8% YoY and contributed 32,1% to total revenue. This 
was supported by the roll out of 62 3G and 35 LTE sites during the quarter. Local currency ARPU increased by 15,0% 
QoQ. 

MTN Mobile Money subscribers declined by 27% to 6,9 million primarily due to the disconnections in Q4 15 related to
the subscriber registration process.

WECA 
MTN Nigeria reported a 6,9% QoQ decrease in its subscriber base to 57,0 million. This was a result of the
disconnection of 4,5 million subscribers at the end of February 2016 related to the ongoing subscriber registration 
process. We believe we have now dealt with all the subscribers who were considered to be non-compliant. The operation 
continues to focus on reconnecting subscribers through proactive engagement and winback offers. Following the 
re-instatement of regulatory services in March 2016, MTN Nigeria continued to engage the regulatory authorities and 
we hope to receive approval from the regulator for approval of promotional products and services during the current 
month. 

Constant currency data revenue declined by 9,6% and contributed 19,0% to total revenue mainly due to a change in
regulatory requirements obliging operators to seek permission from customers to charge out-of-bundle rates upon the 
depletion of a data bundle. During the quarter the operation continued to improve its data network in key cities and 
rolled out 73 2G and 149 3G sites. These network coverage and quality improvements were reflected in the net promoter 
score with an increase of 3% for the quarter. Local currency ARPU increased by 11,9% QoQ. The operation’s 
competitiveness was impacted by regulatory restrictions in the quarter.

Other WECA - the remainder of the region increased its subscriber base by 1,3% to 45,9 million driven by solid growth
in MTN Ghana and MTN Cameroon. 

MTN Ghana delivered a sound performance and grew its subscriber base by 4,6% to 17,0 million. This was supported by
competitive value propositions as well as churn and loyalty management initiatives. Billable minutes increased by 26,0%
YoY, while constant currency data revenue increased by 111,0% and contributed 36,3% to total revenue. This was supported
by strong growth in digital and mobile financial services as well as improved data network quality. The operation added
65 3G and 143 LTE sites in the quarter. Local currency ARPU increased by 4,0% QoQ. MTN Mobile Money customers increased
by 10,8% QoQ to 6,3 million. 

MTN Cameroon increased its subscriber base by 3,1% to 9,5 million supported by improved 3G network quality and the
launch of 4G at the end of Q4 15. Constant currency data revenue increased by 78,9% and contributed 18,5% to total 
revenue supported by a 7,5% increase in MTN Mobile Money subscribers to 2,1 million. 

MENA
MTN Irancell increased its subscriber base by 1,0% QoQ to 46,6 million in a highly penetrated market. Constant
currency data revenue increased by 70,9% QoQ and contributed 39,3% to total revenue. This was largely supported by 
continued network modernisation as well as the rollout of 1 368 3G and 743 LTE sites during the quarter. Local currency 
ARPU decreased by 1,4% QoQ. 

Other MENA - the remainder of the region increased its subscriber base by 0,2% to 27,0 million. 

MTN Sudan increased its subscriber base by 4,0% to 8,8 million driven by competitive pricing and below-the-line and
targeted campaigns. Total billable minutes increased by 12,5% YoY. Constant currency data revenue increased by 74,0%
driven by digital content and contributed 26,2% to total revenue. Local currency ARPU increased by 8,4% QoQ. 

MTN Syria, MTN Yemen and MTN Afghanistan remain profitable, however, they continue to operate in highly challenging
environments impacting the region’s subscriber growth.

- HEPS decreased 51,4%** to 746 cents**

  and the towers, on a like-for-like basis HEPS has declined 14,3%

Note: Certain financial information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. The pro
forma financial information is the responsibility of the Group’s board of directors and is presented for illustrative
purposes. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly present MTN’s financial position,
changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. An assurance report has been prepared and issued by our joint 
auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc. in respect of the pro forma financial information 
included in this announcement that is available at the registered office of the Company.

1. The financial information presented in these results has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation and
relating goodwill impairment, tower profits, and the Nigeria regulatory fine and constitutes pro forma financial
information to the extent not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the audited financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2015. This pro forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of 
hyperinflation and relating goodwill impairment, tower profits, and the Nigeria regulatory fine from the financial 
results in order to achieve a comparable analysis year on year. Hyperinflation adjustments and relating goodwill 
impairment, tower profits and the Nigeria regulatory fine have been calculated in terms of the Group’s accounting 
policies disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

2. Constant currency (“organic”) information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates
on the Group’s results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the current financial reporting year’s
results have been adjusted to the prior year’s average exchange rates determined as the average of the monthly exchange
rates which can be found on www.mtn.com/investors. The measurement has been performed for each of the Group’s currencies,
materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The organic growth percentage has been calculated by utilising
the constant currency results compared to the prior year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan
and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. During the 
year the Iranian economy was assessed to no longer be hyperinflationary and hyperinflation accounting was discontinued
effective 1 July 2015.

* Constant currency (“organic”) information.
** Reported - includes hyperinflation and relating goodwill impairment, tower profits and the Nigeria regulatory fine.

Overview

MTN Group’s 2015 financial results reflect the challenging operating environment the business experienced in the year.
Weak macro-economic conditions, increased market competition, heightened regulatory pressures, notably in Nigeria, and
operational challenges in some of our markets resulted in a lower-than-expected performance.

Reported basic headline earnings per share (HEPS) declined by 51,4%** to 746 cents**. This was largely a result of the
Nigerian regulatory fine provision (R9 287 million), which had a 402 cents negative impact on HEPS. Excluding the
Nigerian regulatory fine provision, HEPS declined 25,3%. In addition, HEPS were negatively impacted by hyperinflation of 
54 cents (positive impact of 69 cents in 2014) and losses from our investment in African Internet Holdings (AIH) and Middle
East Internet Holdings (MEIH) 34 cents (versus 7 cents in 2014) and from the tower companies of 39 cents (versus 16 cents in
2014). While these investments are a short-term drag on reported earnings they remain key elements in the long-term
strategy of the Group. Excluding the impact of the Nigerian regulatory fine provision, hyperinflation and the impact of
AIH, MEIH and the towers, on a like-for-like basis HEPS has declined 14,3%.

Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment, MTN continued to benefit from its significant scale and
footprint. The Group’s subscriber base increased by 4,1% to 232,5 million, despite the disconnection of 10,4 million
subscribers to ensure compliance with subscriber regulatory registration requirements in Nigeria and Uganda. Nigeria and 
Uganda disconnected 6,7 million and 3,7 subscribers respectively. Subscriber growth was achieved through attractive 
segmented below-the-line campaigns and an increased focus on the customer experience enabling the Group to maintain its 
leadership position in 15 markets.

Group revenue remained flat in the year largely due to a decline in voice revenue in Nigeria and a reduction in
handset revenue in South Africa following the industrial action experienced in the first half of the year which led to 
lower distribution of handsets. This was, however, largely offset by an increase in data revenue across the business. 

Lower voice tariffs, which declined by 25% across operations in the year (average price per minute, in US dollar
terms) drove a 15% increase in billable minutes. Voice revenue continued to come under pressure as a result of heightened
competition and the related use of multiple SIM cards as well as pressure on consumer spending. 

The Group benefited from a 108,5% increase in data traffic and an increased take-up of digital services. Despite a 
45% decline in the effective data tariff (in US dollar terms), Group data revenue increased by 30,2% (32,6%*), partly
offsetting a 5,6% (4,5%*) decline in voice revenue. Data revenue, including digital services, contributed 23,1% to total
revenue. 

MTN Nigeria’s competitiveness in the market was compromised by the suspension of regulatory services in October 2015.
Under this suspension, the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) withdrew its approval process for new tariff plans
and promotions until certain tariff plans and promotions linked to the ‘dominant operator’ ruling were removed from the
market. MTN Nigeria has complied with these requirements and now awaits the NCC’s approval of new tariff plans and
promotions submitted. MTN Nigeria continues to engage with the regulator regarding the ‘dominant operator’ ruling and
suspension of regulatory services to find an amicable resolution. This, combined with the disconnection of subscribers 
in the year, negatively impacted MTN Nigeria’s results. 

MTN South Africa continued to show encouraging service revenue, which excludes handset revenue and other revenue,
growth trends, regaining relevance in the pre-paid segment in the second half of the year. Revenue growth in South Africa
was supported by strong growth in data, benefiting from extensive 3G and LTE network rollout in the year.

The Group earnings before tax, depreciation, amortisation, interest and goodwill impairment losses (EBITDA) margin
declined 3,9 percentage points (pp) to 40,9%. This was negatively impacted by an impairment for obsolete handsets in South
Africa (R592 million) and an interconnect debt provision in Nigeria (R503 million). In addition, 2014 EBITDA was higher
as a result of the Belgacom International Carrier Services (BICS) five-year profit amortisation, which ended in 2014
(R364 million) and a provision raised for Syria related to the build-operate-transfer licence, which was reversed in 2014
(R497 million). The underlying EBITDA margin was impacted by lower revenue growth, higher inflation, costs associated
with the extensive network rollout and the depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar, which made
foreign-denominated payments more costly. Higher lease costs associated with the sale of towers in Nigeria and commissions 
associated with new revenue streams also impacted the margin. The Group, however, continued to make good progress during 
the year on cost-containment initiatives including decreased advertising and staff costs as well as procurement efficiencies.
 
Cash inflows generated by operations decreased by 10,9% ** to R57 598 million** mainly as a result of lower EBITDA and
a R5 221 million** increase in working capital.

Capital expenditure (capex) increased by 15,7% to R29 199 million with a key focus on 3G and LTE rollout. South
Africa’s capex amounted to R10 948 million, representing 37,5% of total capex. During the year, the Group rolled out 
3 116 2G sites, 7 891 co-located 3G sites and 5 241 co-located LTE sites. The Group also rolled out 1 469 km of long 
distance fibre and connected a total of 1 164 sites to fibre, enabling better quality data networks across its operations.

Fine imposed by the NCC on MTN Nigeria 

On 26 October 2015, MTN announced that the NCC had imposed a N1,040 trillion fine, subsequently reduced to N780
billion (equivalent to approximately US$3,9 billion using the exchange rate prevailing at the time) on MTN Nigeria. 
This was related to the late disconnection of approximately 5,1 million subscribers whose registration documents were 
considered incomplete. 

On 17 December 2015, MTN Nigeria proceeded with legal action in the Federal High Court in Lagos challenging the fine.
On 22 January 2016, the matter was adjourned by the judge to allow parties to find an amicable solution. On 24 February
2016, MTN Nigeria made a without prejudice good faith payment of N50 billion (equivalent to approximately US$250
million) to the Federal Government of Nigeria, on the basis that this will be applied towards a settlement, when one is
eventually hopefully arrived at. In an effort to achieve an amicable settlement, MTN Nigeria, without prejudice, agreed to
withdraw the matter from the Federal High Court. 

MTN Nigeria recorded a R9 287 million provision for the fine at the end of the reporting period, negatively impacting
reported EBITDA by 13,6%** and HEPS by 402 cents. Management has applied its judgement in determining the provision in
accordance with IFRS. MTN Nigeria continues engaging with the Nigerian authorities in an attempt to ensure an amicable
resolution in the interest of MTN Nigeria, its stakeholders and the Nigerian authorities.

The fine imposed on MTN Nigeria and the related process continues to receive extensive attention from the Group Board
of Directors (the board) and management and the Group will continue to update shareholders on any material developments.
Until the matter is resolved, MTN shareholders are advised to exercise caution when trading in MTN securities.

Management and structure changes

MTN Nigeria CEO and Regulatory and Corporate Affairs Executive both resigned on 31 December 2015. 

In December 2015, the Group announced the implementation of a new operating structure incorporating a Group Chief
Operations Officer (COO) position and Vice Presidents (VPs) for three regions, namely West and Central Africa (WECA), 
South and East Africa (SEA) and Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This multi-layer operating structure, effective 
1 January 2016, will strengthen governance and operational oversight as well as improve stakeholder engagement to better 
position MTN in the rapidly changing industry.

In addition, the Group has revised its compliance structure and is in the process of appointing a Group Regulatory
Executive and regional compliance officers to work with the VPs and the in country regulatory executives. Complying 
with regulatory requirements and, in particular, with subscriber registration regulations is a priority. Subscriber
registration is often highly complex given the limited national identity databases and personal documents in many of 
the countries in which we operate. However, MTN remains committed to registering subscribers with the use of improved 
systems and processes. Ongoing subscriber registration processes are expected to impact net additions in some markets 
in the year ahead. 

Changes to the Board

Due to the unfortunate circumstances occurring at MTN Nigeria, in the interests of the Company and its shareholders,
the Group President and CEO Sifiso Dabengwa tendered his resignation on 9 November 2015. The Chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko,
was appointed Executive Chairman on an interim basis to facilitate the resolution of the fine imposed and to drive the
process for the appointment of a new Group CEO. The search for a new Group CEO is well under way and we hope to finalise
this process in the second quarter of 2016.

Fani Titi also resigned as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Board on 31 December 2015 to focus on demanding 
fiduciary responsibilities and other commercial interests. He joined MTN Group in July 2012 and also served as a
member of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee. The Board expresses its appreciation for the valuable 
contribution made by Mr Titi over the years. 

Prospects 

MTN Group continues to work towards achieving its vision of “leading the delivery of a bold, New Digital World to our
customers.” While 2015 was a difficult year for the Group, impacted as it was by challenges in our two key markets, 
we are hopeful that we will see improvements in operating conditions during 2016. The new operating structure, together 
with our strong platform, positions us well to take advantage of the next phase of evolution in the mobile telecoms 
sector. 

We are confident that our operations will continue to benefit from strong growth in data together with our 
investment in AIH and MEIH and related activities in the digital space. This will be underpinned by organic growth, 
partnerships and acquisitions and will position the Company to become the leading digital player across our markets 
over the next few years. 

In the near term, we anticipate the resolution of the ongoing suspension of regulatory services which continues to
restrict new tariff plans and promotions for MTN Nigeria. Following the resumption of regulatory services we would
anticipate an improved operational performance in 2016. However, net additions in Q1 2016 are expected to be impacted 
by the disconnection of 4,5 million subscribers at the end of February 2016 related to the ongoing subscriber 
registration process. MTN Nigeria is working to complete the registration process with these disconnected subscribers 
and is also actively engaging the high value subscribers. These disconnections follow a process that was initiated with 
the NCC during the last quarter of 2015.

The current economic challenges in Nigeria have resulted in increased pressure on US dollar liquidity and we expect
this situation to remain a challenge in the short to medium term. We are, however, establishing contingency plans to
ensure we can continue with the planned network rollout.

We expect the South African operation to continue the positive trend shown during H2 2015, improving its operational
performance with the support of strong leadership, leveraging an enhanced 3G/LTE device strategy, as well as increased
focus on customer services. The extensive 3G and LTE network rollout in 2015 will also benefit the operation in 2016. 
The continued easing of sanctions in Iran and its related economic uplift offers significant opportunities to expand
services, particularly in the digital space where we command a strong market position. We also expect acceleration in
economic growth together with a reduction in inflation and some normalisation in the exchange rate. Although this is a
complex process, MTN is working towards remitting some of its cash of R15 860 million from MTN Irancell during the first
half of 2016. 

Improving network quality and capacity in key markets remains a priority. We will continue to close and improve
coverage of 3G, LTE and LTE advanced in Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Cameroon. In addition, improved quality and
throughput in homes and fixed locations through the rollout of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) in South Africa, Nigeria, 
Ghana and Iran will be a focus in 2016. 

While the Group operates across 22 countries the earnings remain highly concentrated in a few markets with the
associated volatility and risks as evident over the past few years. To this end management will continue to explore
opportunities to address this over the medium term.

Dividends

The Group has declared a second half dividend of 830 cents, which will bring the total dividend for FY2015 to 
1 310 cents. This represents a YoY growth of 5,2%. During FY2016 the Company anticipates declaring a minimum dividend 
of 700 cents which takes into consideration the uncertainty regarding the regulatory fine imposed by the NCC and the 
dollar liquidity situation in Nigeria. We have adopted a cautious approach to the dividend outlook for FY2016, taking 
into account the interests of shareholders and lenders and the importance of maintaining an investment grade credit 
rating. This minimum dividends remain subject to the outcome of the regulatory fine imposed by the NCC and is at the 
discretion of the Board. Should the operating conditions improve, we will look to declare a higher dividend than advised.

To lead the delivery of a bold, new Digital World to our customers

In the year, the Group continued to shape its business to drive growth in non-voice revenue in a rapidly changing
telecommunications landscape. Centralising and streamlining processes and systems, outsourcing non-core functions 
and creating agility to remain competitive were key focus areas in the year.    
 
GROUP CONSUMER

The Group Consumer division established in 2015 continued to transform operations towards creating a distinct customer
experience. The focus for the year was on embedding the use of customer analytics to offer segmented below-the-line
campaigns and engage with customers more effectively. Other areas of focus were the close monitoring of net promoter 
scores and ensuring the agility of systems for speedy go-to-market campaigns. 

GROUP DIGITAL SERVICES 

Group Digital Services continued to expand its offerings across Africa and the Middle East, leveraging MTN’s core
competencies of a strong brand, knowledge of and access to customers, scale and distribution. Key focus areas during the
year were e-commerce, digital media and mobile financial services. MTN recorded strong growth in digital services revenue,
supported by lifestyle services. MTN is now the largest distributor of music in Africa and has more than 800 companies
providing 5 500 content services under the lifestyle offering.

MTN Mobile Money customers increased by 56,3% to 34,7 million across 15 countries. In the year, the focus was on the
migration of the MTN Mobile Money platform to a more agile platform enabling converged campaigns and incentives,
establishing dedicated functions across operations and providing niche services where MTN has a competitive advantage. 
MTN Mobile Money revenue increased by 55,8% and it now accounts for 16,8% of Uganda’s total revenue and 6,0% and 6,2% of 
each of Ghana and Rwanda’s total revenues respectively.

In 2015, we continued to leverage our investments in AIH and MEIH, our e-commerce joint ventures. AIH and MEIH offer
a range of internet services including e-commerce retailing, as well as market place, taxi, travel, classified and food
delivery services. AIH has 10 company verticals in over 23 countries in Africa that are market leaders and recorded
approximately 2,3 million customers and 4,4 million transactions in the year. Jumia is now the #1 online shopping mall in 
12 markets in Africa while Lamudi is the #1 real estate classified in 21 countries across Africa. In addition, MEIH has 
seven company verticals including Wadi, an online shopping retailer delivering a premium online shopping experience in the
Middle East.

ENTERPRISE BUSINESS UNIT (EBU)

In the year, our EBU continued to align operations to become the ICT partner of choice for corporate, SME, public
sector, financial services, manufacturing and logistics customers.  

Revenue growth across operations was ahead of expectations, attributable to a number of key corporate wins and the
expansion of our product and service offerings to customers. During the year, we launched MTN Pan African Internet of
Things platform; MTN Business Cloud, a hybrid platform using Windows Azure Pack; the continued rollout of MTN Global MPLS
(multiple protocol label switching), bringing the MTN Global MPLS footprint to 25 points of presence in Africa and various
smaller key initiatives.  Several partnerships secured in the year will enable EBU to further diversify its offerings
in the market.

A key priority is to make customers aware of EBU’s offerings and address some challenges experienced by our Internet
Service Provider businesses in Kenya, Botswana and Namibia. EBU has embarked on a market brand refresh initiative, which
is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 

Financial review

Revenue 

Group revenue remained flat at R146 353 million. Movements in average exchange rates had a limited impact on reported
revenue. Whilst the rand weakened 12,9% against the US dollar it strengthened 2,4% against the Nigerian naira, 11,1%
against the Ghanaian cedi, 2,4% against the Central African franc, 5,6% against the Ugandan shilling and 40,2% against 
the Syrian pound. 

Revenue increased 1,4%*. This lower-than-expected revenue growth was mainly the result of a 2,1%* decline in Nigeria’s
revenue and a 2,9% increase in South Africa’s revenue supported by increased service revenue, which excludes handset
revenue and other revenue, partly offset by a reduction in handset revenue. Service revenue, which excludes handset
revenue and other revenue, in the South African operation increased 7,5% in the year.

The large opco cluster’s revenue remained relatively flat on a reported basis and increased 5,5%*, supported by strong
growth in Ghana and Sudan. This was, however, offset by a reduction in revenue in Cameroon and slower growth in Ivory
Coast and Uganda. 

The small opco cluster’s revenue grew by 4,0% on a reported basis and 1,6%*, largely supported by healthy growth 
in Benin and Zambia, Bissau, Congo Brazzaville and South Sudan.

Costs 

Group operating costs increased by 7,2% (8,1%*). This was largely the result of a 15,1% (15,7%*) increase in 
direct network operating costs linked to network expansion, higher rent and utilities costs and foreign-denominated 
expenses. An increase of 7,2% (7,9%*) in selling, distribution and marketing costs also contributed to the 
increase mostly related to digital revenue share commissions paid. 

EBITDA     
                                                                                      
Reported EBITDA decreased 19,2%** to R59 125 million**. This was negatively impacted by the provision of the Nigeria
regulatory fine (R9 287 million) and positively impacted by the profit from the sale of towers (R8 263 million) and an
adjustment for hyperinflation (R231 million) in  Iran, Syria and Sudan.

Excluding these impacts, EBITDA declined 8,6% (6,9%*) to R59 918 million. This includes the impairment for handsets in
South Africa (R592 million) and the interconnect debt provision in Nigeria (R503 million). In addition, 2014 EBITDA was
higher as a result of the BICS (Belgacom International Carrier Services) five-year profit amortisation, which ended in
2014 (R364 million) and a provision made relating to the build-operate-transfer licence in Syria, which was reversed in
2014 (R497 million).

Excluding these impacts, EBITDA reduced by 5,6% to R61 013 million from R64 659 million. Underlying EBITDA was impacted 
by a decline in Nigeria’s EBITDA, as a result of a reduction in revenue, higher leasing costs and increased expenses
denominated in foreign currencies. This was partly offset by an increase in South Africa’s EBITDA supported by
well-managed costs and fewer handsets sold in the year. The large opco cluster’s EBITDA decreased by 4,3% (0,9%*) 
impacted by a 20,7% (19,0%*) decrease in EBITDA in Cameroon, 11,3% (8,8%*) in Ivory Coast, 14,4% (9,3%*) in Uganda 
and 29,3% (2,0%*) in Syria. 

The Group recorded a 3,9 pp decline in its EBITDA margin to 40,9%, impacted by lower EBITDA margins in Nigeria and in
the large and small opco clusters. Head office EBITDA had a 1,0 pp negative impact on Group EBITDA as a result of
increased professional fees, the end of the BICS profit amortisation in 2014 and the reversal of a provision made 
relating to the build-operate-transfer licence in Syria in 2014.

Depreciation and amortisation                                                                    
                                                                                                 
Depreciation increased by 5,6% (5,8%*) to R19 146 million as a result of higher capex in South Africa and Syria.
Amortisation costs increased by 13,7% (16,3%*) to R3 674 million, driven by higher software spend in previous years.

Net finance costs                                                                                

Net finance costs of R3 005 million were lower than the R3 606 million recorded in the prior year. The decrease was
mainly attributed to a 36,6% decrease in net interest paid to R1 596 million as a result of higher interest income 
on cash and investments in Nigeria. Unfavourable exchange rate movements resulted in net foreign exchange losses 
of R1 409 million (2014: R1 091 million). These included:
- Forex losses in Nigeria of R712 million incurred on US dollar borrowings and trade payables;
- Forex losses of R434 million in South Sudan as a result of the depreciation of the South Sudanese pound by 509%
  against the US dollar;
- Forex losses of R303 million in Zambia as a result of the depreciation of the Zambian kwacha by 72%; partially 
  offset by;
- Forex gains of R348 million in Mauritius as a result of net US dollar-denominated intercompany receivables.

Taxation

The Group’s reported effective tax rate increased to 32,4%** from 26,2%** in the previous year. This was impacted by
hyperinflation, tower transaction proceeds and the provision for the Nigeria regulatory fine. 

Excluding this impact, the Group’s taxation charge decreased by 13,4% (13,4%*) to R11 938 million and the effective
tax rate for the year increased 1,5 pp to 32,6% mainly as a result of lower profit before tax due to the decrease in
equity income from joint ventures and associates and a higher prior year overprovision of the current tax liability 
due to a change in the handset revenue treatment in South Africa. A prior year adjustment in respect of the revaluation 
of the deferred tax asset in MTN Cameroon arising from the change in the corporate tax rate to 33% from 38,5% and a 
higher effective withholding tax rate also contributed to the higher effective tax rate.

Earnings 

Reported basic HEPS decreased 51,4%** to 746 cents** largely impacted by the Nigeria regulatory fine provision
recorded in the year (402 cents), hyperinflation (54 cents), and losses incurred on the Group’s investments in AIH 
and MEIH (34 cents) and tower companies (39 cents). Attributable earnings per share (EPS) declined 36,7%** to 
1 109 cents**. 

Cash flow 

Cash inflows generated from operations decreased by 10,9%** to R57 598 million** mainly as a result of the decline in
EBITDA and the increase in working capital. Dividends paid to ordinary and non-controlling shareholders also impacted
cash flow, increasing by 18,0%** in the year. 

Capital expenditure

Capex increased 16,6%** to R29 611 million**, of which R136 million was related to foreign currency movements. 

Financial position

Net debt increased to R31 635 million** compared to net debt of R4 543 million** in the prior year. This was 
largely due to:

- Dividends of R3 176  million** paid to minority shareholders related to the Nigeria tower transaction;
- An increase in the dividends paid to MTN Group shareholders of R23 506  million**; 
- An increase in capital expenditure in South Africa;

Operational review 

South Africa 

- Subscribers increased by 9,3% to 30,6 million
- Revenue increased by 2,9%
- Service revenue, which excludes handset revenue and other revenue, increased by 7,5%
- Data revenue increased by 37,2%
- EBITDA margin increased by 1,3 pp to 33,4%

MTN South Africa delivered encouraging results despite operational challenges including industrial action in the first
half of the year. A strong focus on customer experience, competitive offerings, aggressive network rollout and employee
engagement resulted in a successful turnaround in the second half of the year. The operation increased its subscriber
base by 9,3% to surpass 30 million customers. 

The pre-paid segment increased by 12,3% to 25,3 million subscribers for the year, attributable to attractive voice and
data offerings. The post-paid subscriber base decreased by 3,3% to 5,2 million as a result of the low availability of
handsets, which normalised in the fourth quarter of the year. 

Total revenue increased by 2,9%, driven mainly by healthy growth in data revenue. This was, however, offset by a 18,0%
reduction in handset revenue and a 2,4% decrease in outgoing voice revenue. Service revenue, which excludes handset
revenue and other revenue, increased 7,5%. Data revenue increased by 37,2% and contributed 31,7% to total revenue. 
This was supported by strong 3G and LTE network rollout as well as increased 3G and LTE device penetration. The number 
of smartphones on the network increased by 10,6% to 7,6 million.

EBU and digital services revenue showed positive trends with more services offered to EBU customers and content
downloads gaining traction. The market in South Africa, however, remains highly competitive in this area. 

The EBITDA margin expanded by 1,3 pp to 33,4% benefiting from cost-containment initiatives including lower staff and
advertising costs and lower handset sales. However, the increased expansion of the network resulted in higher rent and
utilities and transmission costs.

Capex for the period was R10 948 million, 92,9% higher than the previous year. In the year, the operation added 
966 2G, 1 593 co-located 3G and 3 148 co-located LTE sites expanding 3G and LTE coverage and ensuring improved quality 
and capacity. Improving quality of service remains a priority, however, the rollout process did cause some network 
disruptions.

The operation continues to actively engage with the authorities regarding the planned auction of 2,6GHz and 3,5GHz
spectrum frequency needed to further expand and enhance our LTE network. As a short-term solution, the operation has
re-farmed existing spectrum to cater for LTE technology. 

Nigeria 

- Subscribers increased by 2,3% to 61,3 million
- Revenue declined by 2,1%*
- Data revenue increased by 18,8%*
- EBITDA margin decreased by 5,6 pp to 53,0% (excluding tower profit)

MTN Nigeria experienced a challenging year with heightened regulatory pressure severely impacting performance. In
particular, the suspension of regulatory services and the subscriber registration requirements, which led to the
disconnection of 6,7 million subscribers. MTN Nigeria is working to complete the registration process with these 
disconnected subscribers and actively engaging the high value subscribers. Weak economic conditions and the limited 
availability of US dollars also contributed to a lower-than-expected performance.

While the operation reported a 2,3% increase in subscribers to 61,3 million, its market share reduced to 44,7% from
49,0% reported in the previous year. This was largely a result of the ongoing withdrawal of regulatory services
restricting MTN Nigeria from introducing new tariff plans and promotions in the market and the disconnection of 
subscribers. 

Total revenue reduced by 2,1%*. This was mainly due to the absence of new competitive offerings and 
multiple SIM card usage resulting in a decline in outgoing voice revenue. Data revenue increased by 18,8%* and 
contributed 19,5% to total revenue. While data revenue growth was supported by a 60,7% increase in smartphones and 
higher digital services revenue, it was negatively impacted by regulatory requirements, which obliged the operation to 
seek permission from the customer before charging out-of-bundle rates. Slow data speeds and lower effective data tariffs 
also had a negative impact. 

Digital revenue showed positive growth supported by the continued success of digital music and mobile financial services. 
MTN Nigeria’s EBU was, however, negatively impacted by the constrained economy as a result of low international oil prices.

MTN Nigeria’s Mobile Money offering, Diamond Yellow, continued to gain traction with approximately 6,2 million
accounts registered at the end of December 2015. The focus in the year was on partnering additional banks and other 
financial services companies as well as the expansion of an agent network.

The EBITDA margin declined by 5,6 pp to 53,0%. This was largely due to increased build-to-suit towers, higher lease
costs from the sale of towers, the impact of a weaker naira on US dollar expenditure relating to managed services and
network rollout costs, digital services revenue share, an increase in debt provisions and in marketing spend. The transfer
of the final tranche of 4 696 towers to the tower company was completed on 1 July 2015.

During the year, 597 new 2G sites and 1 856 co-located 3G sites were added. Capex declined by 40,4% to R4 993 million,
impacted by the tower transaction as well as increased use of build-to-suit towers. Notwithstanding this, the rollout
of capex was below budget. Improving quality and data speeds of the network in some parts of the country remains a
priority. MTN Nigeria is engaging with suppliers to resolve challenges experienced and is expected to ramp-up its rollout 
by the end of the second quarter of 2016. 

On 3 November 2015, the regulator approved the renewal of MTN Nigeria’s operating spectrum in the 900MHz and 1 800MHz
frequency bands to 31 August 2021. In addition, on 31 December 2015, MTN Nigeria concluded the acquisition of Visafone
Communications Ltd. This combined with the acquisition of a 4G/LTE licence and digital TV spectrum will provide the
operation with access to sufficient spectrum to rollout LTE services.  

Iran (joint venture, equity accounted)

- Subscribers increased 5,0% to 46,1 million
- Revenue increased 11,6%* 
- Data revenue increased  90,2%*
- EBITDA margin decreased 1,3 pp to 41,5%

MTN Irancell delivered a strong performance despite the impact of a slow economy and sanctions. Subscribers increased
by 5,0% to 46,1 million in a highly penetrated market. This was supported by the continued adoption of 3G and LTE
services by the youth segment.

Total revenue increased by 11,6%* driven by higher data revenue. Data revenue increased by 90,2%* despite a steep fall
in data prices, to contribute 30,2% to total revenue. This offset a 4,0%* decline in outgoing voice revenue as a result
of aggressive competition in the market and data substitution. Data revenue was supported by a strong 3G and LTE
network as well as a 52,7% increase in the number of smartphones on the network to 26,4 million, representing more than 
half of the subscriber base. 

In the year, MTN Irancell launched its EBU ahead of the easing of sanctions in the country to provide dedicated ICT
and business-to-business (B2B) services to business customers. 

MTN Irancell’s EBITDA margin decreased by 1,3 pp to 41,5% as a result of an increase in regulatory fees and
transmission costs associated with 3G and LTE network rollout.
 
Capex for the year amounted to R8 531 million (100%) with a focus on network modernisation and the continued expansion
of the 3G and LTE networks. In the year, the operation rolled out 432 2G sites, 2 443 co-located 3G sites and 1 266
co-located LTE sites. The renewal of the operation’s WiMax licence to TDD-LTE at the end of 2015 will support a nationwide
expansion of fixed LTE services in the year ahead. 

Large opco cluster

- Subscribers increased by 0,7% to 57,1 million
- Revenue increased by 5,5%*
- Data revenue increased by 47,7%*
- EBITDA decreased by 0,9%*

MTN Ghana delivered a solid performance despite a challenging economic environment. The operation increased its
subscriber base by 17,3% to 16,2 million, largely attributable to attractive voice and data offers aimed at subscriber
acquisition and churn management as well as digital and mobile financial services offerings.

Total revenue increased by 15,9%* supported by a 85,2%* growth in data revenue which contributed 30,6% to total
revenue. This was due to appealing data bundle packages, an improved device strategy and an increased focus on 3G quality 
and coverage. The number of smartphones on the network increased by 40,8% to 3,2 million in the year. 

Mobile financial services showed healthy growth. MTN Mobile Money customers increased by 68,1% to 5,7 million.

The EBITDA margin increased 3,1 pp to 40,5% despite an increase in US dollar-denominated expenses associated with the
sharp depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar. The increase in margin was mainly due to well-maintained costs and
no management fees paid to the Group in the year.

MTN Ghana invested R1 831 million in the network, adding 73 2G and 233 co-located 3G sites in the year. In December
the operation won a 4G/LTE licence in the 800MHz spectrum band enabling MTN Ghana to improve the quality and capacity of
its data network. 

MTN Cameroon’s performance was below expectations largely due to aggressive competition and a limited 3G network.
Subscriber numbers declined by 5,0% to 9,2 million, resulting in a decline in market share from 59,4% to 56,2%.

Total revenue declined by 4,6%* mainly due to a 12,5%* decrease in outgoing voice revenue. This was a result of lower
effective tariffs and network challenges in the first half of the year. Following corrective measures, network quality
showed improvements and stabilised revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Data revenue increased by 65,7%* and
contributed 14,2% to total revenue. This was supported by attractive data promotions, growth in digital services and MTN
Mobile Money. MTN Mobile Money subscribers increased 23,8% to 2,0 million in the year. 

MTN Cameroon’s EBITDA margin decreased by 6,6 pp to 36,2% as a result of an increase in rent and utilities as well as
maintenance and transmission costs associated with strengthening the 3G and 4G network.

Capex increased by 122,7%* to R1  911 million as a result of a focused 3G and 4G network rollout. During the year, the
operation rolled out 162 2G and 609 largely co-located 3G sites. The renewal of the operation’s licence in the year
allowed for a significant increase in the capacity of the network and enhanced data traffic speed. 

MTN Ivory Coast increased its subscriber base by 4,1% to 8,3 million in a competitive market. This was supported by
segmented offerings and bonus bundle promotions. 

Total revenue increased by 2,2%* supported by encouraging growth in data revenue. Data revenue increased by 41,5%* to
contribute 15,6% to total revenue. The increased uptake of digital services, MTN Mobile Money offerings and an
aggressive rollout of 3G sites contributed to data growth. MTN Mobile Money subscribers increased 12,8% to 2,9 million. 
The focus going forward is on the expansion of distribution channels and the introduction of new products.

The operation’s EBITDA margin declined by 4,4 pp to 34,2%. This was a result of high maintenance costs and an increase
in rent and utilities associated with network rollout. 

MTN Ivory Coast spent R833 million on its capex programme and rolled out 132 2G and 339 co-located 3G sites during the
period.

MTN Uganda’s subscriber base declined by 14,1% to 8,9 million, impacted by the disconnection of 3,7  million
subscribers in the fourth quarter who did not fully comply with regulatory subscriber registration requirements.

Total revenue increased by 2,8%*, supported by a 17,4%* increase in data revenue that contributed 28,3% to total
revenue. This was attributable to the launch of LTE services in the year, an increase in 3G and LTE devices and the 
continued success of MTN Mobile Money. Voice revenue continued to be impacted by high excise duties and the One Network 
Area initiative implemented in the region. Outgoing voice revenue decreased by 2,1%* mainly due to lower effective voice 
tariffs. Outgoing voice revenue, excluding roaming, decreased by 0,7%*. 

MTN Mobile Money recorded a 30,2% increase in registered subscribers to 9,5 million.

The EBITDA margin decreased by 4,7 pp to 34,5%, negatively impacted by US-dollar denominated expenses.

Capex in the year amounted to R951 million with 161 new 2G sites and 100 co-located 3G sites rolled out, improving
quality and capacity on the network.

MTN Syria increased its subscriber base by 1,9% to 5,9 million. Despite deteriorating conditions in the country, 
the operation increased total revenue by 4,7%* mainly as a result of strong data revenue growth. Data revenue increased 
by 22,8%* and contributed 27,7% of total revenue. The EBITDA margin declined by 1,2 pp to 17,7%. Capex amounted to 
R974 million in the year. 

MTN Sudan showed good progress despite a 5,5% decline in subscribers to 8,5 million due to subscriber registration
requirements. Total revenue increased by 14,8%*, supported by a 59,8%* increase in data revenue that contributed 21,9% to
total revenue. The EBITDA margin improved 1,2 pp to 35,0% despite a high inflation environment. Capex in the year
amounted to R819 million.

Small opco cluster 

- Subscribers increased by 7,3% to 37,4 million
- Revenue increased by 1,6%*
- Data revenue increased by 34,1%*
- EBITDA decreased by 8,0%* 

The small opco cluster increased its subscriber base by 7,3% to 37,4 million. Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Guinea Bissau
and South Sudan showed healthy double-digit subscriber growth. Despite weak economic conditions, revenue increased 
1,6%* supported by positive growth in Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Zambia, Guinea Bissau and South Sudan. Difficult operating
conditions in Yemen, Afghanistan, Liberia and Guinea Conakry resulted in a decline in revenue. Data revenue increased
34,1%* and continued to be impacted by slow 3G/LTE penetration. EBITDA decreased 8,0%* mainly due to high inflation and
unfavourable currency movements impacting foreign-denominated expenses.

As the Group will continue in its strategy to monetise its passive infrastructure, similar tower sale transactions 
may continue going forward. In addition, the impact of hyperinflation on the Group’s results will continue for as 
long as Syria and Sudan are considered to be hyperinflationary economies.

(1) The increase in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was mainly due to capital 
    expenditure for the year amounting to R29 611 million.    
                                                    
(2) The increase in investment in joint ventures and associates was mainly due to the Group recognising an 
    additional equity interest in Nigeria Tower Interco B.V. (note 16). 
    
    The devaluation of the rand, which is the presentation currency of the Group, against the functional 
    currencies of the Group’s largest operations contributed significantly to the increase in assets and 
    liabilities which are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at closing rates at the end 
    of the reporting period.

Notes to the summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015

1. Independent audit
                                     
The summary consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated 
financial statements. The directors of the Company take full responsibility for the preparation 
of the summary consolidated financial statements and that the financial information has been 
correctly derived and are consistent in all material respects with the underlying audited consolidated 
financial statements. The summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 
have been audited by our joint auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. and SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc., who 
expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditors also expressed an unmodified opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements from which these summary consolidated financial statements were 
derived. The auditors’ reports contained emphasis of matter paragraphs which drew attention to the 
circumstances, uncertainty and current status of the regulatory fine imposed by the NCC against MTN 
Nigeria Communications Limited. Disclosure regarding the matter that was emphasised by the auditors 
is contained in note 8 to the summary consolidated financial statements. A copy of the auditors’ report 
on the consolidated financial statements is available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, 
together with the financial statements identified in the auditors’ report.  

2. General information  

MTN Group Limited (the Company) carries on the business of investing in the telecommunications industry 
through its subsidiary companies, joint ventures and associates.    

3. Basis of preparation

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
JSE Limited Listings Requirements for provisional reports and the requirements of the Companies Act 
applicable to summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require provisional reports to 
be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued 
by the Accounting Practices Committee and the Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Standards Council (FRSC), and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 
Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements from which the summary consolidated financial statements were derived, are in terms  
of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated 
annual financial statements unless otherwise stated. These summary consolidated financial statements should be read 
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. A copy of the full set of the audited consolidated financial statements is 
available for inspection from the company secretary at the registered office of the Company.   
                                                                                                                
4. Principal accounting policies  
                                                                              
The Group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which were effective for the Group from 1 January 2015, none of which had a 
material impact on the Group. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summary 
consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting 
policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated financial statements unless otherwise stated.

5. Financial instruments

The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost except for its 
listed long-term borrowings set out below, as their carrying amounts closely approximate their fair values. Other 
than investments, there were no financial instruments measured at fair value that were individually material at 
the end of the current year.    
  
Listed long-term borrowings

The Group has listed long-term fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes in issue with a carrying amount of 
R11 633 million (2014: R8 686 million) and a fair value of R10 268 million (2014: R8 686 million) at 31 December 2015. 
The fair value of this instrument is determined by reference to published market values on the relevant exchange.

Fair value measurement of investments

The Group holds an equity investment in IHS Holdings Limited (IHS) at fair value of R9 250 million at 31 December 2015 
(2014: R5 912 million). The increase in the value of the investment is mainly due to an additional investment in IHS 
amounting to R1 189 million and foreign exchange translation movements relating to the investment at the end of the 
reporting period amounting to R2 149 million.
                                                                                                      
The investment is classified as available for sale and categorised within level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The 
fair value of the investment was previously determined with reference to recent transactions between market participants. 
The absence of recent transactions resulted in the fair value being determined using models considered to be appropriate 
by management and consequently the investment was transferred from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
The fair value is calculated using an earnings multiple technique and is based on unobservable market inputs including 
average tower industry earnings multiples of between 10 - 14 (2014: 12 - 14).
                                                                                                      
An increase of 1 in the multiple at the reporting date would result in an increase in the fair value by R792 million 
(2014: R434 million) and a 1 decrease in the multiple would result in a decrease in the fair value by R792 million 
(2014: R434 million).                                        
                                                                                                         
6. Segment analysis 
                                                                                
The Group has identified reportable segments that are used by the Group executive committee (chief operating 
decision maker (CODM)) to make key operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The reportable 
segments are geographically differentiated regions and grouped by their relative size.

Operating results are reported and reviewed regularly by the CODM and include items directly attributable to a 
segment as well as those that are attributed on a reasonable basis, whether from external transactions or from 
transactions with other Group segments. EBITDA is used as the measure of reporting profit or loss for each segment. 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and goodwill impairment losses.

8. Nigeria Regulatory fine

During October 2015, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) imposed a fine of N1,04 trillion (R80,7 billion(1)) 
on MTN Nigeria Communications Limited (MTN Nigeria). This fine relates to the timing of the disconnection of 5,1 million 
MTN Nigeria subscribers who were disconnected in August and September 2015 and is based on a fine of N200 000 for each 
unregistered subscriber. Subsequently during December 2015, the NCC revised the amount to N780 billion (R60,6 billion(1)).
      
MTN Nigeria, acting on external legal advice, has resolved that the manner of the imposition of the fine and the quantum 
thereof is not in accordance with the NCC’s powers under the Nigeria Communications Act, 2003 and therefore believes there 
to be valid grounds upon which to challenge the fine. Accordingly, MTN Nigeria followed due process and instructed its 
lawyers to proceed with an action in the Federal High Court in Lagos seeking the appropriate reliefs.  
                
On 22 January 2016, the judge adjourned the matter to 18 March 2016, in order to enable the parties to try to settle the matter. 

Pursuant to the ongoing engagement with the Nigerian Authorities, MTN Nigeria on 24 February 2016 made an agreed without prejudice 
good faith payment of N50 billion (R3,9 billion(2)) to the Federal Government of Nigeria on the basis that this will be applied 
towards a settlement, where one is eventually, hopefully arrived at. In an effort to achieve an amicable settlement, MTN has 
agreed to withdraw the matter from the Federal High Court in Lagos. 
                                
In arriving at an appropriate provision at 31 December 2015, management has applied its judgement resulting in a provision being 
recorded as required in accordance with IFRS, amounting to N119,6 billion (R9,3 billion(1)).  

In light of the engagement with the Nigerian Authorities, the Group has provided limited disclosure relating to the provision 
in accordance with IFRS.

FURTHER UPDATE ON THE FINE IMPOSED ON MTN NIGERIA AND RENEWAL OF
CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders were advised on 22 January 2016 that the above-mentioned matter came up for
hearing before the Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria when the judge adjourned the matter to 18
March 2016 in order to enable the parties to try and settle the matter.

Pursuant to the ongoing engagement with the Nigerian Authorities, MTN Nigeria has today made an
agreed without prejudice good faith payment of 50 Billion Naira (USD250 million) to the Federal
Government of Nigeria on the basis that this will be applied towards a settlement, where one is
eventually, hopefully arrived at. In an effort to achieve an amicable settlement, MTN has agreed to
withdraw the matter from the Federal High Court in Lagos.

Phuthuma Nhleko in his capacity as Executive Chairman of MTN Group and a director of MTN Nigeria
is continuing to lead the team engaging the Nigerian Authorities with a view to settling the matter.

Shareholders are therefore advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the Company’s
securities until a further announcement is made.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2015 (“the
financial results”) which will be announced on the JSE Limited Stock Exchange News Service on Thursday,
3 March 2016.

Paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements requires a trading statement to be published as soon
as an issuer and its directors are satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial results
for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from the financial results for the previous
corresponding period.

Given the ongoing discussions taking place with the Nigerian authorities, there remains some uncertainty as to
the final quantum of the Nigerian fine, should an out of court settlement be reached. Notwithstanding the
uncertainty of the outcome of the various engagements relating to the fine, shareholders are advised that,
excluding the fine, the Company is expecting to report a decrease of at least 20% in basic headline earnings per
share (“HEPS”), which equates to a reduction of at least 307 cents for the year ended 31 December 2015 when
compared with the previously reported HEPS (FY2014) of 1 536 cents. The negative earnings performance has
been impacted by a number of factors with the operational underperformance in Nigeria, resulting from the
subscriber disconnections and the withholding of regulatory services, being a key contributor to this.

Shareholders are advised that a further trading statement will be issued as soon as there is a reasonable
degree of certainty as to the likely range within which the Company’s HEPS is expected to decrease.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither been reviewed nor reported on
by MTN`s external auditors. The information provided in this announcement does not contain and should not
be construed as containing any forward-looking statements or projections of any nature whatsoever for the
period ended 31 December 2015.

MTN Nigeria acting on legal advice has resolved that the manner of the imposition of the
fine and the quantum thereof is not in accordance with the NCC’s powers under the
Nigerian Communications Act and therefore there are valid grounds upon which to
challenge the fine.

Accordingly MTN has followed due process and has instructed its lawyers to proceed with
an action in the Federal High Court in Lagos seeking the appropriate reliefs.

MTN is advised that in the current circumstances in line with the lis pendens rule (pending
legal action) the parties are enjoined to restrain from taking further action until the matter
is finally determined. This is consistent with previous judicial decisions in Nigeria.

Notwithstanding this action the Company will continue to engage with the Nigerian
Authorities to try and ensure an amicable resolution in the best interests of the Company,
its stakeholders and the Nigerian Authorities.

Shareholders are therefore advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

MTN GHANA AWARDED A 4G/LTE LICENCE

Shareholders are advised that Scancom Limited (“MTN Ghana”) was declared a winner in the
auction process of a 15 year 4G/LTE licence in the 800 MHz spectrum band for a purchase
consideration of US$67.5 million. The National Communications Authority of Ghana will award
the licence and spectrum to MTN Ghana once the licence fee has been paid.

The award of this licence will enable MTN Ghana to launch 4G/LTE services to support the
increasing demand of data services and improve customers’ data usage experience. MTN Ghana
surpassed 15 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Data revenue
increased 78,6% year-on-year for the nine months period ended 30 September 2015 and
contributed 28,7% to total revenue. For the same period the operation had approximately 3
million smartphones on its network.

Previously, MTN Ghana was only able to provide 2G and 3G services (voice and data) to its
customers using 900Mhz, 1800Mhz and 2100Mhz spectrum which cannot be extended for
4G/LTE technology due to licence restrictions.

As part of the eligibility criteria of the licence and spectrum, MTN Ghana is required to have a
minimum of 35% Ghanaian ownership in place within 13 months from the effective date of the
licence. As a group which owes its founding and growth to the emerging world, MTN is
committed to the growth of local economies and development of communities where it
operates. Consequently, MTN is exploring various options to comply with the eligibility criteria.

Further update on the fine imposed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and
renewal of cautionary announcement

On 3 December 2015 shareholders were informed that MTN had received a formal letter dated
2 December 2015 from the NCC (the First Letter) informing the Company that, after considering
the Company’s request, it had taken the decision to reduce the fine imposed on the MTN
Nigerian business from the original N1,040,000,000,000 (One Trillion, Forty Billion Naira) (the
Original Fine) to 674 Billion Naira, which had to be paid by 31 December 2015. The fine relates
to the late disconnecting of 5.1 million MTN Nigerian subscribers in August and September
2015. This was a reduction of 35% of the Original Fine.

Late on 3 December 2015, the day after receipt of the First Letter, the Company received a
further letter from the NCC dated 3 December 2015 (the Second Letter). The Second Letter,
which was stated to supersede the First Letter, informed the Company that the fine had
actually been reduced by 25% to 780 Billion Naira and not by 35% to 674 Billion Naira, as was
stated in the First Letter. The payment date remained 31 December 2015.

Neither the First Letter nor the Second Letter sets out any details on how the reduction was
determined.

The Company is carefully considering both the First Letter and the Second Letter, and the
Executive Chairman Phuthuma Nhleko will immediately and urgently re-engage with the
Nigerian Authorities before responding formally, as it is essential for the Company to follow due
process to ensure the best outcome for the Company, its stakeholders and the Nigerian
Authorities, and accordingly all factors having a bearing on the situation will be thoroughly and
carefully considered before the Company arrives at a final decision.

Shareholders are therefore advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

MTN Group: New operating structure and senior management changes


Shareholders are referred to the announcements issued by the Company on the JSE Limited’s Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) since 26 October 2015.

MTN advises shareholders that it has reviewed its operating structure with a view to strengthening
operational oversight, leadership, governance and regulatory compliance across its 22 country operations
in Africa and the Middle East. To this end, MTN has resolved to re-implement its previous reporting
structure. This will see MTN Group restructured into three regions – namely West and Central Africa
(“WECA”), South and East Africa (“SEA”), and Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”). MTN has also
made a number of senior appointments to support this structure.

Effective 1 December 2015 Jyoti Desai assumed the new position of Group Chief Operating Officer
(“COO”). Based in Johannesburg, she reports to the Executive Chairman, Phuthuma Nhleko. Ms Desai
has 14 years’ experience at MTN. She has previously held the positions of Chief Information Officer at
MTN Nigeria, was COO of MTN Irancell and was recently seconded to support the Nigerian country
operations. Her replacement as Group Chief Technology and Information Officer will be announced soon.

Two regional Vice Presidents (“VP”) have been appointed, also reporting to the Executive Chairman. The
VP for WECA is Karl Toriola, with Ismail Jaroudi the VP for MENA. The VP for SEA will be announced
soon.

Based in Nigeria, Mr Toriola has been at MTN for 10 years, having held senior operational roles at MTN
Group and MTN Iran. He was formerly also the Chief Technology Officer at MTN Nigeria and CEO at
MTN Cameroon.

Mr Jaroudi has been CEO of MTN Syria since 2006. Prior to this he held senior operational roles for
Investcom’s subsidiaries across the Middle East and North Africa.
Also reporting to the Executive Chairman is the new Group Executive for M&A, Matthew Odgers. The
former head of TMT for Africa & the Middle East and head of investment banking for MENA at UBS, Mr
Odgers led UBS’s overall relationship with MTN.

MTN Nigeria’s CEO Michael Ikpoki and the head of Regulatory and Corporate Affairs Akinwale Goodluck
have tendered their resignations with immediate effect. They are replaced by Ferdi Moolman as MTN
Nigeria CEO and Amina Oyagbola as its head of Regulatory and Corporate Affairs. Mr Moolman was
previously COO at MTN Irancell and most recently CFO at MTN Nigeria. A Nigerian national, Ms
Oyagbola also retains the position of MTN Nigeria’s Head of Human Resources. She formerly headed
regulatory affairs at the Nigerian operating company.

The search for the MTN Group CEO is underway and remains a priority.

Commenting on the announcements, MTN Group Executive Chairman Phuthuma Nhleko said: “This
revised structure and strengthened leadership will improve operational oversight and increase
management capacity. This will enable MTN to continue to realise its strategy and vision, while also
ensuring we achieve high governance standards and robust risk mitigation.""

With the financial year closing on 31 December 2015, the MTN Group will report its FY2015 results in line
with the former structure – namely for MTN Nigeria, MTN South Africa, Large Operating Companies and
Small Operating Companies.
