TRADING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2020

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, an issuer is required to publish a
trading statement as soon as it becomes reasonably certain that its earnings and/or headline earnings per share
for the next period to be reported on are expected to differ by at least 20% from those of the previous
corresponding reporting period.

As set out in the prospects section of its results announcement for the year ended June 2020, the group
expected its earnings for the six months to December 2020 (a post-COVID period) compared to the six months to
December 2019 (a pre-COVID period) to be impacted given the base effect.

Shareholders are now advised that IFRS headline earnings per share (HEPS), earnings per share (EPS) and
normalised earnings per share for the six months to 31 December 2020 (current period) are expected to decline
by between 20% and 25% from the reported 2019 comparatives of 249.4 cents, 249.3 cents and 249.7 cents,
respectively.

Whilst this performance remains in line with guidance, the earnings trend for the four months from 1 July 2020 to
31 October 2020 is reflecting a better than anticipated rebound.

In terms of revenue, period-on-period (October 2019 to October 2020) net interest income (NII) increased 2%
whilst non-interest revenue (NIR) was down marginally. NII remained resilient despite muted growth in advances,
pressure on margins, and the impact of endowment and excess liquidity levels, however, the deposit franchise
continued to show good growth through the period (+18%). Retail and commercial deposits grew 13% and 20%,
respectively, with large corporate deposits increasing 17%. The UK deposit franchise saw strong growth of 25%.

NIR declined 2%, with fee and commission revenue reducing 1%, reflecting decreased levels of activity across
the retail and commercial segments as well as the lower price increases effective 1 July 2020.

Revenue growth for the four months to October 2020 has been more resilient than initial expectations. NII has
been supported by ongoing growth in the deposit franchise (+4% since June 2020) and some advances growth.
Retail advances are flat compared to June 2020. This reflects risk cuts in certain unsecured portfolios, although
origination in residential mortgages and VAF is almost back to pre-lockdown levels. Commercial and large
corporate advances declined marginally due to lacklustre lending activity and lower utilisation of facilities.
Advances in the UK operations were flat, with MotoNovo origination trending above pre-COVID levels.

The NIR trajectory has rebounded strongly, supported by payroll recovery which, on an aggregate basis, is back
to pre-COVID levels. October 2020 volumes are up compared to June 2020, in particular:

-    total financial transactions up 22%;
-    banking app transactions up 16%;
-    point-of-sale swipes (merchant acquiring) up 38%; and
-    swipes by FNB card holders up 29%.

The period-on-period credit loss ratio showed a marked increase, with the impairment charge increasing 44%.
For the four months to October 2020, the credit loss ratio improved compared to the 1.91% reported at 30 June
2020. The four months’ build-up in NPLs is marginally better than expectations.

Collections are back at pre-COVID levels and continue to trend better than expected, with a small cohort of
customers entering extended relief. Despite the better than anticipated rebound, given the prevailing uncertainty,
the group has not adjusted its provisioning assumptions and methodology.

Operating expenses continue to trend at inflation, resulting in a deterioration in the cost-to-income ratio
compared to 30 June 2020.

The group has remained capital generative and the group’s CET1 ratio (including unappropriated profits) has
increased from the 11.5% reported at 30 June 2020.


Expected earnings ranges:

                       6 months to December 2019    6 months to December 2020     6 months to December 2020
                                                            (expected maximum             (expected minimum
                                                             decrease of 25%)              decrease of 20%)
    HEPS                                   249.4                        187.0                         199.5
    EPS                                    249.3                        186.9                         199.4
    Normalised EPS                         249.7                        187.2                         199.7

With regard to the outlook, whilst the first four months of the financial year are better than expected, the group
remains cautious on the sustainability of this rebound. Significant uncertainties remain in the system which may
play out in the first six months of 2021; the COVID-19 pandemic is not over and South Africa could experience a
second wave. In addition, the long-term impacts of the lockdown are not yet fully known. The South African
medium-term budget confirmed the ongoing fiscal and macroeconomic challenges which the group believes will
continue to weigh on economic activity and constrain growth.

Shareholders are advised that the estimated financial information on which this trading statement is based has
not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s external auditors. FirstRand’s results for the current period will
be released on SENS on Thursday, 4 March 2021.

AMENDMENT TO FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED’S CREDIT RATINGS

On 24 November 2020, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered the long-term local currency and
foreign currency deposit ratings on five South African banks, including FRB. This follows the downgrade
of the South African sovereign rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

The rating action on the banks, including FRB, was driven by:
1) deterioration in the creditworthiness of the South African sovereign, as reflected in the downgrade
   of the South African government to Ba2 from Ba1 on 20 November 2020; and
2) the gradual weakening of the banks’ standalone credit profile as the COVID-19 pandemic
   exacerbates an already challenging operating environment in South Africa.

Moody’s maintains a negative outlook on the bank, reflecting the negative outlook on the sovereign
rating.

Summary of rating actions on FirstRand Bank Limited:

                                                                           To                From

PROVISIONAL AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

FirstRand's portfolio of integrated financial services businesses comprises FNB, RMB, WesBank, Aldermore and Ashburton Investments. The group operates in South
Africa, certain markets in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK, and offers a universal set of transactional, lending, investment and insurance products and services.

""The COVID-19 pandemic is a once in a generation event and has had a profound impact on the world. In South Africa it resulted in the deepest GDP contraction since
the Second World War. The lockdown devastated the economy and it will be a long hard road back to recovery.

FirstRand's performance for the year to 30 June 2020 reflects the depth of the crisis. However, the group believes that the actions it has taken to strengthen and protect
its balance sheet, combined with the structure of its portfolio and its chosen strategies, will ensure ROE and earnings recovery once the current stress scenario
normalises.""

OVERVIEW OF RESULTS

FirstRand's results for the year to 30 June 2020 reflect the extremely difficult operating environment, with normalised earnings decreasing 38% to R17.3 billion
compared to 30 June 2019. ROE declined to 12.9%. Most of this decline was due to the much higher than expected credit impairment charge, driven by forward-looking
economic assumptions required under IFRS 9. In addition, post the beginning of lockdown in March 2020, underlying customer income and affordability in all segments
deteriorated sharply, as evidenced by lower levels of underlying transactional and credit turnover and in the amount of debt relief requested by customers, resulting in
increased arrears and non-performing loans (NPLs).

The group's capital position remained strong, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital adequacy ratio of 11.5%. However, despite this healthy position, the board has
not declared a final dividend given the Prudential Authority's (PA's) current guidance to preserve capital.

Pre-provision operating profit showed a decrease of 2%, which points to a resilient operating performance, despite margin pressure, subdued non-interest revenue growth

- FNB demonstrated operational resilience, supporting its retail, small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) and commercial customers through a range of debt relief
  propositions and multi-channel transactional solutions. As South Africa's leading digital bank, FNB was able to fulfil origination, account service and liability gathering
  digitally throughout the lockdown, with particularly strong growth in deposits.
- RMB delivered solid annuity income growth, underpinned by disciplined balance sheet deployment, with good growth in core advances and deposits. RMB's
  portfolio benefited from strong flow-trading activities in Nigeria, and the overall performance of RMB's rest of Africa franchise offset, to some degree, the pressures
  experienced in the domestic businesses.
- WesBank's pre-provisioning operating profit was impacted by lower associate earnings. Excluding this impact, pre-provisioning profits would have been flat year-on-
  year. The business continued to extract efficiencies.
- Aldermore grew customers on the back of advances and deposit growth.


COVID-19 created unprecedented economic stress, which has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the economy. One of the implications of this stress was the
need to provide payment relief solutions for customers. For the South African businesses, some of these solutions are outlined below:

- Retail customers in good standing were offered emergency funds designed to bridge short-term liquidity needs and provide cash flow relief. The loans were priced
  at the prime interest rate with zero fees and a flexible repayment period starting three months after relief was taken up. No early settlement penalties are levied. This
  customer-centric approach covers all FNB products and those WesBank customers who bank with FNB. Payment holidays were also offered.
- FNB provided relief to commercial customers primarily in the form of payment holidays and additional relief was offered to SMEs through the government-guaranteed
  loan scheme.
- For corporate, relief was advanced on a case-by-case basis. Corporate relief was provided in the form of additional liquidity facilities, payment holidays and covenant
  waivers.


Eligibility for relief followed a risk-based approach and was assessed at an overall customer level.

For retail customers industry guidance set by the Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) was followed. Corporate and commercial portfolios were assessed against
the respective sector's sensitivity to the impact of COVID-19.

In the UK, Aldermore's focus was on providing forbearance for existing clients.

Revenue and cost overview

Total group net interest income (NII) increased 4% on the back of resilient balance sheet growth, offset by margin compression given the endowment impact from interest
rate cuts. Net interest margin (NIM) declined 30 bps to 445 bps, reflecting a higher proportional increase in liquid assets due to strong growth in deposits whilst advances
growth slowed. Advances increased 6% (1% in constant-currency terms) and deposits grew 10% (7% in constant-currency terms). Growth in advances and deposits is
unpacked by operating business below.

** Reflects growth in customer deposits.


Advances growth in FNB occurred mainly in the premium and commercial segments, with the consumer segment sharply down, reflecting the lack of capacity in lower-
income households to take on credit. Overall retail advances growth declined significantly during lockdown reflecting depressed demand and cautious credit origination. At
WesBank, the decline in advances reflects the material drop in applications during the first two months of lockdown.

Advances growth to the corporate and commercial sectors was muted due to weak macroeconomic conditions and low levels of business confidence. This was further
compounded by the impact of COVID-19.

Deposit growth benefited from strong momentum in savings and investment products and retail customer balances increasing pre- and during lockdown. Commercial
customers maintained liquidity to support cash flow demands given the prevailing uncertainty, and large corporate deposit growth was underpinned by clients holding
higher current account balances.

The group's operational NIR was down 1% reflecting a reduction in fee and commission income, and negative growth in insurance income of 5% and investment income
of 14%. This was partly offset by a 32% increase in revenue from markets' trading activities.

FNB's NIR declined 2% due to the significant decrease in volumes during lockdown. FNB assisted customers by waiving SASwitch fees, rental relief on speedpoints and
other devices, and data charges. In addition, as part of its annual pricing review (pre-pandemic), FNB had already reduced certain fee categories. These factors collectively
impacted NIR by approximately R529 million.

The decline in insurance income was driven by increased credit life and death claims and forward-looking claims provisions. Pleasingly in-force annual premium
equivalent (APE) grew 7% (non-credit life APE increased 14%). The number of new policies declined 2% despite strong growth in underwritten life products.

RMB's private equity income declined due to impairments raised on a limited number of investments in the portfolio reflecting the pressures in the underlying economy.
This was despite an uptick in realisations and resilient annuity income which benefited from investments made in previous periods and the current year.

Growth in operating expenses was contained at 3%, reflecting the focus on cost management and lower variable staff expenditure given current year performance, and
was achieved despite continued investment in:

- insurance and asset management growth strategies;
- platforms to extract further efficiencies;
- the build-out of the group's footprint in the rest of Africa; and
- the process and system modernisation of the UK business.

Additional costs incurred were associated with managing employee and customer wellbeing on premises and in branches, and the rapid facilitation of remote working for
a significant proportion of staff when lockdown commenced.

Despite the level of cost containment, given the degree of pressure on the topline, the group's cost-to-income ratio increased to 52.9%.



Credit performance

FirstRand has revised its macroeconomic outlook for 2020/21, with material downward revisions to key economic variables affecting the group's activities, including a
sharp contraction in real GDP of 8%, a significant increase in unemployment and weakness in property markets. These revisions have been incorporated into the group's
credit provision models in line with IFRS 9 requirements, with all segments and portfolios experiencing notable incremental impacts from forward-looking adjustments.

This, together with arrears (up 42%), resulted in performing provisions increasing R9 billion, mainly driven by conservative coverage ratios. Group NPLs increased 39% to
4.37% of advances (2019: 3.33%). This required further provision of R6.2 billion, however, coverage has been largely maintained.

All of this combined resulted in a R15.2 billion (45%) increase in provisions (2019: R5.1 billion increase) held against loans and advances across all stages, products
and portfolios. The following table unpacks these movements and operational credit losses, and explains the group's materially higher credit impairment charge of R24.4
billion, and the credit loss ratio increase to 191 bps (2019: 88 bps).

All provisions raised reflect the group's best estimates against available data and scenario analysis (see pages 183 to 187 of the online version for detailed macro
forecasts) and are considered appropriately prudent given the prevailing risk in the system. In addition, the group has conservatively provided for a sharp increase in credit
life retrenchment claims, taking account of the latest economic outlook together with write-downs on non-private equity investments - these are reflected under NIR.

DIVIDEND STRATEGY

The board noted the guidance from the PA regarding dividends. Despite the group's healthy capital position which has built up over many years of strong capital
generation, the board has not declared a final dividend. However, it's important to recognise that regular and sustainable dividends, apart from being a material part of
any shareholder investment proposition, matter to many beneficiaries dependent on these cash flows, such as pension fund members and, specifically, the FirstRand
Empowerment Foundation, whose corporate social investment (CSI) activities will be materially constrained.

At this stage, the board has not adjusted the group's dividend strategy or long-term cover range.

As previously stated, the board will revisit the cover range should:

- capital demand increase to support sustainable balance sheet growth; and/or
- macro risks materially trend outside of the group's current scenarios.

Economic activity in South Africa is expected to start to rebound from the depths of the first half of 2020. This is mainly linked to the easing of lockdown measures and
could stem the level of job losses and support the start of a recovery. However, given the South African government's limited capacity to inject further stimulus into the
economy, there will be ongoing permanent damage to household and business balance sheets. This will limit the extent to which the economy will be able to recoup the
output losses sustained during the first half of the year. As a result, private sector credit growth will remain weak and activity levels will continue to trend lower than
pre-crisis.

The UK is likely to recover faster, as households and business activity rebound following the easing of lockdown conditions and the government's significant stimulus
measures. This rebound will, however, face the added complexity of Brexit uncertainty during the latter part of 2020, which may constrain growth.

For FirstRand, the economic impact of COVID-19 will continue to place acute pressure on the group's performance for the rest of the 2020 calendar year. Trends post
lockdown are improving as the economic recovery slowly emerges, however, activity levels will remain muted on a relative basis, balance sheet growth will be subdued,
and the credit performance will not materially improve. Whilst this will translate into a recovery of earnings for the six months to December 2020 on a rolling six-month
basis, the period-on-period performance compared to the six months to December 2019 (a pre-COVID-19 period) will be a further reduction given the significant base
effect.

FirstRand anticipates an upward trajectory in earnings in the second half six months to June 2021, although the absolute level of earnings on a year-on-year basis are
unlikely to revert back to June 2020 levels.

FirstRand believes that the actions it has taken to strengthen and protect its balance sheet, combined with the structure of its portfolio and the strategies it continues to
execute on, will ensure ROE and earnings recovery once the current stress scenario normalises.

FURTHER TRADING STATEMENT BY FRB’S PARENT IN RESPECT OF THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

FRB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstRand Limited (FirstRand or the group), which is listed on the JSE
Limited and the Namibian Stock Exchange. The bank represents approximately 75% of the group’s balance
sheet and earnings base. FRB noteholders are therefore referred to the announcement released by FirstRand on
the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) on 12 August 2020, in which it advised FirstRand shareholders
that it has a reasonable degree of certainty in respect of the group’s financial results for the year ended 30 June
2020 (the current period).

The group’s attributable earnings per share, headline earnings per share, and normalised earnings per share for
the current period are all expected to be between 35% and 45% lower than reported for the prior financial year
ended 30 June 2019 (the comparative period).

As indicated in FirstRand’s trading statement of 4 June 2020, the main driver of this decline in earnings is the
materially higher than expected credit losses and credit impairment charge, driven by the forward-looking economic
assumptions required under IFRS 9.

Although the group produced solid growth in earnings for the first half, and the second half includes only three
months of the impact of COVID-19, given the IFRS 9 requirement to consider forward-looking information in the
calculation of expected credit losses, the group will report a significant increase in credit provisioning levels for the
year ended 30 June 2020.

Since the beginning of lockdown in March 2020, underlying customer income and affordability in FirstRand’s retail,
commercial and large corporate segments have deteriorated sharply, particularly in those sectors most affected
by the lockdown restrictions. This is evident in lower levels of underlying transactional and credit turnover and in
the amount of debt relief requested across all client segments. Given the continuation of the pandemic and the
associated lockdown restrictions, these trends are expected to continue for some time.

Informed by these trends, FirstRand has revised its macroeconomic outlook for 2020/21, with material downward
revisions to key economic variables impacting the group’s activities, including a sharp contraction in GDP of -8%,
a significant increase in unemployment and weakness in property markets.

The revisions have been incorporated into the group’s credit provisions under IFRS 9, with all segments and
portfolios experiencing notable incremental impacts from forward-looking adjustments. The total impact of these
adjustments will result in credit loss ratios exceeding those experienced during the global financial crisis, in part
reflecting the faster pace of impairment recognition under IFRS 9.

Whilst credit impairments represent the most significant driver of the decline in earnings, further pressures include
the negative endowment impact as a result of interest rate cuts and margin pressure, subdued non-interest revenue
growth due to lower absolute volumes during the lockdown period, and depressed new business origination. In
addition, the group has conservatively provided for a sharp increase in retrenchment claims as well as elevated
death claims in its insurance business, taking account of the latest epidemiological and economic outlooks.

The bank exceeds all prudential minimum regulatory requirements and maintains a strong balance sheet with
buffers in excess of minimum regulatory requirements.

The forecast financial information on which the group’s trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the group’s external auditors. FirstRand and FirstRand Bank’s results for the year ending 30 June
2020 will be released on SENS on Thursday, 10 September 2020.

Normalised earnings per share                                       497.3                            273.5 – 323.2

As previously stated, the group considers normalised earnings to most accurately reflect its operational
performance. Attributable earnings in the comparative period included R2.3 billion of earnings relating to the sale
of the Discovery Card business, the absence of which accounts for a 7.6% reduction in the current year.

As indicated in the trading statement of 4 June 2020, the main driver of this decline in earnings is the materially
higher than expected credit losses and credit impairment charge, driven by the forward-looking economic
assumptions required under IFRS 9.

Although the group produced solid growth in earnings for the first half, and the second half includes only three
months of the impact of COVID-19, given the IFRS 9 requirement to consider forward-looking information in the
calculation of expected credit losses, the group will report a significant increase in credit provisioning levels for the
year ended 30 June 2020.

Since the beginning of lockdown in March 2020, underlying customer income and affordability in FirstRand’s retail,
commercial and large corporate segments have deteriorated sharply, particularly in those sectors most affected
by the lockdown restrictions. This is evident in lower levels of underlying transactional and credit turnover and in
the amount of debt relief requested across all client segments. Given the continuation of the pandemic and the
associated lockdown restrictions, these trends are expected to continue for some time.

Informed by these trends, FirstRand has revised its macroeconomic outlook for 2020/21, with material downward
revisions to key economic variables impacting the group’s activities, including a sharp contraction in GDP of -8%,
a significant increase in unemployment and weakness in property markets.

The revisions have been incorporated into the group’s credit provisions under IFRS 9, with all segments and
portfolios experiencing notable incremental impacts from forward-looking adjustments. The total impact of these
adjustments will result in credit loss ratios exceeding those experienced during the global financial crisis, in part
reflecting the faster pace of impairment recognition under IFRS 9.

Whilst credit impairments represent the most significant driver of the decline in earnings, further pressures include
the negative endowment impact as a result of interest rate cuts and margin pressure, subdued non-interest revenue
growth due to lower absolute volumes during the lockdown period, and depressed new business origination. In
addition, the group has conservatively provided for a sharp increase in retrenchment claims as well as elevated
death claims in its insurance business, taking account of the latest epidemiological and economic outlooks.

The group remains well capitalised and its capital and liquidity ratios are expected to remain strong and well above
required minimums.

Shareholders are advised that the forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed and reported on by the group’s external auditors. FirstRand’s results for the current period will be
released on SENS on Thursday, 10 September 2020.

    •  Line 20(a) is amended by the deletion of “b” in the statement “Yes, subject to the provisions of
       paragraph 93(b)” and the replacement thereof with “c”, such that the statement now reads “Yes,

TRADING STATEMENT ISSUED BY FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED’S PARENT FOR THE YEAR TO 30 JUNE 2020

FRB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstRand Limited (FirstRand or the group), which is listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange. The bank represents approximately
75% of the group’s balance sheet and earnings base. FRB noteholders are therefore referred to the
announcement released by FirstRand on the JSE Limited Stock Exchange News Service earlier today,
in which it indicated that although it does not have a final view of the performance of the lending books
during May and June, it has sufficient insight to advise its shareholders, with a reasonable degree of
certainty, that headline earnings per share (HEPS), earnings per share (EPS) and normalised earnings
per share (normalised EPS) for the current period are expected to be more than 20% lower than those
reported at 30 June 2019 (HEPS: 497.2 cents per share; EPS: 538.6 cents per share; normalised EPS:
497.3 cents per share).

The main driver of this slowdown in group earnings growth is the materially higher credit impairment
charge for the period, driven partly by deterioration in the lending portfolio performance, but more
significantly by the forward-looking assumptions used in the modelling of expected credit losses.

IFRS 9 requires the group to consider forward-looking information in the calculation of expected credit
losses, therefore the group has estimated an increase in customer stress caused by the pandemic and
resultant economic pressures anticipated over the next twelve to eighteen months. This stress has
been incorporated into the calculation of the group’s expected credit losses and has resulted in a
material increase in provisioning, even though the year to June 2020 only includes three months of the
pandemic.

Other notable drivers of the decline in group earnings include the negative endowment impact on the
back of interest rate cuts and margin pressure. Non-interest revenue growth has also showed a marked
decline due to lower absolute volumes during the lockdown period.

With regard to capital, funding and liquidity, FirstRand supports the actions taken by the South African
Reserve Bank. The group and bank remain well capitalised and capital and liquidity ratios are expected
to remain strong and well above required minimums.

The forecast financial information on which the group’s trading statement is based has not been
reviewed and reported on by the group’s external auditors. FirstRand and FRB’s results for the year
ending 30 June 2020 will be released on SENS on Thursday, 10 September 2020.

TRADING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 2020

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, an issuer is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes apparent that earnings per share for the next period
to be reported on are expected, with a reasonable degree of certainty, to differ by at least 20% from those
of the previous corresponding reporting period.

FirstRand Limited (FirstRand or the group) is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
(the pandemic) on its performance for the year ending 30 June 2020 (current period). Although the group
does not have a final view of the performance of the lending books during May and June, it has sufficient
insight to advise shareholders, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that headline earnings per share
(HEPS), earnings per share (EPS) and normalised earnings per share (normalised EPS) for the current
period are expected to be more than 20% lower than those reported at 30 June 2019 (HEPS: 497.2 cents
per share; EPS: 538.6 cents per share; normalised EPS: 497.3 cents per share).

The main driver of this slowdown in earnings growth is the materially higher credit impairment charge for
the period, driven partly by deterioration in the lending portfolio performance, but more significantly by
the forward-looking assumptions used in the modelling of expected credit losses.

ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE FRB NOTES LISTED ON THE MAINBOARD

ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE FRB BANK GOLD BOND

FirstRand Bank Limited wishes to advise noteholders that interest payable to investors at maturity of the FRB
Gold Bond will be dependent on the ZAR value of the ounce interest as at redemption. As a result of fluctuations
in the USD gold price and the rand/dollar exchange rate, the ZAR value of interest paid at maturity may not
equal the sum of the ZAR interest announced annually via SENS. FRB further wishes to advise that interest is
calculated in ounces of gold and as such for purposes of calculating the annual interest which has accrued on
the note, interest earned per ounce is converted to a ZAR amount at the end of February in each year. Interest
accrued on the FRK02 bond for the period 12 August 2019 - 28 February 2020 has amounted to 0.00383
ounces per unit, which yields an approximate rand interest value of ZAR 97.50 per bond unit.

*A rand gold price of ZAR 25420 per ounce has been applied (as at London close of business on the last
business day of February).

ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE FRB PLATINUM ETF LINKED STRUCTURED NOTE

FirstRand Bank Limited wishes to advise noteholders that interest payable to investors at maturity of the FRB
Platinum ETF note will be dependent on the unit value of the notes at redemption. Interest accrued on the
FRTP01 note for the period 1 March 2019 – 28 February 2020 has amounted to 0.00273973 per unit, which
yields an approximate rand interest value of ZAR 37.62 per unit.

FTSE/JSE notes the announcement by RMB Holdings (South Africa, FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index constituent,
RMH, ZAE000024501) regarding the unbundling of its shareholding in Firstrand Limited (South Africa,

In the event, shareholders of RMB Holdings will receive 1.31189 shares of Firstrand Limited for each
share held.

Subject to Finalisation and based on the current timetable, FTSE/JSE anticipates the following treatment:

On the ex-date, a temporary line representing the shares of Firstrand Limited distributed to RMB Holdings
shareholders will be added to RMB Holdings’ Indexes. The close price of the temporary line will be
updated daily to align with the close price of Firstrand Limited.

RMB Holdings will have its price adjusted by the value of the Firstrand Limited Unbundling (1.31189 * 23

remain in its indexes with an increased investability weight in accordance with the terms received.

AMENDMENT TO CREDIT RATINGS OF FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED AND FIRSTRAND LIMITED
On 7 May 2020, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) lowered the long-term issuer credit ratings on FirstRand Bank
Limited and FirstRand Limited. This follows the downgrade of the South African sovereign rating to BB- from
BB, which was driven by the significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on fiscal and growth prospects. S&P
does not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency sovereign ratings given the direct
and indirect impact that sovereign distress would have on domestic banks' operations. The outlook is stable.
Summary of rating actions on FirstRand Bank Limited and FirstRand Limited:

                                                                             To                 From

NOTIFICATION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE APPLICABLE PRICING SUPPLEMENT OF THE FRPT01 NOTES

In accordance with condition 23.1 of the terms and conditions of the ZAR 30 000 000 000 Note
Programme, dated 29 November 2011 and as amended from time to time (the programme), FRB hereby
notifies noteholders of the FRPT01 notes that it has amended and restated the applicable pricing
supplement of the FRPT01 notes (the amended aps), issued under the programme, to give effect to
amendments of a technical nature.

The FRPT01 applicable pricing supplement has been amended as follows:

  (i)     adding the words “Two Business Days after the” prior to the words “Maturity Date or Early
          Redemption Date” in the definition of “Payment Date” in line item 36(f) of the amended aps;
          and
  (ii)    including the material change statement in line item 96 of the amended aps.

The amendment in (i) above was required to allow FRB to comply with the required JSE Limited (“JSE”)
timelines in relation to the redemption of the FRPT01 notes, as the existing structure of the notes did
not allow it to do so. The amendment in (ii) above was inserted to ensure that the pricing supplement
complied with the current version of the JSE Debt Listings Requirements.

The amended aps, reflecting the amendments, is available for inspection at the registered office of FRB
and      will    be     made       available    for     inspection      on     the   FRB       website,

WITHDRAWAL OF FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED’S PARENT FOR THE
YEAR TO 30 JUNE 2020

FRB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstRand Limited (FirstRand or the group), which is listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange. The bank represents approximately
75% of the group’s balance sheet and earnings base. FRB noteholders are therefore referred to the
announcement released by FirstRand Limited on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service earlier today,
in which it withdrew the guidance it had provided in its interim results announcement on 10 March 2020
on the group’s expected earnings and ROE for the full year to 30 June 2020. This financial guidance was
based on the group’s macroeconomic view in early March 2020.

The escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown scenarios in most of the markets in
which the group operates, has required significant revisions to the group’s macroeconomic forecasts. As
a result, FRB noteholders are hereby advised that FirstRand’s 30 June 2020 financial performance
guidance has been withdrawn and expected earnings and ROE performance for the full year to 30 June
2020 remain under review.

Once FirstRand has sufficient certainty regarding its expected performance for the full year to
30 June 2020, it will update shareholders and FRB noteholders accordingly.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group or
bank’s external auditors.

In the Prospects section of its results announcement for the six months to 31 December 2019, released

earnings and ROE performance for the full year to 30 June 2020. This financial guidance was based on

AMENDMENT TO FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED’S CREDIT RATINGS

On 31 March 2020, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered the long-term local currency and
foreign currency deposit ratings on five South African banks, including FirstRand Bank Limited. This
follows the downgrade of the South African sovereign rating to Ba1 from Baa3, which was driven by the
continuing deterioration in South Africa's fiscal strength and structurally very weak growth. The outlook
remains negative.

These rating actions do not reflect any change in the fundamental credit quality of the bank.

Summary of rating actions on FirstRand Bank Limited:

                                                                            To                  From

RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News Service on
19 November 2019, 7 January 2020 and 18 February 2020, in which they were referred to the
corresponding announcements released by FirstRand’s largest shareholder, RMB Holdings Limited
(RMH) and RMH’s largest shareholder, Remgro Limited (Remgro), respectively.

RMH, in an announcement released on 31 March 2020, advised shareholders that, although it was still
committed to the restructure of its portfolio of assets and liabilities (the Restructuring), given the
unprecedented market turmoil being experienced in South Africa and globally as a result of COVID-19,
the RMH board is currently assessing the optimal timing and detailed transaction steps required to give
effect to the Restructuring.

In an announcement released on 31 March 2020, Remgro indicated that the Remgro board has
resolved that it will, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals, proceed with the full distribution of its
28.2% interest in RMH to its shareholders. The Remgro board has further resolved to retain its 3.9%
direct interest in FirstRand in order to provide additional balance sheet capacity to support growth in
Remgro’s existing portfolio and its ability to pursue new opportunities that may arise.

RMH and Remgro will publish separate announcements providing updates on or before 14 April 2020.

Accordingly, FirstRand shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in
FirstRand securities, until detailed announcements are made.

2.    The income tax expense and dividends paid to other equity instrument holders were restated for the year
      ended 30 June 2019 and the six months ended 31 December 2018 due to the adoption of amendments to

3.    The reclassification of management and fiduciary fees from insurance income to fee and commission
      income, both lines within non-interest revenue (NIR), for the six months ended 31 December 2018 to

4.    The reclassification of customer loyalty-related costs from operating expenses to fee and commission
      expenses in NIR for the six months ended 31 December 2018 and the year ended 30 June 2019, in line

      ended 30 June 2019.

UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019



FirstRand's portfolio of integrated financial services businesses comprises FNB, RMB, WesBank, Aldermore and Ashburton Investments. The group operates in South
Africa, certain markets in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK, and offers a universal set of transactional, lending, investment and insurance products and services.

""For the six months to December 2019, FirstRand produced normalised earnings growth of 5% and a normalised ROE of 21.2%. This is a commendable performance
given the speed of deterioration experienced in the domestic operating environment during this period, and testament to the strength of the portfolio and the quality of the
strategies executed by FNB, RMB, and WesBank in South Africa and the broader region. Aldermore continues to perform well and contributed again to growth and returns.

As a large systemic financial services group FirstRand is not immune to the serious macroeconomic challenges facing South Africa, and the damaging impact of ever
declining GDP growth is becoming evident in all of the group's customer segments in South Africa.""

FNB's domestic franchise produced a solid performance underpinned by non-interest revenue (NIR) growth, driven by ongoing customer gains and increased transactional
volumes, and net interest income (NII) growth, particularly from deposit generation. However, some of these drivers have slowed relative to the previous six-month period
to June 2019, in line with the weakening economic conditions.

RMB's diversified portfolio performance was resilient, with normalised earnings increasing 6% to R3.5 billion, notwithstanding that investing activities were down 46%
period-on-period due to the non-repeat of private equity realisations. The client activities franchise delivered another strong performance.

WesBank's performance remained subdued in a market still characterised by competitive pricing pressures and low vehicle sales. The business continued to focus on
cost management and protecting its origination franchise and return profile.

Aldermore produced a solid operational performance underpinned by growth in origination across all portfolios. Absolute period-on-period growth in earnings was,
however, impacted by new origination strain in MotoNovo and a GBP4.4 million mark-to-market loss on loan portfolio hedging compared to a GBP6.4 million profit in the
comparative period.

At a total group level, whilst NII growth has softened slightly, it remained resilient, increasing 8% period-on-period and, although advances growth slowed to 4%, growth
in deposits increased 7%.

RMB achieved NII growth of 12%, benefiting from period-on-period average advances growth, specifically from cross-border activities, and higher levels of working capital
utilisation. This growth is expected to moderate in the second half of the financial year.

FNB's NII growth moderated slightly to 9% period-on-period but still benefited from advances growth of 8%, and deposit growth of 10%, particularly from the premium
and commercial segments. WesBank's NII reflected a tough operating environment, with advances increasing marginally (+0.5%).

Group NIR growth slowed to 5% period-on-period, mainly reflecting relatively lower fee and commission income growth, and the non-repeat of private equity realisations
in the comparative six months to December 2018 (investment income was down 73% period-on-period).

FNB's fee and commission income grew 5%, mainly due to increased volumes across its digital and electronic channels, however, as expected, the rate of growth in
volumes is slowing due to customers' constrained disposable incomes, competitive pressures and certain fee concessions.

The strong increase in insurance income of 14% offset these pressures to some degree, benefiting from premium growth of 20% in core life products and 77% in
underwritten life policies, despite a slowdown in growth of credit life policies. This resulted in a 17% increase in the in-force annual premium equivalent (APE) period-on-
period. WesBank's insurance income grew 11% reflecting an improved performance from MotoVantage.

The group's fair value income, mainly driven by RMB's markets business, again showed strong growth of 18%.

Cost growth remained above inflation, increasing 7%. This reflects a focus on efficiencies, particularly given current topline pressures, and was achieved against a
backdrop of above-inflation staff wage increases and ongoing investment in:

- insurance and asset management growth strategies;
- platforms to extract further efficiencies; and
- the build-out of the group's footprint in the rest of Africa.

The group's cost-to-income ratio decreased marginally from 52.3% to 52.1%.

The group's credit performance, which is marginally weaker than expected, should be seen in the following context:

- The macroeconomic environment deteriorated more rapidly than anticipated, particularly in late 2019 and the velocity of this deterioration could not be immediately
  captured by FNB's origination scorecards and collections processes. Business is actively addressing these issues, however these interventions are only likely to have
  an impact in the next financial year.
- Historical advances growth has, as expected, resulted in new business strain.

The impact of the above was not experienced equally across all segments and product lines. It was more pronounced in FNB's unsecured retail advances and, to a lesser
degree, in commercial. Both of these portfolios are particularly sensitive to slowing nominal GDP growth and the impact of loadshedding.

Despite these issues, the overall credit impairment charge remains within the group's guided through-the-cycle (TTC) range at 105 bps (95 bps including Aldermore),
resulting in an 18% increase in the charge.

IFRS 9 also continues to impact the credit charge in that provision levels are upfronted for new origination and, similarly, higher levels are maintained for arrears.

The maturing of the write-off period during the six months to December 2019 resulted in a negative impact on the impairment charge, where the lengthening of the
write-off point in the six months to December 2018 provided a one-off relief.

IFRS 9 also has a significant impact on some balance sheet credit metrics (e.g. non-performing loans (NPLs) and coverage). Certain IFRS 9-specific changes, as indicated
below, will start normalising in the current financial year.

IFRS 9 contributes a material increase in NPLs mainly due to:

- the lengthening of the write-off period from six to 12 months, particularly in retail unsecured;
- a more stringent definition for customer rehabilitation (technical cures); and
- 12 consecutive full instalment payments to cure.

These IFRS 9-related changes, particularly the lengthening of the write-off period, accounted for 27% of the growth in NPLs. The underlying credit performance is
captured under the operational NPL definition.

As indicated previously, certain of the IFRS 9-related adjustments would start normalising in the current reporting period, e.g. curing. The maturing of the curing definition
and reinstating cure for debt-review accounts, resulted in a migration of c. R700 million of unsecured NPLs to stage 2 during the reporting period, with no change to
related coverage ratios.

Taking into account the above context, total NPLs have increased 17% or R6 447 million since December 2018, with operational NPLs increasing 15% (excluding
Aldermore), as shown in the table below.

The increase in operational NPLs (excluding Aldermore) reflects:

-   ongoing strong book growth in certain retail unsecured portfolios, and residential mortgages, primarily in the premium segment;
-   macro pressures in some sectors affecting WesBank corporate;
-   migration of certain highly collateralised or guaranteed counters in the RMB corporate and investment banking (CIB) portfolio; and
-   drought-related impacts in FNB commercial's agricultural portfolio.

This increase was driven by new business strain and the impact of the deteriorating macro environment.

A detailed explanation of the c. R910 million increase in the credit charge is unpacked below.

- FNB card impairments increased c. R270 million (+77%) on the back of 21% growth in advances. Operational NPLs in card increased materially (+84%), still reflecting
  the ongoing impact of the previously disclosed specific origination issues in the financial year to June 2019, whereby FNB saw strong book growth from new-to-bank
  and new-to-product origination strategies. This was further exacerbated by the worse than expected macro environment. These originated cohorts will continue to drive
  NPL formation over the medium term. The group expects ongoing elevated NPLs in card during the rest of the 2020 financial year.
- The FNB personal loans charge increased c. R300 million (+47%). Whilst book growth remained robust, up 21% period-on-period, it has moderated since June 2019
  (+7%) on the back of risk cuts. Advances growth continues to be driven by the premium segment. The increase in operational NPLs tracked book growth, which
  together with the pressures in collections resulted in an elevated credit charge. This trend may continue into the second half of the year.
- The DirectAxis (DA) impairment charge reflected a modest increase of R34 million (+5%) benefiting from a focus on repeat business in lower-risk segments and risk
  cutbacks in previous periods.
- The residential mortgages credit loss ratio increased to 22 bps on the back of an increase of 12% in NPLs. This reflects the continued normalisation of the credit cycle
  and expected origination strain.
- WesBank's vehicle asset finance (VAF) charge increased 2%, reflecting reduced appetite in higher-risk origination, resulting in NPL growth of 3%.
- FNB commercial NPLs increased 47%, impacted by growth in the highly collateralised agricultural portfolios against which proactive provisions were raised in prior
  years, as well as an increase in core transactional NPLs given previous levels of book growth. The impairment charge increased to 111 bps, reflecting a change in mix
  of NPLs with a higher proportion of transactional NPLs during the current period. The current impairment charge remains within expectations.
- The RMB CIB portfolio reported a 15% increase in NPLs period-on-period, specifically impacted by the migration of certain highly collateralised and guaranteed
  distressed counters. The resilient performance of the overall portfolio benefited from proactive provisioning in prior years, resulting in a modest charge of 7 bps during
  the period. The portfolio is, however, reflecting higher levels of corporate stress in South Africa.
- The 3% improvement in the credit performance in FNB's rest of Africa portfolio benefited from proactive provisioning in the prior financial year and the adoption of
  IFRS 9. NPLs reduced 15%, reflecting specific write-offs and some recoveries. However, ongoing tough macros remain in some of the jurisdictions in which the group
  operates (primarily Namibia, Mozambique and Zambia).
- Aldermore's NPLs increased 51% (46% excluding MotoNovo) in pound terms, driven by the expected normalisation across its retail portfolios off historically low levels
  and ongoing book growth in buy-to-let and owner-occupied residential mortgages over the last two financial years. In addition, NPLs were impacted by the migration of
  certain high-value asset finance counters during the last 12 months. Aldermore's impairment charge, excluding the MotoNovo new book, was 22 bps (46 bps including
  MotoNovo new book), in line with expectations.
- MotoNovo's combined impairment charge showed an increase of 8% in pound terms. New origination has focused on lower-risk buckets and, as a result, the
  impairment charge remained flat period-on-period.

Overall balance sheet portfolio provisions increased 7%.

The group's performing book coverage ratio improved period-on-period, although reflecting a marginal decrease of one basis point since June 2019. At 130 bps, the
performing book coverage remains comfortably above the current period impairment charge.

DIVIDEND STRATEGY

Given the group's high return profile and strong capital generation, the board has maintained the dividend cover at 1.7x, which remains below its stated long-term cover
range of 1.8x to 2.2x. The board will revisit the cover range:

- should capital demand increase to support sustainable balance sheet growth; and/or
- macro risks materially trend outside of the group's current scenarios.



PROSPECTS

Looking forward to the second half of the year, the group is of the view that the South African macroeconomic environment will continue to deteriorate, probably at a
faster rate than in the first half. GDP is expected to contract further, firstly driven by the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak which will result in lower exports and
supply chain disruptions, and secondly by weaker wage growth which translates into weaker consumer spending. Potential job losses could further exacerbate this
scenario, which is a real risk if corporates continue to right-size given GDP contraction, and SMEs feel the effect of ongoing energy disruption issues. The broader regional
picture is likely to be similar to the second half, although the COVID-19 outbreak could impact certain jurisdictions.

The UK is expected to show incremental growth in GDP, together with a strong labour market and an improving trend in house prices. The risk of a hard Brexit could
however change this picture.

FirstRand has already experienced a material slowdown in its domestic business since the beginning of 2020. Given the expected pressures on top line the group
appreciates the need for ongoing cost efficiencies, balanced with continued investment in sustainable growth strategies. Aldermore is expected to contribute to both
growth and returns.

The group will not achieve its stated target of real growth in earnings (defined as real GDP plus CPI) for the year to 30 June 2020 based on its current GDP forecast,
although earnings are expected to reflect growth and the ROE will remain well within the current target range of 18 to 22%.

FIRSTRAND APPOINTMENT OF GERT KRUGER AS GROUP CHIEF RISK OFFICER

FirstRand has appointed Mr Gert Kruger as group Chief Risk Officer (CRO), effective 1 July 2020. Mr
Kruger will report to the group Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mary Vilakazi, and will be a member of
the group's strategic executive committee (Stratco).

Mr Kruger has been with the group for 16 years, most recently as the CRO at RMB. He has extensive
experience managing all risk classes including credit, market, investment and operational risk. Prior to
joining RMB, Mr Kruger was instrumental in building the group's credit risk framework for retail,
commercial and corporate lending, which was implemented post the global financial crisis.

This deep understanding of group-wide frameworks, places Mr Kruger in a unique position to provide
greater portfolio oversight and ensure alignment of the second line of defence to FirstRand's integrated
financial services strategy and operating model.

The CROs of the underlying businesses will report directly to Mr Kruger. Mr Jaco Grobler has been
appointed CRO for FirstRand Bank and remains head of group enterprise risk management, also
reporting to Mr Kruger. Mr Grobler's new role ensures that key banking risks, and the governance of
those risks, particularly cybersecurity, environmental and social risk, and IT risk, have dedicated, senior
ownership.

Noteholders are referred to the notice of request for written consent released on SENS on 5 December 2019, with the deadline date being 12h00 on 13 January 2020 (the
noteholders written consent) at which the written consent set out below was considered:

        The Issuer seeks the Instrumentholders' written consent in accordance with Condition 23.3 (Modification) of the Terms and Conditions to amend and restate the
        Terms and Conditions of the Applicable Pricing Supplement to reflect the changes highlighted in the revised version of the Applicable Pricing Supplement annexed
        as Schedule 1 to the noteholders written consent, in order to correct the Scheduled Termination Date of the Credit Default Swap and to update for the latest JSE
        Debt Listings Requirements (where applicable).

In this regard, FRB confirms that the voting results from the noteholders written consent in relation to total nominal amount of that class of debt securities are as follows:

In compliance with the Listing Requirements of the JSE Limited (JSE Listings Requirements), shareholders are hereby advised that Mr Jan Jonathan Durand

28 November 2019.

Dr Nolulamo Nobambiswano Gwagwa and Ms Ethel Gothatamodimo Matenge-Sebesho have retired as independent non-executive directors from the boards
with effect from 28 November 2019. The boards wish to extend their sincere gratitude to these directors for their dedication and commitment in discharging
their duties over their tenure. The have contributed immensely to the group’s success and the board wishes them all the best.

Chairman’s statement on the resolutions on climate change
The chairman thanked those shareholders that supported the board on the climate change resolutions tabled by the Raith Foundation and Just Share NPC. He
reiterated that the group does not disagree with the Raith Foundation and Just Share NPC on the principle of increased disclosure, only the short timeframe
that had been proposed. He reconfirmed FirstRand’s stated commitment to increase its disclosure and the group is actively mapping climate risk in its lending
activities and the activities of its clients, which is a complex task.

In closing the chairman said that FirstRand seeks to engage, on an ongoing basis, with all shareholders on this very important issue.

Notification of changes to the board of directors
In compliance with the Listing Requirements of the JSE Limited (JSE Listings Requirements), shareholders are hereby advised that Mr Jan Jonathan Durand
has stepped down as an alternate non-executive director from FirstRand Limited and FirstRand Bank Limited boards of directors (the boards), with effect from
28 November 2019.

Dr Nolulamo Nobambiswano Gwagwa and Ms Ethel Gothatamodimo Matenge-Sebesho have retired as independent non-executive directors from the boards
with effect from 28 November 2019. The boards wish to extend their sincere gratitude to these directors for their dedication and commitment in discharging
their duties over their tenure. The have contributed immensely to the group’s success and the board wishes them all the best.

Chairman’s statement on the resolutions on climate change
The chairman thanked those shareholders that supported the board on the climate change resolutions tabled by the Raith Foundation and Just Share NPC. He
reiterated that the group does not disagree with the Raith Foundation and Just Share NPC on the principle of increased disclosure, only the short timeframe
that had been proposed. He reconfirmed FirstRand’s stated commitment to increase its disclosure and the group is actively mapping climate risk in its lending
activities and the activities of its clients, which is a complex task.

In closing the chairman said that FirstRand seeks to engage, on an ongoing basis, with all shareholders on this very important issue.

AMENDMENT TO FIRSTRAND BANK LIMITED AND FIRSTRAND LIMITED CREDIT RATINGS

On 26 November 2019, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) affirmed the issuer credit ratings of FirstRand
Limited and FirstRand Bank Limited. S&P lowered the South African long term national scale ratings
on FirstRand Bank Limited and affirmed its short term national scale rating. The long term and short
term national scale ratings on FirstRand Limited were also lowered.

The ratings actions follow the revision of the outlook on South Africa to negative from stable given the
weakening fiscal and debt trajectory and sizable contingent liabilities. S&P does not rate financial
institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency sovereign ratings, due to the direct and indirect
impacts of a sovereign distress on banks' operations. As a result, the outlook on FirstRand Bank Limited
and FirstRand Limited were also revised to negative.

These rating actions do not reflect any change in the fundamental credit quality of the bank.
