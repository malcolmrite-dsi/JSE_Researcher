COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 30 September 2020 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 30 September 2020

As at 30 September 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.55 billion, a decrease of EUR 260 million from 30 June 2020. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 30 September 2020. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 30 September 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization ('WHO') announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has continued to cause significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. The fair value of the Fund's investments will continue to be impacted by these factors. At the time of this announcement the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown.

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 30 September 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 26.57 (30 June 2020: EUR 28.09) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

Unquote

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in due course and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

REINET INVESTMENTS S.C.A. (""REINET"") - EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF ORDINARY SHARES LISTED ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE


The dividend payable to holders of Reinet ordinary shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""Reinet South African Shares"") is payable in rand via central security depository participants in Strate for all holdings of dematerialised Reinet South African Shares.

Reinet has recommended a total dividend of EUR 0.19000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Reinet at the annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday, 25 August 2020 in Luxembourg. 

There is no Luxembourg withholding tax payable on dividends which may be declared by Reinet.

In 2013 Reinet sought clarification from the South African Revenue Service ('SARS') as to the treatment of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares. This ruling from SARS was renewed for a further 5 years on 8 March 2018 in respect of any dividends to be declared by Reinet and paid to holders of Reinet South African Shares. SARS confirmed to Reinet that any such dividends would be treated as 'foreign dividends' as defined in the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962. Accordingly, any such dividends would be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at 20 per cent in the hands of holders of Reinet South African Shares unless those holders of Reinet South African Shares are otherwise exempt from the tax. Non-resident holders of Reinet South African Shares are required to fill in the appropriate SARS declaration form, if they wish to be exempted from the tax. 

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of euro to rand for payment of the Reinet South African Share dividend is ZAR 20.74010 : Euro 1. This exchange rate is determined on 18 August 2020. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per Reinet South African Share is 315.24952 ZAR cents, as set out in the table below:

             Gross dividend     South African       Net dividend
             per share          dividend tax        per share
             (in ZAR cents)     at 20%              (in ZAR cents)
                                (in ZAR cents)

Total        394.06190              (78.81238)           315.24952

The timetable for the dividend in respect of the Reinet South African Shares is anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""          Tuesday, 25 August 2020

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from
the commencement of business on          Wednesday, 26 August 2020

No cross-border movements of Reinet ordinary shares will be permitted between the clearing and settlement systems for the Dutch and Luxembourgish stock exchanges (Euroclear Nederland, Euroclear Bank and Clearstream) and the clearing and settlement system for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Strate) between Tuesday, 25 August 2020 and Friday, 28 August 2020, both days inclusive, and no Reinet South African Shares may be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 26 August 2020 and Friday, 28 August 2020, both days inclusive.

Note to former holders of certificated depository receipts issued by Reinet Securities SA in respect of Reinet ordinary shares (""Certificated DRs""):

Upon the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme in December 2017, the holdings of former holders of Certificated DRs were dematerialised through Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited reflecting Reinet South African Shares in dematerialised form in a valid account with a CSDP or broker as specified by the former holder of Certificated DRs, or, in the absence of such specification, in a nominee account for the benefit of the former holders of Certificated DRs, if and to the extent that they held 10 or more depository receipts. Former holders of Certificated DRs that have not specified a valid account with a CSDP or broker at the time of the automatic cancellation of the depository receipt programme are advised to regularise their accounts with their CSDP by contacting Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited to surrender their certificates and to obtain assistance and information on the process they must follow in order to regularise their holdings and to ensure their bank mandates are up to date.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE	


NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 30 JUNE 2020

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S., has today announced its net asset value as at 30 June 2020 as follows: 

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 30 June 2020

As at 30 June 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.8 billion, an increase of EUR 0.4 billion from 31 March 2020. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 30 June 2020. The NAV calculation has not been audited.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 30 June 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization ('WHO') announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has continued to cause significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. The fair value of the Fund's investments will continue to be impacted by these factors. At the time of this announcement the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown.

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 30 June 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 28.09 (31 March 2020: EUR 25.71) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in due course and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

NET ASSET VALUE OF REINET FUND S.C.A., F.I.S. AS AT 31 MARCH 2020

Reinet Investments S.C.A.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. has today announced its net asset value as at 31 March 2020 as follows:

Quote

Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('the Fund')

Net asset value of the Fund as at 31 March 2020

As at 31 March 2020, the net asset value ('NAV') of the Fund amounted to EUR 4.4 billion, a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion from 31 December 2019. 

This valuation reflects the Fund's shareholding in British American Tobacco p.l.c., Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited, its other investments and cash resources, together with other assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities have been revalued to their estimated fair values as at 31 March 2020. The NAV calculation is subject to completion of the year-end audit.

The entire ordinary share capital of the Fund of 171.3 million shares is owned by Reinet Investments S.C.A. In addition, 1 000 management shares in the Fund are held by Reinet Fund Manager S.A.

The net asset position of the Fund is a substantial element of the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. at 31 March 2020. However, the consolidated balance sheet of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will reflect other parent company assets and liabilities, including cash and amounts payable to or receivable from the Fund. As such, the NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. differs from that of the Fund.

In January 2020, the World Health Organisation (""WHO"") announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The wide variability in expected financial, social and epidemiological outcomes regarding the outbreak has led to significant levels of market uncertainty mostly reflected in increased market, currency and commodity volatility. At the time of this announcement the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains highly uncertain and is continuously changing. 

Net asset value per share of the Fund as at 31 March 2020

The NAV per share of the Fund amounted to EUR 25.71 (31 December 2019: EUR 31.87) based on 171.3 million shares in issue.

The NAV of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will be published in May 2020 and dividing that value by the total number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 184.3 million will result in a NAV per share for Reinet Investments S.C.A. which will differ from that of the Fund.

REINET EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS APPROVES REVISIONS TO THE TERMS OF THE PROSPECTUS

An Extraordinary General Meeting (the 'Meeting') of Reinet Investments S.C.A. (the 'Company') was held in Luxembourg today to approve proposed revisions to the investment guidelines of Reinet Fund S.C.A., F.I.S. ('Reinet Fund'), which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company issued at the time of the reorganisation of the Company and the listing of its shares in 2008 and subsequently amended in 2012 with the approval of a general meeting of shareholders of the Company. 
 
The Meeting also considered the deletion of the paragraph ""Limits on Illiquid Securities"" restricting investments in illiquid securities to no more than 50 per cent of the net assets of Reinet Fund.  

At the Meeting, a total of 137 729 895 ordinary shares and all the 1 000 management shares were present or represented by proxy, representing 74.74% of the total voting rights at the record date (10 January 2020) of 184 290 891, being the total shares in issue (195 942 286) less the treasury shares (11 651 395), the voting rights attached to which are suspended. Of the shares present or represented, 99.97% voted in support of the two proposed resolutions relating to i) the amendment of the investment guidelines and ii) the removal of the limits on illiquid securities. 

Commenting on the outcome of the meeting, Mr van Zyl, who acted as the Chairman of the Meeting, said:

Quote

""Our philosophy is to find and invest in assets that offer long-term growth potential. It is therefore important that Reinet have the flexibility to manage the size of and further investment in certain key investments, which will remain a feature of the portfolio. Having obtained shareholder approval at today's Meeting allows Reinet Fund to expand its exposure to certain key assets as required, which will be in the long term interest of the Company's shareholders. We thank shareholders for their strong support in this regard.""

As such, the net asset value of Reinet Investments S.C.A. may differ from that of the Fund. The net asset value per share of Reinet Investments S.C.A. will also differ from that of the Fund due to the difference in number of shares in issue.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


REINET INVESTMENTS PROPOSES REVISIONS TO THE TERMS OF THE PROSPECTUS

The Board of Reinet Investment Manager S.A., acting on behalf of Reinet Investments S.C.A. ('the Company') proposes to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to consider revisions to the prospectus (the 'Prospectus') of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reinet Fund S.C.A. F.I.S. (the 'Fund'), which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company issued at the time of the reorganisation of the Company and the listing of its shares in 2008 and subsequently amended in 2012 with the approval of a general meeting of shareholders of the Company.

Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the 'Fund Manager') manages a diversified portfolio of investments allowing for an emphasis on several key investments which the Fund Manager believes may add substantial value. The proportion of the Fundâ€™s assets represented by such key investments may be substantially higher than that of the other investments in the Fund's portfolio. 

It is proposed that the Prospectus is amended to allow an investment in such a key asset of up to 50 per cent of the Fund's total assets with all other assets remaining below 30 per cent of total assets. If the limits are exceeded as a result of market movements, adjustments to the portfolio will only be made when considered to be in the interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Commenting on the rationale for this proposed amendment, Johann Rupert, Chairman of the Company, said:

Quote

As communicated previously, Reinet remains focused on pursuing the planned diversification of the Fundâ€™s investment portfolio; its investment in British American Tobacco p.l.c. ('BAT') has provided the Fund with the capacity to fund new opportunities, either through borrowing or through the realisation of part of the shareholding. As at 30 September 2019 the Fund had sold over 16 million BAT shares for total proceeds of some EUR 720 million and made new investments of some EUR 2.4 billion in pursuit of further diversification of the Fund.

Whilst the Fund has significantly expanded its portfolio of new investments, the Fund Manager believes that the existence of certain key investments will remain a feature of the portfolio and is considered the most optimal way of creating value for the Fund's shareholders. 

Our philosophy is to find and invest in assets that offer long-term growth potential. We therefore invest to deliver strong returns over the long term, rather than to deploy short-term investment strategies designed to generate short-term results. However, we are currently limited â€“ due to risk diversification requirements - in our efforts to develop certain key investments that have the potential to achieve long term growth. An additional contribution of capital in certain key investments (other than BAT) could, over time, increase the Fund's current exposure to an investment beyond the 30 per cent threshold. This possibility has been discussed with the CSSF, the Fund's regulator, and has subsequently been approved.

Whilst on the one hand now placing a limit on the overall exposure of a single investment, in obtaining shareholder approval for the amendment to the Prospectus, Reinet will have more flexibility over time to manage the size of and further investment in key investments, which will be in the long term interest of the Reinet shareholders.

Unquote

On a separate point, the Prospectus restricts investments in illiquid securities to no more than 50 per cent of the net assets of the Fund. It is proposed to delete this restriction, as liquidity constraints are not directly relevant for the Fund, it being closed ended and investing for the long term, such that it does not have regular and unpredictable redemption obligations towards its shareholder, also noting that the Fund's shareholder is the listed and regulated securitisation vehicle Reinet Investments S.C.A. which has its ordinary shares listed and traded on three regulated stock exchanges.

Upon shareholder approval, the investment guidelines and the investment objective and policy which were originally described in the prospectus of the Company and subsequently amended in 2012 will automatically be updated and the Fund will submit its amended prospectus for approval to the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, the Luxembourg financial services regulator. 

It is anticipated that the shareholders' meeting will be held on 24 January 2020 to consider the revisions to the Prospectus.
