Anglo American Platinum closes ACP Phase B resulting in temporary build up in work-in-
progress inventory

Anglo American Platinum has made the pre-emptive decision to close the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
Phase B unit, following a series of water leaks, to ensure an ongoing safe operating environment, protect
employees and protect the integrity of the plant and surrounding processing assets.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum states:

“As indicated in our Q3 production report on 22 October, the ACP Phase B unit has been fragile and has
unfortunately recently experienced a number of further instances of water leaks. Whilst the ACP
management team has done extraordinary work to keep the unit operating safely over the past several
months, we have taken this pre-emptive decision to now close the ACP Phase B unit to ensure we protect
our employees, operating environment and the integrity of our assets. Whilst this early closure will result
in a temporary build up in work-in-progress inventory, we continue to make good progress with the rebuild
of the main ACP Phase A unit, which we expect to complete towards the end of this year.”

Increased monitoring, controls and systems were implemented to continually assess the ACP Phase B
unit and further water leaks were discovered. The ACP Phase B unit underwent a planned and measured
shutdown. Whilst the ACP management team has been able to complete repairs to previous water leaks,
after a comprehensive assessment, and with further water leaks discovered, the ACP Phase B unit now
requires more extensive repair work. As a result, the ACP Phase B unit has been closed for a full rebuild
in 2021.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company has refined 2.4 million PGM ounces. As production continues at
c.94% of normal production levels, the closure of ACP Phase B unit until ACP Phase A unit is
recommissioned will result in an increase in work-in-progress inventory, whose release will commence
once the ACP is operational. The Company has made significant progress with the Phase A unit and
remains on track to commission it before the end of this year, ahead of the original schedule of Q2 2021.

As a result of the closure of the ACP Phase B unit, the Company has lowered its refined production and
sales guidance for 2020 to c.2.5 million PGM ounces (previously 3.1-3.3 million PGM ounces). There is
no change to other guidance, including M&C production which remains at between 3.6 – 3.8 million PGM
ounces. The Company has contingency plans in place and will be engaging with customers to minimise
any disruption to contractual obligations.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company remains in a net cash position of c.R28 billion (unaudited) and has
R25 billion of committed facilities available.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum’s PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company’s smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum Limited is a member of the Anglo American plc Group and is a leading primary
producer of platinum group metals. The company is listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange
(JSE). Its mining, smelting and refining operations are based in South Africa, as well as its two joint
venture operations. Elsewhere in the world, the Group owns Unki Platinum Mine in Zimbabwe. Anglo
American Platinum is committed to the highest standards of safety and continues to make a meaningful
and sustainable difference in the development of the communities around its operations.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


OVERVIEW


- Safety performance did not meet expectations and tragically we had one work-related fatality at Amandelbult
    and one at the Modikwa joint-operation during Q3 2020.
- Covid-19 continued to impact the business, however own-managed operations reached 94% of normal
    capacity by the end of the quarter.
- Own managed mines PGM production increased by 1% to 652,000 ounces despite the continued impact
    of Covid-19. Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo delivered strong performances.
- Joint operations PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 23% to 190,600
    ounces largely due to the impact of Covid-19 and the safety stoppage at Modikwa.
- Refined PGM production - owned decreased by 14% to 1,020,700 ounces. The lower output was principally
    due to interruptions at the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP), offset marginally by increased throughput.
-   PGM sales volumes from production decreased 16% to 884,900 ounces due to lower refined production,
    and the rebuild of refined inventory.


Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, said:


“The third quarter has been challenging with two work-related fatalities at Amandelbult and the Modikwa joint-
operation. It is extremely disappointing that we have failed to ensure that every employee goes home safely to
their families every day. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of Mr Dennis Hlengani
Mdaka and Mr Lindile Manzingi. Our focus remains on safe and responsible production and the adherence to
Covid-19 measures, including extensive screening and testing protocols, at our operations.

“From a production perspective, we have managed to reach 94% of normal capacity by the end of the quarter
from our own-managed mines, with Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo delivering strong performances. Refined
production continues to be interrupted by water leaks at the Anglo Converter Plant’s Phase B unit. We have put
increased monitoring in place at the Phase B unit to ensure an ongoing safe operating environment for our
employees and will continue to take all appropriate measures to keep people safe while we wait for the main
Phase A unit to restart. We have made significant progress with the Phase A unit and remain on track to
commission it before the end of the year.”

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY & HEALTH

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities, however, regrettably had two loss of
life incidents during Q3 2020. On 13 September Mr Dennis Hlengani Mdaka passed away after a ventilation
related incident at the Modikwa joint operation. On 16 September Mr Lindile Manzingi from Amandelbult
succumbed to his injuries after a fall of ground incident at Dishaba Mine on 2 September. We again send our
sincere condolences to their family, friends and colleagues.


The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed operations for the quarter
worsened in the quarter at 2.85 compared to 2.60 in the prior period.


Learnings have been incorporated into our operational practice including intensifying critical control compliance
and assurance, particularly around fatal risk-related events. We continue our deliberate focus on operational
routines compliance, as well as strict verification through scheduled, frequent and increased leadership presence
at operations. Finally, we have an increased focus on planning to manage behavioural aspects proactively and
understand employee state of mind, particularly during the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic.


Covid-19 remains a significant challenge, however, Anglo American Platinum has fully embedded protocols to
ensure risks to the health of our employees are managed, as well as keeping vulnerable employees away from
potential harm. In addition to our world-class workplace Covid-19 protocols, we continue our extensive and
rigorous screening and testing process at our operations to help keep our employees, their families and our local


                                                                    2
communities safe and healthy. We believe that the combination of screening and testing helps us to ensure that
positive cases are detected earlier in the life cycle of the virus, allowing us to isolate and treat people in the earlier
stages of the disease and prevent the spread of infection.




PGM PRODUCTION


Total PGM production of 1,112,900 ounces decreased 2% against prior year largely due to lower production
predominantly from the joint operations of Modikwa and Kroondal, as well as lower production from Amandelbult.
This was largely offset by strong production performance from Unki, Mogalakwena and Mototolo who increased
production 12%, 9% and 6% respectively. Platinum production was down 2% to 516,400 ounces and palladium
production was flat at 352,200 ounces.


The impact of COVID-19 on the business continued in Q3 2020 and PGM ounces lost for the quarter amounted
to 119,000 ounces, bringing the year to date total to 712,000 ounces. The most notable impact in Q3 was at our
joint operations, where 55,000 ounces (mined and purchase of concentrate) were lost. A further 52,000 ounces
were lost from our third party metal providers and to a lesser extent at Amandelbult where we lost 5,000 PGM
ounces. Mototolo lost 6,800 PGM ounces due to COVID-19 for the quarter but exceeded the prior quarter output.


Due to the overall strong M&C production performance in Q3 2020, we have increased our full year M&C
production guidance to between 3.6 – 3.8 million PGM ounces (previously 3.1 – 3.6 million PGM ounces).


PGM production from own managed mines


Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 1% to 652,000 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 1% to 295,100 ounces and palladium production increased 6% to 238,600 ounces). The strong
performances at Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo was partly offset by lower volume from Amandelbult. The
Company reached 94% of its normal operating levels at its own mined operations at the end of the quarter.


Mogalakwena PGM production increased 9% to 315,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 7% to
132,000 ounces and palladium production increased by 12%, to 146,000). The PGM production increase is due
to higher throughput and improvements in concentrator recovery, but partly offset by a decrease in the 4E built-
up head grade. The mine continued to operate at normal production capacity during the quarter.


Amandelbult PGM production decreased 12% to 204,800 ounces (platinum production decreased by 13% to
102,800 ounces and palladium production decreased by 11%, to 48,300 ounces). The lower production against
Q2 2019 was primarily due to infrastructure closures at the end of 2019 at Tumela Upper (9,800 PGM ounces),
surface material/opencast production coming to end of life (21,200 PGM ounces) and COVID-19 restrictions
(5,000 PGM ounces). This was partly offset by increased production from Dishaba Upper (7,200 PGM ounces).
Amandelbult operated at 90% of normal operating levels at the end of the quarter.




                                                            3
Mototolo PGM production increased by 6% to 72,200 ounces (platinum production increased by 6% to 33,300
ounces and palladium increased by 7% to 20,700 ounces). This performance was despite suffering 6,800 PGM
ounce losses as a result of COVID-19 during the quarter, as the prior period was impacted by geological features
which resulted in a grade decline.


Unki PGM production increased 12% to 60,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 14% to 27,000 ounces
and palladium production increased by 10% to 23,600 ounces).

PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint operations PGM production in total decreased by 23% to 190,600 ounces (platinum production decreased
by 22% to 85,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by 24% to 56,400 ounces).

Modikwa PGM production decreased by 27% to 61,400 ounces (platinum production decreased by 25% to 24,000
ounces and palladium decreased by 27% to 23,200 ounces). This was largely due to Covid-19 restrictions, as
well as due to the tragic loss of life incident and associated safety stoppages.


Kroondal PGM production decreased by 21% to 129,200 ounces (platinum and palladium production decreased
by 21% to 61,400 ounces and 33,200 ounces respectively), largely due to Covid-19 restrictions.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties


Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, increased 8% to 270,200 ounces (platinum POC
increased by 13% to 136,000 ounces and palladium POC increased by 10% to 57,200 ounces). Increases in
volumes were from Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine and Platinum Mile while lower production was received
from other providers.


Refined PGM production


Refined PGM production owned, decreased by 14% to 1,020,700 ounces (refined platinum production decreased
by 13% to 503,800 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 2% to 354,100 ounces). The decrease
in the quarter was largely driven by Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit interruptions.


As previously highlighted, the ACP Phase B unit, which was recommissioned following the incident at the ACP
Phase A unit, has been operating past its useful life and therefore challenged with reliability issues. Increased
monitoring has been put in place at the ACP Phase B unit to allow for proactive risk control, ensuring an ongoing
safe operating environment for our employees and to maintain the integrity of our assets. Due these proactive
measures, water leak repairs, essential maintenance, testing and monitoring was conducted at the ACP Phase
B, production was disrupted for 20 days during the quarter.


Refined production in the final quarter is highly dependent on the ongoing stability of Phase B, until a controlled
switch-over to Phase A can be completed. As a result, we remain cautious on refined production in Q4 2020 and



                                                         4
have revised full-year refined PGM production guidance to the lower end of our previous guidance to between
3.1 – 3.3 million PGM ounces.


The ACP stoppages have resulted in a slight increase in work-in-progress (WIP) inventory between Q2 2020 and
Q3 2020. The build in WIP inventory is not lost production - only the timing of the release of WIP inventory to
refined inventory is impacted.


If the ACP Phase B unit creates a material risk to employees or assets by continuing to operate, the Company
will proactively conduct a safe shut-down, taking Phase B offline until the recommissioning of Phase A. The
rebuild of ACP Phase A remains on schedule with completion estimated towards the end of Q4 2020.


The Company is focused on embedding strong asset reliability, which is of key strategic importance to enable
Anglo American Platinum to position itself for the next stage of safe and sustainable value creation.


PGM sales volumes


PGM sales volume from production decreased by 16% to 884,900 ounces, in line with lower refined production
(platinum and palladium sales volume both decreased by 17% to 448,500 ounces and 261,700 ounces
respectively), as well as the rebuild of some refined inventory.

PGM sales volume from trading increased 210% to 341,000 (platinum trading volumes increased by 499% to
105,000 ounces and palladium trading volumes increased by 170% to 214,600 ounces).

PGM sales volumes for the year will remain highly dependent on the level of refined production in Q4 2020.

Unaudited financial position and committed facilities

At the end of the interim reporting period to 30 June 2020, the Company was in a net cash position of
R11.3 billion, including the customer prepayment. As at 30 September, the Company remains in a net cash
position of R20.6 billion. Anglo American Platinum also has R20.2 billion of committed facilities available.

2020 full-year guidance


We revise our full-year production and refined production guidance in line with performance year-to-date, and
expectations in the final quarter as follows:

Repurchase of Anglo Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the Alchemy Community Share Scheme,23 Sep 2020,"Repurchase of Anglo Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the Alchemy Community Share Scheme

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED

(“the Company"" or ""Anglo American Platinum"")


Repurchase of Anglo American Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the
Alchemy Community Share Scheme

Introduction

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on 25 August 2020 where the company
announced the successful settlement of the notional vendor finance (NVF) by its community share scheme
(Alchemy Scheme), resulting in the Lefa Le Rona Trust (LLRT), which is the umbrella trust on behalf of the
regional development trusts (DTs), now holding unencumbered shares in Anglo American Platinum . The
settlement of the NVF and transfer of value comes one year prior to the maturity of the Alchemy Scheme
funding period (December 2021), due to Anglo American Platinum’s strong share price performance.

The transaction structure provided for early settlement of the NVF when Anglo American Platinum’s volume
weighted average price (VWAP) reached a trigger price. This trigger event occurred on 27 July 2020 and
consequently the company has repurchased 4,889,680 shares from LLRT on 22 September 2020 at par
value of 10 cents per share (“the Repurchase”).

The Repurchase was done in terms of the authority granted by shareholders for the community share
scheme at the Company’s General meeting held on 14 December 2011.

 Total shares in issue after the share repurchase     265,292,206



*Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, will retain 500,000 of the
repurchased shares in treasury to satisfy obligations under the share incentive schemes with the remaining
4,389,680 repurchased shares being delisted and cancelled. The Company has applied for the delisting of
these shares from the JSE with effect from Tuesday 29 September 2020. After the repurchase the Company
will have 509,691 shares held in treasury.

Source of funds

The Repurchase was funded from the company’s available cash resources.

Impact of the Repurchase on the financial information of the Company

The acquisition will have no financial effect on the Company or its shareholders, other than in respect of
the repurchase costs that are normally incurred in transactions of this nature. The repurchase results in an
immaterial cash flow impact for the Company and does not have an impact on the Company’s earnings per
share and headline earnings per share.

Anglo American Platinum to transfer R2 billion of value in settlement of successful
community share scheme

Anglo American Platinum announces the successful settlement of the notional vendor finance (NVF) by
its community share scheme (Alchemy), resulting in the Lefa Le Rona Trust (LLRT), which is the umbrella
trust on behalf of the regional development trusts (DTs), now holding unencumbered shares in Anglo
American Platinum with a value of c.R2 billion at vesting. The settlement of the NVF and transfer of value
to communities comes one year prior to the maturity of the Alchemy Scheme period (December 2011 to
December 2021), due to Anglo American Platinum’s recent strong share price performance.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum says:

“I am delighted to announce that our community share scheme Alchemy, set up in 2011, has delivered
on its objective of creating sustainable shared value to our host communities and specific communities
from where our employees originate in the Eastern Cape, North West and Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries. The settlement will result in R2 billion of value transferring to these
communities via regional development trusts. These trusts will focus on advancing broad-based
community development including infrastructure, education and health developments, as well as
improving livelihoods. Anglo American Platinum is playing a responsible role by catalysing development
in our communities. Through our established governance structures, we will work with the DTs to ensure
the careful deployment of this capital so that it can further advance our efforts to deliver shared value and
build thriving communities.”

Background

In December 2011, Anglo American Platinum established a community empowerment and development
scheme named Alchemy. The transaction was structured to provide equity ownership of Anglo American
Platinum to the host communities around the mines and specific labour-sourcing communities, through
development trusts. The LLRT is the umbrella trust through which the regional DTs hold their interest in
the Company.

Transaction structure

At the time of the inception of Alchemy, the Company issued c.6.3 million shares at par value of 10 cents
per share, which are held by LLRT, representing 2.33% of the total issued share capital.

Of the total dividends paid to the LLRT relating to their shareholding of 2.33%, 60% was used to service
the NVF and the balance of 40% is retained by the LLRT. The dividends received by the LLRT to date
amounted to c.R300 million which has been deployed to further the development objectives of the DTs.

The subscription for the shares was funded through the NVF mechanism, facilitated by the Company.
The transaction structure provided for early settlement of the NVF when Anglo American Platinum’s
volume weighted average price (VWAP) reached a trigger price.
The trigger event occurred on 27 July 2020 and will result in the Company repurchasing 4,889,680 shares
from LLRT (not from the market) on 22 September 2020 at par value of 10 cents per share, to settle the
NVF. The vesting results in an immaterial cash flow impact for the Company.

The LLRT will have 1,400,685 unencumbered Anglo American Platinum shares held by LLRT (with a
vesting value of c.R2 billion at the date of the trigger event).

The shares held by LLRT are subject to restrictions until the end of the Alchemy Scheme period in
December 2021 – i.e. shares cannot be transferred, sold or encumbered.

Post the Alchemy Scheme period in December 2021, 40% of the shares can be distributed to the DTs
based on their proportional interest held and are entitled to monetise this investment. The remaining 60%
of shares held by LLRT are subject to a twenty year lock-in period, to the end of December 2041.

Governance

The DTs are managed by Trustees, including transparently selected community trustees, independent
trustees and company selected trustees. The DTs have been designed in consultation with locally-based
working groups, and structures and governance are carefully customised to serve local community
dynamics and development requirements.

Notes to editors:

The Lefa La Rona Trust (LLRT) was established in 2011 as a community empowerment vehicle to
ensure sustainable community development in the areas where Anglo American Platinum operates and
specific communities from where our employees originate (Eastern Cape, North West and SADC
countries). The Trust serves as a conduit to four independent community development trusts (DTs) and
a non-profit company (NPC) called Zenzele Itereleng, which serves Anglo American Platinum’s labour-
sourcing communities.

The Dikuna Tsa Sechaba DT serves Amandelbult and its surrounds, the Rustenburg DT serves
Rustenburg and its surrounds, the Bohwa Bja Rena DT serves Twickenham Project and its surrounds,
and the Ditholwana Tsa Rena DT serves Mogalakwena Complex and its surrounds.

Through these Public Benefit Organisation structures, funds generated from dividends on the LLRT
shares flow directly to locally relevant and ‘impact-by-design’ community development. These Boards of
Trustees with community-elected trustees have strong governance, senior operations managers and
experienced project development & implementation units in place.
This enables communities through these DTs to undertake initiatives and projects of their own, to help
confront their communities’ challenges and to create a sustainable future for themselves, beyond the life
of the mines in their vicinity. The development priorities include livelihood, education, health and poverty
relief.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented:

“On behalf of everyone at Anglo American Platinum, I would like to pay our respects to the victims of
the Covid-19 virus. We extend our deepest condolences to their family, friends and colleagues.

Our business has faced some significant headwinds in the first six months of 2020, with the impact of
Covid-19 on our operations and the temporary shutdown of the ACP following a force majeure incident.
Despite these challenges, we continued our commitment to safety, with zero fatalities at own-managed
operations for 620 consecutive days. We remain dedicated to the health and wellbeing of our employees
and local communities, investing R251 million in additional Covid-19 measures, including R55 million
on community initiatives which have benefitted over one million people.

Our financial results for the six months illustrate the resilience of the business. We ended the period
under review with an increase in EBITDA to R13.1 billion, a net cash position of R11.3 billion, and an
increase in return on capital employed to 48%. As always, we remain committed to disciplined capital
allocation, prioritising the need to maintain asset integrity, ensure a strong balance sheet. The Board
has declared an interim dividend of R10.23 per share.

We expect to see a stronger production performance in H2 2020, but caution that significant headwinds
still exist.”

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDING 30 JUNE 2020


OVERVIEW - PRODUCTION

- Resilient business – managing through the headwinds of national lockdowns during Covid-19 pandemic

- Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q2 2020, continuing the fatal-free period 
  at managed operations

- Strict implementation of Covid-19 prevention measures - including social distancing, hygiene measures,
  screening and testing, and provision of PPE – resulting in no operation needing to close due to spread of
  Covid-19 amongst employees

- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) decreased 41% against prior year (Q2
  2019) to 665,100 ounces, largely due to the impact of shutdowns implemented in South Africa and Zimbabwe
  in response to curbing the outbreak of COVID-19. This led to a loss of c.521,600 PGM ounces in the quarter

- Own managed mines PGM production decreased by 40% to 379,400 ounces largely due to the COVID-19
  shutdowns and subsequent ramp-up leading to a loss of 286,500 ounces, however impact was partially
  mitigated as open-pit and mechanised operations were able to safely ramp-up production faster (98%
  production level at the end of June)

- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 55% to 101,600 ounces
  largely due to the Covid-19 shutdowns, and the result of declaring force majeure leading to Kroondal material
  being processed by third parties

- Refined PGM production excluding tolling decreased by 67% to 407,000 ounces, primarily due to the
  temporary closure of the Anglo Converter Plant B unit (ACP) for repairs which was offline for 54 days in Q2

- PGM sales volumes (excluding tolling and 4E POC sales that are now tolled) decreased 55% to 548,000
  ounces due to lower refined production, partially supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER


SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities and reports zero fatalities in the period
at managed operations. The Company continues its fatal-free period as a result of the commitment made to
maintaining safety standards through shut down and start-up processes. The Total Recordable Case Frequency
Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed operations for the quarter improved 27% to 1.93 compared to 2.63
in the prior period.


PGM PRODUCTION
Total PGM production of 665,100 ounces decreased 41% (against prior period Q2 2019), with platinum
production down 41% to 307,500 ounces and palladium production down 34% to 228,500 ounces. The impact of
the shutdowns implemented by the Governments of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Zimbabwe in
response to curbing the outbreak of Covid-19 led to a loss of 521,600 PGM ounces in the quarter. In collaboration
with government, labour unions and employees, stringent measures were put in place to protect employees,
including social distancing, hygiene measures, screening and testing, and provision of PPE – resulting in no
operation needing to close due to spread of Covid-19 amongst employees.



PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines decreased 40% to 379,400 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 43% to 166,100 ounces and palladium production decreased 30% to 158,600 ounces), largely due
to the Covid-19 shutdowns which led to a loss of 286,500 PGM ounces in the quarter. The impact of the Covid-
19 shutdowns was partially mitigated due to high proportion of open-pit and mechanised operations which could
ramp-up at a faster pace than the conventional underground operations. Open-pit and mechanised operations
were able to get to 98% levels of production by the end of June 2020.



Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 8% to 277,600 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 8%, to 117,300 ounces and 128,900 ounces respectively). Mogalakwena surface operations were
granted the right to restart shortly after lockdown began and therefore the North concentrator continued operating


                                                                                             2
by drawing down on ore stockpiles. Thereafter, a gradual increase in operational activity was granted and by the
end of June, Mogalakwena mine was operating at 100% production levels and is expected to do so for the
remainder of the year.



Amandelbult PGM production decreased 78% to 50,100 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 78%, to 25,300 ounces and 11,700 ounces respectively), largely due to the Covid-19 shutdowns
which led to a loss of 174,000 PGM ounces in the quarter, as well as the closure of parts of Tumela Upper section
in December 2019 as they reached the end of life of mine (contributing 30,100 PGM ounces in the prior period).
At the end of June, Amandelbult mine reached 50% of targeted production levels and is expected to ramp up to
85% production levels by the end of the year, due to strict compliance to Covid-19 protocols and protecting
vulnerable employees who are not permitted to work on mine-site.


Mototolo PGM production decreased by 59% to 20,400 ounces (platinum production decreased by 59% to 9,500
ounces and palladium decreased by 58% to 5,800 ounces). At the end of June, Mototolo mine was operating at
a production level of around 90% and is expected to reach 100% production levels going forward.


Unki PGM production decreased 40% to 31,300 ounces (platinum production decreased by 40% to 13,900
ounces and palladium production decreased by 42% to 12,100 ounces). At the end of June, Unki mine was
operating at normal production levels of 100% and is expected to continue at this level to the end of the year.


PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)


Joint venture PGM production, decreased by 55% to 101,600 ounces (platinum production decreased by 56% to
45,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by 54% to 29,600 ounces). This was largely due to the
impact of Covid-19 shutdowns causing a loss of 126,000PGM ounces in the quarter, as well as the diversion of
material from Kroondal during the period of force majeure, which was processed by a third party.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties


Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, decreased by 28% to 184,100 ounces (platinum POC
decreased by 23% to 96,000 ounces and palladium POC decreased by 26% to 40,200 ounces), due to the impact
of Covid-19 shutdowns causing a loss of 109,100 PGM ounces during the quarter, as well as the diversion of
Platinum Mile concentrate during the period of force majeure, which was processed by a third party.


Refined PGM production

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, decreased by 67% to 407,000 ounces
(refined platinum production decreased 71% to 160,600 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by
64% to 147,400 ounces). Refined production was impacted by the temporary closure of the Anglo Converter
Plant (ACP) on 6 March 2020 and a subsequent closure during the first two weeks of June to repair a water leak
which was detected on 3 June.




                                                        3
ACP Repairs

A force majeure incident at the ACP (Anglo Converter Plant) on 10 February led to the closure of both ACP phase
A and phase B units from 6 March, with ACP phase B returning to steady state on 12 May. Following a subsequent
closure during the first two weeks of June, the ACP phase B has since ramped-up and is operating at full capacity.
The rebuild of ACP Phase A are ahead of schedule with completion estimated at the end of Q4 2020.


PGM sales volumes

PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, decreased 55% to 548,000
ounces, with platinum sales volumes down 65% to 195,700 ounces and palladium sales volumes down 64% to
160,900 ounces due to the decrease in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory.
Trading Sales volumes increased by 80% to 210,500 PGM ounces to ensure supply to customers.



2020 full-year guidance


We retain our full-year production and refined production guidance, as updated in the Q1 2020 production report
released on 23 April 2020. PGM production will be between 3.1– 3.6 million ounces, including platinum production
of between 1.45–1.65 million ounces and palladium production of 1.0–1.15 million ounces. Refined PGM
production will also be between 3.1–3.6 million ounces, including refined platinum production of between
1.45–1.65 million ounces and refined palladium production of 1.0–1.15 million ounces.


We acknowledge that significant headwinds exist in the second half of the year, including completing the rebuild
of the ACP Phase A, further Eskom power-outages, as well as the potential impact the Covid-19 pandemic could
have on our performance. Our priorities remain to ensure the safety of our employees and the integrity of our
assets and caution that these headwinds could impact our ability to meet full year guidance.

Anglo American Platinum update on ACP Phase B repair

Anglo American Platinum announced on 3 June 2020 that a water leak had been detected in the high-
pressure cooling section of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. All employees were safely
evacuated as a precaution. The Company took the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit
to secure a safe operating environment, protect employees and protect the integrity of the plant.

The detailed technical investigation into the cause of the water leak shows localised damage to a single
cooler tube that is now being replaced and confirms that this leak is unconnected to the repair work
recently completed on the ACP Phase B unit. Other maintenance is being carried out and additional
controls put in place whilst the ACP Phase B unit is off-line in order to provide greater operational stability.
The repair work is expected to be completed next week, and recommissioning will then start once a
detailed risk-based assurance process has confirmed it is safe to do so.

A prudent approach will be taken to safely ramp up the ACP Phase B unit. Increased monitoring will likely
result in intermittent stoppages to inspect the plant until the repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are completed.
The repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are progressing well and are now expected to complete towards the
end of 2020 due to the successful accelerated procurement of key long-lead time items.

Anglo American Platinum will continue to receive concentrate from third parties and joint ventures under
the purchase of concentrate and toll agreements and will continue to deliver metal to customers.

The stoppage of the ACP Phase B for repairs of this water leak is not expected to have any impact on
full year refined production guidance, which remains at between 3.1 – 3.6 million PGM ounces.

Company has taken the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit to ensure an ongoing safe

Anglo American Platinum ramps up ACP plant to restart refined PGM production

Anglo American Platinum has safely and successfully completed the repair of the Anglo Converter Plant
(ACP) Phase B unit. The ACP and full downstream processing operations are completing a safe ramp-
up and expect to be fully operational from 12 May 2020. Force majeure to suppliers of concentrate will
be lifted on that date.

CEO of Anglo American Platinum, Natascha Viljoen, stated:

“I am pleased to report that we have safely and successfully completed the repair of the ACP Phase B
unit ahead of schedule, enabling the restart of refined production of our platinum group metals and our
base metals. We were vigilant in adhering to strict health and safety protocols to keep the repair team
safe during the lockdown, whilst ensuring that we were able to implement social distancing and hygiene
requirements which form our new way of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have carried out substantial testing to ensure the stability of the ACP Phase B unit, and as we
complete the ramp-up, we are engaging with suppliers of concentrate to lift force majeure imminently. All
temporary commercial arrangements applicable during the force majeure period will revert to normal
commercial terms.”

The estimated final cost of repairs for ACP Phase B is c.R150 million, in line with the lower end of guidance
provided. Repair work on the ACP Phase A unit continues and is progressing in line with the project plan.
All orders for long lead items have been placed and the dismantling work started on site.

Due to the time taken to refine the respective platinum group and base metals, the force majeure notice
remains in effect for our refined metal customers. Force majeure arrangements with these customers will
be lifted in the future and in line with the provisions of our agreements.

Given the collective uncertainty around the start-up of ACP, the ramp-up of mining operations and the
potential impact of COVID-19, Anglo American Platinum retains its current guidance and will provide an
update as appropriate when we have further information and clarity on production.


A safe and successful repair under lockdown

In accordance with lockdown regulations, the repair team was able to continue with repairs throughout
the extended lockdown period in South Africa. All materials required for repairs were ordered and
available on site ahead of the lockdown, and there were no supply chain disruptions that impacted the
ability to complete the repairs. Safety protocols were implemented on site in line with Government
approvals and regulations. A construction work risk review was completed to determine work phasing,
method of execution, key resource identification and increased health protocols.

The ACP construction repair team was split into two teams that self-isolated for the duration of the repair
work, and COVID-19 specific health protocols were put in place for cleaning, screening and transport to
site. A new shift pattern was introduced that fostered social distancing. Increased site hygiene measures
for sanitisation, together with site safety and health supervision were implemented to ensure safety and
quality of construction. We have reported zero injuries, zero health issues or positive COVID-19 cases
and did not experience any health and safety or construction issues during the repair and ramp up.

The Company’s ability to continue these essential repairs during lockdown has been critical to the
resumption of the processing pipeline. As a result of the incidents at the ACP, and the need to shut
operations to secure a safe operational environment for employees, the Company could not process any
metal to final product during this period. With mining activity resuming to varying degrees under the
current Level 4 lockdown restrictions, the Company is now able to begin processing concentrate and
releasing metal from the pipeline.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDING 31 MARCH 2020 & UPDATE TO
RESPONSE ON COVID-19


OVERVIEW - PRODUCTION
- Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q1 2020, continuing the record fatal free
    period at managed operations
- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) decreased 7% against prior year (Q1
    2019) to 954,800 ounces, largely due to the impact of shutdowns implemented by the Government of the
    Republic of South Africa (RSA) in response to curbing the outbreak of COVID-19. This led to a loss of 61,000
    PGM ounces in the quarter
- Own managed mines PGM production decreased by 7% to 560,100 ounces due to the COVID-19
    shutdowns and some impact from Eskom power outages earlier in the quarter
- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 10% to 188,800 ounces
    largely due to the COVID-19 shutdowns
- Refined PGM production including tolling decreased by 15% to 743,900 ounces. This was due to the
    temporary closure of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) and the declaration of force majeure to secure a safe
    operating environment
- PGM sales volumes (excluding tolling and 4E POC sales that are now tolled) decreased 13% to 681,300
    ounces due to lower refined production, partially supplemented by a drawdown in refined palladium inventory

OVERVIEW – UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO COVID-19
-   Safe shutdowns implemented across all operations, with limited surface operations at Mogalakwena, later
    extended to limited mining operations at Mogalakwena and the start-up of Polokwane Smelter in April
-   ACP Phase B repairs continued throughout the lockdown period, making good progress and on schedule
-   Employees continue to be paid during the lockdown including full fixed pay, as well as pension and
    medical benefits and housing allowances where applicable
-   Local host communities continue to be supported through a comprehensive response plan focusing on
    providing food and water provisions, and training and supply of equipment to clinics and hospitals
-     Supporting small business – supplier response plan in place to deliver range of support for suppliers
-     Strong financial position – in a net cash position of R11.8 billion at 31 March 2020 (unaudited) with
      committed facilities of R20.5 billion
-     Cash conservation measures identified – cost and capex savings of over R4.0 billion identified for 2020

down 7% to 440,900 ounces and palladium production down 7% to 303,100 ounces. The impact of the shutdowns
implemented by the Government of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) in response to curbing the outbreak of
COVID-19 led to a loss of 61,000 PGM ounces in the quarter. Eskom load-shedding also impacted production,
largely at Amandelbult, resulting in a loss of 8,300 PGM ounces.


PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines decreased 7% to 560,100 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 6% to 257,500 ounces and palladium production decreased 7% to 204,500 ounces), largely due
to the COVID-19 shutdowns.




                                                                              2
Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 8% to 282,300 ounces (platinum decreased by 7% to 121,900 ounces
and palladium production decreased by 9% to 128,700 ounces), primarily due to maintenance on the North
concentrator mill which impacted tonnes milled, as well as the impact from COVID-19 shutdowns.


Amandelbult PGM production decreased 13% to 167,700 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 13%, to 85,500 ounces and 39,100 ounces respectively), due to Eskom load shedding power
outages in January and February, as well as the COVID-19 shutdowns.


Mototolo PGM production increased by 6% to 61,200 ounces (platinum production increased by 5% to 28,300
ounces and palladium increased by 5% to 17,200 ounces), due to higher throughput and grade, despite the
impact of COVID-19 shutdowns.


Unki PGM production increased 13% to 49,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 13% to 21,800 ounces
and palladium production increased by 15% to 19,600 ounces), due to improved concentrator throughput and
recovery supported by mining volume increases.


PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, decreased by 10% to 188,800 ounces (platinum production decreased by 11% to
83,800 ounces and palladium production decreased by 9% to 56,800 ounces). This was largely due to the impact
of COVID-19 shutdowns.


In addition, due to the temporary closure of the ACP resulting in the declaration of force majeure to purchase of
concentrate suppliers, it was agreed that 50% of the concentrate produced by Kroondal (a pool and share
agreement) will be sold to, and processed by Sibanye-Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period. As
a result, Sibanye-Stillwater purchased and will market and sell material, equivalent to 12,000 PGM ounces in Q1.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, decreased by 5% to 205,900 ounces (platinum POC
decreased by 3% to 99,600 ounces and palladium POC decreased by 6% to 41,800 ounces), due to the impact
of COVID-19 shutdowns, and the agreement that purchase of concentrate from Platinum Mile would be made by
Sibanye-Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period.


Refined PGM production

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, decreased by 22% to 612,200 ounces
(refined platinum production decreased 34% to 240,300 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by
26% to 197,100 ounces). Refined production was largely impacted by the temporary closure of the ACP on 6
March 2020, to repair the Phase B unit, which led to a temporary increase in work-in-progress inventory.


ACP Repair




                                                        3
The ACP was temporarily closed on 6 March 2020 to secure a safe operating environment. Repairs started on
Phase B unit, with most of the replacement equipment (i.e. waffle coolers) obtained from the undamaged waffle
coolers in the Phase A unit or spares available in inventory. All procurement of additional equipment was from
within South Africa, so no supply chain disruptions have been experienced.


The original estimated time for repairs was 80 days, with a completion date of around 25 May 2020. The ACP
Phase B repairs were able to continue during the lockdown period in South Africa and are progressing well and
on schedule. Repairs will be followed by significant testing to ensure stability and a safe operating environment
before re-commissioning of the ACP.


PGM sales volumes

PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, decreased 13% to 681,300
ounces, with platinum sales volumes down 33% to 239,900 ounces and palladium sales volumes down 14% to
222,500 ounces due to the decrease in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined palladium
inventory.




UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO COVID-19


Overview

On 23 March 2020 President Cyril Ramaphosa of the Republic of South Africa declared a national lockdown for
21 days effective from midnight of 26 March 2020. On 9 April 2020, Pres. Ramaphosa extended the lockdown
period in South Africa for an additional two-weeks, ending at midnight on 30 April 2020.


On the 28 March 2020, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe declared a national lockdown for 21 days
effective from midnight of the 30 March 2020 until midnight of the 19 April 2020. On 19 April 2020, Pres.
Mnangagwa extended the lockdown for an additional two weeks, ending on 3 May 2020.


Anglo American Platinum’s priority remains ensuring the safety and health of our employees and surrounding
communities. The Company completed safe shutdown, placing all assets on care and maintenance, which was
successfully completed without any incidents by midnight on Thursday 26th March, except for Mogalakwena
surface material which was treated through the concentrators on a scaled back basis. Operations which were
classified as essential mining operations were safely re-started in April at limited operating capacity, in line with
government guidelines.


Supporting employees, communities and small businesses

Anglo American Platinum is thankful to be in a position where all employees are paid their full fixed pay, pension
and medical benefits, as well as housing allowances where applicable, for the full duration of the extended
lockdown period. This includes all employees who have not been able to work as a result of the lockdown period.




                                                         4
The Board and Executive Committee of Anglo American Platinum notes and fully supports the call by President
Cyril Ramaphosa to contribute to supporting the national fight against the spread of COVID-19. The non-
executive directors have elected to contribute 30% of their fees for three months to charitable organisations that
are aiding the pandemic relief effort. The CEO and Finance Director will also donate 30% of their salaries for
three months to charities associated with Anglo American Platinum’s relief efforts in its host communities. The
Executive team have elected to contribute to the employee matching scheme supported by the Anglo American
Foundation, and many employees have been forthcoming in making contributions to charities of their choice.


During the lockdown period, essential services relating to care and maintenance needed to be carried out,
including pumping, critical maintenance, supervision, engineering, medical services, ventilation, transport and
security has been resourced with critical services employees. The necessary permits and delegations of authority
were all completed and issued to allow passage to the operations. There have been no material issues since the
lockdown commenced and attendance of essential services employees remains high and they are receiving an
extra allowance during the lockdown period in recognition of their commitment.


The medical and occupational health response to the pandemic continues. Essential services workers are
receiving the necessary medical screening, health information, being socially distanced and provided with the
required personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent infection. To date no COVID-19 cases have been
reported.


The Company continues to provide a wide range of essential services in its host communities in South Africa and
Zimbabwe, to provide additional support to help alleviate the health and economic effects of COVID-19. In
partnership with Gift of the Givers, the University of Pretoria and other stakeholders, the Company is expanding
water supply to communities that do not have access to water; supporting local clinics and hospitals with training,
PPE and other equipment to assist them to respond effectively to the pandemic; undertaking awareness
campaigns; and delivering food parcels to vulnerable families.


Anglo American Platinum has developed a supplier response plan which delivers a range of support including
reviewing payment terms, committing as far as possible to early settlement of invoices for small businesses and
assisting in directing small business owners for help from Government and other NGO assistance programs.


Limited production during the lockdown period


During the lockdown period, limited production at select operations was able to commence, but only after
extensive engagement with Unions and employees was conducted, to ensure that all aspects of health and safety
risks were considered. During March, limited surface operations commenced at the Mogalakwena North
Concentrator. This was later extended to limited mining operations at Mogalakwena and the re-heating and start-
up of the Polokwane smelter in April 2020, and in Zimbabwe, Unki mine was able to recommence limited
operations.

                                                        5
   At Mogalakwena mine, surface processing operations were allowed to continue during the shutdown in South
   Africa and surface ore stockpiles were fed to the North concentrator. With the successful start-up of North
   concentrator, South concentrator went through a safe start-up on 2 April at 75% capacity. Based on its status
   as an essential mining operation, limited mining operations started on 8 April which continued for the duration
   of the lockdown period.




2. Unki complex

    Unki operations were placed on care and maintenance when the lockdown period commenced in Zimbabwe
    on 30 March. Approval was granted by the Government of Zimbabwe for the operations to resume with a
    requirement to comply with the strict measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The mining operations
    reopened on 7 April following implementation of these measures, with the Concentrator scheduled to start
    at the beginning of May whilst the Smelter remains on care and maintenance.


3. Polokwane smelter

    Polokwane smelter was placed on care and maintenance when the lockdown period commenced. A safe
    start-up plan, integrating social distancing and safe procedures was established and Polokwane smelter
    was ramped-up on 14 April 2020. Polokwane smelter is running at full capacity to smelt the material from
    Mogalakwena mine.


4. Other operations

   Our own operations that did not operate or start-up during the lockdown period include:
        -     Amandelbult mine
        -     Mototolo mine
        -     Joint venture operation – Modikwa mine
        -     Joint venture operation – Kroondal mine
        -     Mortimer smelter
        -     Waterval smelter
        -     ACP (although repairs continue) and the magnetic concentrator plant (MCP)
        -     Base metal and precious metal refineries

    Some third-party purchase of concentrate production was started at a limited capacity during the lockdown
    period.


M&C Production impact from the lockdown period


The PGM production impact for Q1 2020 from the COVID-19 related shutdowns amounted to 61,000 PGM
ounces. The Company estimates that the full impact of the shutdown in South Africa and Zimbabwe to the end
of the extended lockdown period to 30 April 2020 will be approximately 331,000 PGM ounces.

Unaudited financial position and committed facilities


At the end of the 2019 reporting period (31 December 2019), Anglo American Platinum was in a net cash position
of R17.3 billion, including the customer prepayment of R9.4 billion. On 9 March 2020, the Company paid the year
end base dividend and special dividend totalling R11.1 billion.


As at 31 March 2020 the Company remains in a net cash position of R11.8 billion (unaudited), including the
customer prepayment and early settlement of the deferred consideration for the sale of the Company’s 33%
share of the Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine to Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited. Anglo American Platinum
also has R20.5 billion of committed facilities available.


Despite the strong financial position, the Company is undertaking a cash conservation programme, with
measures amounting to annual cost and capex savings for 2020 of over R4.0 billion including:
-     Cost cutting measures implemented to eliminate all non-essential costs
-     Non-essential capital expenditure delays
-     For employees not at work, the reduction in payment of overtime and production bonuses resulting in labour
      cost reductions



Capital expenditure savings


In line with cash conservation measures, the Company has been able to look at the deferral of non-essential
capital for 2020. The approach pursued was to deliver capex reductions that supported the updated production
profile whilst ensuring the long-term asset integrity and maximising immediate reduction in planned spend.



                                                            7
Further reductions arose from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns on project equipment
delivery schedules and the lead time to project site start up with the implementation of social distancing and
hygiene protocols for construction.


The SIB reductions largely relate to non-production support equipment replacement, general infrastructure
upgrades, non-plant asset replacement and deferment of rebuilds, which will not impact the integrity of the assets
or business continuity. These are partially offset by the additional SIB capital required to repair Phase B and
Phase A units of the ACP, which amount to R200m and R500m respectively in 2020. This guidance does not
include any potential insurance proceeds receivable. Project capital has also been reduced largely by delaying
the start of certain breakthrough and digitalisation projects which can be deferred without adverse impact on the
business.

Full-year guidance


Referencing the SENS announcement made on 19 March 2020, with regards to the update on the impact of the
temporary closure of the ACP, the Company provided updated M&C production and refined production guidance.


As a result of the precautions and shutdown in South Africa and Zimbabwe to curb the spread of COVID-19, the
production outlook is difficult to quantify. There are several variables that could impact production including:
-      The ability to complete safe start-up at our own managed mines, joint ventures operations and third parties
       we purchase concentrate from
-      Ongoing social distance and de-densification measures to keep employees safe from COVID-19 and the
       potential impact this has on production
-      Further Government policy leading to shutdowns or extensions thereof that could impact production
-      Possibility of infections at operations, despite significant efforts to implement safety and hygiene measures
-      Ensuring all stakeholders agree with the approach to establish safe working practices

Considering this, we have revised our FY2020 M&C production and refined production guidance on our best
estimates of the outlook for the year, cautioning that production guidance will remain fluid, and further downside
risk is possible.

At our new revised M&C production level, all material should be refined in 2020.

Anglo American Platinum updates response to South Africa’s COVID-19 measures

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the SENS announcement released on 24 March 2020,
which notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 23 March in relation
to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, to take effect at midnight on Thursday 26 March, in order to help curb
the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.

Anglo American Platinum remains unconditional about safety and the health and wellbeing of employees
and contractors remains our core priority. The Company has started the controlled ramp down of its
underground mining operations at Amandelbult, the Modikwa JV and the Kroondal JV, as well as the
Mortimer smelter and Waterval smelter (which receives concentrate from those operations), in order to
place them safely into care and maintenance for the period of the lockdown.

In line with South African government regulations, Anglo American Platinum has assessed the ability to
continue some operations on a reduced basis. Subject to further planning, mining operations at the open-
pit Mogalakwena mine, and at the mechanised Mototolo mine may continue on a reduced basis.
Polokwane smelter will also operate to smelt this material into furnace matte. Following a thorough risk
assessment to determine the safety of employees and contractors on site, additional safety, health and
hygiene provisions have been put in place to protect the wellness of employees that will continue to work
during the temporary shut-down period.

Critical care and maintenance work will continue at all operations and will include the ongoing repair of
the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit, to ensure the integrity of the assets, and prepare for a
safe operational ramp-up. All required parts and equipment for the Phase B repair are on site and the
estimated time for repair work remains 80 days, ending around 25 May 2020.

A number of specified essential services will also continue, including security; mine maintenance; tailings
facility safety management; water treatment; community water supply; accommodation provision; health,
safety and emergency response; and critical head office services.

Anglo American Platinum remains aware of the significant impact of the shutdown on its employees and
has reached agreement to pay all employees basic salaries, housing allowance and continue with
Company contributions to medical and pension funds throughout the 21-day lockdown period. In addition,
the Company acknowledges the vital role our operations play in the local communities in which they
operate, and we remain committed to providing services including the supply of potable water, healthcare,
emergency response assistance and maintenance of civil infrastructure throughout the lockdown period.
We will continue to see how we can further support our communities at this difficult time.

Anglo American Platinum has a clear responsibility to protect the integrity of our business and operations
and will ensure a controlled and measured shutdown of the operations going into care and maintenance.
It is critical that we are prepared for a safe start up once the lockdown restrictions are eased and return
operations to normal levels as swiftly as possible to support economic recovery in South Africa.

Anglo American Platinum update on the temporary shutdown of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
and impact of force majeure

Anglo American Platinum issued a SENS announcement on 6 March 2020 regarding the temporary
closure of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) and the declaration of force majeure to secure a safe
operating environment. Anglo American Platinum has since started the repair process and has been in
discussions with third parties from which it purchases concentrate and for which it toll-treats 4E material
and agreed in principle revised terms for the duration of the force majeure period. Anglo American
Platinum does not foresee any customer agreements being terminated as a result of this disruption.

The force majeure period is defined as starting on 6 March 2020 and remains ongoing for the time it takes
to repair ACP Phase B which is expected to be approximately 80 days, ending around 25 May 2020.

ACP repair process and capital expenditure update

The total repair time, including the time to procure all necessary spares and equipment, is estimated at
80 days. The repair team is on site executing the work, and a full investigation is under way to understand
the cause and nature of the water ingress into the furnace. The majority of the replacement equipment
(i.e. waffle coolers) can either be obtained from the undamaged waffle coolers in the Phase A unit or
spares available in inventory. All procurement of additional equipment is from within South Africa, so no
supply chain disruptions are anticipated.

A project team is also in place to execute the repairs to Phase A, and orders for the long lead items have
been placed. It is still estimated that repairs will be complete by Q2 2021.

The estimated capital expenditure for replacement equipment and repair of ACP Phase B is R150 to
R200 million, which will be incurred in 2020, while the estimated capital expenditure to rebuild Phase A
will be R500 to R600 million, of which R100 million is expected to be incurred in 2021. These are
incremental capital expenditure amounts to full year guidance previously provided but exclude any
potential insurance proceeds.

As a result of the activities under way at the ACP, the Company is reviewing its capital plans for 2020
and will provide a further update of the full year capex guidance in due course.

Force majeure agreement with Sibanye-Stillwater

Anglo American Platinum has agreed in principle revised processing agreements with Sibanye-Stillwater
at the different operations including:

1. Toll-treatment of 4E material from Rustenburg:

    PGM concentrate from Rustenburg that is processed at Anglo American Platinum’s processing
    facilities will continue to be smelted by Anglo American Platinum and will continue to receive a
    smelting fee. For the period of the force majeure, smelter matte will be returned to Sibanye-Stillwater
    for further treatment and refining.

2. Kroondal pool and share agreement (PSA classified as 50% purchase of concentrate and 50% JV
   mined production)

    The Kroondal joint venture operations operate under a PSA agreement, whereby Anglo American
    Platinum purchases 100% of the concentrate, with 50% accounted as own-mine production and 50%
    as purchase of concentrate from the Kroondal PSA.

    50% of the concentrate produced by the Kroondal PSA will be sold to and processed by Sibanye-
    Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period under the same terms as the pre-existing
    purchase of concentrate terms with Anglo American Platinum. Sibanye-Stillwater will market and sell
    the material.

    The remaining 50% of concentrate produced will continue to be purchased by Anglo American
    Platinum and smelted at one of the Company’s smelter complexes. Together with Sibanye-Stillwater,
    we have established revised payment terms which allow for delays in payment during the force
    majeure period.

3. Platinum Mile (classified as third party purchase of concentrate)

    Platinum Mile concentrate will be sold to and processed by Sibanye-Stillwater, who will take
    ownership of the material for the duration of the force majeure period under the same terms as the
    pre-existing purchase of concentrate agreement with Anglo American Platinum. Sibanye-Stillwater
    will market and sell the material. In 2019, Platinum Mile produced 23,600 PGM ounces.

These revised terms will only be applicable during the force majeure period, which is the period it takes
to repair ACP Phase B.

Force majeure to purchase of concentrate suppliers

Anglo American Platinum purchases concentrate from Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (“RBPlats”), the
independently managed Modikwa joint-venture (“Modikwa JV”), Siyanda Resources (“Siyanda”) and
small volumes from other third parties. The Company can confirm that it has engaged with all parties and
agreed in principle temporarily revised terms which will allow concentrate to continue to be delivered to
the Company’s smelters during the force majeure period. Anglo American Platinum will continue to smelt
concentrate received at all its four smelter complexes. Together with our partners RBPlats, the Modikwa
JV and Siyanda, we have established temporarily revised payment terms which allow for delays in
payment during the force majeure period.

Force majeure to customers

Anglo American Platinum continues to work with its customers, within the provisions of the force majeure
clauses in their agreements, to minimise the impacts of the disruption. The force majeure protections are
such that the Company does not foresee any agreements being terminated as a result of this disruption,
including the customer prepayment which remains in place.

 (5E + gold)



As a result of the changes in the agreements with third parties, in particular the sale of concentrate from
Platinum Mile and 50% of the Kroondal PSA to Sibanye-Stillwater, and not due to production reductions,
we revise our production guidance (metal in concentrate basis) to be at the lower end of previously
provided guidance of between 4.2 - 4.6 million PGM ounces, and we maintain our revised refined
production of 3.3 - 3.8 million PGM ounces.

Unit cost of production guidance remains between R10,600 - R11,000 per PGM ounce.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum’s PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company’s smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum announces temporary shutdown of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
and declares force majeure

Anglo American Platinum announces the temporary shutdown of the entire Anglo Converter Plant (ACP),
part of the chain of processing facilities, and the need to declare force majeure.

The Company's ACP phase A converter plant, at Waterval smelter in Rustenburg, was damaged following
an explosion within the converter on 10 February 2020. Nobody was injured in the incident and work has
started to repair phase A, which is expected to be completed by Q2 2021.

As per normal business procedure, the phase B unit was commissioned to take over from the phase A
plant and was in the process of ramping up to steady state, when water was detected in the furnace.
Notwithstanding extensive testing being conducted to determine the source of the water, and a number
of circuits being isolated, water continued to be observed in the furnace. This poses a high risk of
explosion and the Company has determined that it has no other option but to temporarily shut down the
phase B unit, to ensure the safety of all employees, and avoid a catastrophic event. It is anticipated that
the repair works to fix the phase B unit will take approximately 80 days.

As a result of the temporary closure of the entire ACP, Anglo American Platinum has had to declare force
majeure to customers, suppliers of third-party purchase of concentrate and suppliers of tolling material,
as we are unable to complete the processing of material during the converter repair. Production from own
mines will continue, and the concentrate from the mines will continue to be smelted at one of the four
smelter complexes. However, production from own mines, as well as third party material will not be able
to be converted to refined production while the ACP is undergoing repairs.

Initial estimates of the impact on AAP refined production are shown in the guidance below:

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum's PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company's smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum announces appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO

The Board of Anglo American Platinum Limited (""Anglo American Platinum"") announces the
appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO, with effect from 16 April 2020, following Chris Griffith's
decision to step down after more than seven years to pursue other career opportunities.

Norman Mbazima, Chairman of Anglo American Platinum, said: ""I am delighted to welcome
Natascha Viljoen as CEO of Anglo American Platinum. Natascha is a seasoned senior executive,
bringing 28 years of operational experience from across our mining industry, spanning many
different countries, metals and minerals including, of course, the PGMs. She knows us and our
business well, having worked with our executive team over the last five years in leading the
changes required to transform the performance of - and commercial value from - our processing
operations.""

Ms Viljoen is currently Group Head of Processing for Anglo American, a role she has held since
2014. In that role, she has led a trusted global team that has unlocked value across Anglo
American's processing operations safely and with a long term perspective, recognising their
critical commercial place in the mining value chain.

Prior to joining Anglo American, Natascha was Executive Vice President of Processing at Lonmin
while also leading the company's sustainability, employee health, environmental and stakeholder
relations work at various times. Natascha began her career as an engineer at Iscor and, amongst
other roles, took on leadership positions at AngloGold and was General Manager of BHP's
Klipspruit Colliery before joining Lonmin in 2008.

Under Natascha's leadership, her team has successfully leveraged and accelerated technology
development and deployment to unlock the full potential of mineral endowments through
processing, delivering significant financial value and competitive advantage. She and her team
are recognised for their work in developing Coarse Particle Recovery technology which enables
the separation of metals from rock using a fraction of the energy and water of traditional methods,
while increasing throughput and productivity.

Natascha Viljoen said: ""I feel really excited to take on my new role at Anglo American Platinum
and I am fortunate to inherit a business in such a strong position. Chris Griffith has reshaped our
PGMs portfolio to be fit for the future and I believe we now have an opportunity to re-imagine how
we operate - in our mines and our host communities. It is also our responsibility to build upon
the wide variety of applications for our platinum group metals that already play a critical role in
so many areas of modern life, from clean transport and energy, to health and jewellery, of course.

""Safety is paramount, always, while building a purpose-led high performance culture with
stakeholders front of mind is critical to the future of our business. We will work to ensure that
what we do and the benefits we bring for all our stakeholders are sustainable in every sense.""
Natascha Viljoen will join Anglo American Platinum on 1 April 2020 and the Group Management
Committee of Anglo American plc on 16 April 2020.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented:
“For the first time in Anglo American Platinum’s history, we have had no
workplace fatalities at our managed operations in the year. The Company also
demonstrated leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance
in 2019. Anglo American Platinum has delivered another strong set of
operational and financial results. Overall, PGM production was up 1%, with
record production once again achieved at Mogalakwena and Unki mines. EBITDA
doubled to R30.0 billion and ROCE increased to 58%. Net cash is at R17.3
billion, an improvement of R14.4 billion from end 2018. As a result of the
strong cash generation, a final dividend for H2 2019 of R11.2 billion or
R41.60/share was declared, made up of R16.60 base dividend and R25.00 special
dividend. This brings the aggregate 2019 dividend to R14.2 billion or
R52.60/share. We continue to progress the next phase of our strategy,
focusing on optimising value at our operations through world-best operating
practices, modernisation and by investing in breakthrough projects to reach
new benchmark (known as P101) levels of productivity and the implementation
of FutureSmart MiningTM technologies, digitalisation and sustainability. We
continue to assess the project studies for expansion at Mogalakwena and
Mototolo/Der Brochen as well as investing in market development to stimulate
incremental demand for our platinum group metals.”

EARLY SETTLEMENT OF DEFERRED CONSIDERATION FOR 33% INTEREST IN BRPM JV BY
ROYAL BAFOKENG PLATINUM

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the SENS announcement of the completion of the
disposal of its 33% interest in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine joint venture (""BRPM JV"") on 12
December 2018, (the ""Transaction"").

The total purchase consideration at the time of announcement was R2.178 billion, (the total consideration
of R1.863 billion plus the repayment of the Company's contributions into the BRPM JV until completion of
the Transaction). The upfront purchase consideration was settled by a cash payment by Royal Bafokeng
Resources Proprietary Limited (""RBR"") of R555 million (approximately US$40 million).

The remaining deferred consideration, including accumulated interest, of R1.851 billion (c.$125 million)
has been settled in full by RBR on 30 January 2020.

All existing commercial arrangements remain in place notwithstanding the settlement of the deferred
consideration. The Company retains its right to purchase 50% of the BRPM JV's concentrate for the life
of mine and RBR retains the right to sell its 50% of the concentrate to Anglo American Platinum.

Shareholders are also referred to the Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited announcement relating to the
settlement of the deferred consideration dated 3 February 2020.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"")
on the Stock Exchange News Service on 17 February 2020.

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period
are likely to increase by between 131% and 151% respectively compared to the prior year. Headline
earnings are likely to be between R17.545 billion and R19.055 billion (R7.588 billion in 2018) and HEPS
will increase to between 6,689 cents and 7,265 cents per share (2,893 cents in 2018).

Basic earnings and earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period are likely to increase by between 157% and
177% respectively compared to the prior year. Basic earnings are likely to be between R17.545 billion and
R18.900 billion (R6.817 billion in 2018) and EPS is expected to be between 6,689 cents and 7,205 cents
per share (2,599 cents 2018).

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily driven by a 38% increase in
the rand basket price and continued steady operational performance, notwithstanding the loss in
production (38,000 PGM ounces) and deferred refined production (89,000 PGM ounces to be refined in
2020) due to Eskom power outages.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has been reviewed, but not yet reported
on, by the Company's external auditors.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2019


OVERVIEW

- Commitment to elimination of fatalities - no fatalities occurred in Q4 2019, resulting in a fatal free year at
   managed operations

- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) increased 9% against prior year (Q4
   2018) to 1,152,700 ounces, (excluding Sibanye-Stillwater 4E material), despite the impact of Eskom power
   outages, which led to a loss of c.20,000 PGM ounces

- Own managed mines PGM production increased by 21% to 675,200 ounces due to increased production
   from all own managed mines

- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate, excluding Mototolo) decreased by 11%
   to 231,200 ounces due to the impact of power outages, safety stoppages and low equipment availability

- Refined PGM production including tolling decreased by 2% to 1,492,100 ounces as improved processing
   operational performance was offset by the impact of Eskom power outages and the associated Rustenburg
   Processing facilities power failure in December. This led to a build-up of c.89,000 PGM ounces in work-in-
   progress inventory which be will refined in 2020

- PGM sales volumes excluding tolling were up 11% to 1,414,100 ounces as refined production increased
   and a drawdown in refined inventory supplemented sales

    Total M
    -        Include Mototolo production as own mined production on a 100% basis;
    -        Include Union production as purchase of concentrate from third parties; and
    -        Include Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) production as purchase of concentrate from third
             parties.

Total PGM production of 1,152,700 ounces increased 9%, with platinum production up 10% to 531,700 ounces
and palladium production up 10% to 360,400 ounces. Eskom power outages led to a loss of production in the
quarter of c.20,000 ounces across all operations in Q4 2019.

PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 21% to 675,200 ounces (platinum production
increased by 22% to 310,000 ounces and palladium production increased 20% to 241,000 ounces), due to higher
production from all operations, despite the impact of Eskom power outages leading to a loss of 16,800 PGM
ounces of production.


Mogalakwena PGM production increased 24% to 317,500 ounces (platinum increased by 25% to 135,800 ounces
and palladium production increased by 23% to 146,000 ounces), due to an increase in built-up head grade. High
grade ore stockpiles were drawn down to supplement mined production as low equipment availability, due to
maintenance on the rope shovel, impacted production.


Amandelbult PGM production increased 25% to 238,700 ounces (platinum production increased by 24% to
120,100 ounces and palladium increased by 25% to 56,000 ounces), as the benefit from increased development
at Dishaba lower mine has allowed increased productivity and production.


Unki PGM production increased 5% to 52,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 6% to 23,300 ounces
and palladium production increased by 2% to 20,000 ounces), due to improved concentrator throughput and mill
run-time, partially offset by lower grade.


On a 100% basis, Mototolo PGM production increased by 9% to 66,900 ounces (platinum production increased
by 10% to 30,900 ounces and palladium by 8% to 19,000 ounces), due to higher mining rates and throughput
efficiency improvement at the concentrator.

PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, excluding Mototolo, decreased by 11% to 231,200 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 10% to 103,600 ounces and palladium production decreased by 11% to 68,000 ounces), including
losses from Eskom power outages of 3,200 PGM ounces. PGM production at Kroondal was down 8% due to the
power outages and PGM production at Modikwa decreased by 16% due to low equipment availability and section
54 safety stoppages.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties, excluding 4E tolled material, increased by 1% to 246,300 ounces
due to higher volume from Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) and Siyanda Resources (Union).

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, increased by 2% to 1,308,800 ounces
(refined platinum production was flat at 624,900 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 6% to
394,400 ounces), despite the impact of Eskom power outages, as well as the associated Rustenburg Processing
facilities power outage event in December 2019.
PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, were up 11% to 1,414,100
ounces, with platinum sales volumes up 5% to 662,000 ounces and palladium sales volumes up 11% to 432,700
ounces due to an increase in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory.

Eskom power outages impact on 2019 production

In the first half of the year, own-managed mines lost production due to power outages that required the mines to
shut down, resulting in a loss of 18,000 PGM ounces. In the second half of the year (Q4 2019), own-managed
mines lost 16,800 PGM ounces, and joint ventures lost 3,200 PGM ounces. This resulted in a loss of production
(which cannot be recovered) of 38,000 PGM ounces for 2019.


Power outages resulted in an impact to refined production of 74,700 PGM ounces in Q1 2019, and a further
70,200 PGM ounces in Q4 2019. A load-shedding related event, resulting in a total power outage at the
Rustenburg Processing facilities in December 2019, led to a further impact on refined production of 71,100 PGM
ounces, resulting in a total impact on refined production of 216,000 PGM ounces for the year. The strong
operational performance of the processing assets led to 127,000 PGM ounces being caught up in 2019, with
89,000 PGM ounces built up in work-in-progress inventory which will be refined in 2020.

Anglo American Platinum updates guidance in line with the Anglo American plc Investor Update

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the Anglo American plc briefing for investors and
analysts which includes updated production guidance for the financial years to 2022:


Platinum production (M&C):
2019F: In line with guidance of 2.0 – 2.1 Moz
2020F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (unchanged)
2021F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (unchanged)
2022F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (new guidance)


Palladium production (M&C):
2019F: In line with guidance of 1.3 – 1.4 Moz
2020F: c. 1.4 Moz (previously 1.3 – 1.4 Moz)
2021F: c. 1.4 Moz (previously 1.3 – 1.4 Moz)
2022F: 1.4 -1.5 Moz (new guidance)

Anglo American Platinum’s unit cost guidance for 2019 of between R21,000 to R22,000 per platinum
ounce produced (M&C) will likely exceed the upper end of guidance to between R22,000 and R22,300
per platinum ounce produced (M&C), which could be further impacted by current power outages as
Eskom implements load shedding.

The presentation will start at 12:00 UK time / 14:00 SA time today (10 December 2019) and is available
on the Anglo American plc website at https://www.angloamerican.com/investors/investor-
presentations/2019.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current
beliefs and expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this

OVERVIEW
- Commitment to elimination of fatalities - no fatalities occurred in Q3 2019
- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) in line with prior year at 1,141,200
  ounces, (excluding Sibanye-Stillwater material)
- Own managed mines PGM production increased by 1% to 642,500 ounces due to increased production
  from Mogalakwena and Unki
- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate, excluding Mototolo) increased by 1%
  to 248,200 ounces due to higher volume from Kroondal, despite a weak performance from Modikwa
- Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties (excluding 4E toll treated material) decreased by 5% to
  250,500 ounces due to lower volumes received from BRPM and Siyanda
- Refined PGM production including tolling increased by 26% to 1,360,700 ounces due to improved
  processing operational performance
- PGM sales volumes excluding tolling were marginally down 2% to 1,022,900 ounces due to lower minor
  metal sales
- 2019 production guidance (metal in concentrate) remains unchanged at 4.2 - 4.5 million PGM ounces

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities and reports zero fatalities in the
period. Managed operations continue to be fatal free for the year-to-date. The Total Recordable Case Frequency
Rate (""TRCFR"") per million hours at managed operations for the quarter improved 14% to 2.52 compared to
2.93 in the prior period.


PGM PRODUCTION

Production has been adjusted in the comparative periods to enable fair comparison between each period as
follows:
     -     exclude Sibanye-Stillwater 4E ounces from purchase of concentrate (POC) from third parties
     -     include Mototolo production as own mined production on a 100% basis
     -     include Union production as purchase of concentrate from third parties
     -     include Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) production as purchase of concentrate from third
           parties

Total PGM production of 1,141,200 ounces was in line with prior year, with platinum production down 1% to
526,800 ounces and palladium production flat at 351,800 ounces.


PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 1% to 642,500 ounces (platinum production
increased by 1% to 296,800 ounces and palladium production increased 1% to 225,900 ounces), due to higher
production from Mogalakwena and Unki, partly offset by decreased production from Amandelbult and Mototolo.

Mogalakwena PGM production increased 6% to 287,700 ounces (platinum increased by 8% to 123,400 ounces
and palladium production increased by 3% to 130,800 ounces), due to an increase in throughput and a 14%
increase in built-up head grade.

Amandelbult PGM production decreased 5% to 232,900 ounces (platinum production decreased by 6% to
118,400 ounces and palladium decreased by 5% to 54,300 ounces), mainly due to maintenance at the
concentrator.

Unki PGM production increased 7% to 53,800 ounces (platinum production increased by 5% to 23,600 ounces
and palladium production increased by 9% to 21,400 ounces), due to improved underground mining efficiencies
as well as improved concentrator throughput and mill run-time.

On a 100% basis, Mototolo PGM production decreased by 2% to 68,100 ounces (platinum production decreased
by 2% to 31,400 ounces and palladium by 3% to 19,400 ounces), due to a 6% decline in head-grade due to the
mine transitioning through a difficult ground area containing geological features.
PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, excluding Mototolo, increased by 1% to 248,200 ounces (platinum production
was in line with prior year at 109,800 ounces and palladium production increased by 2% to 73,800 ounces).
PGM production at Kroondal increased by 3% due to increased concentrator throughput, higher mill run-time
and improved recoveries. PGM production at Modikwa decreased by 3% due to low equipment availability.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties decreased by 5% to 250,500 ounces due lower volume from
Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) and Siyanda Resources.

Refined production and sales volumes

Total refined PGM production, including 168,700 4E ounces of toll treated material, increased by 26% to
1,360,700 PGM ounces due to improved processing operational performance.

Refined PGM production, excluding 4E production now tolled, increased by 10% to 1,192,000 ounces (refined
platinum production increased by 4% to 578,500 ounces and refined palladium production increased by 13% to
362,000 ounces). Prior period refined production was impacted by Mortimer smelter ramping up from its full
rebuild and Polokwane smelter undertaking maintenance which required a full shutdown for 35 days.


PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material, were marginally down 2%, with platinum
sales volumes up 21% to 522,200 ounces and palladium sales volumes up 12% to 309,700 ounces. Minor metal
sales were lower in Q3 and year-to-date, as demand normalised from particularly strong sales in 2018, with
demand also impacted by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty due to trade tariff disputes. Total PGM sales
volumes were down by 13% to 1,048,400 ounces due to 168,700 4E ounces returned through toll arrangements
and not sold by Anglo American Platinum.

Sales volumes are lower than refined production in the period, due to maintenance at Waterval smelter (Furnace
2 end wall repair), which delayed the availability of refined production for sale during the quarter.

2019 production guidance maintained

PGM production outlook for 2019 is maintained at between 4.2 - 4.5 million ounces, including platinum production of
between 2.0 - 2.1 million ounces and palladium production guidance of between 1.3 - 1.4 million ounces. As previously
communicated, production guidance is down compared to 2018 due to the transition of material from purchase of
concentrate to a 4E tolling arrangement. The Company is not expecting any significant headwinds in the final quarter,
however if there are any prolonged periods of Eskom load-shedding, full year production guidance could be impacted.

Completion of the acquisition of Kwanda North and Central Block prospecting rights

Shareholders are referred to the Company's interim results announcement on 24 July 2017 announcing
that the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (""RPM""),
had made a conditional offer to acquire the resources specified in the Kwanda North and Central Block
prospecting rights for cash consideration of R300 million from Atlatsa Resources Corporation (""Atlatsa"").
Shareholders are also referred to the Atlatsa announcement released on 12 December 2018, regarding
its agreement with Anglo American Platinum and including the key terms agreed in relation to Atlatsa's
two-phased restructuring plan (""Composite Transaction""), implemented by way of a Canadian court-
approved plan of arrangement under section 288 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia)
(""Arrangement"").

Shareholders are advised that all conditions to effect the Arrangement have now been fulfilled and that,
on 27 August 2019, Anglo American Platinum and Atlatsa completed the acquisition and inclusion of
the resources specified in the Central Block and Kwanda North prospecting rights into RPM's
Mogalakwena mining right. The administrative process of registration with the Mineral and Petroleum
Titles Registration Office will now follow.

The additional components of the Composite Transaction relevant to the Company include, amongst
others:
  • The disposal of the Company's 22.55% shareholding in Atlatsa for a nominal cash consideration;
  • The waiver and/or capitalisation of all of the current debt owing by Atlatsa group to the Company
     totaling approximately R4.8 billion. From an accounting perspective, these loans have already
     been fully impaired;
  • The waiver of further debt to be provided to Atlatsa until 31 December 2019 for care and
     maintenance costs at Bokoni Mine;
  • The waiver of all of the debt owing by Atlatsa Holdings Proprietary Limited, Atlatsa's controlling
     shareholder, to the Company totaling approximately R0.5 billion. From an accounting perspective,
     this loan has also already been fully impaired; and
  • Atlatsa and the Company will retain their 51% and 49% respective shareholdings in the Bokoni
     Mine joint venture.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM – 2019 INTERIM RESULTS SHORT FORM ANNOUNCEMENT

Financial Performance

H1 2019 overview

Anglo American Platinum delivered another strong financial performance in H1 2019, with increased
earnings, returns and operating cash flows, benefitting from strong market fundamentals which saw the
US Dollar platinum basket price increase 16%, and coupled with a weakening rand, led to the ZAR
platinum basket price increasing by 33% year-on-year.

Headline earnings increased by 120% to R7.4 billion primarily because of a higher rand basket price,
and a stock count adjustment gain of R1.0 billion in the period compared to a stock count adjustment
loss of R0.4 billion in the comparative period.

The Company strengthened its balance sheet to end the period with net cash of R6.0 billion from the
R2.9 billion net cash position at 31 December 2018. This reflects a R3.1 billion improvement after paying
a final dividend of R2.0 billion for 2018 in March 2019.

Return on capital employed doubled to 45% due to the strong earnings
Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented:

""Anglo American Platinum has delivered safe, responsible and profitable production in H1 2019. We
are committed to the elimination of fatalities and ensuring safe operations. We have had no fatal
incidents at our own managed operations in H1 2019 and we continue to improve the overall safety
performance of the business with a further reduction in the total recordable case injury frequency rate
to the lowest on record.

Anglo American Platinum continues to deliver PGM industry leading returns and has increased EBITDA
by 82% to R12.4 billion, resulting in an increase in the EBITDA margin to 32%, an increase in Return
on Capital Employed (ROCE) to 45%, and an increase in headline earnings per share, up 120% to
R28.15. The Board has declared an interim dividend based on a pay-out ratio of 40% of headline
earnings of R3.0 billion, or R11.00 per share. This is a very much stronger business today because of
the actions we have taken in recent years and I'm pleased to say that there are further opportunities to
unlock full potential from our operations.

We've seen steady production from our operations, though certain headwinds, including Eskom power
shortages and strike action at Mototolo, have impacted our first half performance but we expect to see
a stronger performance in H2 2019. Mogalakwena production was slightly lower as we mined through
a new cut and focused on waste removal in H1, allowing us greater access to ore tonnes in H2 2019.
The turnaround plan at Amandelbult is progressing with significant improvement on the development of
Dishaba seen in Q2 and the subsequent increase in immediately available ore reserves, with an
expected ramp-up now that the infrastructure upgrades have been completed. Unki continues to deliver,
with another record performance. Mototolo had a tough start to the year, due to the unprotected strike
and difficult ground containing geological faults but is expected to step up performance going into the
second half.

We made progress on refining the work-in-progress (WIP) inventory. However, Eskom power outages,
the Mortimer smelter furnace rebuild in Q1 and a stock count gain in the period has led to a temporary
build-up in WIP inventory which should be largely refined in H2 2019.

The fundamentals of PGM demand remain robust, with the US Dollar platinum basket price increasing
16%, particularly for palladium and rhodium, and coupled with a weakening rand led to a ZAR platinum
basket price increasing by 33%. Despite the temporary increase in WIP, we generated operating free
cash flow of R4.3 billion, increasing net cash to R6.0 billion.

We are focused on the next phase of value delivery and work is under way to realise value at existing
operations. Our aim is to achieve and beat world best operating practices and implementing
FutureSmart™ technology and innovation to enable material efficiency improvements. Market
development continues to progress, with a number of achievements made in H1 2019, including the
announcement of the launch of Lion Battery Technologies Inc. partnership for the accelerated
development of next-generation PGM-containing batteries, and the announcement of the Mirai Creation
Fund II joining Anglo American Platinum, Mitsubishi Corporation & The Public Investment Corporation
as an investor in AP Ventures. Finally, project studies continue to assess how to unlock optimal value
from Mogalakwena and the Mototolo/Der Brochen ground.""

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities and reports zero fatalities in the
period. The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (""TRCFR"") per million hours at managed operations for the
quarter reduced by 9% to 2.63 compared to 2.90 in the prior period.

PGM PRODUCTION

Production has been adjusted in the comparative periods to enable a fair comparison between each period as
follows:
- exclude Sibanye-Stillwater 4E ounces from purchase of concentrate from third parties
- include Mototolo production as own mined production on a 100% basis
- include Union production as purchase of concentrate from third parties
- include Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) production as purchase of concentrate from third parties

Total PGM production increased by 1% to 1,118,700 ounces (platinum production increased by 3% to 520,300
ounces and palladium production decreased by 1% to 347,100 ounces), excluding Sibanye-Stillwater
Rustenburg 4E material which transitioned to a tolling arrangement from 1 January 2019. Despite the increase
in production, the quarter was impacted by unprotected industrial action at Mototolo, maintenance at
Mogalakwena North Concentrator and production challenges at Modikwa and Mototolo.

PGM production from own mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines decreased 4% to 633,600 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 5% to 290,500 ounces and palladium production decreased 4% to 228,100 ounces), due to lower
production from Mogalakwena and Mototolo, partly offset by increased production from Unki and Amandelbult.

Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 4% to 302,500 ounces (platinum and palladium production decreased
by 4% to 127,900 ounces 139,500 ounces respectively), due to low equipment availability, and a decrease in
concentrator throughput and recoveries due to a minor shut down for maintenance on the secondary mill at
North concentrator. In addition, the mine increased its waste tonnes mined in line with the mine plan (started a
new mining cut and push-back) which was partially offset by a drawdown in ore stockpiles.

Amandelbult PGM production increased 1% to 229,000 ounces (platinum production in line with the prior period
at 116,500 ounces while palladium increased by 3% to 53,700 ounces), due to improvement in the Dishaba ore-
reserve build-up as well as increased operational efficiencies. Production performance in Q2 2019 improved
19% over Q1 2019.

Unki achieved a record production performance in the quarter, increasing PGM production 12% to 52,500
ounces (platinum production increased by 11% to 23,100 ounces and palladium production increased by 14%
to 20,900 ounces). The increases were due to improved underground mining efficiencies, improved concentrator
throughput, higher mill run-time and recoveries.

The acquisition of the remaining 50% of Mototolo was concluded on 1 November 2018 from which date 100%
of its production became own mine production.
On a 100% basis, Mototolo PGM production decreased by 32% to 49,600 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 32% to 23,000 ounces and palladium by 33% to 14,000 ounces). The lower production was largely
due to three weeks of unprotected industrial action (c.9,000 PGM ounces) and lower built-up head grade and
volume as the mine transitions through multiple difficult geological features. In addition, the prior period included
once-off PGM ounces that were toll treated at Bokoni.

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, excluding Mototolo, decreased by 4% to 228,200 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 1% to 104,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by 6% to 64,800 ounces).

Modikwa PGM production decreased by 23% due to safety stoppages related to the fatality at the end of Q1
2019 and increased maintenance on the mechanised machinery fleet. In addition, the prior period benefitted
from Mototolo ore purchases which increased Q2 2018 production by c.5,000 PGM ounces. PGM production at
Kroondal increased by 6% due to increased concentrator throughput, higher mill run-time and recoveries.

PGM production from joint ventures is 50% own-mine production and 50% purchase of concentrate.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 22% to 256,900 ounces due increased volume
from BRPM and Siyanda Resources.

Refined production and sales volumes

Own refined PGM production, excluding tolling, increased by 10% to 1,273,400 ounces (refined platinum
production increased by 3% to 591,000 ounces and refined palladium production increased by 17% to 428,400
ounces). The increase was largely driven by improved operational performance and stability across the
processing assets, particularly at the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP), as well as lower refined production in the
prior period which was impacted by the Mortimer smelter rebuild.

Refined PGM production including tolling of 154,400 4E ounces treated in the quarter under tolling arrangements,
increased by 23% to 1,426,900 PGM ounces.

PGM sales volumes of 1,275,100 ounces were in line with refined production, but down by 8% year-on-year due
to 154,400 4E ounces returned through toll arrangements and not sold by Anglo American Platinum. Platinum
sales volumes decreased by 6% to 595,200 ounces and palladium sales volumes increased by 17% to 475,900
ounces due to the change in the concentrate mix processed in each period.

2019 production guidance maintained

PGM production outlook for 2019 is maintained at between 4.2 - 4.5 million ounces, including platinum
production of between 2.0 - 2.1 million ounces and palladium production guidance of between 1.3 – 1.4 million
ounces. As previously communicated, production guidance is down on 2018 due to the transition of Sibanye-
Stillwater Rustenburg mine 4E material to a tolling arrangement.

Updated Trading Statement for the six months ended 30 June 2019

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (""the period"") on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 22 July 2019.

Shareholders are referred to the Company's trading statement released on SENS on 25 June 2019 in
which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the
period were expected to be at least 80% (R2.690 billion or 1,025 cents per share, respectively) higher
than that reported for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (""the comparative period"") and that basic
earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period were also expected to be at least 180%
(R3.922 billion or 1,496 cents per share, respectively) higher than for the comparative period.

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings for the period is likely to increase to between
R7.005 billion and R7.670 billion, (an increase of between 108% and 128% compared to the
comparative period figure of R3.363 billion). HEPS for the period is likely to increase to between 2,671
cents and 2,924 cents per share (an increase of between 108% and 128% compared to the comparative
period figure of 1,282 cents).

Basic earnings for the period is likely to increase to a profit of between R7.055 billion and R7.485 billion
(an increase of between 224% and 244% compared to the comparative period figure of a R2.179 billion).
EPS for the period is likely to increase to between 2,690 cents and 2,854 cents per share (an increase
of between 224% and 243% compared to the comparative period figure of 831 cents).

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is due to a higher ZAR PGM basket
price, and a stock count adjustment gain of R1.0 billion in the period compared to a stock count
adjustment loss of R0.5 billion in the comparative period.

In addition, in the comparative period, basic earnings was impacted by an impairment of R0.6 billion
(post-tax) relating to the disposal of the 33% holding in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine joint
venture (BRPM JV) to Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited and a loss of R0.8 billion (post-tax) on the
finalisation of the disposal of Union Mine and Masa Chrome, while benefiting from an insurance receipt
of R0.2 billion (post-tax) in respect of property damage suffered at the Concentrator Plant (ACP) in
2017. Both basic and headline earnings benefitted from a revaluation gain on the deferred consideration
in respect of the sale of the Rustenburg Mines of R0.3 billion (post tax).

on by the Company's external auditors.

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ending 30 June 2019 (""the period"") on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 22 July 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a
trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to
be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises its shareholders that, primarily due to an increase in the rand PGM
basket price, headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period will be at least
80% (R2,690 million or 1025 cents per share) higher than that reported for the six months ended 30
June 2018 (the ""comparative period""). Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were
R3,363 million and 1282 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") will also be at least 180% (R3,922 million or 1,496
cents per share) higher than the comparative period as a result of a higher PGM basket price and once-
off impairments in 2018. Basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R2,179 million and
831 cents respectively.

A further trading statement will be released as soon as the Company has reasonable certainty on the
expected HEPS and EPS ranges for the period as required by the Listings Requirements.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM - DETAILS ON TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITIES

Anglo American Platinum has today published on its website the details of its nine mineral residue facilities,
comprising six managed tailings storage facilities (""TSF"") and three slag stockpiles. Details of an additional
eight TSFs at non-managed JV operations in which it has an ownership interest are also disclosed. This
disclosure is in response to a request by the Church of England Pensions Board and the Swedish Council
on Ethics for the AP Funds, representing 96 institutional investors.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, stated:
""As part of the global efforts to improve the transparency around tailings storage facilities, we are providing
detailed information on each of our facilities in response to a request from a number of global institutional
investors. We have confidence in the integrity of Anglo American Platinum's managed TSFs which are
subject to the highest global safety and stewardship standards. Anglo American's mandatory Mineral
Residue Facilities and Water Management Structures standard was completely revised and updated in early
2014 and goes beyond regulatory and other industry requirements in all host jurisdictions, including in South
Africa. We have also received assurances from the operators of non-managed joint venture facilities in which
Anglo American Platinum has an interest relating to the safety of TSFs at those operations.""

Anglo American Platinum manages six active TSFs, five of which are located in the Limpopo province of
South Africa and one located in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe. The company also manages three slag
dumps, two located in the Limpopo province of South Africa, and one in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe.
In addition, at the non-managed joint venture operations, there are eight TSFs (two of which are currently on
care and maintenance), which are located in the North West and Limpopo provinces of South Africa.

All of Anglo American Platinum's managed tailings dams have been constructed using the upstream method,
except the Blinkwater dam at Mogalakwena mine in the Limpopo province of South Africa, which uses a
downstream method of construction, and Dam 1 at Unki mine, which uses a hybrid downstream and
upstream method. Upstream tailings dams are generally considered to be an appropriate design for facilities
in dry and seismically stable regions with flat topography, including the locations of Anglo American
Platinum's TSFs in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Anglo American's Group Technical Standard, which applies to all TSFs managed by Anglo American
Platinum, sets minimum requirements for design criteria, monitoring, inspection and surveillance, and was
peer-reviewed by international specialists. In line with that standard, all TSFs managed by Anglo American
Platinum have a Competent Person in charge and have appointed an external Engineer of Record, providing
continuous technical management from initial design and construction, to monitoring and support. A
dedicated team of engineering specialists at Anglo American provides strategic direction and technical
assurance.

Anglo American Platinum and GIWUSA settle unprotected strike at Mototolo Mine

Anglo American Platinum is pleased to report that the unprotected strike that led to the dismissal of 643
employees at Mototolo Mine has been resolved, following ongoing engagements with the General Industrial
Workers Union (GIWUSA) over the past three weeks.

In terms of the collective agreement signed by the parties on Wednesday, 29 May 2019, all dismissed
employees will be reinstated at Mototolo Mine and will report for duty by Friday, 31 May 2019.

In terms of the agreement, the union has accepted that the proposed medical aid meets the requirement of
the Section 197 transfer. While the no work, no pay principle will be applied for the duration of the strike, the
agreement also makes provision for employees to earn back their lost income within the next four months
through working additional shifts and to make up for lost production.

Anglo American Platinum CEO Chris Griffith commented: ""We are pleased that we have been able to reach
a mutually acceptable outcome through negotiations. Our priority is now to safely restore the mine to full
production as quickly as it is practical to do so.""

UNPROTECTED INDUSTRIAL ACTION AT ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM'S MOTOTOLO MINE


The General Industrial Workers Union of South Africa (GIWUSA) served a strike notice on Anglo American
Platinum (AAP) at Mototolo Mine on Thursday 9 May 2019. This followed a dispute declared by GIWUSA at
the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), in which the union alleged that the
changes AAP made regarding employees' medical scheme, following the purchase of the mine from
Glencore in November 2018, represented a unilateral change in employees' conditions of service. This is
despite AAP having offered a medical scheme (Platinum Health) with similar benefits.

On Friday 10 May, Anglo American Platinum was granted an interim court interdict against any strike action
by GIWUSA at Mototolo Mine. Despite this interdict, GIWUSA employees embarked on an unprotected strike
on Sunday 12 May, thereby defying the court order and Anglo American Platinum's communication to
employees to not embark on an unprotected strike. Anglo American Platinum has appealed to GIWUSA to
end the unprotected strike and for striking employees to return to work. These requests have been ignored
and AAP has therefore been left with no option but to dismiss about 50% of Mototolo Mine's underground
workforce.

Dismissed employees have until 21 May to appeal Anglo American Platinum's decision. Anglo American
Platinum is disappointed by the conduct of the union and its members at a time in which socio-economic
pressures continue to detrimentally impact the sector and employment is so scarce.

The impact on production has been minimal. Anglo American Platinum is exploring options to ensure that
Mototolo Mine recommences full production as soon as practically possible.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDING 31 MARCH 2019


OVERVIEW

• Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q1 2019
• Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) decreased 6% to 998,900 ounces,
  (normalising for the transition of Sibanye-Stillwater material to a tolling arrangement), due to the once-off
  benefit of additional ore stockpile which increased production at Mototolo and Unki in Q1 2018, as well as
   Eskom power disruptions and operational challenges across the portfolio in the quarter
• Own managed mines PGM production increased 4% to 601,000 ounces, due to the inclusion of Mototolo
  as own-mine production
• Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased 29% to 210,400 ounces
   due to Mototolo now reported as an own mine
• Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties decreased by 44% to 216,800 ounces largely due to the
  transition of material from Sibanye-Stillwater to a tolling arrangement
• Refined PGM production decreased by 14% to 871,200 ounces following the triennial planned stock take
  at the PMR, maintenance at processing operations, as well as the impact from Eskom power disruptions
• PGM sales volumes were down 21% to 884,900 ounces, largely in line with lower refined production
• 2019 Production guidance (metal in concentrate) remains unchanged at 4.2 – 4.5 million PGM ounces

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities and reports zero fatalities in the
period. The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (""TRCFR"") per million hours at managed operations for the
quarter saw a slight decline from 2.67 to 2.97.

PGM PRODUCTION

Total PGM production decreased 6% to 998,900 ounces (platinum production decreased by 5% to 471,900
ounces and palladium production decreased by 6% to 326,600 ounces), after normalising for the transition of
Sibanye-Stillwater material to a tolling arrangement from 1 January 2019 (which equated to 115,700 platinum
ounces and 58,100 palladium ounces in Q1 2018). Production was also lower in the quarter due to the one-off
benefit of additional ore stockpile which increased production at Mototolo and Unki in Q1 2018, as well as Eskom
power disruptions and operational challenges across the portfolio in the quarter.

PGM production from own mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 4% to 601,000 ounces (platinum production
increased 4% to 275,000 ounces and palladium production was flat at 219,700 ounces), due to the inclusion of
Mototolo production as own-mine production.

Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 6% to 307,200 ounces (platinum and palladium production decreased
by 6% to 130,400 ounces and 141,500 ounces respectively) largely due to Eskom power disruptions, as well as
lower concentrator recoveries, partly offset by an increase in grade.

Amandelbult PGM production decreased 7% to 192,800 ounces (platinum production decreased by 5% to
98,500 ounces and palladium decreased by 11% to 44,900 ounces). The decreases were primarily due to major
hoisting capacity and shaft upgrades which delayed hoisting for two weeks, as well as electrical breakdowns
exacerbated by Eskom power disruptions.

Unki PGM production decreased 5% to 43,300 ounces (platinum production decreased by 6% to 19,300 ounces
and palladium production decreased by 4% to 17,000 ounces) largely due to additional Q1 2018 production
mined from ore stockpiles. Normalising for this impact, production at Unki was flat.

The acquisition of the remaining 50% of Mototolo was concluded on 1 November 2018 from which date 100%
of its production became own mine production. On a 100% basis, Mototolo produced 57,700 ounces PGM
ounces (platinum production was 26,800 ounces and palladium production was 16,300 ounces).

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production decreased by 29% to 210,400 ounces (platinum production decreased by 31%
to 93,800 ounces and palladium production decreased 28% to 62,400 ounces). Modikwa PGM production
decreased by 8% to 72,800 ounces compared to Q1 2018, which included additional production toll treated from
Mototolo mine (7,500 PGM ounces). This was partially offset by improved concentrator recovery at Kroondal.
PGM production from joint ventures is 50% own-mine production and 50% purchase of concentrate.
Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties decreased 44% largely due to the transition of material from
Sibanye-Stillwater to a tolling arrangement from 1 January 2019. This material is currently work-in-progress
inventory and first delivery will be at the end of April 2019, when we will start recognising toll treated ounces.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production decreased by 14% to 871,200 ounces (platinum production decreased by 18% to
411,700 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 8% to 293,600 ounces). Q1 2019 production
was lower following maintenance on Waterval Smelter, the Anglo Convertor Plant (ACP) and the Base Metals
Refinery during the quarter, the annual planned stocktake (including the triennial physical stock take at the
Precious Metals Refinery), as well as the impact from Eskom power disruptions.

There has been a further build up in work-in-progress inventory following the impact of power disruptions, and
this should be refined in full by the end of 2019. However, if power disruptions persist, there could be an impact
to the timing of refining the built-up work-in-progress inventory in full.

PGM sales volumes decreased by 21% to 884,900 ounces (platinum sales volumes decreased by 14% to
414,200 ounces and palladium sales volumes decreased by 11% to 292,100), largely in-line with refined
production.


2019 Outlook

PGM production outlook (excluding tolling material from Sibanye-Stillwater) for 2019 is between 4.2 - 4.5 million
ounces, including platinum production of between 2.0 - 2.1 million ounces and palladium production guidance
of between 1.3 – 1.4 million ounces as guided at the 2018 Annual Results Presentation in February. Production
guidance is down on 2018 due to the transition of Sibanye-Stillwater material to a tolling arrangement in place
of its concentrate previously purchased by Anglo American Platinum.

The Board is pleased to advise that at its meeting held on 14 February 2019, the directors increased
the pay-out ratio dividend policy from 30% to 40% of headline earnings, which is in accordance with the

shareholders through the cycle, whilst retaining a high level of balance sheet strength.

At that meeting, the directors approved the declaration of a final gross cash dividend of 751 cents per
share on the ordinary shares from profits accrued during the six-month period ended 31 December

B. Joint ventures
Unlisted investment: AP Ventures (APV)
On 17 July 2018 AAP announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Anglo Platinum Marketing Limited (APML), had subscribed for interests in two UK-based venture capital funds (the Funds),
with a total aggregate commitment equivalent to USD100 million. AAP's commitment to the Funds is matched by a USD100 million commitment from South Africa's Public Investment Corporation
SOC Limited (PIC). APML and the PIC comprise the Limited Partners (LPs).

APV comprises two funds, APV Fund I and APV Fund II. Fund I is closed to other investors with APML and PIC holding equal ownership interest of 49.5% each and 1% held by General Partners,
who have power and authority over APV. APV is a legally separate entity from the Limited Partners. The two Limited Partners have invested R328 million each into Fund I on 21 September
2018.

APV is independently managed by the General Partners.

The General Partners (GPs) are responsible for the day-to-day investment, disinvestments, financing and distribution decisions.

The GPs are required to hold at all times the 1% of the capital contributed by the LPs. The removal of the GPs require 75% of committed capital by Limited Partners to approve the
decision. This demonstrates that the Limited Partners require unanimous consent to remove the General Partners and therefore the investment in fund I is that of a joint venture and is
equity accounted by APML from 1 October 2018.

APV has a 31 March year end, measures its investments at fair value through profit or loss and therefore unaudited internal valuations as at 30 November 2018 were used for equity
accounting purposes.

The movement for the year in the Group's investment in joint ventures was as follows:

Fair value disclosures
The following is an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. They are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the extent to
which the fair value is observable.

The levels are classified as follows:
Level 1 - fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities
Level 2 - fair value is determined using directly observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs
Level 3 - fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data

There were no transfers between the levels during the year.

Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values
Level 2 fair values for other financial liabilities relate specifically to forward foreign exchange contracts and fixed price commodity contracts.

The valuation of forward foreign exchange contracts is a function of the ZAR:USD exchange rate at balance sheet date and the forward exchange rate that was fixed as per the forward
foreign exchange rate contract. Fixed price commodity contracts are valued with reference to relevant quoted commodity prices at period end.

Level 2 fair values for trade and other payables relate specifically to purchase of concentrate trade creditors which are priced in US dollar. The settlement of these purchase of
concentrate trade creditors takes place on average three to four months after the purchase has taken place. The fair value is a function of the expected ZAR:USD exchange rate and the metal
prices at the time of settlement. The Level 2 fair value of liabilities for the return of metal is determined by multiplying the quantities of metal under open leases by the relevant
commodity prices and ZAR:USD exchange rates.

Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
The Level 3 fair value of other financial assets comprises investment in unlisted companies Ballard Power Systems and Primus Power. These investments are irrevocably designated as at fair
value through other comprehensive income per IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and, the deferred consideration on the disposal of the Rustenburg Mine, Pandora Joint Venture and BRPM which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The fair values are based on unobservable market data, and estimated with reference to recent third-party transactions
in the instruments of the company, or based on the underlying discounted cash flows expected.

The Level 3 fair value of other financial liabilities comprises the components of the deferred consideration on the acquisition of control in Mototolo business, which is classified as
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value is based on the underlying discounted cash flows expected.

17. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Inventory
During the current period, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a physical count of in-process metals. The Group runs a theoretical metal
inventory system based on inputs, the results of previous counts and outputs. Due to the nature of in-process inventories being contained in weirs, pipes and other vessels, physical counts
only take place once per annum, except in the Precious Metal Refinery, where the physical count is usually conducted every three years. The Precious Metals Refinery physical count was
conducted by exception again in 2016 and is due to be performed again in 2019.

This change in estimate had the effect of decreasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements by R485 million (31 December 2017: increase of R942 million). This
results in the recognition of an after tax loss of R349 million (31 December 2017: after-tax gain of R678 million).

Rustenburg deferred consideration
The Group's sale of the Rustenburg Mine was completed on 1 November 2016. The present value of the deferred consideration was recognised as a level 3 financial asset at fair value through
profit or loss. Remeasurements arising from changes in estimates of cash flows as well as the unwinding of the discount are included in interest income and expense. The estimated cash
flows were revised in December 2018 after the finalisation of relevant financial information by the purchaser, Sibanye-Stillwater. This has given rise to a post-tax increase of R729
million (31 December 2017: nil) in the present value of the deferred consideration, and the recognition of a gain in profit or loss which is included in headline earnings.

18. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 January 2018.

IFRS 9
The new classification and measurement, and impairment principles in IFRS 9 were adopted with no material impact. The Group continues to apply the hedge accounting principles in IAS 39
Financial Instruments per paragraph 7.2.21 of IFRS 9. The impact was on classification of investments that were reclassified from amortised cost with a value of R30 million on 1 January
2018, which was disposed of during the year, and from available-for-sale assets to fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) irrevocably designated. Fair value changes on the
investments previously classified as available for sale were not reclassified as they are already in equity, and will never be reclassified to profit or loss but retained earnings. Prior
years were reclassified with no material impact.

IFRS 15
The only impact on adoption of this standard was on classification of prepayment from customers from deferred income liabilities to contract liabilities. Prior years were reclassified
with no material impact.

19. DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS
Union Mine and Masa Chrome
The Group concluded a binding sale agreement for its 85% ownership interest in Union Mine and its 50.1% ownership interest in Masa Chrome Proprietary Limited to Siyanda Resources. The
agreement was signed on 14 February 2017 and most of the critical conditions precedent were met on 1 December 2017. As of this date it was highly probable that the sale would be concluded
within 12 months, such that the criteria for reclassification as held for sale, in terms of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale, were met. An attributable, post-tax impairment loss of
R996 million was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2017. A further attributable post-tax impairment loss of R12 million was recognised in January 2018, presented in scrapping of
assets and partly in the loss on disposal in the statement of comprehensive income.

The sale was effective as of 1 February 2018, at which date R414 million (R573 million proceeds less R159 million cash and cash equivalents disposed) consideration was received. A post-
tax loss on disposal of R0.8 billion was recognised, and is excluded from headline earnings. This brought the total loss, including previously recognised impairments to R1.8 billion.

Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM)
Background
On 4 July 2018 AAP signed a binding agreement to dispose of its 33% interest in the unincorporated Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) joint venture to Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RB
Plat) structured in two phases, which will be completed independently.

Phase 1 is for the sale of AAP's 33% interest in BRPM. Shareholder and lender approvals were obtained and the capital raise by RB Plat was completed on 26 September 2018. Phase 2 is for
the transfer of AAP's 33% interest in the mining rights, and requires section 11 DMR approval.

Salient features
The purchase consideration totals R1.86 billion (excluding cash calls) plus the amount of funding provided by AAP to BRPM from signature to effective date. An upfront payment of R568
million (including, proceeds from the capital raise of R253 million to settle part of purchase consideration and repayment of cash calls made by BRPM on AAP to 11 December 2018 of R315
million) was received by AAP on 11 December 2018, being the effective date for the transaction.

The balance of the R1.86 billion, less the capital raise will be settled on a deferred basis. One-third will be settled after each of 1.5 years, 2.5 years and 3.5 years. The deferred
consideration escalates at RB Plat's borrowing rate plus a premium of 2% (c.12.36%) and will be subordinated in favour of RB Plat's third-party debt.

Each deferred consideration tranche may be settled in cash or RB Plat shares, at the option of RB Plat. If settled in shares, RB Plat will first offer the shares to the RB Plat
shareholders at the 30-day VWAP, then determined, discounted by no more than 5%.

Accounting impact
A post-tax impairment loss of R879 million was recognised based on the transaction price, excluded from headline earnings.
Classification as held-for-sale for BRPM commenced on 1 October 2018 as all conditions precedent were met on 26 September 2018. Thereafter, the investment was recognised at fair value
less costs to sell, which was lower than the equity-accounted value.

The deferred consideration was measured at fair value upfront and takes into account the possibility of a lower receipt in the event RB Plat issues shares, which are taken up by the RB
Plat shareholders at a discount. Remeasurements of the deferred consideration, including the unwind of discount, are subsequently recognised in profit/loss and included headline earnings.
Hydrogenious Technologies GmbH

On 20 September 2018, AAP sold its equity-accounted investment in Hydrogenious to AP Ventures. The difference between the proceeds of R353 million and the equity-accounted carrying amount
of R129 million resulted in a profit on disposal of R224 million which was recognised in profit or loss and excluded from headline earnings.

20. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS
Equity investments in Atlatsa and Bokoni Holdco and associated loans
AAP has a 22.76% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco, which is equity accounted as an associate.

On 21 July 2017 Atlatsa Resources announced the placement of Bokoni Platinum Mine on care and maintenance, which was effected on 1 October 2017. AAP committed to support Bokoni while on
care and maintenance until the end of December 2019. A total of R211 million was advanced during the year ended 31 December 2018, with a further R159 million expected to be advanced for
care and maintenance costs in 2019.

All funding advanced has been impaired to the extent that it comprises a loan to Atlatsa for its 51% share of the funding requirements. The 49% effective shareholder contribution to
Bokoni was capitalised to the investment. Equity-accounted losses were applied thereto.

Bokoni
R101 million (49%) of the care and maintenance funding was capitalised to the investment in Bokoni and equity-accounted losses to the same value were applied against this amount. The
equity-accounted losses impact headline earnings.

Atlatsa
R110 million (51%) of the care and maintenance funding for 2018 was capitalised as a loan to Atlatsa. The full value hereof was impaired leaving a carrying value of R224 million which is
expected to be recovered through the acquisition of the Kwanda North and Central Block prospecting rights for R350 million.

21. UNKI PLATINUM MINE INDIGENISATION PLAN
The Zimbabwean Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act was promulgated in March 2008 and seeks to ensure that at least 51% of the shares of every company is owned by indigenous
Zimbabweans. The Company has sought to secure compliance with this legislation through the implementation of two previous transactions. Both these transactions were not executed to
finality as the government of Zimbabwe has been refining its position on indigenisation.

In his budget speech in December 2017, the Zimbabwean minister of finance, honourable PA Chinamasa, proposed further changes to the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act. The
proposed changes will result in the 51/49 indigenisation requirement being only applicable to diamond and platinum miners, with all other sectors free from the indigenisation requirements.

While generally a positive development for most foreign investors in Zimbabwe, we will continue to engage the Zimbabwean government regarding Unki's indigenisation.

Stakeholders will be kept informed of any material developments in this regard.

22. POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
A final dividend of R2,0 billion (R7.51 per share) for the year ended 31 December 2018 was declared after year end, payable on Monday, 11 March 2019 to shareholders recorded in the
register at the close of business on Friday, 8 March 2019.

23. BUSINESS COMBINATION
AAP has signed a binding SPA to acquire Glencore's 40% in the unincorporated Mototolo Mine joint venture (JV) which will increase its interest to 90%, structured in two phases, which can
be completed independently of one another. AAP held an existing interest of 50% in the JV.

Phase 1 for the acquisition of 40% of the business was subject to competition commission approval, which was granted and therefore, became unconditional on 1 November 2018. Phase 2 for
the transfer of Glencore's Thorncliff mining right requires DMR section 102 approval.

Phase 1 of the transaction was completed on 1 November 2018, acquisition date, from which date AAP obtained control of the Mototolo Mine and was therefore consolidated for two months
ended 31 December 2018. On the acquisition date Kagiso, Glencore's BEE partner in Mototolo mine, sold its 10% interest in Mototolo Mine to AAP thereby granting AAP 100% ownership of the
Mototolo Mine.

Mototolo Mine is engaged in mining operations and was acquired to continue the expansion of the Group's operations in mining.

The consideration is made up of upfront payment of R1,278 million (R267 million for Kagiso and R1,011 million for Glencore's interest) which was paid on 1 November 2018 and the remaining
balance would be paid monthly on a deferred basis over a period of 72 months at equal instalments of R12.6 million. The contingent deferred consideration is remeasured based on the actual
PGM 4E prices realised from the effective date of the transaction to 31 December 2024, with resulting changes recognised in profit or loss and included in headline earnings. The maximum
amount payable is limited to R22 billion, however, this is unlikely to be reached as the PGM 4E prices will have to increase significantly. Refer to note 16 for sensitivity analysis of
financial liabilities. 

Acquisition-related costs to the value of R13 million were incurred, excluded from consideration transferred and recognised as an expense in profit or loss. 

The purchase of concentrate liability, that was payable to Glencore for concentrate delivered to AAP, will not be required to be made and therefore comprise a purchase price adjustment.

1 Property, plant and equipment acquired includes the chrome plant with a fair value of R61 million purchased from Glencore. This is included in the business combination accounting
because it was negotiated as part of the acquisition of the acquiree's business. The chrome plant will continue to be operated by Glencore at its own costs to obtain the chrome concentrate
that was part of an existing chrome supply contract. A new chrome supply agreement was entered into on the same commercial terms until 31 December 2024, at the end of the life of the
mining right related to the chrome business. The fair value of the mining right related to the chrome business has therefore taken into account the fact that the chrome business is not
transferred to AAP.

2 The receivables acquired (which primarily comprised trade receivables) in this transaction with a fair value of R7 million had a gross contractual amounts of R7 million. The best
estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected are Rnil.

The following transaction is recognised separately from the business combination accounting:

AAP and Glencore had an existing chrome supply agreement that continues post the business combination on the same commercial terms to the end of December 2024. This is treated separately
from the business combination accounting because it is not settled as part of the business combination. This transaction is accounted for in terms of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers with revenue recognised and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.

3 The fair value of the existing shareholding in Mototolo JV was based on the existing footprint. This business combination accounting is provisional and may be restated in 2019 when it
is finalised as AAP finalises its valuation of its existing shareholding and the fair values of property, plant and equipment, with any adjustments recognised against the intangible asset.
Goodwill, if any, represents synergies/improvements arising from the utilisation of the acquired Mototolo infrastructure to mine and process Der Brochen and other adjacent properties.
4 AAP was already selling off all of the PGM output of Mototolo JV under a POC agreement with Glencore/Kagiso partnership. The business combination therefore has no impact on the Group's
revenue.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented:
""Anglo American Platinum delivered another strong operational and financial performance in 2018. However, losing two of our colleagues is simply unacceptable and deeply distressing. We
again express our sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Johannes Maimela and Mr Emmanuel Segale. These tragic incidents have re-emphasised how critical it is for
us to eliminate fatalities across our business - we must create a safe working environment.

In another year of strong production from our operations, total Platinum Group Metal (PGM) production increased by 4%, with another record production performance from Mogalakwena, as well
as record production from Unki and Kroondal. The turnaround plan at Amandelbult is progressing, but a combination of factors negatively impacted Q4 production.

Refined production was, however, lower than mined production due to the temporary build-up of work-in-progress inventory. Planned maintenance, as well as the Mortimer smelter rebuild in
Q2, the partial rebuild of the Polokwane smelter in Q3, and the commissioning of the Unki smelter in Q3, resulted in the inventory build - which we expect will be fully processed in 2019.
Despite this, cash flow from operations rose by 60% to R5.6 billion, and net debt reduced by R4.7 billion to move us to a net cash position of R2.9 billion. I am pleased to report that as
a result, Anglo American Platinum led the JSE All Share Index in 2018 with a total shareholder return of 55%.

We have had a busy year. As part of the upgrading of our portfolio, we sold Union Mine to Siyanda Resources, sold our equity holding in Royal Bafokeng Platinum, and sold our 33% interest
in BRPM to our joint-venture (JV) partner. We have completed the acquisition of Glencore and Kagiso Platinum Venture stakes in the Mototolo JV, to make it a wholly owned operation. In
support of our strategic objective of growing demand for PGMs, we supported the launch of AP Ventures LLC, together with the PIC committing USD200 million. Finally, we continue to advance
project studies to evaluate the optimal expansion plan at Mogalakwena and assess the potential for synergies at Mototolo and Der Brochen.

We have evolved our strategy to deliver the next phase of value to the business, which focuses on three components: firstly, to realise the full value of our operations through our people
and innovation, by operating beyond current world benchmark levels of performance; secondly, to invest in our portfolio through fast-payback projects, investing in technology and
innovation at our mines, as well as developing studies for expansion projects, particularly at Mogalakwena; and thirdly, to facilitate the development of global markets for PGMs. I expect
this series of strategic actions will create considerable additional value from our business, increasing cashflows and returns and reinforcing the sustainability of the Company for the
benefit of all our stakeholders.

Given our strong balance sheet and greater confidence in the underlying cash-generating capability of the business, we are increasing our dividend pay-out ratio from 30% to 40% of headline
earnings. This equates to a H2 2018 declared cash dividend of R2.0 billion or R7.51/share. Anglo American Platinum is in a strong position and I thank all our employees and business
partners for their hard work. We are now looking forward to unlocking our full potential.""

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW
Anglo American Platinum strives for continuous improvement and capitalising on value-enhancing opportunities to position itself as the leading PGM producer. The restructured and
simplified, high-quality portfolio is at the centre of an attractive investment proposition and provides competitive returns and value to shareholders. The next phase of the strategy
focuses on driving further value from the operations and is built around three key areas.

1. Extracting the full potential from our operations through our people and innovation
This is a process to drive improvement in operational performance from current levels, through greater stabilisation and process optimisation, towards best in class in the industry, known
as P100. The next step is to operate our assets and equipment at levels beyond what is currently thought to be possible in the industry, known as P101.

Examples of areas of improvement include increasing the rope shovel performance at Mogalakwena from 26Mtpa to over 45Mtpa; increasing throughput at the concentrators by over 10%;
increasing operating time of concentrators to over 94%; increasing recoveries of concentrators to over 83%; and increasing the operating factor at processing facilities (defined as
availability multiplied by utilisation).

Beyond P101, a number of step-change technologies are being developed and deployed, including coarse particle flotation which can reduce energy intensity by over 30%; advanced
fragmentation and shock-break technology at concentrators which has the potential to also reduce energy intensity by 30%; and fine recovery of chrome and PGMs, in conjunction with bulk
sorting, which can lead to a 10% increase in feed grade and recoveries.

To unlock this additional value through P101 and a number of FutureSmart Mining technologies and digitalisation, additional investment in a number of fast payback, value enhancing
projects is required. This is expected to deliver EBITDA margin uplift of 5-8% on a mine-to-market basis, within a three to five year time horizon, before the benefit of any expansion
projects using 2018 prices and exchange rates. Capital guidance, including for these fast-payback and P101 investment projects will be in the region of R1.5-1.8 billion in 2019, and c.
R2.0 billion for each of 2020 and 2021.

2. Investing in our core portfolio that delivers industry-leading cash flows and returns
The Company has identified specific opportunities to invest in value-enhancing projects in our portfolio to deliver attractive cash flows and returns. The capital profile is aligned to
both the strategy and disciplined capital-allocation framework:

Stay-in-business capital will temporarily increase by once-off spend on environmental upgrades to the smelters, through sulphur dioxide (S02) abatement
Project capital remains focused on low-capex, fast-payback projects including chrome plant expansions, debottlenecking and replacement projects
Project studies are progressing on expansion opportunities at Mogalakwena and Der Brochen.

3. Facilitating the development of the market for PGMs to increase demand
Growing the market for PGMs is a long-standing strategic priority. Its importance was re-emphasised in 2018 as a key aspect of the strategy. Market development is undertaken globally
through a mix of marketing efforts in existing or near-term demand segments, such as jewellery through the Platinum Guild International (PGI); investment through the World Platinum
Investment Council (WPIC); and targeted market development in longer-term growth areas, such as fuel cells, hydrogen and clean energy, in part through the launch of the new venture capital
vehicle, AP Ventures. South African beneficiation objectives form part of broader market development activities.

SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL INVESTMENT
Safety
Tragically, there were two fatalities in work-related incidents in 2018, both at the Amandelbult complex. Mr Johannes Maimela, a 42-year-old tyre fitter, lost his life on 12 February 2018
after being attacked by a swarm of bees at the open-pit operations, and Mr Emmanuel Segale died in a fall-of-ground at Dishaba mine on 18 October 2018. Independent and comprehensive
investigations were conducted to understand the circumstances and to incorporate learnings to create a safer work environment for all.

Despite the improved trend in our other safety indicators and reduction in the number of fatalities in recent years (2017: 6), our loss-of-life performance is disappointing. Our total
recordable case injury-frequency rate (TRCFR) improved 34% to 3.00, and the lost-time injury-frequency rate (LTIFR) dropped 42% to 2.10. This resulted from a revised safety, health and
environmental strategy which was co-created in 2017 with management, unions and employees, to turn around the poor fatality performance. This guided our management approach to safety in
2018 and will continue to do so in conjunction with comprehensive safety turnaround plans for targeted operations.

Health
Continued focus on the health and wellness of our employees has delivered results by reducing the amount of equipment emitting noise above 85 decibels at our operations. In addition, a
strategy to reduce and ultimately eliminate particulate matter (dust) exposure is underway and will be fully implemented by 2020.

Anglo American Platinum is committed to achieving the 90:90:90 targets on HIV set by UNAIDS. The UNAIDS target includes 90% of employees knowing their status and 90% of HIV-positive
employees taking antiretroviral therapy, with 90% under viral suppression. In 2018, 98% of employees were counselled leading to 88% of those knowing their status; 90% of those registering
for antiretroviral therapy; and 80% of those in viral suppression.

The Company continued to intensify the proactive management of tuberculosis (TB) and roll-out of isoniazid prophylaxis. The combined HIV and TB initiatives contributed to reducing the TB
incidence from 1,020 per 100,000 people in 2014 to 325 in 2018, significantly below the national average of 781.

Environment
We have maintained our record of no major or material environmental incidents (categorised as level three to five) since 2013.
We continue to reduce both our fresh water and energy consumption as well as improving water and energy intensities. Due to our reduced energy consumption, we are also reducing our
greenhouse gas emissions through our focused carbon management programme.

We have made considerable progress in the management of our hazardous and non-hazardous waste to landfill with programmes and projects are in place to achieve a zero waste to landfill
ambition by 2020.

Our most material air quality issue relates to sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from our three smelters in South Africa. Polokwane smelter started constructing its SO2 abatement project in
2018, which will use an innovative technology to capture SO2 gas from the furnace and convert it to sulphuric acid. The technology will ultimately reduce SO2 emissions by an estimated 96%
to comply with global best practice limits. On completion of the SO2 abatement project at Polokwane in 2020, Mortimer will commence its abatement project, together at a capital investment
of R2.5 billion (in real terms). Waterval smelter, through the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) already has an SO2 abatement solution in place which operates at global best practice levels.

Managing tailings storage facilities (TSF) is critically important and remains a top ten priority major risk event. Risk management for major risk events has enforced very stringent
management controls to prevent any failures. Focus remains on using the latest technology for early detection and ongoing monitoring and inspection of all the TSFs of both owned mines and
managed JV mines. Anglo American Platinum continues to implement technical measures that indicate stability and integrity of the dams and ensure that the correct management structures and
employed expertise are in place.

Social and community investment
The Company's social license to operate is dependent on the ability to demonstrate value-creation to host communities and thus make a positive impact on society.

In 2018, R609 million was spent on social investment, community development and empowerment. Included in this amount was R467 million of Community Social Investment (CSI), Social and
Labour Plan (SLPs) spend and payments into Community Trusts, as well as R142 million paid out in dividends for community shareholdings in Atomatic, MASA and Alchemy.

Anglo American Platinum has an embedded plan to achieve its 2016-2020 SLPs. Stakeholders are engaged and more involved in the delivery of each SLP and each project is monitored and
evaluated to gauge its impact. Overall, our flagship projects have created over 1,000 jobs. More than 8,000 learners benefited from our education support programme from early childhood
development to grade 12 levels. The SLPs, regional socio-economic development or SED, Alchemy (community shareholding trust) and Zimele (an Anglo American initiative) strategy all form
part of a broader SED strategy aimed at delivering lasting benefits for host communities around our assets.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Total production
Total production (M&C)       2018       2017  %
PGMs                    5,186,500  5,007,700  4

Palladium               1,610,800  1,557,300  3

Improving operational efficiencies and higher productivity across the majority of the portfolio has enabled an increase in total PGM production in line with upgraded PGM production
guidance of 5.1 to 5.2 million PGM ounces.
Total PGM production (comprising platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, iridium and ruthenium metal in concentrate) was up 4% to 5,186,500 ounces. Excluding Bokoni, which was placed on care
and maintenance in 2017, total PGM production was up 6% on a like-for-like basis.

Mogalakwena
Production (M&C)       2018       2017  %
PGMs              1,170,000  1,098,500  7
Platinum            495,100    463,800  7
Palladium           540,900    508,900  6

Mogalakwena produced another record year of production of 1,170,000 PGM ounces, up 7%. Production increased through mining a targeted higher-grade area in the North pit in the first half
of the year, and also due to optimisation of the primary mill at North concentrator plant leading to improved throughput and metal recovery.

Due to an optimised mine plan, which was implemented at the beginning of 2018, the pit walls of the central pit were steepened. This, together with improved truck and shovel performance,
enabled an opportunity to move more waste tonnes in the period. By mining additional waste tonnes this period, more ore tonnes were exposed, allowing for more consistent mining of ore
tonnes over the short to medium term, reducing the need to drawdown on ore stockpiles from 2021. In addition, improvements in concentrator performance allowed more ore to be processed and,
as a result, less ore was stockpiled.

The consequent impact on Mogalakwena's unit cost was an 18% increase to R18,522 per platinum ounce. Excluding the impact of the lower ore capitalisation and increased waste stripping, unit
cost increases 9%, benefitting from higher production but offset by above inflationary cost increases e.g. diesel and labour. Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was
R7,838 against R6,628 per ounce in 2017.

Mogalakwena delivered R4.0 billion of economic free cash flow (defined as operating free cash flow from consolidated activities less/add economic interest in the asset). The mine had an
EBITDA margin of 46% and a ROCE of 31%.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) (includes operating costs as defined above, all sustaining capital expenditure, capitalised waste stripping and allocated marketing and market development
costs net of by product revenue) per platinum ounce sold was USD286 per ounce, down from USD340 in the previous year mainly due to the benefit of increased by-product revenue. AISC, if all
produced metal was sold would have been USD222 per platinum ounce sold.

Amandelbult
Production (M&C)     2018     2017  %
PGMs              868,800  858,000  1
Platinum          442,700  438,000  1
Palladium         205,100  202,500  1

As announced on 24 July 2017, Amandelbult has developed a strategy to improve the profitability of the mine by reducing the AISC. The key steps include: operational turn around of the
asset by increasing immediately stopeable ore reserves (IMS) at Dishaba and implementing productivity improvements; developing the Dishaba UG2 project to mine the UG2 reef by utilising
existing Merensky infrastructure at minimal capital investment; extracting the full value of metals mined and expanding chrome production; and assessing capital light replacement projects
at Dishaba. The combination of these measures should enable Amandelbult to sustain production with no significant project capital expenditure in the medium term and reduce the AISC per
platinum ounce sold to USD820 at H1 2017 achieved prices and exchange rates by 2022.

Total PGM production at Amandelbult increased by 1% to 868,800 ounces, due to increased underground production delivered to the concentrator, primarily from Dishaba. Dishaba mine
development led to a 7% increase in immediately available ore reserves compared with the prior year, highlighting the progress made in developing Dishaba Lower at a low capital cost of
R0.5 billion. This was against previous thinking that a new shaft at much higher capital investment was the only replacement option. As part of the overall improvement plan, Dishaba No2.
Vertical shaft has been successfully upgraded from 160ktpm to 230ktpm hoisting capacity by the end of 2018.

However, production was significantly impacted in the final quarter, with lower underground production delivered to the concentrator primarily due to the section 54 stoppage following the
fatal incident on 18 October 2018 and subsequent extensive retraining of employees, some impact from Eskom load shedding, and persistent high absenteeism in the final quarter.

Chrome production at Amandelbult increased 27% to 831,900 tonnes (on a 100% basis) from 654,400 tonnes in 2017. A chrome interstage project was implemented in Q3 2018 at a capital cost of
R10 million which increased the yield from 13.5% to 16.6%.

Amandelbult delivered economic free cash flow of R0.6 billion and the mine had an EBITDA margin of 15% and a ROCE of 17%.

AISC per platinum ounce sold was USD794 per ounce, down from USD955 in the previous year due to improvements in the rand basket price, including a greater contribution from chrome. AISC if all
produced metal was sold would be USD840 per platinum ounce sold.

Palladium          75,500   64,400  17

Unki mine in Zimbabwe produced a record 192,800 PGM ounces, an increase of 16%. Production increased due to an increase in tonnes milled, up 10% due to improved underground productivity,
while the 4E built-up head grade increased to 3.51g/t (2017: 3.47g/t) due to improved mining reef cut and reducing waste tonnes mined.

Unki delivered R0.5 billion of economic free cash flow and an EBITDA margin of 29% and ROCE of 9%. If adjusted for the sale of treasury bills and real time gross settlement (RTGS) forex
loss, the EBITDA margin would be 27% and ROCE would be 8%.

AISC (excluding the receipts of treasury bills) per platinum ounce sold was USD616 per ounce, marginally up from USD612, due to the benefit from increased by-product revenue offset by the RTGS
forex loss. The equivalent AISC would be USD449 if all material produced had been sold. Excluding the impact of the RTGS forex loss the AISC was USD472 per ounce and USD311 per ounce if all
material produced had been sold.

The Unki smelter was completed in 2018, on schedule and on budget (capital investment of R0.7 billion) with commissioning completed in Q3 2018.

Palladium          82,900   52,500  58

Mototolo had an improved performance in 2018 increasing production by 56% to 287,700 PGM ounces (2017: 184,800 ounces). The mine returned to normal production levels in 2018, prior to the
impact of the four-month concentrator shut down in 2017 for remedial work to restore the Helena tailings storage facility. Additional production of 20,800 PGM ounces was toll treated at
Bokoni Mine (2017: 11,900 PGM ounces) from ore stockpiled during the concentrator plant shut down.

Mototolo delivered economic free cash flow of R0.1 billion, due to the loss of cash flow for four months following the concentrator disruptions at the end of 2017. This will normalise in
2019. The mine had an EBITDA margin of 25% and a ROCE of 34% based on the mine as a wholly-owned mine. The AISC of Mototolo for the period was USD823 per platinum ounce sold (weighted as own
mine and purchase of concentrate).

The acquisition of Glencore and Kagiso Platinum Venture shares of the Mototolo JV was completed on 1 November 2018. From this date, production was treated as own-mine production, and was
previously treated as 50% JV mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate.

Union
PGM production from Union on an own-mine basis contributed 23,100 ounces including 11,600 platinum ounces and 5,200 palladium ounces. On completion of the sale of Union on 1 February 2018,
production was treated as purchase of concentrate from third parties.

Palladium                  140,000  135,200  4

Joint venture production is 50% mined production.
Kroondal achieved record PGM production up 7% to 312,200 PGM ounces due to improved underground efficiencies, and improved concentrator recoveries.
Modikwa marginally increased production by 1% to 164,700 PGM ounces, benefiting from ore purchases from Mototolo which contributed 12,300 PGM ounces compared to 9,700 in 2017. The
underlying mine performance was impacted by a slow start to the year due to community unrest that affected work attendance in March and a bus-arson incident in April which tragically
resulted in the death of six Modikwa employees.

Palladium           597,300    548,600   9

Total PGM purchase of concentrate (POC), including 50% of the joint ventures' production and purchase of concentrate from third parties, increased 13% to 2,291,900 ounces. The increase in
POC is primarily due to the inclusion of concentrate from Union following the sale to Siyanda on 1 February 2018 and was partially offset by the removal of unprofitable ounces of Bokoni
which was placed on care and maintenance in 2017 (which contributed 117,000 PGM ounces in 2017).
4E material from Sibanye-Stillwater will be under a tolling contract from 1 January 2019, and therefore will not be categorised under purchase of concentrate from third parties.

Refined PGM production decreased 6% to 4,784,900 PGM ounces. The reduction was primarily attributable to the planned rebuilds of Mortimer and Polokwane smelters, the commissioning of the
Unki smelter, and maintenance work on other processing assets, all of which resulted in a build-up of work-in-progress inventory.

In addition, there was a particularly strong refined production performance in 2017 due to the stock-count gain (106,000 PGM ounces) and the build-up in additional work in progress
inventory following the Waterval smelter run-out in 2016 (114,000 PGM ounces). Refined production and sales volumes should increase in 2019 as the backlog of work-in-progress-inventory
from 2018 is processed in full.

PGM sales volumes (excluding marketing activities) decreased 3% to 5,224,900 PGM ounces. The decrease resulted from lower refined production, compensated in part by a drawdown in refined
inventory levels. Market activities generated further sales volumes of 223,100 PGM ounces.

Platinum and palladium work-in-progress inventory has risen from around 467,000 ounces and 379,000 ounces respectively at the end of 2017 to 548,000 ounces and 447,000 ounces respectively
at the end of 2018. Work-in-progress stock levels are expected to normalise in 2019.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2018 overview
Anglo American Platinum delivered another strong financial performance in 2018, with enhanced margins and operating cash flows, benefiting from the strategy to reposition the portfolio,
removing loss-making ounces and an increased focus on operational efficiencies.

EBITDA rose 21% to R14.5 billion with a group EBITDA margin of 20% (excluding marketing activities). Headline earnings increased 95% to R7.6 billion (2017: R3.9 billion), with headline
earnings per share (HEPS) of 2,893 cents (2017: 1,482 cents). Higher earnings reflect a higher dollar basket compared to 2017 and operating improvements.

The Company further strengthened its balance sheet to end the year with net cash of R2.9 billion, a R4.7 billion improvement from net debt of R1.8 billion at 31 December 2017.

Disposals and acquisitions
Further significant progress was made during the year in upgrading the Anglo American Platinum portfolio.

On 1 February 2018, the sale of our 85% interest in Union Mine and 50.1% interest in MASA Chrome to Siyanda Resources became effective. The company realised an attributable, after-tax loss
on disposal of R0.8 billion which, together with prior impairments recognised, brings the total attributable, after-tax loss on divesting from this operation to R1.8 billion. This is
excluded from headline earnings. Anglo American Platinum expects to extract value in future from the continuing purchase of concentrate/toll refining contracts with Siyanda, utilising
capacity in the group's processing operations.

On 24 April 2018, the Company disposed of 17.3 million shares in Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (RB Plat) for R0.4 billion. The sale of the Company's residual shareholding in RB Plat was
completed on 7 August 2018, realising net proceeds of R0.1 billion.

On 4 July 2018, the Company entered into a binding sale-and-purchase agreement with RB Plat to dispose of its 33% interest in the BRPM JV. The sale was effective from 1 December 2018 (for
accounting purposes). The total upfront consideration of R0.6 billion comprises an upfront payment of R0.3 billion for part of purchase consideration, plus the repayment of funding
provided to BRPM from signature to effective date (R0.3 billion). The balance of the purchase consideration of R1.6 billion will be settled on a deferred basis and settled in three equal
tranches after 1.5 years, 2.5 years and 3.5 years from the completion date, and escalated at over the settlement period at RB Plat's borrowing rate plus a premium of 2%. The deferred
consideration may be settled in cash or in equivalent value of RB Plat shares. The sale has given rise to a post-tax impairment loss of R0.9 billion, excluded from headline earnings.

On 17 July 2018, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Anglo Platinum Marketing Limited had subscribed for interests in two UK based venture capital funds, with an aggregate
commitment of USD100 million. Our commitment to the funds is matched by a USD100 million commitment from South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC). In December 2018, Mitsubishi
Corporation became the third Limited Partner of AP Ventures, further endorsing the funds mandate. The investments in Altergy Systems, Hydrogenious Technologies, Food Freshness Technology,
Greyrock Energy, United Hydrogen and HyET Holding were sold to AP Ventures on 20 September 2018 with a carrying amount of R0.4 billion. The total fair value of the investments at the date
of sale was R0.7 billion. A profit of R0.2 billion was recognised on disposing of the equity-accounted investment in Hydrogenious Technologies, which is excluded from headline earnings.

On 1 November 2018, the Company acquired Glencore's 40.2% and Kagiso's 9.8% interests in the Mototolo joint venture. The consideration comprises an upfront payment of R1.3 billion and
deferred consideration payments of R12.6 million per month from November 2018 for 72 months to Glencore. Top-up payments (depending on the PGM price) and additional tax gross-up payments
will be paid to Glencore in January each year until 2024, with a final top-up payment in November 2024. The deferred consideration is carried at fair value through profit or loss and
included in headline earnings.

Sales revenue
Net sales revenue rose 14% to R74.6 billion from R65.7 billion in 2017 on the back of a 13% higher US dollar basket price of USD2,219 per platinum ounce sold (compared to USD1,966 in
2017). The average US dollar sales price achieved on all metals improved, except for platinum which was USD871 per ounce compared to USD947 in 2017. The average rand/dollar exchange rate
was unchanged from 2017 and as a result the rand basket price also improved by 13% to R29,601 per platinum ounce sold (2017: R26,213). Sales volumes of PGMS declined 3% from the prior year
due to lower refined production resulting from the Mortimer and Polokwane smelter rebuilds and other maintenance at the processing assets. The prior year also had the benefit of additional
sales volumes, due to the stock count gain and the additional refined material following the build-up of work-in-progress inventory following the Waterval smelter run-out in 2016.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales rose by 12% from R56.6 billion in 2017 to R63.3 billion due to increased production volumes, lower ore stockpile capitalisation and input cost inflation. Following the sale
of the Union operations in February 2018, Anglo American Platinum has higher purchase-of-concentrate costs and lower on-mine costs due to purchasing concentrate from Siyanda.

On-mine costs (mines and concentrators) reduced by R0.8 billion to R26.1 billion due to the exit of Union, partly offset by input cost inflation and increased volumes at retained
operations. Processing costs rose by 10% in 2018 on higher input costs, such as labour, diesel, electricity and coal as well as commissioning the Unki smelter.

Costs associated with the purchase of concentrate and trading activities increased to R29.2 billion from R20.8 billion in 2017 due to higher volumes purchased as a result of concentrate
purchased from Siyanda in respect of Union Mine, increased output from BRPM and purchases of third-party refined metal, and due to a higher purchase price due to the 13% higher rand basket
price than 2017. This was partly offset by lower purchases for Bokoni after the mine was placed on care and maintenance in the second half of 2017 and lower output from the Sibanye
Rustenburg mine. Inventory movements increased due to work-in-progress build-up because of maintenance of process operations and the ore stockpile capitalised was lower than the prior
year. Other costs rose 2% from R3.4 billion in 2017, primarily due to higher transport of metal costs given higher costs for transporting chrome, and increased royalties on higher revenue.

Improved truck and shovel performance at Mogalakwena enabled the Company to move more waste creating the potential to expose more ore in future periods and improvements in concentrator
performance resulted in building up less ore stockpiles than previously guided. As a result, unit cost rose 8% compared to 2017 to R20,684 per platinum ounce. Excluding the accounting
impact of the lower ore capitalisation and increased waste stripping, unit cost was up 5% year-on-year. Unit cost benefited from increased mined production (after adjusting for Union) but
was more than offset by above inflation increases in processing costs, labour and fuel cost, as well as environmental rehabilitation cost credits in 2017, not recurring in 2018.

The all-in sustaining cost of production was USD756 per platinum ounce against an achieved platinum price of USD871 per ounce.

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
EBITDA rose 21% from R12.0 billion in 2017 to R14.5 billion. Uncontrollable items comprising CPI inflation, US dollar metal prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate, increased earnings
by a net R4.2 billion, with stronger metal prices contributing R5.4 billion and foreign exchange gains adding R0.3 billion, partially offset by CPI of R1.5 billion.

Earnings were reduced by the lower increase in the measured value of ore stock piles (R1.3 billion) and the stock count loss in 2018 of R0.5 billion compared to the stock count gain in
2017 of R0.9 billion (net impact of a decrease of R1.4 billion). This was partially offset by improved costs which increased earnings by R0.6 billion, as well as the benefit of Bokoni
being placed on care and maintenance, resulting in lower losses incurred for associates (R0.3 billion).

The EBITDA margin achieved was 20% (2017:18%), made up of own mining operations of 32% (2017: 32%), JV operations of 27% (2017:20%) and purchase of concentrate of 10% (2017: 9%).

Capital expenditure
Disciplined capital expenditure remains a priority, aimed at maintaining asset integrity and adding value, not volume.

Capital expenditure for 2018, excluding capitalised interest and capitalised waste stripping, increased 18% to R4.7 billion (net of insurance receipts) from R4.0 billion in 2017.

Stay-in-business (SIB) capex was flat on 2017 at R3.3 billion. The SIB governance process is rigorous, ensuring that this capital is sustainable and focused on safety, enhancing business
continuity and regulatory compliance. SIB capital spend in 2019 is expected to be R3.4-R3.7 billion.

As previously guided, the SO2 abatement project for Polokwane smelter began in 2018 (capital spend to date of R0.4 billion) and this will continue in 2019 - 2020. Mortimer SO2 abatement
project will begin in 2021.

Our focus is to invest in low-capex, fast-payback, value-accretive projects. Project capital was R1 billion in 2018 and related to Amandelbult chrome plant modules 3 and 4, Unki smelter
and closing out Mogalakwena North concentrator optimisation. Project capital in 2019 is expected to be R1.5-R1.8 billion for low-capital, fast-payback projects (such as 15E at Amandelbult,
Unki debottlenecking and chrome recovery plants at Amandelbult and Modikwa, and chrome interstage at Mototolo) and projects to achieve and then exceed operating benchmark performance.

Waste tonnes mined increased from 69 million tonnes in 2017 to 71 million tonnes in 2018 and the cost of mining 36 million tonnes was capitalised as compared to 20 million tonnes in 2017.
Capitalised waste stripping was marginally above guidance at R1.5 billion as improved truck and shovel performance at Mogalakwena enabled the Company to move more waste, creating the
potential to expose more ore in future periods. Guidance on 2019 capitalised waste stripping is R2.0-R2.2 billion.

Working capital
The company continued to focus on optimising its working capital levels. Trade working capital at 31 December 2018 was R4.9 billion, equivalent to 15 days, compared to R6.2 billion at 31
December 2017 (26 days). The decrease reflects higher trade creditors (R3.3 billion) due to higher payables for the purchase of concentrate (on higher volumes, including production
purchased from Siyanda, as well as higher rand metal prices), an increase in the customer prepayment of R1.5 billion (due to a weaker closing exchange rate than 2017 and higher prices) and
lower trade debtors of R0.6 billion (2 days in 2018 compared to 5 days in 2017). This was partially offset by a build-up in work-in-progress metal inventories totalling R3.5 billion
because of planned maintenance at the processing assets, and measured ore stockpiles increasing R0.5 billion.

In 2018, the Company had a stock count loss of R0.5 billion (2017: stock count gain of R0.9 billion), with stock count losses of 16,000 ounces palladium, 19,000 ounces rhodium and 3,000
tonnes of nickel, partially offset by the benefit of 26,000 ounces platinum stock-count gain.

Stock counts of work-in-progress are performed annually at smelters and the base metal refinery, and every three years at the precious metals refinery. Due to the different physical nature
of the stock at each point in the processing cycle, detailed methods have been developed to determine the physical contents. The process is complex, and results are available circa four
months later at the end of the processing cycle. These values are then compared to the theoretical stock. The variance of each metal (either positive or negative) must be within an
allowable variance, otherwise this would trigger an additional physical stock count. Each metal variance is then valued using the standard stock valuation methodology and the net sum of
the platinum, palladium, rhodium and nickel variances reported as the financial stocktake adjustment.

Net debt and liquidity
The Company has a strong balance sheet. It ended the year with net cash of R2.9 billion compared to net debt of R1.8 billion at the end of 2017. This was supported by operations generating
cash of R14.2 billion, R1.5 billion from the customer prepayment and net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions of R0.1 billion. These cash flows were used to fund capital expenditure
and capitalised waste stripping of R6.2 billion; pay taxation of R1.8 billion; settle interest of R0.6 billion to our debt providers; fund associates and minor investments of R0.6 billion
and pay a dividend to shareholders of R1.9 billion.

Excluding the impact of the customer prepayment of R6.1 billion, the Company is in a net debt position of R3.2 billion (2017: R6.5 billion), with net debt to EBITDA of 0.2x (2017: 0.5x).
Liquidity headroom is at R23.4 billion, comprising both undrawn committed facilities of R14.2 billion and cash of R9.2 billion. The Company is comfortably within its debt covenants.

Dividend
The Board has increased the dividend pay-out ratio policy from 30% to 40% of headline earnings, reaffirming Anglo Platinum's confidence in the future of the business and commitment to
disciplined and balanced capital allocation.

A second half cash dividend of R2.0 billion or R7.51 per share has been declared to our shareholders. The dividend applies to all shareholders on the register on 8 March 2019 and is
payable on 11 March 2019. This brings the aggregate 2018 dividend to R3.0 billion or R11.25 per share, equivalent to a 40% pay-out on full year 2018 headline earnings.

PGM MARKET REVIEW
Anglo American Platinum produces all PGMs which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium, as well as by-products including gold, nickel, copper and chrome.
Prices
In USD terms, the achieved basket price was up 13% year on year to USD2,219 per platinum ounce (2017: USD1,966). The rand was unchanged, leading to the rand basket price also increasing by
13% at R29,601 per platinum ounce (2017: R26,213). The dollar platinum price ended the year at USD794, down 15% from the beginning of the year, while the average price over the year
declined by 7.3% to USD880 (2017: USD949). The palladium price climbed 18% to USD1,029 per ounce on average (2017: USD869) and the rhodium price doubled to an average USD2,221 per ounce
(2017: USD1,108).

Platinum
Platinum showed the weakest price performance amongst the PGMs due to a combination of negative sentiment on the light duty diesel engine segment in Europe, continuing softness of Chinese
jewellery demand and global macroeconomic factors. Primary supply from mine production was essentially unchanged from the previous year but recycling of end-of-life catalytic converters
from the automotive industry grew strongly, while gross demand declined by 2.5%. Consequently, platinum was in a moderate fundamental surplus in 2018.

Palladium
The palladium price climbed strongly in 2018, particularly in the second half, driven by an excess of demand over combined primary and secondary supply. As a result, palladium was in
deficit again, although the size of the deficit was limited by very heavy net disinvestment. This performance is reflected in palladium hitting a series of nominal highs in the final
quarter, peaking at USD1,277 in December, with an average price of USD1,029, 18% above prior-year levels (2017: USD869). Indeed, palladium traded at a premium to platinum almost throughout
2018, with its premium rising to a record USD476 an ounce in December, providing strong support for the PGM basket price. Demand for this metal remains concentrated in the automotive
industry, where gross demand climbed 2.7% in 2018, while industrial demand rose 1.4%. This picture would have seen palladium in a much more substantial deficit without over 500,000 ounces
of net redemptions from physically backed exchange-traded funds during the year which contributed to an overall 574,000 ounces of net disinvestment.

Rhodium
The rhodium price was particularly strong in 2018, with the average price doubling to USD2,221 (2017: USD1,108). The peak price of USD2,600 was the highest since 2010. As with palladium,
this meant that rhodium contributed more significantly to revenue than in recent years. This price rise was partly due to a fundamental market deficit of 92,000 ounces, and a tighter
leasing market driving some additional purchasing and speculators showing interest. Underlying demand in fact weakened slightly, dropping 3.8%: gross automotive demand climbed 2.6% to
863,000 ounces, aided by tighter emissions regulations in China and in Europe, but the chemical and glass industries both bought less metal than a year earlier.

Minor metals
The prices of both ruthenium and iridium increased in 2018 with ruthenium climbing to an of average of USD241 per ounce (2017: USD75) and iridium achieving an average of USD1,284 per
ounce (2017: USD898). Demand for both metals is strong from both the chemical industry, through demand for clean catalysis in the chlor-alkali sector in China, and the electrical industry,
for its use in hard disks and chip resistors.

Automotive
The global light-duty vehicle sector declined marginally last year, with sales falling 0.4% from 2017 at 95 million units (source: LMC automotive global light vehicle sales update). The
European automotive market was the main high point, with sales growing in both Eastern and Western Europe. North American vehicle sales were unchanged but there was some marked weakness in
China, where light-duty vehicle sales fell 3.0%, driven by higher purchase taxes and slowing growth.

Gross automotive demand for platinum declined by 167,000 ounces or 5.4% year on year. Diesel's share of the light-duty vehicle market in Western Europe continues to drop, from 49.5% in
2016 to 44.5% in 2017 and 36.0% in 2018, contributing to a fall of over 200,000 ounces in gross platinum demand from the European automotive sector. A number of factors have combined to
send diesel car sales lower, from the increased cost of fitting advanced after treatment, the perception of poor in-use tailpipe emissions and proposals to limit the use of older diesel
vehicles in some urban areas around Europe.

The outlook for the diesel engine in the light-duty vehicle sector is somewhat unclear. Lower sales have made it less economically feasible for some manufacturers to develop a new family
of diesel engines and diesel's share can be expected to fall further in the next few years. However, diesel vehicles are expected to maintain a reasonable share of sales of commercial
vehicles and larger passenger cars in Western Europe over the next five years. With its relatively low CO2 emissions, diesel is still extremely important for light and heavy-duty vehicle
manufacturers and their ability to meet the stretching EU CO2 emission targets in 2021 and 2030. Diesels are likely to remain the primary engine technology in heavy-duty vehicles in
particular, while tighter emissions legislation in China and India will generate additional platinum demand to offset some of the demand lost in the light-duty vehicle sector.

Globally, gross demand for palladium from the automotive sector rose 2.7% while demand for rhodium climbed 2.6%. Both metals benefited from tightening emission standards in China and
Europe in particular, with demand growing despite static vehicle sales volumes.

With palladium moving to a record premium over platinum in late 2018, there has been more interest in the concept of replacing palladium in some gasoline catalytic converters with
platinum. Although this is not a trivial process, we believe it is already technically possible to replace some proportion of palladium currently used, while research may make this
approach more widely applicable. However, there is little evidence yet that automotive manufacturers have started this substitution process. It is therefore unlikely that there will be any
meaningful progress in replacing palladium with platinum in gasoline autocatalytic converters in 2019, although it is highly likely that this will occur at some point.

Industrial
Industrial demand for platinum was strong in 2018, rising 14% or 294,000 ounces, and a greater growth rate than global economic growth. China remained a key purchaser for capacity
expansion in the chemical and, particularly, the glass sectors. Platinum demand from the fuel cell sector remains small in absolute terms, but this sector reflects a growing share of
demand, supported by official support for this technology in China.

Industrial demand for palladium increased again in 2018, by 20,000 ounces. Rising demand from the chemical sector was the key positive change, just as for platinum. Industrial demand for
rhodium declined by roughly 60,000 ounces from the previous year's high levels.

Jewellery
Gross global jewellery demand declined marginally in 2018, falling 1.5% or 37,000 ounces to 2.36 million platinum ounces. In China, the largest single market, gross platinum demand from
the jewellery sector shrank 4.8% or 70,000 ounces to some 1.4 million ounces. Decreased footfall in jewellery stores in China has led retailers to move from a volume strategy (where
jewellery is priced by weight) to a margin strategy, where profitability per piece is the focus. This has been challenging for both 24ct gold and plain platinum jewellery, which has
historically been sold by weight. The jewellery sector in China is changing its approach and some positive signs are evident, but this process will take some time to complete as
manufacturers develop new products and designs.

Indian jewellery demand grew strongly again in 2018, rising some 15%. The Platinum Guild International continues to position platinum as an attractive and modern jewellery metal for
consumers in India, as well as supporting the jewellery trade to manufacture, price and market platinum successfully in what remains a gold-led marketplace.

Demand was relatively stable in Europe, Japan and North America. In all three markets, platinum retains a strong brand and attraction to consumers, supporting ongoing demand.

Investment
Net investment demand for platinum was again positive in 2018 but lower than the exceptionally strong 2016 and 2017. Net demand was 66,000 ounces, compared to 356,000 ounces in 2017.
Despite obvious price weakness in US dollar terms, there was net disinvestment from physically-backed exchange-traded funds. Investment from Japan was lower than the previous two years:
lower volatility in yen prices and a persistent discount for platinum against gold failed to provide as many buying opportunities in 2018. Physical investment in platinum outside Japan
strengthened, aided by the World Platinum Investment Council's work on improving the availability of investment products in key markets.

Palladium suffered another year of disinvestment, with over 500,000 ounces of net disinvestment from exchange-traded funds as investors looked to realise profits from their holdings or, in
some cases, take physical metal instead to benefit from high palladium lease rates.

Long-dated demand from fuel cells
Although platinum demand from fuel cells remains limited in scale, interest in this technology is gaining traction. Some recent commercial successes for hydrogen fuel cell technology, in
both stationary and mobile applications, include uses as diverse as garbage trucks, heavy-duty trucks and forklift trucks. Hyundai released a new fuel cell car, the Nexo, while Mercedes
produced its first fuel cell hybrid, the GLC, in 2018.

OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and governments have set a range of targets for fuel cell electric vehicle use. If infrastructure requirements are also met, there is the potential
for several million fuel cell electric vehicles to be on the road by 2030. At least as importantly, China continues to devote considerable effort to commercialising fuel cell and hydrogen
technology. The potential for these efforts in China and elsewhere could lead to annual demand of several hundred-thousand ounces by the end of the next decade.

MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Jewellery
Development of the global platinum jewellery market is carried out by Platinum Guild International (PGI) and focused on four major platinum jewellery markets (China, Japan, USA, India).
Initiatives in China, Japan and the USA are funded by Anglo American Platinum and other primary PGM producers, while the work in India is funded exclusively by the Company.

The next three years will be critical for platinum jewellery development in China to stimulate long-term demand growth. The market is undergoing a structural change due to changing
consumer preferences, with millennials who prefer branded jewellery collections over generic designs. The PGI is developing marketing programmes that safeguard platinum's strong equity in
bridal jewellery and target love occasions, which together represent a total potential market of 3.5 million ounces. This is a large segment for future growth - especially in China's
fast-growing lower-tier markets. In 2019, PGI will also lead further innovation in jewellery by driving a bigger variety of product designs through its partnerships with platinum jewellery
manufacturers.
The PGI launched platinum in India, and its core marketing programmes and product offerings contribute to the growth in this market. Retail sales among PGI's strategic partners (which
represent 54% of the platinum market under the PGI programme) continued to grow in 2018, despite challenging market conditions after government introduced new taxes and regulations for the
jewellery industry. PGI is currently working through partners to develop branded offerings for platinum jewellery for men, which has recently become one of the fastest-growing categories.
Existing marketing programmes such as Platinum Day of Love and Evara branded franchises continue to perform. At current growth rates, PGI projects the market to deliver over 500,000 ounces
of platinum jewellery in India by 2023.

This is the most-mature platinum jewellery market in the world, with the highest per-capita consumption and share of market. PGI Japan has identified the opportunity to develop a new
platinum jewellery category targeted at mature consumers, who hold a third of all Japanese financial assets. In 2018, PGI developed a series of Legacy collections aimed at older consumers
with a preference for platinum to buy products that allow them to pass on their wealth to the next generation.

Platinum sales continue to rise on the back of a strong economy and historically low platinum prices in the US. PGI's Platinum Crown initiative has boosted sales of platinum prongs by over
10% among participating partners.

Investment demand
Developing investment demand for platinum is led by the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), an industry body funded by several producers including Anglo American Platinum. In 2018,
WPIC continued to make progress against its mission and strategy despite adverse market conditions, which included a falling platinum price. WPIC works to stimulate investor demand for
physical platinum by providing actionable insights, engaging prospective investors and giving them the information to support informed decisions on platinum, and working with financial
institutions and market participants to develop products and channels that investors need.

WPIC concluded 2018 with ten active, ounce-producing product partnership projects, including three at a very early stage in China. An incremental 160,000 ounces of investment in platinum
are anticipated for the year. North American retail sales were particularly strong and will be a focus for WPIC in future.

In 2018, WPIC continued its strategic investment in China's significant potential, by engaging with multiple prospective investors. In addition, it has positioned itself as an important
provider of platinum market information in the Chinese language and attracted key media partners including Wall Street CN, Gold Topnews and Puoke Financial in disseminating relevant
research and content for Chinese investors.

In early December, WPIC concluded an agreement with Bank of China, one of the world's largest banks, to collaborate across China to increase platinum investment. The bank plans to grow its
platinum investment products and the partnership will capitalise on WPIC's expertise in existing and new product development. WPIC will provide platinum training to the bank's sales team
in Beijing and Shanghai in 2019 and expand this across major branches in China over the year.

Industrial market development
On the industrial front, Anglo American Platinum continues to support the development of PGM technologies through several means. These include investing in primary research and
development; investing in early-stage companies commercialising PGM technologies; and working towards a favourable policy environment for these technologies.

In 2018, Anglo American Platinum successfully spun off its internal PGM investment programme, announcing the establishment of independent fund manager AP Ventures LLP. The second founding
partner is the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) which manages the South African state pension fund. Each founding partner committed USD100 million to the initiative. AP Ventures will
continue with the original intention of the PGM investment programme, investing in high-growth companies developing patentable technologies that use PGMs to address some of society's
biggest challenges. In December 2018, Mitsubishi Corporation became the third limited partner of AP Ventures, further endorsing the funds' mandate.

Advocacy activities support development of a conducive policy environment for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in the major early-adopter markets of China, the European Union, United
Kingdom and United States. This work is complemented by participating in demonstration projects, where appropriate, such as co-funding hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in key locations.
Further, our advocacy work involves actively participating in several industry associations including the global Hydrogen Council and Chinese International Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Association, with Anglo American Platinum being a founding member of both bodies. The Company is also a member of Brussels-based Hydrogen Europe, the London-based UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
Association, the Washington DC-based Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, and the California-based California Fuel Cell Partnership. Each organisation provides a platform to engage
relevant industry and government partners.

Importantly, where possible, the company aims to integrate demand stimulation with developing skills and building capacity in South Africa. In 2018, we held the 19th annual PlatAfrica
jewellery design and manufacturing awards in partnership with PGI India and Metal Concentrators. This reflects our strategy to actively grow the market for platinum jewellery in South
Africa and our successful partnership with Metal Concentrators, which manages our metal financing scheme that provides platinum to local jewellery manufacturers on favourable financial
terms.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY
Mining Charter 2018
Anglo American Platinum welcomes the gazetting of the mining charter 2018 by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 27 September 2018. The final version is a significant improvement on the
draft 2017 and 2018 mining charters and deals more constructively with numerous issues that had proven challenging under the 2010 charter. The Company appreciates the extensive efforts
made by the minister and his team to engage with and consider the feedback of numerous stakeholder groups in finalising this charter.

In its submission to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) on 27 August 2018, Anglo American (including Anglo American Platinum, collectively known as the ""Group"") presented several
proposals that the Group believed would support greater competitiveness, investment and growth for the mining industry.

While the process of reviewing and fully assessing the implications of the new charter is still under way, the Group welcomes certain improvements and points of clarity. However, a few
significant concerns remain, which the group believes may continue to affect the sustainability of the mining industry in South Africa. These include:

Continued regulatory uncertainty arising from the recent favourable decision of the High Court on the Minerals Council of South Africa's application for a declaratory order on various
issues in the mining charter
Application of the charter (designed for mining) to licences granted under the Precious Metals Act and Diamonds Act, some of which must be renewed annually
Provisions suggesting that new and further BEE ownership transactions will need to be concluded on renewing a mining right.

In addition, the Group is concerned that Mining Charter 2018 will, in certain respects, be difficult to implement legally and practically, and may have unintended adverse consequences for
the industry.

Currently, Anglo American Platinum is not applying for any new mining rights, and all current mining rights have at least 20 years until renewal is required.

A further amendment to the mining charter of 2018 was gazetted in December 2018. This amendment has clarified that our first reports on progress with initiatives under the new mining
charter will be due in March 2020. This is a welcome development.

Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA)
The Minister of Mineral Resources has announced that he is withdrawing the MPRDA Amendment Bill. As the MPRDA Amendment Bill was never signed into law by the President, the Bill falls away
in its entirety and the MPRDA stands unamended.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
Reserves
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Ore Reserves have decreased by 8.7% from 166.2 4E Moz to 151.6 4E Moz in the review period. The reduction was primarily due to a change in
economic assumptions at Mogalakwena Mine, the disposal of the interest In Union Mine to Siyanda Resources and depletion due to production. The reduction of Ore Reserves has been partially
offset by an increase in Ore Reserves at Tumela, Unki and Modikwa mines due to the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.

Resources
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Mineral Resources, inclusive of Ore Reserves, decreased by 5.1% from 801.1 4E Moz to 760.5 4E Moz in the review period. This was primarily the
result of disposing of the interest in Union Mine to Siyanda (-39.2 4E Moz for Merensky and UG2 Reef and -0.6 4E Moz for the tailings dams).

The full reserves and resources statement will be available on 13 March 2019.

leadership of Mr Dean Pelser, Executive Head of Mining.

Mr Indresen Pillay, Executive Head of Projects and Safety, Health and Environment, resigned from his role as of August 2018. Mr Prakashim Moodliar has been appointed by the Executive
Committee and will start on 1 March 2019 as Executive Head of Projects. Mr Moodliar joins from ABInBev Africa as the Africa Zone Projects Manager, responsible for leading a large, multi-
disciplinary team which focused on project development and execution in Africa.

The Safety, Health and Environment portfolio will continue under the leadership of Mr Gordon Smith, Executive Head of Technical.

OUTLOOK
Market outlook
The three major PGMs - platinum, palladium and rhodium - should again be in a combined deficit in 2019. Primary mine supply should remain flat, while tightening emissions regulations are
likely to boost demand for palladium and rhodium in the light duty and platinum in the heavy-duty sectors.

Platinum is expected to be in a modest surplus once again in 2019. The outlook for gross global automotive demand is more positive in 2019, with some growth possible. While the diesel
engine's share of the European light vehicle market is expected to decline further, additional demand from the heavy-duty sector in China and India, due to stricter emissions regulations,
could drive combined automotive demand higher. Industrial demand is likely to remain strong, but lower than 2018 as global economic growth moderates. The jewellery demand outlook remains
mixed. There are some positive signs in China that jewellers could drive higher platinum sales but 2019 could still see a modest decline in demand before the market finally stabilises. In
contrast, Indian demand should increase further, and we expect a robust performance in other key jewellery markets. Investment demand depends on price movements and volatility but should
be positive, aided by continuing market development work from the World Platinum Investment Council. Primary supply should change little year on year, but recycling flows will increase
marginally, all contributing to the modest surplus forecast for 2019.

Palladium should once again be in a strong and widening deficit in 2019. Automotive demand seems set to increase, even with little or no growth in vehicle sales, as average vehicle size
increases and emissions rules tighten. Although palladium is trading at a substantial premium to platinum, there is little evidence of intensive efforts to replace palladium with platinum
in any gasoline catalytic converters. Even if this R&D process were to start in earnest in 2019, gross automotive palladium demand would be likely to rise over the coming year. Mine
production should be relatively flat year-on-year, but more palladium will be recovered from recycling. Over 500,000 ounces of net disinvestment from Exchange Traded Funds took place in
2018, without which palladium would have been in a very large deficit. Even if similar levels of disinvestment occur in 2019 which is unlikely given the current volume of ETFs available,
palladium is still expected to remain in a deficit once again.

Rhodium demand should be steady in 2019. Although vehicle sales are unlikely to grow this year, tighter emissions rules and rising vehicle sizes should translate to incremental automotive
demand. Industrial demand could fall back due to some price sensitivity in the glass sector. Primary supplies are expected to remain relatively flat but the volume of metal recycled should
climb in 2019, with rhodium likely to remain in a small fundamental surplus.

Operational outlook
PGM production guidance (metal-in-concentrate) is 4.2-4.5 million PGM ounces for 2019, including platinum outlook of 2.0-2.1 million ounces and palladium outlook of 1.3-1.4 million ounces.
Lower production versus 2018 reflects the Sibanye-Stillwater material changing to a tolling contract from 1 January 2019, and therefore refined metal is returned to Sibanye-Stillwater.
Refined production will be higher at 4.6-4.9 million PGM ounces for 2019, including platinum of 2.2-2.3 million ounces and palladium of 1.4-1.5 million ounces. Refined production is higher
than M&C due to the build-up of work-in-progress inventory after planned maintenance on Mortimer and Polokwane smelters in 2018, which will be processed in 2019. Sales volumes will be in
line with refined production.

Financial outlook
Unit cost guidance is between R21,000 and R22,000 per produced platinum ounce (metal-in-concentrate).

The Company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle, only focussing on high-returning and quick pay back projects. Total capital expenditure guidance for 2019,
excluding capitalised waste stripping is R5.7 billion to R6.3 billion. Capitalised waste stripping guidance is R2.0-R2.2 billion.

The Board has committed to paying a sustainable dividend based on a pay-out ratio of 40% of normalised headline earnings.

The financial information on which the guidance is based on has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company's auditors.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2018 (""the period"")
on the Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 18 February 2019.

Shareholders are referred to the Company's trading statement released on SENS on 13 December 2018
in which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the
period were expected to be at least 20% (R777 million or 297 cents per share, respectively) higher than
for the comparative reporting period for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 (""comparative
period"") and that basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period were also expected
to be at least 20% (R302 million or 149 cents per share, respectively) higher than for the comparative
period.

Shareholders are now advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the period are likely to increase to
between R7.125 billion and R7.895 billion (or between 83% and 103% higher than the prior year figure of
R3.886 billion) and to between 2,715 cents and 3,010 cents per share (or between 83% and 103% higher
than the prior year figure of 1,482 cents) respectively.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to increase to between R6.585 billion and R6.970 billion
(or between 239% and 259% higher than the prior year figure of R1.944 billion) and to between
2,510 cents and 2,655 cents per share (or between 239% and 258% higher than the prior year figure of
741 cents) respectively.

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily driven by a 13% increase in
the rand basket price and improved operational performance.

Basic earnings for the period will include post-tax attributable net losses of R1.5 billion, including the
impairment of the company's associate investment in BRPM, and the loss on disposal of Union mine and
MASA Chrome. Headline earnings in the period will include a post-tax attributable net gain of R0.5 billion,
which includes the remeasurement of deferred consideration relating to the Rustenburg disposal. Basic
earnings for the comparative period included attributable impairments after tax of R3.9 billion of which
R0.8 billion impacted both basic earnings and headline earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or reported on,
by the Company's external auditors.

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum tragically had one loss of life in Q4 2018. Mr Emmanual Thato Segale, lost his life
due to a fall of ground related incident which occurred on Thursday, 18 October 2018 at the Company's
Dishaba Mine in Amandelbult. Our deepest condolences go to his family, friends and colleagues. An
independent and comprehensive investigation is under way to understand the circumstances and learn from
them to create a safer work environment for all, and the Company is providing support and assistance to all
involved. Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities.

The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (""TRCFR"") per million hours at managed operations for the
quarter was 2.99, an 11% improvement compared to 3.36 in Q4 2017.


PGM PRODUCTION

Total PGM production increased to 1,256,900 ounces, up 3% (Q4 2017: 1,220,000 ounces), due to improved
operational performances across the majority of the portfolio. Platinum production increased by 3% to
602,300 ounces (Q4 2017: 587,000 ounces) and palladium production increased by 3% to 386,600 ounces
(Q4 2017: 374,900 ounces).


PGM production from own-managed mines

Own managed mines PGM production decreased by 2% to 535,600 ounces (Q4 2017: 545,600 ounces) due
to lower production at Mogalakwena (as guided) and Amandelbult, offset by strong performances from Unki
and the inclusion of Mototolo as an own-mine from 1 November 2018, following the completion of the
acquisition of Glencore and Kagiso-Tiso's stakes in the Mototolo mine. Platinum production decreased by
3% to 244,400 ounces (Q4 2017: 252,900 ounces) and palladium production decreased by 1% to 193,600
ounces (Q4 2017: 195,700 ounces).

Mogalakwena PGM production decreased by 9% to 256,800 ounces (Q4 2017: 282,200 ounces) due to an
8% reduction in the built-up head grade, following from the decline in Q3 2018 and as previously guided, as
well as maintenance at one crusher, which led to a reduction in tonnes milled. Mining performance was
strong, with an increase in total tonnes mined, up 7% to 22.9 million tonnes. Platinum production decreased
11% to 108,400 ounces (Q4 2017: 121,700 ounces) and palladium production decreased 8% to 118,200
ounces (Q4 2017: 127,800 ounces).

Amandelbult PGM production decreased by 16% to 190,700 ounces (Q4 2017: 226,800 ounces) due to
lower underground production delivered to the concentrator primarily due to the section 54 stoppage
following the fatal incident on 18 October 2018 and subsequent extensive retraining of employees, some
impact from Eskom load shedding, and an increase in absenteeism in the final quarter. Platinum production
decreased 16% to 96,500 ounces (Q4 2017: 114,800 ounces) and palladium production decreased by 16%
to 44,900 ounces (Q4 2017: 53,700 ounces).

Unki had a strong production performance, with PGM production increasing by 36% to 49,800 ounces
(Q4 2017: 36,600 ounces) due to a strong operational performance with a 20% increase in tonnes milled,
10% improvement in recovery and 3% improvement in built-up head grade. Platinum production increased
by 34% to 22,000 ounces (Q4 2017: 16,400 ounces) and palladium production increased by 38% to 19,600
ounces (Q4 2017: 14,200 ounces).

The acquisition of the remaining 50% of Mototolo was concluded on 1 November 2018, from which date
100% of its production became own mined production, contributing 38,300 PGM ounces, 17,500 platinum
ounces and 10,900 palladium ounces.


PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production (Mototolo to 31 October 2018, Modikwa and Kroondal) increased by 6% to
281,600 ounces (Q4 2017: 265,800 ounces). Platinum production increased by 6% to 126,200 ounces
(Q4 2017: 119,600) and palladium production increased 6% to 82,400 ounces (Q4 2017: 77,400 ounces).
This was driven by productivity improvements, improved plant recoveries and an increase in built-up head
grades. Production from joint ventures is split 50:50 between own mined production and purchase of
concentrate.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 32% to 439,700 ounces (Q4 2017: 334,200
ounces) due to concentrate purchased from Union mine following its sale to Siyanda in February 2018, as
well as including all purchased concentrate from BRPM following its sale. Platinum production increased by
31% to 231,700 ounces (Q4 2017: 177,400 ounces) and palladium increased by 31% to 110,700 ounces
(Q4 2017: 84,700 ounces).


Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production had a strong performance in Q4 2018, up 5% to 1,528,200 ounces (Q4 2017:
1,455,600 ounces). This was due to partially refining the build-up of work-in-progress inventory following
scheduled smelter rebuilds and maintenance at both Mortimer smelter and Polokwane smelters earlier in
2018, and the performance was up against a strong comparative quarter in Q4 2017 when additional work-
in-progress inventory was processed following the Waterval smelter run-out. Platinum refined production
increased 7% to 770,900 ounces (Q4 2017: 722,200 ounces), while palladium production was flat at 493,800
ounces (Q4 2017: 491,400 ounces).

PGM sales volumes (excluding refined metal purchased from third parties) was flat at 1,507,200 ounces
(Q4 2017: 1,511,800 ounces). However, platinum sales volumes increased by 8% to 776,900 ounces
(Q4 2017: 721,700 ounces) due to higher refined production, supplemented by a draw down in platinum
stocks. Palladium sales volumes decreased by 4% to 455,300 ounces (Q4 2017: 473,500 ounces).


2019 Outlook

PGM production outlook (excluding tolling material from Sibanye-Stillwater) for 2019 is between
4.2 - 4.5 million ounces, including platinum production of between 2.0 - 2.1 million ounces and palladium
production guidance of between 1.3 – 1.4 million ounces. Production guidance is down on 2018 due to the
transition of Sibanye-Stillwater material to a tolling arrangement in place of its concentrate purchased.
Purchased production from Sibanye-Stillwater in 2018 equated to 903,900 PGM ounces, including 464,100
platinum ounces and 231,800 palladium ounces. Refined production and sales volumes should increase as
the backlog of work-in-progress-inventory is processed in full during 2019.

Anglo American Platinum trading statement for the twelve months ending 31 December 2018

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ending 31 December 2018 (""the
period"") on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 18 February 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a
trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to
be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty, that due to an increase in
the rand basket price and improved operational delivery across the Company, headline earnings and
headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period will be at least 20% (R777 million or 297 cents per
share) higher than that reported for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 (""the comparative
period""). Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R3,886 million and 1,482 cents
respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") will also be at least 20% (R302 million or
149 cents per share) higher than the comparative period. Basic earnings and EPS for the comparative
period were R1,508 million and 741 cents respectively.

There is currently insufficient certainty to enable the Company to provide specific guidance on its
expected results and it is anticipated that Anglo American Platinum will publish a further trading
statement closer to the release of its annual financial results.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or
reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.

Anglo American Platinum completes disposal of 33% interest in the BRPM joint venture

Anglo American Platinum announces that all conditions precedent to the sale and purchase agreement
with Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (""RBPlat"") and Royal Bafokeng Resources Proprietary Limited
(""RBR"") have been fulfilled. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Rustenburg Platinum Mines
Limited (""RPM"") has therefore completed the disposal of its 33% interest in the Bafokeng Rasimone
Platinum Mine joint venture (""BRPM JV"") (the ""Transaction""), with effect from 11 December 2018
(""Completion Date"").

Accordingly, RBR took over full ownership of the operation on the Completion Date.

RPM will retain its right to purchase 50% of the BRPM JV concentrate for the life of mine, and RBPlat
will retain its termination right on the remaining 50% of the concentrate every five years, with the earliest
possible termination date being in August 2022.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented on the Transaction:

""Following the sell-down of RPM’s listed interest in RBPlat earlier this year, this completes RPM’s exit
from RBPlat and the BRPM JV.

The completion of the sale of RPM's 33% interest in the BRPM joint venture allows Anglo American
Platinum to further simplify its portfolio and focus its capital allocation into own-managed mines and
projects. Importantly, RPM will retain its right to purchase 50% of the BRPM JV’s concentrate for the
life of mine.

The Transaction allows RBPlat to increase its attributable resource and reserve base and furthers
empowerment in the PGM industry, with RBPlat fully owning and operating low cost, high quality assets
with attractive growth optionality at Styldrift.""

Purchase Consideration

The total purchase consideration is comprised of R1.863 billion, plus an additional R315 million
(approximately US$150 million in total), which equates to the repayment of RPM's contributions into the
BRPM JV since announcement of the Transaction.

The upfront purchase consideration was settled on the Completion Date by a cash payment by RBR of
R555 million (approximately US$40 million).

As outlined in the announcement made on 5 July 2018, the remaining purchase consideration will be
deferred and left outstanding on loan account and escalated at a rate equivalent to RBPlat’s borrowing
rate plus a premium of 2%. The deferred consideration will be paid in three equal tranches after 1.5
years, 2.5 years and 3.5 years from the Completion Date. RBPlat has the option to settle the outstanding
consideration either in cash or by the issue of additional RBPlat shares to RPM at each payment date.

Please also refer to the RBPlat announcement relating to the transaction dated 12 December 2018.

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the Anglo American plc briefing for investors and
analysts which includes updated production guidance for the next three financial years.

Anglo American Platinum’s production guidance will change from 1 January 2019 as Sibanye PGM
material will no longer be purchased as concentrate but toll treated, with the refined metal returned to
Sibanye. As a result, production (metal in concentrate) will be lower than 2018.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2018


OVERVIEW


• Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q3 2018

• Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) of 1,345,700 ounces increased
  3%, including platinum production of 649,000 ounces and palladium production of 410,800 ounces,
  due to improved operational performances across the majority of the portfolio, despite the removal
  of unprofitable ounces from Bokoni, which was placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017

• Own mined PGM production increased 2% to 567,600 ounces due to strong performances from Unki
  and Amandelbult

• Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) increased 12% to 314,400
  ounces due to a strong performance from Mototolo and Kroondal

• Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates was down 16% to 113,600 ounces primarily due to
  the closure of unprofitable production from Bokoni in Q3 2017

• Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 39% to 350,100 ounces due to
  production purchased from Union mine following its sale

• Refined PGM production decreased by 21% to 1,079,600 ounces, due to a planned partial furnace
  rebuild at Polokwane smelter in Q3 2018 which led to an increase in work-in-progress inventory.
  Commissioning of the Unki smelter commenced in Q3 and is progressing well

• PGM sales volumes decreased 16% to 1,208,900 ounces due to the increase in work-in-progress
  inventory, as a result of the partial furnace rebuild in Q3 2018


REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities, and reports zero fatalities
in the period. The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed
operations for the quarter improved significantly to 2.93 compared to 4.67 in Q3 2017, equating to a
37% improvement.

PGM PRODUCTION

Total PGM production was up 3% as improved operational performances across the majority of the
portfolio offset unprofitable production from Bokoni which was place on care and maintenance in
Q3 2017 (up 6% if Bokoni is excluded from the prior period). Platinum production increased 4% to
649,000 ounces and palladium production increased 1% to 410,800 ounces.

PGM production from own-managed mines

Own-managed mines PGM production increased by 2% to 567,600 ounces due to strong performances
from Unki and Amandelbult. Platinum production increased by 3% to 262,300 ounces and palladium
production increased by 1% to 204,100 ounces.

Mogalakwena PGM production decreased by 2% to 271,800 ounces, due to planned maintenance at
the concentrators which led to lower concentrator throughput and lower recoveries, partially offset by
higher built-up head grade. Platinum production decreased by 2% to 113,900 ounces and palladium
production decreased by 2% to 127,100 ounces as expected. In line with previous guidance,
Mogalakwena has experienced a decline in grade, and it is expected that this lower grade will continue
for the final quarter.

Amandelbult PGM production increased by 5% to 245,400 ounces, driven by continued operational
improvement that was supported by increased development at Dishaba as mining activities transition
to this section. Platinum production increased by 5% to 126,000 ounces and palladium production
increased by 4% to 57,300 ounces.

Unki PGM production increased by 14% to 50,400 ounces as a result of an increase in tonnes milled,
improvements in recovery and increased built-up head grade. Platinum production increased by 13%
to 22,400 ounces and palladium production increased by 15% to 19,700 ounces.

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production (Mototolo, Modikwa, Kroondal) increased by 12% to 314,400 ounces (of
which 157,200 ounces is own-mined production and 157,200 ounces is purchase of concentrate).
Platinum production increased by 14% to 141,200 ounces (of which 70,600 ounces is own-mined
production and 70,600 ounces is purchased concentrate). Palladium production increased by 9% to
92,200 ounces (of which 46,100 ounces is own-mined production and 46,100 ounces is purchased
concentrate). Mototolo PGM production was up 126% largely due to lower production in Q3 2017 as
the concentrator was temporarily stopped to carry out remedial work on the Helena Tailings facility.
Kroondal PGM production increased 3% due to increased production efficiencies and plant throughput.
Modikwa PGM production decreased 10% due to equipment unavailability and maintenance of
equipment underground.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from associates

Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates decreased by 16% to 113,600 ounces, due to the
closure of Bokoni which was placed onto care and maintenance in Q3 2017. Purchase of concentrate
from associates decreased by 9% for platinum to 66,700 ounces and 25% for palladium to 27,200
ounces. BRPM PGM production increased 14% to 113,600 ounces. Following the sale of Anglo
American Platinum’s stake in BRPM, production purchased will be categorised as third-party purchase
of concentrate from completion of the transaction in Q4 2018.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 39% to 350,100 ounces due to production
purchased from Union mine following its sale. Purchase of concentrate from third parties increased 40%
to 178,800 ounces for platinum and 31% to 87,300 ounces for palladium.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production decreased 21% to 1,079,600 ounces. Refined platinum production decreased
19% to 556,200 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 29% to 321,500 ounces.
Refined production was impacted by the planned partial furnace rebuild at Polokwane smelter during
August and September 2018. The partial rebuild was completed successfully, and the furnace has been
recommissioned and returned to full operating capacity. Commissioning of the Unki Smelter is
progressing well, and the first matte was tapped from the new smelter on 21 September 2018. Ramp-
up of the facility to full production is continuing.

PGM sales volumes, excluding refined metals purchased from third parties as part of our trading
activities, decreased 16% to 1,208,900 ounces. Platinum sales volumes decreased by 20% to 530,100
ounces while palladium sales volumes decreased by 30% to 324,300 ounces. Refined PGM sales
volumes were supplemented by a draw down in refined inventory.

Full year guidance

Due to strong operational performance across the portfolio, 2018 full year PGM production (metal in
concentrate) has been revised up to between 5.1 to 5.2 million PGM ounces (previous guidance of 4.85
to 5.1 million PGM ounces). This includes a revised platinum production guidance of 2.45 to 2.5 million
ounces (previous guidance of 2.4 to 2.45 million ounces) and a revised palladium production guidance
of 1.55 to 1.60 million ounces (previous guidance of 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces).


Mogalakwena production has been strong to Q3 2018 in part due to a high-grade area mined, largely
in H1 2018. This will normalise to an annual average of around 3.18g/t. However, due to strong
operational performance, PGM production guidance of 1.15 million ounces will include an upgrade to
platinum production guidance of around 490,000 platinum ounces (previously 480,000 platinum
ounces).

As a result of scheduled smelter rebuilds and maintenance at both Mortimer smelter and Polokwane
smelter, there has been an increase in work-in-progress inventory, of around 460,000 PGMs including
270,000 platinum ounces and 160,000 palladium ounces as at the end of the third quarter (relative to
normalised levels of inventory). The built-up work-in-progress inventory will not be refined in full by year
end, and therefore refined production guidance is lower than produced production. Full year refined
PGM production will be at the lower end of guidance of 4.85 to 5.1 million PGM ounces, including
platinum refined production of between 2.4 and 2.45 million ounces and palladium refined production
between 1.5 and 1.6 million ounces. The remaining built-up work-in-progress PGM inventory will be
processed in H1 2019, which will return to normalised levels.

PGM sales volume guidance for 2018 has been revised up to between 5.2 and 5.3 million ounces
(previous guidance of 4.85 to 5.1 million ounces), as a draw down in refined inventory has
supplemented sales volumes. Platinum sales volume guidance will remain between 2.4 and 2.45 million
ounces and palladium sales volume guidance will be at the lower end of guidance of between 1.5 and
1.6 million ounces.

for the six months ended 30 June 2018


1. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with and contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

The preparation of the Group's reviewed consolidated interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2018 was supervised by the Finance Director, Mr I Botha CA
(SA).

2. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial Reporting
Standards and are consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except as set out in note 3 below.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Impact of new standards issued and amendments to existing standards not yet effective
At 30 June 2018, the following new accounting standards and amendments to existing standards were in issue but not yet effective:

                                                                                                                         Effective for annual periods
New standards and amendments                                                                                             commencing on or after:

IFRS 16 Leases - removes the classification of leases as operating or finance leases and requires all                    1 January 2019
 leases to be brought onto companies' balance sheets.                                                                   (early application permitted if IFRS 15 is also applied)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments - addresses the determination of taxable profit                          1 January 2019
 (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty
 over income tax treatments under IAS 12 Income Taxes. It specifically considers:                                     

Whether tax treatments should be considered collectively.

Assumptions for taxation authorities' examinations.

The determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.

The effect of changes in facts and circumstances.

Annual improvements to IFRS 2015 - 2017 cycle makes the following amendments: IFRS 3 Business Combinations- requiring    1 January 2019
 the remeasurements of a previously held interest in a joint operation where control is obtained; IFRS 11 Joint
 Arrangements- clarifying that there is no remeasurement of previous interests upon obtaining joint control of a 
 business that is a joint operation; IAS 12 Income Taxes- clarifying that all income tax consequences of dividends 
 should be recognised in profit or loss regardless of how the tax arises; and IAS 23 Borrowing Costs- clarifying
 that a specific borrowing that remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for use, becomes part of general
 borrowings for purposes of interest capitalisation.                                                                  

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts - requires insurance liabilities to be measured at a current fulfilment value and            1 January 2021
 provides a more uniform measurement and presentation approach for all insurance contracts. These requirements are 
 designed to achieve the goal of consistent, principle-based accounting for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 supersedes
 IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts as of 1 January 2021.
                                   
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments In Associates and Joint Ventures -        To be determined
 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture deal with situations where 
 there is a sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associates or joint ventures.                                                                         

The above standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact for the Group, except IFRS 16 which is addressed below.

Impact of standards issued, effective and adopted by the Group
The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 January 2018. As reported previously, the adoption of these
standards has an immaterial impact for the Group. The IFRS 9 impact was the reclassification of one financial asset, with a value of R30 million on 1 January 2018,
from loans and receivables, along with all available-for-sale investments, to equity instruments irrevocably designated as at fair value though other
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) per note 14. There is no reclassification of fair value changes on available-for-sale investments as these are already in equity. The
IFRS 15 impact was only on reclassifying the deferred income liability to contract liability per note 20. Prior years were also reclassified, albeit with an
immaterial impact.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Impact of new standard issued and neither effective nor adopted by the Group
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance
leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions
are short-term and low-value leases.

The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group's operating leases and embedded leases in service contracts. The Group has decided to adopt the
modified retrospective transition approach such that the cumulative effect of transition to IFRS 16 will be recognised in retained earnings and the comparative
period will not be restated.

As at the reporting date, 30 June 2018, the Group has non-cancellable operating leases with a net present value of approximately R0.2 billion and embedded leases
with an estimated net present value of approximately R0.2 billion, which will be capitalised together with any new leases entered into post the reporting period.
Capitalisation will result in an increase in net debt and property, plant and equipment on 1 January 2019.

The standard is mandatory for first interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group does not intend to adopt the
standard before its effective date.

  spot metal price at the end of the reporting period applied to the ounces of metal obtained under such leasing arrangements.
2 The contract liability represents a payment in advance for metal to be delivered in six months time. An amount is received monthly on a rolling six-month basis
  over five years of the contract ending in March 2023. Cash and cash equivalents are held as a hedging instrument in respect of the foreign exchange risk of this
  liability. This was previously a deferred income liability and has now been reclassified as a contract liability on adoption of IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018.

23. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
This announcememt does not include information required pursuant to paragraph 15A(j) of IAS 34. The full interim report is available on the Company's website, at
the Company's registered office and upon request.

24. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Letters of comfort have been issued to financial institutions to cover certain banking facilities. There are no encumbrances over Group assets.
The Group is the subject of various claims, which are individually immaterial and are not expected in aggregate, to result in material losses.
The Group has provided guarantees to certain financial institutions to cover various metal borrowing facilities. At 30 June 2018 these guarantees amounted to
R1,235 million (30 June 2017: R1,177 million; 31 December 2017: R1,108 million).

The Group has, in the case of some of its mines, provided the Department of Minerals Resources with guarantees that cover the difference between the closure costs
and amounts held in the environmental trusts. At 30 June 2018, these guarantees amounted to R2,450 million (30 June 2017: R2,619 million; 31 December 2017: R2,398
million).

25. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE
Inventory
During the current period, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a physical count of in-process metals. The Group
runs a theoretical metal inventory system based on inputs, the results of previous counts and outputs. Due to the nature of in-process inventories being contained
in weirs, pipes and other vessels, physical counts only take place once per annum, except in the Precious Metals Refinery where the physical count is usually
conducted every three years. The Precious Metals Refinery physical count was conducted by exception in 2016 and is due to be performed again in 2019.

This change in estimate has had the effect of decreasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements by R485 million (30 June 2017: increase of
R942 million; 31 December 2017: increase of R942 million). This results in the recognition of an after tax loss of R349 million (30 June 2017: after-tax gain of
R678 million; 31 December 2017: after-tax gain of R678 million).

Rustenburg deferred consideration
The Group's sale of the Rustenburg Mine completed on 1 November 2016. The present value of the deferred consideration was recognised as a level 3 financial asset
at fair value through profit or loss. Remeasurements arising from changes in estimates of cash flows and discount rate as well as the unwinding of the discount are
included in interest income and expense. The estimated cash flows were revised in June 2018 after the finalisation of relevant financial information by the
purchaser. This has given rise to an increase of R268 million (post-tax) in the present value of the deferred consideration, and the recognition of a gain in profit
or loss which is included in headline earnings.

26. DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS
Union Mine and Masa Chrome
The Group concluded a binding sale agreement for its 85% ownership interest in Union Mine and its 50.1% ownership interest in Masa Chrome Proprietary Limited to
Siyanda Resources. The agreement was signed on 14 February 2017 and most of the critical conditions precedent were met on 1 December 2017. As of this date, it was
highly probable that the sale would be concluded within 12 months, such that the criteria for reclassification as held for sale, in terms of IFRS 5 Non-current
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, were met. An attributable post-tax impairment loss of R996 million was recognised for the year ended 31 December
2017. A further attributable post-tax impairment loss of R12 million was recognised in January 2018, presently partly in scrapping of assets and partly in the loss
on disposal in the statement of comprehensive income.

The sale was effective as of 1 February 2018. A post-tax loss on disposal of R811 million was recognised, and is excluded from headline earnings. This brings the
total loss, including previously recognised impairments to R1.8 million.

Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited
On 24 April 2018 the Group conducted an accelerated book build in respect of its shares in Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (RB Plat). 17 million shares were sold
at a price of R22.50 per share, which was at a discount to market price. The investment was irrevocably designated as at fair value through other comprehensive
income in terms of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments such that all gains and losses are recognised directly in equity and never recycled. This transaction consequently
had no earnings impact.

27. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS
Bokoni Holdco and associated loan
The Group has a c.23% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco. Both investments are equity accounted, with the investment in
Atlatsa previously fully impaired and subsequently reporting losses which have not been equity accounted.

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni Platinum Mine. The Group's equity interest continues to be fully impaired to
the extent that the balance is not otherwise reduced through equity accounted losses. During the first half of 2018, 49% of the funding provided to Bokoni mine for
care and maintenance (R50 million) was capitalised to the investment and reduced by equity accounted losses of an equal amount.

Atlatsa's ability to service its debt obligations in the context of the current market conditions, where Bokoni Platinum Mine is its main source of funding, is
doubtful. The Group has impaired all but R211 million in funding provided to Atlatsa. This resulted in an impairment loss for the period of R52 million, which is
included in headline earnings.

Bafokeng Ras'mone Platinum Mine (BRPM)
Due to a binding sale agreement that was signed on 4 July 2018 for the disposal of the Group's 33% interest in BRPM, see note 28, the equity-accounted BRPM
investment was impaired to the fair value of the transaction price (level 1 fair value) per the binding sale agreement. A post-tax impairment of R628 million 
has accordingly been recognised, and excluded from headline earnings.

28. POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
Disposal of 33% equity-accounted interest in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine
On 4 July 2018, the Group entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with a subsidiary of RB Plat for the sale of the Group's 33% interest in the
unincorporated BRPM joint venture. Owing to the signature of the SPA after the balance sheet date and the fact that certain approvals remain outstanding, the
investment was not classified as held for sale in terms of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The salient transaction terms are as
follows:
Initial purchase price to be settled in cash arising from a 5% capital raise by RB Plat, plus any capital contributions made by the Group to BRPM between the SPA
signature date and completion date. Deferred consideration for the remainder of the agreed R1.863 billion transaction price to be settled in three equal tranches
1.5; 2.5 and 2.5 years after the effective date, with early settlement permitted. The deferred consideration will escalate at the RB Plat cost of borrowing plus a 
premium of 2%. RB Plat has the option of settling the deferred consideration either in cash or by the issue of additional RB Plat shares to the Group at each
payment date.

Anglo Platinum ventures with Public Investment Corporation
On 17 July 2018, AP Ventures (APV) was launched as an independent venture capital fund to invest in Platinum Group metals (PGMs). AP Ventures is backed by Anglo
American Platinum Limited and South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC) who have committed a total of USD200 million, USD100 million each, as joint
partners. AAPL will sell its current Platinum Group Metals investments, valued at USD60 million, to APV as part of its contribution. APV is a joint venture, as the
parties require 75% of the voting power for decision making, and will be equity-accounted when the agreement becomes effective with AAPL's share of profit or loss
of APV recognised in profit or loss.

Dividend
The Board approved a dividend of R3.74 per share on 19 July 2018.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented:

""Anglo American Platinum has produced another strong set of operational and financial results. Our commitment to ensuring safe production has delivered value and
the Company continues to improve more profitable own-mine production, with total PGM production up 4%. We did however lose one of our colleagues to multiple bee
stings and again have sent our condolences to the friends, family and colleagues of Mr Maimela. Our focus will remain on the elimination of fatalities.

We've seen strong production from our operations, with the world-class Mogalakwena operation increasing production 19% in H1 2018. The turnaround plan at
Amandelbult is progressing and the joint venture portfolio had a strong performance, with record production from Mototolo and Kroondal. This strong production
performance, combined with strict cost control led to a further 3% decrease in unit costs.

Despite the temporary build up in work in progress inventory, due to maintenance and the scheduled Mortimer smelter rebuild in Q2, the Company generated operating
free cash flow of R1.3 billion, reducing net debt by R2.3 billion and moving to a net cash position of R0.5 billion.

We have been busy and in the last six months, announced a number of transactions. As part of the simplification of the portfolio, we have sold 8.8% of our equity
holding in Royal Bafokeng Platinum, and agreed the sale of our 33% interest in BRPM to them. In support of our strategic objective of growing demand for PGM's, we
have supported the launch of AP Venture funds, with the PIC, together committing USD200 million to stimulate demand for PGMs. Finally, to own and operate the best
assets, we have signed an SPA to acquire Glencore's 39% stake in the Mototolo JV, which will unlock significant synergies with Der Brochen.

Work is underway to extract value at existing operations through world best operating practices and modernisation, through people and innovation; and finally,
project studies continue to assess how to unlock the most value from Mogalakwena.

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to delivering PGM industry leading returns, and has increased EBITDA by 70% to R6.8 billion, resulting in an increase in
EBITDA margin to 21%; an increase in ROCE to 22% and the Board has declared an interim dividend of R1.0 billion. This is very much a stronger business today as a
result of the actions we have taken in recent years and I'm pleased to say that we see even more value that we can unlock ahead of us.""

STRATEGY

Anglo American Platinum's strategy over the past five years has focused on restructuring and repositioning the portfolio in response to structural changes in the
platinum group metals (PGM) industry. The execution of this strategy is essentially complete and has simplified and improved the business by reducing its operating
mines from eighteen to seven, decreased overheads by 50% and headcount by 60%, whilst maintaining PGM production. The portfolio is now positioned with 70% of
production in H1 of the primary industry cost curve (excluding BRPM), with PGM industry leading cost control outperforming input cost inflation, improved operating
free cash flows and delivering a return on capital employed of 22%. The balance sheet has been de-levered with net debt reducing from R14.8 billion in 2014, to a
net cash position of R0.5 billion in H1 2018, and a base dividend was reintroduced in 2017.

The next chapter of the strategy has been formulated with the view to maximise margins, returns and cash flows within a changing market and competitor landscape. We
continue to see material upside value in the Company, with work underway to quantify the potential from existing operations, and growth options of our world class
resources.

Value proposition

Anglo American Platinum has a differentiated value proposition through:

- The quality of our long-life assets from which we continually strive to extract full value;
- Demonstrated capital discipline that has resulted in balance sheet strength which enables flexibility to be responsive to opportunities through the cycle and
  withstand potential downward pressure; and
- Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the business by leading market development to grow demand for PGMs, progressing select prioritised project studies to
  ensure optionality is maintained, and by modernising our organisation.

The Company's focus is on driving the value and earnings of the business, by taking the operational performance of the operations to world best practice, investing
in growth optionality across the portfolio, and developing the market for PGMs.

Anglo American Platinum seeks to deliver these strategic priorities in a safe, values driven and socially responsible way.

Simplified mining portfolio

The quality and long life of our mineral assets are the foundation of our leadership position in the industry. We focus on operating and investing in the assets
that offer the most attractive long-term value creation potential, that are positioned in the lower half of the cash cost curve and that are, or have potential to
be mechanised.

We have further simplified the ownership structure of our mining portfolio, with greater direct influence over the asset operational performance as well as being
able to focus capital allocation to these assets. This will be achieved as the sales and purchase agreement was signed to acquire Glencore's interest in Mototolo,
enabling a seamless transition into Der Brochen. In addition, Anglo American Platinum has signed an SPA to dispose of the 33% stake in the BRPM JV to our joint
venture partners Royal Bafokeng Platinum. The non-strategic minority interest in the remaining 2.6% of the listed shares of Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited will be
sold following the sale of 8.8% in April 2018, which generated gross proceeds of R390 million.

Disciplined capital allocation

Our value-focused approach to capital allocation underpins our preferred portfolio by prioritising the following:

- Maintaining asset integrity, ensuring a strong balance sheet and paying base dividends to our shareholders;
- Discretionary capital allocation to the best value outcome, by investing in fast pay-back projects and profitable growth;
- Thereafter, capital will be allocated between further increasing balance sheet strength or additional returns to shareholders; and
- Disciplined value-added growth projects to enhance margins and additional returns

Anglo American Platinum has rebuilt its balance sheet to a net cash position, supported by strong underlying cash generation, despite the current pricing and global
economic environment. In line with the capital allocation framework, Anglo American Platinum continues to progress project studies to assess the expansion potential
at our key operations, Mogalakwena and Der Brochen and determine how we extract the most value from these assets, considering market and capital constraints.

Mogalakwena expansion

Mogalakwena remains the world's most significant PGM operation and the only major open-pit operation globally. The mine is in the lowest quartile of the primary PGM
producer cash cost curve, and as a palladium-rich resource, will benefit given the current and medium term structural deficits in the palladium market.

The project opportunity studies have identified that a third concentrator expansion at Mogalakwena will significantly improve the NPV of the asset, has value-
enhancing returns, with optimal value being achieved with a concentrator size of between 9-12 million tonnes per annum. This would lead to an incremental c.270,000
palladium ounces and c.250,000 platinum ounces. The concept and prefeasibility studies have commenced and the capital expenditure will be quantified once the
project studies have advanced further.

Mototolo / Der Brochen

As announced on SENS, Anglo American Platinum has signed an SPA with Glencore to purchase its 39% interest in the Mototolo joint venture.

The acquisition enables significant synergies between Mototolo and the adjacent Der Brochen resource, with project studies underway to assess the most valuable
options which could include both replacement and growth options, creating a major PGM hub for the Company. By combining the Mototolo JV area with the downdip and
adjacent Der Brochen resource, the life-of-mine is also significantly extended from the current c.five-year life of mine, to beyond a thirty-year life of mine.

Extracting full value from our assets

We are working to reset operational performance benchmarks across our business, recognising the further latent potential that exists in our operations,
notwithstanding the material improvements we have made over the last few years. Whether it's the hours one gets out of a truck or shortening the lost time between
shift changes or failures, or to completely re-think long established practices, Anglo American Platinum believes there is substantial additional value to be gained
by focussing on best practice benchmarks and further improvements through modernisation and technical innovation.

Developing the market for PGMs

Market development is a key priority where latent demand across jewellery, investment and industrial segments remains a large and growing opportunity.

The Company's Platinum Group Metals Development Fund has enjoyed great success and built a strong track record. We have now taken the decision to separate the
fund's activities into an independent structure, AP Ventures, which will attract additional outside investment allowing it to increase the scale of its activities.

The launch of AP Ventures is an exciting development which will support the growth of PGM technologies and is expected to increase PGM demand from the industrial
segment. Through this transaction, we are hoping to facilitate the application of cutting-edge technological advances and broad innovative thinking to address the
major global challenges. It is a clear example of the use of collaborative partnerships to connect people for the betterment of the industry and we are grateful to
have had the support of the Public Investment Corporation in bringing the Funds to fruition.

In addition, we continue to also drive PGM demand through:

Engaging and collaborating in the shaping of the strategy and activities of the Platinum Guild International (PGI), focusing on jewellery demand creation, and the
- World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), focusing on investment demand creation;
- Spearheading new initiatives which fall outside the mandates of the industry funded entities, by expanding and formalising an approach to primary R&D with the
  intention of developing PGM based solutions to global issues; identifying bottlenecks and barriers to increased use/sales of PGMs and developing solutions in
  partnership with AP Ventures funds, the PGI & WPIC; and
- Focus on fuel cell development and the hydrogen economy through advocacy, investment in refuelling infrastructure and anti-diesel lobbying.

SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT & SOCIAL INVESTMENT

Safety

Tragically there was one work related loss of life in H1 2018. Mr Johannes Maimela died of multiple bee stings at Dishaba Mine in March 2018, and our deepest
condolences go to Mr Maimela's family, friends and colleagues.

Management has committed to maintaining safe operations and the benefits of safe production are producing results. Safety indicators highlight the significant
improvements that have been made, with total recordable injury frequency rate (TRCFR) the lowest on record, down 42% to 2.93 per one million hours worked (H1 2017:
5.08). This can be attributed to the implementation of the revised safety, health and environment strategy and the focus on reporting and learning from high
potential incidents.

Health

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the fight against HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and the wellness of employees. The Company aspires to the UN targets of
90:90:90 with respect to HIV. These targets aim at diagnosing 90% of all HIV-positive persons, provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 90% of those diagnosed, and
achieve viral suppression for 90% of those treated. AAP achieved 80% ""know-your status"" and 86% on ART in 2017. The Company remains confident that by intensifying
efforts and encouraging the participation of employees at all levels of the organisation, these levels can further improve. Our HIV interventions, together with
parallel proactive TB interventions are contributing to a consistent reduction in TB incidence rates - reducing 53% to 271 per 100,000 and well below the national
average of 781 per 100,000. These efforts highlight the significant reduction in TB related deaths - reducing from over 60 in 2013 to 3 so far in 2018.

Environment

Anglo American Platinum has again had no major or material environmental incidents (categorised as Level 4 to 5), and has had no Level 3 incidents since 2013.
Through applying an operational risk management process and identifying critical controls to manage priority unwanted environmental events, the Company ensures that
environmental risk is appropriately managed. Minor environmental incidents are analysed and investigated to learn from, and implement remedial actions to prevent
repeats.

Rustenburg Base Metals Refinery (RBMR) and Precious Metals Refinery (PMR) are the key operations to remain ISO14001 certified as they are responsible for product
delivery and complying with external requirements. As a result, PMR was certified against the new ISO 14001:2015 standard in October 2017 and RBMR was certified in
June 2018. All other operations will focus on implementing the new ISO14001:2015 standards and best practice.

The Company continues to focus on reducing demand for fresh water and energy. Improving energy efficiency also drives reduced carbon emissions. The focus on water
efficiency depends on two key measures: technology to reduce total water demand; and reduced dependency on potable water to ensure water availability for
surrounding stakeholders. To minimise water usage at operations, non-potable or effluent water is the priority source.

Anglo American Platinum continues to make considerable progress in the management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste sent to landfill as a result of several
reduce, re-use and recycling activities. For the five months to end-May there was a 64% reduction in the total tonnes of waste to landfill compared to the same
period last year.

Social and community investment

We continue to engage with stakeholders as part of our mandate to enhance the social license to operate and endeavor to make a lasting positive contribution to
communities in which we operate. Several projects have been implemented as part of our commitment to social labour plans, including the signature of a service level
agreement with Hall Core Mapela to supply water to 42 villages of Mapela, which will deliver potable water to over 70,000 people. We are constructing administration
blocks and additional classrooms in four schools, completed water and sanitation facilities in eight schools, with another three schools under construction.

Food production remains a focus, and the communities in which we are delivering water projects are also encouraged to start food gardens. The Amandelbult, St George
and Kalkfontein farming projects are thriving and over 30 jobs are sustained on these farms. All our initiatives are contributing towards the achievement of the
National Development Plan of our Country and the Integrated Development Plans of the host Municipalities and are done in partnership with our stakeholders.

The Company has spent R86 million so far in H1 2018 on Social Labour Plan projects, equating to 2% of NOPAT, and in line with plan. This spend will more than double
by the year end.

JOURNEY TO OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

Operational performance

As a result of improved operational efficiencies across the own-managed mine portfolio, and strong performances from the joint venture portfolio, PGM production for
H1 2018 increased, despite the closure of unprofitable production from Bokoni and Maseve in H2 2017, which does not form part of H1 2018 production.

Total PGM production (expressed as platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, iridium and ruthenium metal in concentrate) was up 4% to 2,583,800 ounces in H1 2018 (H1
2017: 2,484,300 ounces). Platinum production was up 4% to 1,233,400 ounces (H1 2017: 1,189,100 ounces), while palladium increased 5% to 813,200 ounces (H1 2017:
774,900 ounces).

The 4E built-up head grade of 3.52g/tonne was 2% higher due to higher grade from Mogalakwena, which targeted a particularly high grade area at Zwartfontein pit, as
well as higher underground grades at Amandelbult.

Own managed mines

Own managed mines (Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and Unki) increased total PGM production by 14% to 1,166,700 ounces (H1 2017: 1,021,100 ounces). Platinum production by
own-managed mines increased 14% to 534,500 ounces (H1 2017: 467,900 ounces) and palladium increased by 15% to 434,600 ounces (H1 2017: 377,800 ounces).

Mogalakwena

Mogalakwena produced a record 641,400 PGM ounces up 19% (H1 2017: 538,600 PGM ounces), with platinum production up 21% to 272,900 ounces (H1 2017: 225,800 ounces)
and palladium up 18% to 295,500 ounces (H1 2017: 251,200 ounces). Total production included production from the Baobab concentrator plant of 48,700 PGM ounces (H1
2017: 39,100 PGM ounces).

Mogalakwena increased production through mining a higher-grade area within the current mining cut as per the mine plan, as well as optimisation of the North
concentrator plant which led to improved concentrator throughput and recoveries. Material was mined from the Zwartfontein pit which also contributed to higher
grade, but at a lower recovery. Total tonnes mined remained constant year-on-year, but tonnes milled increased 6% and the 4E built-up head grade increased 10% to
3.39g/t from 3.07g/t in H1 2017.

Mogalakwena contributed R2.1 billion in economic free cash flow, up from R812 million in H1 2017. The mine delivered EBITDA of R3.9 billion at a 45% margin, up from
37% in H1 2017. Return on Capital Employed increased to 29% from 16% (on an annualised basis).

Cash operating costs (costs after allowing for off-mine smelting and refining activities) increased 9% to R4.7 billion. Cash operating costs including capitalised
waste stripping increased by 14% to R5.4 billion from R4.7 billion.

Cash operating costs per platinum ounce decreased 10% to R17,224 from R19,122 in H1 2017 owing to increased mining volume. Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal
in concentrate) was R7,328 against R8,018 per ounce in H1 2017.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) (includes operating costs as defined above, all sustaining capital expenditure, capitalised waste stripping and allocated marketing
and market development costs net of by product revenue) per platinum ounce sold was USD253 per platinum ounce, down from USD687 per platinum ounce in the previous
period.

During 2018, improvements in mining efficiencies and concentrator performance resulted in mine plan changes, causing differences between the sequencing of ore and
waste mining. Improvements in shovel and truck performances resulted in an increase in waste tonnes mined, the bulk of which was capitalised waste. This led to a
decrease in ore mined over the period and coupled with higher milled volumes, resulted in the drawdown from ore stockpiles (which were previously guided to
increase). The net impact from these changes for H1 2018 was a 6% increase in unit costs for Mogalakwena.

The current mining profiles are expected to continue in H2 of 2018 which will result in an overall higher unit cost for the mine for 2018 compared to 2017, which
was lower due to the benefit of measuring R1.6billion of ore stockpiles. The revised medium term mine plan will enable greater minng of ore and will reduce overall
unit costs in future years.

Mogalakwena targeted a high-grade area in the Zwartfontein pit, which led to an increase in grade in H1 2018. This will normalise in H2 2018 which will result in an
annual average of grade 3.18g/t. High grade production was planned for H1 2018, to get early ounces prior to the planned smelter rebuilds in Q2 and Q3 2018. Total
production from Mogalakwena in 2018 is expected to be approximately 1.15 million PGM ounces (around 480,000 platinum ounces).
Amandelbult

Total PGM production at Amandelbult increased by 9% to 432,700 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 397,500 PGM ounces). Platinum production increased 8% 220,200 ounces (H1 2017:
203,700 ounces) and palladium production increased 10% to 102,900 (H1 2017: 93,600 ounces).

Production increased due to the implementation of the operational turnaround of the asset. The immediately stopeable ore reserves (IMS) at Dishaba have increased
and productivity improvements have been implemented.

As development at Dishaba continues, surface tonnes supplement underground production, and led to a 5% increase in tonnes milled. Despite the increased surface
sources in the ore mix, the 4E built-up head grade increased 3% to 3.91 g/t (H1 2017: 3.81 g/t) due to increases in both underground reef ore sources (UG2 and
Merensky) and as a result of reduced dilution.

Production from the chrome plant increased by 46%, yielding 403,000 tonnes of chrome concentrate on a 100% basis (H1 2017: 276,000 chrome tonnes). This is in part
due to 8% increase in plant feed as well as the chrome interstage implementation, increasing the plant yield to 16%. (H1 2017: 12%). Amandelbult is moving towards
a primarily UG2 mine. The chrome recovery capacity is being extended to the Merensky Concentrator by construction of two further modules at a capex cost of R530
million, which will be commissioned in July 2019, and will result in an incremental 360,000 tonnes of chrome production per annum.

Despite a fall in the chrome price during H1 2018 to an average of USD200/tonne, from an average of USD242/tonne in the comparative period, the increased volume and low
production cost enabled the Amandelbult chrome operation to generate attributable economic free cash flow of R409 million (H1 2017: R261 million).

Amandelbult delivered R159 million in economic free cash flow from its mining and chrome activities, up from negative R541 million in H1 2017. The mine delivered
EBITDA of R1.0 billion at a 17% margin, up from 3% in H1 2017. Return on Capital Employed increased to 16% from negative 5%.

Cash operating costs increased by 10% to R4.8 billion (H1 2017: R4.4 billion), mainly due to mining inflation, chrome plant operational costs and costs relating to
the future replacement of production from Tumela Upper to Dishaba Lower UG2. Cash operating costs per platinum ounce was flat year-on-year at R21,701 (H1 2017
R21,596) owing to higher volume. The measurement of run-of-mine ore stockpiles at Amandelbult as at 30 June 2018, resulted in a 2% reduction in unit cost for the
mine.

Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was R11,041 against R11,070 per ounce in H1 2017. AISC per platinum ounce sold was USD891 per ounce, down
from USD1,183 in the previous year.

Total production from Amandelbult in 2018 is expected to increase to between 900,000 to 9 240,000 PGM ounces (c.460,000 - 470,000 platinum ounces).

Unki

Unki mine in Zimbabwe produced a record 92,600 PGM ounces, an increase of 9% (H1 2017: 85,100 ounces). Platinum production increased 8% to 41,400 ounces (H1 2017:
38,400 ounces) and palladium production increased 10% to 36,200 ounces (H1 2017: 33,000 ounces).

Production increased due to an increase in tonnes milled, up 6% due to improved throughput and recovery. The 4E built-up head grade stayed relatively flat at
3.47g/t (H1 2017: 3.48g/t).

Unki increased economic free cash flow to R311 million from R85 million due to improved performance and the sale of treasury bills of R100 million.

The mine delivered EBITDA of R424 million at a 33% margin, up from 21% in H1 2017. Return on Capital Employed increased to 11% from 2% in H1 2017.

Cash operating costs were up 6% to R0.9 billion. The mine, being a dollar denominated operation, benefitted from the strengthening of the rand which increased 6% to
R12.38 from R13.24. Cash operating costs increased by R35 million as ore stock ahead of the concentrator, which was built-up during maintenance at the concentrator
in H2 2017, was depleted in full in H1 2018. Cash operating cost per platinum ounce rose 2% to R23,477 from R22,967 in H1 2017.

Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was R10,511 against R10,360 per ounce in H1 2017. AISC (excluding the receipts of treasury bills) per
platinum ounce sold was USD272 per ounce, down from USD808 in H1 2017.

The Unki smelter, a project in execution, is expected to be completed in Q3 2018 at a total cost of R650 million, with R162 million of the project capital incurred
in H1 2018.

Total PGM production from Unki in 2018 is expected to increase slightly to 180,000 PGM ounces (previously 170,000 PGM ounces) including c.80,000 platinum ounces
(previously 75,000 ounces).

Joint ventures (own-mined and purchase of concentrate)

Total PGM production from joint ventures (Mototolo, Modikwa and Kroondal inclusive of both own-mined and purchase of concentrate production) increased 10% to
607,200 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 550,100 PGM ounces). Platinum production increased 11% to 274,300 ounces (H1 2017: 246,600 ounces) and palladium production increased
10% to 177,000 ounces (H1 2017: 161,500 ounces).

Mototolo PGM production increased 26% to 157,200 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 124,800) due to higher built-up head grade and additional production rolled over from H2 2017
which was toll-treated at Bokoni due to the tailings dam rehabilitation. Platinum production increased 25% to 72,600 ounces (H1 2017: 57,800 ounces) and palladium
production increased 30% to 45,500 ounces (H1 2017: 35,100 ounces).

Modikwa PGM production increased 6% to 158,000 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 149,700 ounces) due to additional ore purchased from Mototolo. Platinum production increased 9%
to 62,800 ounces (H1 2017: 57,800 ounces) and palladium production increased 2% to 58,100 ounces (H1 2017: 56,700 ounces).

Kroondal PGM production increased 6% to 292,000 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 275,700 ounces), due to an increase in underground production efficiencies as well as improved
concentrator throughput. Platinum production increased 6% to 138,900 ounces (H1 2017: 131,000 ounces) and palladium production increased 5% to 73,500 ounces (H1
2017: 69,700 ounces).

Purchase of concentrate from associates

PGM production from associates decreased by 28% to 183,100 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 254,800 ounces), largely due to the removal of unprofitable production from Bokoni
which was placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017. Platinum production from associates decreased by 22% to 106,500 ounces (H1 2017: 137,200 ounces) and palladium
production decreased 37% to 43,800 ounces (H1 2017: 69,400 ounces).

BRPM PGM production increased 6% to 183,100 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 173,000) following improved underground mining efficiencies and the ongoing ramp up of the
Styldrift project. Platinum production increased 7% to 106,500 ounces (H1 2017: 99,300 ounces), and palladium production increased 5% to 43,800 ounces (H1 2017:
41,500 ounces).

On 5th July 2018, Anglo American Platinum announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its 33% interest in the BRPM JV to RB Plat. When conditions precedent
are complete, material from BRPM will be treated as third party purchase of concentrate and not as a purchase of concentrate from associates.

Purchase of concentrate from third parties

Union mine was sold to Siyanda Resources (""Siyanda"") on 1 February 2018, from which date Union production was treated as third party purchase of concentrate. As a
result, PGM production decreased 85% to 23,100 PGM ounces, and platinum and palladium decreased by 85% to 11,600 ounces and 5,200 ounces respectively.

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 20% to 603,800 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 503,300 PGM ounces) due to an increase in purchased production from
Union mine. This is despite a reduction in production from Sibanye Stillwater down 5% to 445,100 PGM ounces and a reduction in production from Maseve which was
placed on care and maintenance in Q4 2017. Platinum purchase of concentrate increased 18% to 306,500 ounces (H1 2017: 259,800 ounces) and palladium purchase of
concentrate increased 17% to 152,600 ounces (H1 2017: 130,300 ounces).

Refined production & sales volume

Refined PGM production decreased by 5% to 2,177,200 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 2,294,100 PGM ounces). Platinum refined production decreased 3% to 1,075,300 ounces (H1
2017: 1,105,600 ounces), and palladium refined production decreased 6% to 686,500 ounces (H1 2017: 726,500 ounces).

Refined production in H1 2018 was lower due to the removal of unprofitable production from Bokoni and Maseve, which were both placed on care and maintenance in H2
2017 (H1 2017: 84,600 PGM ounces and 41,000 platinum ounces).

In addition, refined PGM production for H1 2018 was lower than M&C production (including c.140,000 platinum ounces) as work-in-progress inventory was built up. This
was due to the planned rebuild of Mortimer smelter which was completed during H1 and scheduled maintenance on the processing assets. It is expected that the backlog
of work-in-progress inventory will largely be processed by the year end despite the planned partial rebuild of Polokwane Smelter in Q3 2018, the commissioning of
the Unki smelter in Q3 2018, which will marginally increase pipeline inventory, and commissioning of the Convertor Plant Phase A module (ACP).

As per normal practices, the annual stock count was completed in H1 2018 which resulted in the first net stock loss since 2010, impacting mainly palladium and
rhodium. As a result, PGM refined production for 2018 will be lower than metal in concentrate production.

PGM sales volumes from mining increased by 3% to 2,508,800 PGM ounces (H1 2017: 2,432,600 PGM ounces). Platinum sales volumes (excluding trading activities) were
constant at 1,117,100 ounces (H1 2017: 1,119,300 ounces) and palladium sales volumes increased by 15% to 733,500 ounces (H1 2017: 636,200 ounces).

Total sales volumes were made up of refined production, supplemented by drawing down on refined inventory levels of c.41,000 platinum and 47,000 palladium ounces.
In addition to sales from mining activities, trading activities of c.66,000 platinum ounces and 53,000 palladium ounces took place during the period. Refined
inventory is expected to be built up in H2 2018 and return to normalised levels which will impact sales volumes.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

H1 2018 overview

The Company has had a strong financial performance in H1 2018 with a 70% increase in EBITDA to R6.8 billion with group EBITDA margin increasing to 21% (H1 2017:
15%). Headline earnings increased to R3.4 billion from R0.7 billion reported in H1 2017 and headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 1,282 cents increased 350%
compared to H1 2017 (285 cents) due to the Company's improved operational performance and improvement in the rand basket price for the period.

The balance sheet position has strengthened substantially, with a net cash position of R0.5 billion at 30 June 2018, a R2.3 billion improvement from a net debt
position of R1.8 billion at 31 December 2017. The improvement was after a cash dividend to shareholders of R0.9 billion and was driven by free cashflow from
operations of R1.3 billion, as well as R0.9 billion of net proceeds on asset sales (including R0.4 billion from the disposal of Union mine and R0.4 billion from the
sale of shares in RB Plat). The customer prepayment increased by R1.1 billion due to the impact of a weaker rand at the end of H1 2018 compared to 31 December 2017
as well as higher palladium and rhodium prices, bringing the total customer prepayment to R5.7 billion.

Disposals and acquisitions

On 1 February 2018, the sale of the Company's 85% interest in Union Mine to Siyanda Resources became effective. The Group realised an attributable, after tax loss
on disposal of R0.8 billion, which together with prior impairments recognised brings the total attributable, after tax loss on divesting from this operation to R1.8
billion. The loss on disposal is excluded from headline earnings.

Anglo American Platinum continues to fund Bokoni mine's care and maintenance expenditure. R52 million in impairment losses were recognised in respect of funding
Atlatsa's 51% share and is thus not an impairment of assets but a loan write off, which is included in basic and headline earnings.

On 24 April 2018, the Company disposed of 17.3 million shares in RB Plats for R0.4 billion. There was no earnings impact as the investment was classified at fair
value through other comprehensive income.

On 6 July 2018, Anglo American Platinum entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement with RB Plat for the sale of the Company's 33% interest in the BRPM JV.
The sale is inter alia subject to RB Plat shareholder and lender approval, and the investment was accordingly not classified as held-for-sale at 30 June 2018.
Approximately R0.2 billion of the transaction price will be settled in cash, upfront, with the remainder to be settled in three equal tranches, attracting interest,
and commencing 18 months after the effective date. The deferred amount may be settled in cash or in the equivalent value of RB Plat shares. Owing to the signing of
the binding sale and purchase agreement, the Group impaired its equity-accounted investment in BRPM by R0.6 billion (post-tax) to bring it in line with the
transaction price. This impairment is excluded from headline earnings.

Sales revenue

Net sales revenue rose 23% to R33.5 billion from R27.3 billion in the first half of 2017 on the back of higher palladium, rhodium and chrome sales volumes due to
the ramp-up of the new chrome plant at Amandelbult. The US dollar basket price was 26% higher at USD2,318 per platinum ounce sold compared to USD1,843 in
H1 2017. The sales price achieved on all metals improved, except for platinum at USD932 per ounce (H1 2017: USD957). Palladium was up 29%, rhodium up 113%, nickel
up 41% and copper up 16%. The rand strengthened to an average of R12.38 (H1 2017: R13.24), eroding some of the price benefit, which resulted in a 18% higher rand
basket price of R28,695 per platinum ounce sold (H1 2017: R24,400).

Cost of sales

Cost of sales increased by 17%, from R24.5 billion in H1 2017 to R28.6 billion mainly due to higher purchase of concentrate costs, driven by higher prices as well
as the purchase of metals for trading activities, while the planned rebuild and maintenance of processing assets takes place. Following the sale of Union operations
in February 2018, the Company has higher purchase of concentrate costs and lower on-mine costs due to the purchase of concentrate from Siyanda.

Cash on-mine costs (mines and concentrators) decreased by R0.3 billion mainly due to the Union exit, partly offset by input cost inflation and higher tonnes milled
at Mogalakwena. Processing costs rose R0.4 billion to R3.4 billion, a 12% increase due to inflationary increases, higher insurance costs and coal price increases.

Costs for the purchase of concentrate increased to R12.9 billion from R9.6 billion, principally due higher metal prices and additional volumes purchased from
Siyanda following the sale of Union, offset by no volumes from Bokoni since being placed on care and maintenance.

Other costs increased 24% to R1.6 billion (H1 2017: R1.3 billion), primarily due to higher costs of transporting metal (R0.1 billion) given the increased volume of
chrome concentrate produced and increased royalties as a result of higher revenue (R0.2 billion).

Owing to a change in mining approach, run-of-mine ore stockpile material to the value of R1.8 billion was measured at 31 December 2017. The ore stockpile material
has increased marginally at 30 June 2018, impacting cost of sales by R0.1 billion.

Through higher production, especially from Mogalakwena, unit costs are down 3% at R19,571 per produced platinum ounce (H1 2017: R20,105). Unit cost of PGM
production was R8,954 per ounce, 3% lower than the prior year (H1 2017: R9,265 per ounce). AISC of USD829 per ounce (H1 2017: USD1,036 per ounce) against an
achieved platinum price of USD932 per ounce reflects stringent cost management, higher by-product revenue and operational efficiencies.

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)

Reported EBITDA increased 70% to R6.8 billion from R4.0 billion in the first half of 2017. The movements in EBITDA were due to:
- Uncontrollable items, including inflation, US dollar metal prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate, improving earnings by R2.0 billion, with stronger metal
  prices of R3.6 billion, partially offset by inflation contributing R0.6 billion and a stronger rand R1.0 billion.
- Controllable items - volume and costs - contributed R0.6 billion. Costs reduced mainly due to the disposal of Union, partially offset by the impact of a R0.5
  billion stock-count loss compared to a R0.9 billion stock count gain in H1 2017. EBITDA further benefitted from Bokoni being placed on care and maintenance and the
  disposal of Pandora both in Q4 2017 resulting in lower cost incurred for associates (R0.2 billion).

The Company EBITDA margin was 21%, up from 15% in H1 2017. The EBITDA margin for own mining operations was 34% (H1 2017: 22%), on mined portion of joint ventures
23%, normalised for the Helena tailings dam flow through from 2017 (27% actual) (H1 2017: 23%), while the margin on purchased concentrate was 11% (H1 2017: 11%).

Capital expenditure

Disciplined capital allocation remains a priority, aimed at maintaining asset integrity and adding value, not additional volume.

Capital expenditure for the first half of 2018, excluding capitalised interest and waste stripping, rose by R0.5 billion to R1.8 billion (after adjusting for the
ACP insurance proceeds of R0.3 billion) from R1.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Stay-in-business capital expenditure increased by R0.2 billion to R1.4 billion,
focused on safety-critical and business continuity projects, including heavy mining equipment replacement and the planned maintenance of processing assets,
including the Mortimer Smelter rebuild. Our focus is to invest in low capex, fast-payback, value-accretive projects. Project capital was R0.2 billion higher at R0.4
billion, relating to the Unki smelter, Amandelbult chrome plants and Mogalakwena concentrator optimisation project.

Waste tonnes mined decreased from 34Mt in H1 2017 to 33Mt in H1 2018 and the cost of mining 15Mt was capitalised (H1 2017: capitalisation of 10Mt). As a result,
capitalised waste stripping increased from R0.4 billion in H1 2017 to R0.6 billion in H1 2018.

Project and stay-in-business capex is forecast to be within 2018 guidance of between R4.7 billion and R5.2 billion. The increase reflects a once-off stay-in-
business project for SO2 abatement at the Polokwane and Mortimer smelters to be incurred between 2018 and 2023 (R2.5 billion) to achieve global benchmark emissions
standards and South African legal requirements. Capitalised waste stripping is expected to be around R1.4 billion, above previous guidance of R1.1 billion as a
result of increased waste tonnes mined due to improved truck and shovel efficiencies.

Working Capital

We continue to focus on optimising our working capital levels. Trade working capital has been actively managed down from R13.3 billion (75 days) at the beginning of
2016 to R6.2 billion at the end of 2017, representing a 26-day working capital cycle. Trade working capital at 30 June 2018 was R5.4 billion (33 days), a R0.8
billion decrease due to improved debtors collection (R0.3 billion) and higher trade creditors (R1.9 billion) due to purchases of concentrate from Siyanda and the
impact of higher prices on purchases of concentrate cost and an increase in customer prepayment of R1.1 billion. This was partially offset by a build-up in work-
in-progress material as planned maintenance takes place at processing assets, partially offset by a reduction in refined metal.

Platinum and palladium work-in-progress inventory has increased from around 467,000 ounces and 379,000 ounces at end of 2017 to levels of 628,000 ounces and 467,000
ounces respectively at the end of the first half of 2018. In H1 2018, we had a stock count loss of R0.5 billion (H1 2017: stock count gain of R0.9 billion), with
the benefit of a 26,000-ounce platinum stock count gain valued at R0.2 billion, being offset by stock count losses of 16,000 palladium ounces, 19,000 rhodium ounces
and 3,000 tonnes of nickel valued at R0.7 billion.

Net debt and liquidity

During the first half of the year, we made further progress in strengthening the balance sheet. The Company ended with a net cash position of R0.5 billion compared
to R1.8 billion net debt at the end of 2017, after the payment of a R0.9 billion dividend and despite the work-in progress build-up. The reduction was supported by
free cash flow from operations of R1.3 billion, R1.1 billion from the customer prepayment and R0.9 billion net proceeds on asset sales, including R0.4 billion from
the disposal of Union operations and R0.4 billion from the sale of the Company's 8.8% shareholding in RB Plat.

Excluding the customer prepayment of R5.7 billion (which is settled in metal), net debt is R5.2 billion and net debt to EBITDA is 0.4. Liquidity headroom is at
R22.5 billion, comprising both undrawn committed facilities of R13.3 billion and cash of R9.2 billion, and the Company is very comfortably within its debt
covenants.

Dividend

In accordance with the Company's capital allocation framework to distribute a base dividend of 30% of headline earnings for each reporting period, the Board has
declared an interim cash dividend of R3.74 per share, which is equivalent to a 30% headline earnings pay-out ratio or 3.3x dividend cover. The dividend is
applicable to shareholders on the register on 10 August 2018 and payable on 13 August 2018.

PGM MARKET REVIEW

Prices

The USD-based market platinum price ended H1 2018 at USD849 per ounce, down 8% year-on-year (H1 2017: USD921). The market palladium price was up 11% to USD953 per ounce
(H1 2017: USD858) and the market rhodium price up 117% to USD2,250 per ounce (H1 2017: USD1,035).

Platinum

The average achieved platinum price in H1 2018 declined by 3% compared to H1 2017 in US Dollar terms. Platinum underperformed the other platinum group metals due to
a modest surplus and weak sentiment driven by a soft Chinese jewellery market and a decrease in the share of the diesel engine in Europe's light duty vehicle
market.

Total platinum supply is expected to remain largely unchanged year-on-year in 2018. Primary production of platinum is forecast to decline marginally in 2018 to 6.05
million ounces, partly driven by the impact of mine closures in South Africa during 2017. Secondary supply of platinum is forecast to increase by 80,000 ounces due
to growth in autocatalyst recycling volumes, although this will be partially offset by lower volumes of platinum jewellery recycling in China.

Platinum demand is expected to fall slightly in 2018. Investment demand is predicted to fall by about 100,000 ounces to more normal levels of 250,000 ounces in 2018
and autocatalyst demand is forecast to weaken by the same amount. This will be driven by lower platinum demand from the European diesel light-duty vehicle sector,
where the diesel engine's share in new vehicle sales is declining markedly. However, this will be partially offset by higher demand from the global heavy duty
diesel vehicle sector. Platinum demand from the glass, petroleum and chemical sectors should increase year-on-year in 2018. This combination of slightly lower
demand, modestly lower primary production and a marginal increase in secondary supply should see a small surplus of 315,000 ounces.

Palladium

The average palladium market price in H1 2018 of USD1,005 per ounce was over USD200 higher than the average price in H1 2017. Growing demand for palladium from the
automotive sector has tightened the market over the past couple of years and known inventories of palladium have fallen. The market deficit was estimated at 800,000
ounces in 2017 and palladium is expected to remain in a deficit of around 250,000 ounces in 2018.

Palladium supply from the largest producer of the metal, Russia, is expected to increase year-on-year in 2018 as sales more closely match overall mine production.
Global primary palladium supply may be augmented by additional Russian material and could increase 500,000 ounces to 6.9 million ounces in 2018. Secondary supply
from autocatalyst recycling is anticipated to increase by about 200,000 ounces year-on-year.

Palladium demand is strong with particularly firm growth from the autocatalyst sector, which accounts for approximately 80% of global palladium demand. Demand from
this sector is expected to increase 175,000 ounces year-on-year to 8.6 million ounces in 2018, largely offsetting the increased recycling volumes. However, ETF and
other investment flows were negative in 2017 and are forecast to be negative again in 2018.
The tight market, with deficits of supply versus demand, should continue to support higher palladium prices. The impact of US and China trade tariffs and sentiment
may result in some volatility in the price.

Rhodium

Rhodium has performed very strongly in H1 2018, with the average market price rising by 103% to a 7-year high of USD1,938 per ounce (H1 2017: USD911). Both primary and
secondary production of the metal are expected to increase slightly in 2018. Speculative investment demand for rhodium has driven a higher price in 2018 and
stronger automotive demand is likely to support a higher price going forward.

Minor metals

Ruthenium and iridium prices increased to multi-year highs in H1 2018. Ruthenium climbed to an average of USD221 per ounce (H1 2017: USD48) and iridium rose to an
average of USD1,054 per ounce (H1 2017: USD804), with the prices of each metal driven higher by strong industrial demand in Asia.

Automotive

Global light duty vehicle (LDV) sales are forecast to grow by 2.3% year-on-year to 98 million units in 2018 (source: LMC Automotive Global Light Vehicle Sales
Update). Modest year-on-year growth is forecast in Europe and China, and a small decline is expected in North America. Palladium and rhodium are used in the
catalytic converters of gasoline vehicles and will benefit from global vehicle growth, while platinum is the dominant PGM in exhaust after treatment for diesel
vehicles.

The diesel engine's share of LDV sales in Europe has fallen from an average of nearly 45% in H1 2017 to under 40% in H1 2018, driven primarily by concerns over
potential banning of older diesel vehicles in European cities. However, platinum demand from the automotive sector worldwide is only expected to fall by 100,000
ounces between 2017 and 2018. Offsetting the decline in light vehicles in Europe, diesel LDV sales outside of Europe are expected to increase by 200,000 units;
strong demand is also expected from the heavy-duty vehicle sector (HDV). Globally, the share of HDVs fitted with PGM containing catalyst systems is expected to rise
above 60% and grow rapidly over the medium term as increased emissions legislation in China and India encourages the fitment of more PGM containing catalysts.

The outlook for palladium and rhodium demand is quite positive for the next few years, despite only moderately strong vehicle sales growth. Tighter emissions
standards and higher light duty vehicle production are forecast to support palladium and rhodium demand from 2019 onwards. With the palladium price having traded
above that of platinum since September 2017, the question of substituting platinum for palladium in gasoline or three-way catalytic converters comes into play.
While research suggests that substitution in some of these catalysts is possible, automotive companies have yet to respond to the changing price environment in this
way. It is unlikely that there will be any meaningful progress in replacing palladium with platinum in gasoline autocatalytic converters before 2020, although it is
likely this will occur at some point.

Battery electric vehicles make up less than 2% of light vehicle sales in most countries and have made only nominal inroads on PGM demand. However, while still
small, the electric vehicle sector continues to grow and increasing numbers of automotive producers are looking at introducing electric options for vehicles they
sell. It is estimated that demand for platinum from the fuel cell electric vehicle sector was less than 20,000 ounces in 2017 but this will continue to grow. As
with battery electric vehicles, China is leading the way in developing the fuel cell electric vehicle sector and is aiming to have 50,000 fuel cell vehicles on the
road by 2025 and one million vehicles by 2030.

Hybrid electric vehicle sales are growing more rapidly than battery electric or fuel cell electric vehicle sales. PGM loadings on hybrid vehicles are currently
about the same as their internal combustion engine equivalents and so a shift to hybrid powertrains does not represent a negative impact on PGM demand.

Industrial

Gross industrial demand for platinum is expected to increase by about 60,000 ounces in 2018. This will be driven by stronger demand from the chemical and electrical
sectors.

In contrast, gross industrial demand for palladium is expected to fall back by about 2%, or 50,000 ounces this year. This will be led by weaker demand from the
chemical industry as well as further thrifting of palladium in the dental and electronic sectors. Industrial demand for rhodium is also expected to fall this year
due to lower purchases of the metal by the glass and chemical sectors.

Jewellery

Global gross demand for platinum from the jewellery sector fell slightly in 2017. This decline was driven by weak demand from China, where platinum jewellery
manufacturing fell approximately 10% in 2017, the fourth consecutive year of falling demand. Platinum jewellery demand in China has come under pressure from slower
economic growth and a move to higher margins at a retail level. Nevertheless, platinum gem-set and bridal jewellery sales are still strong in the country. Demand
for platinum from the Chinese jewellery sector is forecast to fall again in 2018 but there is scope for it to stabilise from 2019 onwards, driven by growth in Tier
3 and 4 cities and continuing work on improving retail margins.

There were more positive performances elsewhere, for instance from a strengthening Indian market. In contrast to China, Indian platinum jewellery demand underwent
robust growth in 2017, with demand 15% higher year-on-year and further growth should be seen this year. Elsewhere, modest growth is expected in the European and US
platinum jewellery sectors.

Investment

Net investment demand for platinum is expected to be 250,000 ounces in 2018, about 100,000 ounces lower than in 2017. There were net inflows of metal into ETFs in
2017, encouraged by periods of relative price weakness in US Dollar terms. So far this year, ETF flows have been close to neutral but the US Mint has sold 23,000
ounces of platinum Eagles, suggesting that underlying demand for platinum as an investment continues. Work by the WPIC continues to improve availability and demand
for physical products. Partnerships with the likes of Bullion Vault and the Royal Mint have helped to stimulate additional physical demand in a number of countries.

Net disinvestment of palladium occurred in 2017 and this is expected to occur again in 2018 despite the metal's healthy fundamentals as investors continue to sell
into price strength. At the start of 2018, profit taking resulted in some heavy selling by ETFs as the palladium price moved above USD1,000 per ounce. Palladium ETF
holdings have fallen by roughly 300,000 ounces year-to-date to only 950,000 ounces.

Market outlook

The platinum market is likely to remain in a small surplus in the next few years, with supply outweighing demand. In contrast, the palladium market will probably
remain in a deficit, primarily as a result of strong demand from the automotive sector, potentially supporting a strong palladium price.

Automotive platinum demand looks set to remain weak, and this is not expected to be completely offset by rising industrial demand for the metal. Investment demand
is dependent on price movements and on price volatility but should be positive, aided by market development. Primary supply of platinum is expected to decline
modestly and there is only limited potential for growth in recycling of platinum from the autocatalyst, electrical and jewellery sectors.

The number of gasoline vehicles produced is expected to grow and, in conjunction with tighter emissions legislation, this means that palladium demand from the
automotive industry is likely to rise again year-on-year in 2018 and in the following few years. It is unlikely that there will be any meaningful progress in
replacing palladium with platinum in gasoline catalytic converters in the next 24 months, although it is likely this will occur at some point. As with platinum,
mine production of palladium should stay relatively unchanged year-on-year in 2018 and in the next few years, although some previously-mined material may come to
market this year. There will be about 8% growth in secondary supply of palladium from greater volumes of catalytic converter recycling, but nevertheless, palladium
should remain in a deficit even if disinvestment of physical palladium continues.

Growing demand from the automotive sector will support higher demand for rhodium going forward in a relatively illiquid market. Ruthenium and iridium demand is also
likely to remain healthy.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY

The Reviewed Mining Charter (MCIII)

Anglo American Platinum notes the publication of the draft 2018 Mining Charter by the Minister of Mineral Resources on 15 June 2018. All parties have until the end
of August to respond to the draft, following the decision by the Minister of Mineral Resources to extend the public consultation period. Anglo American is preparing
its submission in respect of the draft 2018 Mining Charter.

Anglo American Platinum shares the acknowledgement made by the Minerals Council that the draft 2018 Mining Charter is an improvement on the draft 2017 Mining
Charter. However, Anglo American Platinum has concerns surrounding several significant issues in the draft charter that it believes may affect the sustainability of
the mining industry in South Africa, should they not be reconsidered.

Anglo American Platinum has consistently affirmed its support for the Government's national transformation objectives in relation to the mining industry and
acknowledges its role in promoting transformation in South Africa. Correspondingly, Anglo American Platinum has a longstanding track record of driving and
supporting transformation in the mining industry and beyond, while contributing significantly to South Africa's economic growth and development.

Anglo American Platinum believes that more work needs to be done, in consultation with all stakeholders, to create a Mining Charter that promotes both investment
for the long term and transformation. We look forward to the ongoing discussions with the Minister, the Department of Mineral Resources and other industry
stakeholders to work towards this.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT

During this period, the sale of the Company's 85% attributable interest in Union was finalised, and as a result there will be a decrease in the Inclusive Mineral
Resource estimates as disclosed in the 2017 integrated report.

MANAGEMENT CHANGES

Indresen Pillay has resigned as Executive Head of Projects and Safety, Health and Environment as of August 2018. A process is underway to find his successor.

Vishnu Pillay will retire as Executive Head of Joint Ventures and Exit Operations as of 31 December 2018.

OUTLOOK

Operational outlook

Due to a strong operational performance in H1 2018, Anglo American Platinum revises up its production outlook for the full year. PGM production guidance (metal in
concentrate) will be 4.85 - 5.10 million PGM ounces (from 4.75 to 5.00 million ounces), including platinum ounces of 2.40 - 2.45 million ounces (from 2.35 - 2.40
million ounces).

Mogalakwena production increased in part due to the high-grade area mined in H1 2018. This will normalise to an annual average of 3.18g/t, resulting in a forecast
production for 2018 of 1.15 million PGM ounces (around 480,000 platinum ounces).

Platinum refined production and sales volumes will be in line with production as the backlog of work-in-progress inventory built up will be refined by year end. PGM
refined production and sales volumes will however be lower than production overall, as the 2018 stock count identified a loss of work-in-progress inventory,
particularly impacting palladium and rhodium.

Financial outlook

The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with volatility in metal prices and exchange rates expected to continue. Management's efforts to reposition the
portfolio, taking out loss-making ounces, implementing strict cost control and focussing on operational efficiencies should enhance margins and generate sustainable
cash flow. Unit cost is expected to be inline with previous market guidance of R19,600-R20,200 per platinum ounce produced. Capital discipline will continue, with
capital expenditure guidance remaining between R4.7 billion to R5.2 billion, of which R3.9 billion to R4.2 billion will be on sustaining capex to maintain asset
integrity and meet compliance requirements.

(""Anglo American Platinum"" or “the Company"")

Anglo American Platinum acquires Glencore’s 39% interest in the Mototolo joint
venture

Introduction

Anglo American Platinum announces that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rustenburg Platinum Mines
Limited (“RPM”), has signed a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) with Glencore Operations South
Africa Proprietary Limited (“Glencore”) to purchase its 39% interest in the Mototolo joint venture
(“Mototolo JV”) (the “Transaction”).

The Mototolo JV is currently operated as a 50/50 joint venture between Anglo American Platinum and
a partnership between Glencore (39%) and Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited (“KTH”) (11%).

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented on the Transaction:

“The acquisition of Glencore’s stake in the Mototolo JV increases Anglo American Platinum’s interest
in a mechanised, low-cost, high quality resource, creating another major PGM hub for the Company.
The Transaction unlocks significant optionality for the Company in its wholly-owned Der Brochen
resource.”

About Mototolo JV

The Mototolo operation is 30km west of Burgersfort in Limpopo in the Eastern Limb of the Bushveld
complex and operates under a mining right covering 9km2.

Rationale for the Transaction

The acquisition of Glencore’s interest in the Mototolo JV better positions Anglo American Platinum as
the majority owner of a high-quality, fully mechanised operation. The Transaction will secure significant
infrastructure for Anglo American Platinum, allowing for value-enhancing optionality between the
Mototolo JV area and the adjacent wholly owned Der Brochen resource, creating a major PGM hub for
the Company. By combining the Mototolo JV area with the downdip and adjacent Der Brochen resource,
the life-of-mine is also significantly extended from the current c.5 year life of mine, to well in excess of
a 30 year life of mine.

Purchase Consideration

The consideration for the Transaction comprises an upfront cash payment, which at 30 June 2018 is
estimated to be R0.8 billion on a cash free basis and an additional consideration, which will be settled
monthly over a six-year period and will be determined based on the Rand PGM prices over the Mototolo
JV life of mine. While the additional consideration is not yet determinable it is estimated to be c.R1
billion (cumulative nominal) based on current spot prices. The total Purchase consideration will be
capped at R22 billion.
Conditions precedent

The Transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent, including Competition Commission
approval. The effective date of the Transaction is expected to be in Q4 2018.

Value of Transaction net assets and attributable profits

As at the Company’s year ended 31 December 2017, the value of the net assets, excluding cash
pertaining to the Transaction assets was R0.7 billion. The losses attributable to the Transaction assets
was R3 million, impacted by the temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator.

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction constitutes a Category 2 transaction for the Company and, as such, shareholder
approval is not required.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDING 30 JUNE 2018


OVERVIEW

• Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q2 2018

• Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) of 1,294,700 ounces, including
  platinum production of 619,600 ounces and palladium production of 406,000 ounces was flat year
  on year, due to improved operational performances across the portfolio, despite the closure of
  unprofitable ounces from Bokoni, which was placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017

• Own mined PGM production increased 11% to 586,300 ounces due to continued exceptional
  performance from Mogalakwena, supported by strong performances from Amandelbult and Unki

• Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) increased 7% to 309,200 ounces
  due to a strong performance from Kroondal supported by processing of ore stockpile from Mototolo

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities, and reports zero fatalities
in the period. The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed
operations for the quarter improved significantly to 2.90 compared to 3.91 in Q2 2017.

PGM PRODUCTION

Total PGM production was flat, as improved operational performances across the portfolio offset the
closure of unprofitable production from Bokoni in Q3 2017. Platinum and palladium production
increased marginally to 619,600 ounces and 406,000 ounces respectively

PGM production from own-managed mines

Own mined PGM production increased by 11% to 586,300 ounces due to continued exceptional
performance from Mogalakwena, supported by strong performances from Amandelbult and Unki.
Platinum production increased by 12% to 270,600 ounces and palladium production increased by 11%
to 215,600 ounces.

Mogalakwena PGM production increased by 15% to 313,800 ounces, driven by higher grade, an
increase in concentrator throughput and higher recoveries. Platinum production increased by 17% to
133,400 ounces and palladium production increased by 14% to 145,100 ounces.

Amandelbult PGM production increased by 6% to 225,700 ounces, driven by continued operational
improvement that was supported by increased development at Dishaba as mining activities transition
to this section. Platinum production increased by 7% to 116,300 ounces and palladium production
increased by 5% to 52,200 ounces,

Unki PGM production increased by 8% to 46,800 ounces, due to increased concentrator throughput
and recoveries. Platinum production increased by 7% to 20,900 ounces and palladium production
increased by 11% to 18,400 ounces.

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production (Mototolo, Modikwa, Kroondal) increased by 7% to 309,200 ounces (of
which 154,600 ounces is own-mined production and 154,600 ounces is purchase of concentrate).
Platinum production increased by 8% to 139,300 ounces (of which 69,600 ounces is own-mined
production and 69,600 ounces is purchased concentrate). Palladium production increased by 6% to
90,200 ounces (of which 45,100 ounces is own-mined production and 45,100 ounces is purchased
concentrate). This was driven by a strong production performance from Kroondal, supplemented by
continued processing of ore stockpiles built up at Mototolo following the temporary closure of the
concentrator in Q3 2017.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from associates

Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates decreased by 31% to 92,600 ounces, due to the closure
of Bokoni which was placed onto care and maintenance in Q3 2017. BRPM PGM production increased
1% to 92,600 ounces. Purchase of concentrate from associates decreased by 25% for platinum to
54,300 ounces and 39% for palladium to 22,000 ounces.
Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased by 17% to 306,500 ounces due to production
purchased from Union mine following its sale. Purchase of concentrate from third parties increased 16%
to 155,500 ounces for platinum and 15% to 78,100 ounces for palladium.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production increased marginally to 1,159,600 ounces. Refined platinum production
increased by 8% to 572,700 ounces, despite a planned smelter rebuild at Mortimer smelter in Q2 2018.
Prior period refined production was adversely affected by the planned Waterval Number 2 smelter
rebuild, as well as the high-pressure water leak at the converter plant.

Refined palladium production decreased by 2% to 366,700 ounces owing to a stock count loss that
largely impacted palladium (16,900 ounces) and rhodium (22,600 ounces).

PGM sales volumes, excluding refined metals purchased from third parties as part of our trading
activities, increased 9% to 1,386,000 ounces. Platinum sales volumes increased by 6% to 636,400
ounces while palladium sales volumes increased by 23% to 405,300 ounces as refined production was
supplemented by a draw down in refined inventory. The refined inventory is expected to return to
normalised levels in H2 2018.

Full year guidance

Following the strong quarter production, full year PGM production guidance has been revised by up to
4.85-5.10 million ounces, including 2.40-2.45 million platinum ounces. Palladium production guidance
remains at 1.5 - 1.6 million palladium ounces.

Mogalakwena production increased in part due to the high-grade area mined in H1 2018. This will
normalise to an annual average of 3.18g/t, resulting in a forecast production for 2018 of 1.15 million
PGM ounces (around 480,000 platinum ounces).

(“The Company"" or ""Anglo American Platinum"")

Anglo American Platinum commits to $200 million (c. R2.6 billion) venture capital funds
managed by AP Ventures LLP focused on increasing demand for PGMs

Anglo American Platinum announces that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anglo Platinum Marketing
Limited (“APML”), has subscribed for interests in two UK based venture capital funds (the “Funds""), with
a total aggregate commitment of $100 million (equivalent to c. R1.3 billion). Anglo American Platinum’s
commitment to the Funds is matched by a $100 million commitment from South Africa’s Government
Employees Pension Fund represented by the Public Investment Corporation SOC Ltd.

The Funds will be managed through an independent fund management business, AP Ventures LLP,
led by two experienced former APML executives. The Funds have been established to invest globally
in companies which support the development of innovative and competitive technological uses of
Platinum Group Metals (“PGMs”). The first Fund will hold certain of APML’s existing investments which
have been made under APML’s PGM Investment Programme (the “Programme”). The second Fund
will be established to make new investments.

Developing the market for PGMs has been a long-standing strategic priority for Anglo American
Platinum, having established the Programme in 2009. Through the Programme, Anglo American
Platinum committed US$10m, ring-fenced for local RSA beneficiation, to provide start-up capital to
entities that use PGM-based technology in their products and processes. As the market developed, the
Programme’s size and mandate expanded, adopting a direct funding approach to leverage networks
and attract third party funding, making US$60 million of early stage and growth capital investments.

Commenting on Anglo American Platinum’s decision to spin the Programme off to independent
management, CEO Chris Griffith said,

“Developing the market for PGMs is a strategic priority for Anglo American Platinum and this investment
with AP Ventures is a key initiative. Having enjoyed success and built a strong track record as part of
Anglo American Platinum’s PGM Investment Programme we have taken the decision to separate the
fund’s activities into an independent structure that will attract additional outside investment and allow
AP Ventures to increase the scale of its activities.

The launch of AP Ventures is an exciting new development which will support the growth of PGM
technologies and increase PGM demand. Through this transaction, we are hoping to facilitate the
application of cutting-edge technological advances and broad innovative thinking to address mining’s
major challenges. It is a clear example of the use of collaborative partnerships to connect people for
the betterment of the industry and we are grateful to have had the support of the Public Investment
Corporation in bringing the Funds to fruition.”

Dr Daniel Matjila, Chief Executive Officer: Public Investment Corporation said: “Through our investment
in the independent AP Ventures Fund, the PIC is funding technology innovation and furthering demand
for PGMs, which will ensure the industry has a sustainable future. As a leading global institutional
investor, this investment further demonstrates our support of the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. My view is this investment will stimulate and sustain the demand for PGMs in the
long term, benefitting our clients and preserving the long-term mineral wealth for all South Africans. In
addition, the potential for localisation of these technologies in South Africa, contributes to sustaining
jobs in the PGM mining sector and planning for creation of jobs in the manufacturing sectors. The PIC
is already a significant investor in the platinum mining industry and regards the long-term sustainability
of the industry as being critical to long-term returns of its portfolios.”

AP Ventures will invest in pioneering technologies and businesses harnessing the high-performance
characteristics of PGMs to address global challenges such as renewable energy integration, resource
scarcity and a growing population. This includes: hydrogen infrastructure; fuel-cell electric mobility;
energy storage platforms; water purification; sensors; durable electronics; and medical devices.

Updated Trading Statement for the six months ended 30 June 2018

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (“the period”) on
the Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 23 July 2018.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s trading statement released on SENS on 29 June 2018 in
which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the
period were expected to be at least 20% (R150 million or 57 cents per share, respectively) higher than
for the comparative reporting period for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (“comparative period”) and
that basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period were also expected to be at
least 20% (R238 million or 91 cents per share, respectively) higher than for the comparative period.

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the period are likely to increase to
between R3.275 billion and R3.415 billion (compared to the comparative period figure of R747 million),
and to between 1,249 cents and 1,302 cents per share (compared to the comparative period figure of
285 cents) respectively.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to increase to a profit of between R2.040 billion and
R2.270 billion (compared to the comparative period figure of a loss of R1.187 billion) and to a profit of
between 778 cents and 866 cents per share (compared to the comparative period figure of a loss of
453 cents) respectively.

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is due to improved operational
performance of the Company and improvement in the rand basket price for the period.

In addition, in the comparative period, the Company had attributable post tax-impairments totalling
R2.2 billion impacting basic earnings of which R283 million impacted both basic and headline earnings.
The impairments that impacted basic earnings only included Union mine of R911 million, equity interests
in BRPM of R952 million and Bokoni Platinum Holdings of R45 million. The impairments that impacted
basic and headline earnings include the write down of a term loan to Atlatsa and a loan to the Bakgatla
Ba-Kgafela Community related to their interest in Union.

Basic earnings in the current period are impacted by an impairment of R0.6 billion (post-tax) relating to
the disposal of the 33% holding in the BRPM JV to Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited and a loss of
R0.8 billion (post-tax) on finalisation of the disposal of Union Mine and Masa Chrome, while benefiting
from an insurance receipt of R0.2 billion (post-tax) in respect of property damage suffered at the
Convertor Plant (ACP) in 2017. Both basic and headline earnings benefit from a revaluation gain on the
deferred consideration in respect of the sale of the Rustenburg Mines of R0.3bn (post tax).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

Anglo American Platinum accepts an offer from Royal Bafokeng Platinum to purchase its 33%
interest in the BRPM joint venture

Anglo American Platinum confirms that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rustenburg Platinum Mines
Limited (“RPM”) has accepted an offer from Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (""RBPlat"") to purchase
its 33% interest in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine joint venture (“BRPM JV"") for a total purchase
consideration of R1.863 billion (approximately US$135 million) (the ""Transaction""). RPM entered into a
sale and purchase agreement (""SPA"") on 4 July 2018 with RBPlat’s wholly-owned subsidiary Royal
Bafokeng Resources Proprietary Limited (“RBR”).

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the Transaction:

“Anglo American Platinum has accepted an offer from Royal Bafokeng Platinum for our 33% interest in
the BRPM JV, whilst retaining the BRPM JV purchase of concentrate.

The Transaction allows RBPlat to increase its attributable resource and reserve base in BRPM, and
furthers empowerment in the PGM industry with RBPlat fully owning and operating low cost, high quality
assets with attractive growth optionality at Styldrift.

The disposal of interest in the BRPM JV will allow Anglo American Platinum to focus its capital allocation
into its own-managed mines and projects.”

Rationale for the Transaction

Exiting the BRPM JV allows Anglo American Platinum to focus its capital into its own-managed mines
and projects rather than into non-managed operations where it holds minority interests.

Anglo American Platinum will retain its right to process 50% of the BRPM JV concentrate for the life of
mine, and RBPlat will retain its termination right on the remaining 50% of BRPM JV concentrate every
five years, with the earliest termination being in August 2022.

Purchase Consideration

The purchase consideration of R1.863 billion will be increased by any capital contributions RPM makes
in respect of its 33% interest in the BRPM JV between signing of the SPA and completion of the
Transaction, such that RPM effectively ceases contributing into the BRPM JV from the signature date
of the SPA.

The upfront purchase consideration will be settled on the completion date of the Transaction
(""Completion Date"") by a cash payment by RBR equivalent to the proceeds RBPlat raises through a
5% capital raise of its shares in issue (""Capital Raise"") amounting to c.R200 million at current market
prices, plus any capital contributions made by RPM to the BRPM JV between signing of the SPA and
the Completion Date.
Any portion of the purchase consideration remaining will be deferred and left outstanding on loan
account and escalated at a rate equivalent to RBPlat’s borrowing rate plus a premium of 2%.

The deferred consideration will be paid in three equal tranches after 1.5 years, 2.5 years and 3.5 years
from the Completion Date. RBPlat has the option to settle the outstanding consideration either in cash
or by the issue of additional RBPlat shares to RPM at each payment date. RBPlat can early settle any
part of the deferred consideration in cash within the payment period.

The purchase consideration will be used by Anglo American Platinum for capital at its own-managed
mines and projects.

Conditions Precedent

The Transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions precedent by no later than
31 December 2018:
    • RBPlat shareholder approval;
    • RBPlat lenders approval; and
    • RBPlat implementing and completing the Capital Raise and receiving the proceeds of such
        capital raise.

The effective date of the Transaction is expected to be in Q3 2018.

Anglo American Platinum refers its stakeholders and shareholders to the announcement released by
RBPlat on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) (“SENS”) on 5 July 2018,
regarding the Transaction.

Anglo American Platinum trading statement for the six months ending 30 June 2018

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ending 30 June 2018 (“the period”) on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 23 July 2018.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a
trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to
be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty, that due to improved
operational delivery across the Company and a marginally higher achieved rand basket price, headline
earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the period will be at least 20% (R150 million or
57 cents per share) higher than that reported for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (“the comparative
period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R747 million and 285 cents
respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) will also be at least 20% (R238 million or 91 cents
per share) higher than the comparative period due to impairments in the comparative period. Basic
earnings and EPS for the comparative period were a loss of R1,187 million and a loss of 453 cents
respectively.

There is currently insufficient certainty to enable the Company to provide specific guidance on its
expected results and it is anticipated that Anglo American Platinum will publish a further trading
statement closer to the release of its annual financial results.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or
reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.

LAUNCH OF SECONDARY ACCELERATED PLACING OF UP TO 12.7 MILLION ROYAL
BAFOKENG PLATINUM LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES

1. Accelerated Placing

Anglo American Platinum hereby announces its intention to conduct an accelerated placing of up to
12,729,858 ordinary shares in Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (“RBPlat”) (the “Placing Shares”) to
qualifying investors only (the “Placing”), subject to acceptable pricing being achieved.

The Placing Shares constitute approximately 6.50% of the total number of RBPlat's ordinary shares in
issue as of 31 December 2017.

Shareholders are advised that the Placing will neither constitute a Category 1 nor a Category 2
transaction as per the JSE Listing Requirements for Anglo American Platinum.

Anglo American Platinum has agreed to a 90-day lock-up period, subject to customary exceptions and
waiver by the Sole Bookrunner.

2. Background to the Placing

On 24 April 2018, RBPlat announced the contribution of the Maseve Plant to the Bafokeng Rasimone
Platinum Mine Joint Venture (“BRPM JV”). Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (“RPM”), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Anglo American Platinum, and RBPlat, in their capacity as partners in the BRPM
JV, have entered into a contribution agreement whereby RPM will contribute R233,094,531 (exclusive
of value added tax), to be settled in cash, to fund its share of the aggregate value of the Maseve Plant.

3. Use of Proceeds

Anglo American Platinum continues to view the BRPM JV as a strategic investment. Anglo American

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY


Anglo American Platinum tragically had one loss of life in Q1 2018. Mr Johannes Maimela, a 42-year-
old tyre fitter, lost his life on 12 February 2018 following an attack by a swarm of African bees at the
Amandelbult open-pit operations. Our deepest condolences go to his family, friends and colleagues. An
independent and comprehensive investigation is under way to understand the circumstances and learn
from them to create a safer work environment for all.
The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed operations for
the quarter improved significantly to 2.67 compared to 5.48 in Q1 2017.

PGM PRODUCTION


Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) of 1,289,200 ounces, increased 8%
due to to improved operational performances across the portfolio. Total platinum production increased
7% to 613,800 ounces and total palladium production increased 9% to 407,400 ounces.

PGM production from own-managed mines


Own mined PGM production (Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki and excluding Union for prior year
comparison) increased 18% to 580,400 ounces due to an exceptional performance from Mogalakwena
and supported by increased production from the other own mined operations. Platinum production was
up 17% to 363,900 ounces, and palladium up 19% to 219,000 ounces.

Mogalakwena PGM production increased by 23% to 327,600 ounces as a result of targeting higher-
grade areas in Q1, and optimisation to the North Concentrator Plant leading to an increase in
concentrator throughput. Concentrator recoveries also increased 5% due to the higher feed grades and
improvements in stability. Platinum production increased by 25% to 139,400 ounces and palladium
production increased by 22% to 150,500 ounces. Base metal production decreased due to lower base
metal content in the North pit.

The Mogalakwena built-up head grade of 3.34g/t is due to targeting a high-grade area in the North pit,
which will normalise in H2 2018 to around 3.18g/t. High grade production was planned for Q1 2018, to
get early ounces prior to the planned smelter rebuilds in Q2 and Q3 2018.

Amandelbult PGM production increased by 12% to 207,000 ounces due to improved underground
efficiencies and higher grades. Platinum production increased 9% to 103,900 ounces, and palladium
was up 16% to 50,700 ounces. Chrome production from Amandelbult increased 45% as the spiral plant
has reached steady state, as well as improved yield.


Unki PGM production increased 9% to 45,800 ounces due to an increase in tonnes milled off the back
of availability of ore stockpiled ahead of the concentrator following planned maintenance to the mill feed
silo at the concentrator. This was completed in December 2017. Platinum and palladium production
increased 9% to 20,600 ounces and 17,800 ounces respectively.

Other mined production


Union mine was sold to Siyanda Resources (“Siyanda”) on 1 February 2018, after which Union
production was treated as third party purchase of concentrate. As a result, PGM mined production at
Union decreased by 70% to 23,000 ounces, with mined platinum production down 69% to 11,600
ounces and mined palladium production down 70% to 5,200 ounces.
Total chrome production for Anglo Platinum reduced due to the sale of Union mine and MASA Chrome,
which contributed one month of chrome production, to Siyanda.

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)


Total joint venture PGM production increased 14% to 298,000 ounces. Platinum and palladium
production increased 14% to 135,000 ounces and 86,900 ounces respectively.


PGM production at Mototolo increased by 38% to 84,700 ounces due to improved stoping efficiencies,
leading to improved built-up head grade, supported by additional processing of ore stockpiles that had
built-up following the temporary closure of the Helena Tailings Dam facility in Q3 2017. The ore stockpile
was also toll-treated through Bokoni contributing to the year-on-year increase. Platinum production
increased 37% to 38,900 ounces and palladium production increased by 44% to 24,700 ounces.


Modikwa PGM production increased by 16% to 77,100 ounces due to improved stoping efficiencies and
plant recoveries, as well as due to purchasing ore stockpile concentrate from Mototolo. Platinum
production increased by 21% to 31,200 ounces and palladium production increased by 11% to 28,000
ounces.

Kroondal PGM production increased by 1% to 136,200 ounces due to operational efficiency
improvements. Platinum production increased 2% to 64,900 ounces and palladium production
increased by 1% to 34,200 ounces.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from associates


Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates declined 25% due to the closure of unprofitable ounces
from Bokoni which was placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017 (platinum down 19% to 52,300
ounces, palladium down 34% to 21,700 ounces). PGM production from BRPM increased by 12% to
90,500 ounces due to the ramp up of the Styldrift project, in line with expectations, (platinum production
up 13% to 52,300 ounces and palladium production up 11% to 21,700 ounces).

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties


Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased 23% to 297,300 ounces due to an increase
in purchased production from Union mine following the sale to Siyanda Resources. Purchase of
concentrate increased 20% for both platinum, to 151,000 ounces, and palladium, to 74,500 ounces.

Refined production and sales volumes


Refined PGM production decreased 11% to 1,017,500 ounces primarily due to planned maintenance
at the ACP causing downtime of 16 days, and a Section 54 stoppage affecting Waterval Smelter in
December 2017, following the loss of life incident, and impacting production through into January 2018.
Furthermore, Q1 2017 refined volumes were unusually high following the 2016 Waterval Smelter run-
out backlog being treated, in addition to normal production volumes. Refined platinum production
decreased by 13% to 502,600 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 10% to 319,800
ounces.
There are planned smelter rebuilds of Mortimer smelter in Q2 2018 and Polokwane smelter in Q3 2018,
resulting in a work-in-progress inventory increase in H1 and Q3, which will hopefully be processed in
full by the year-end.


PGM sales volumes were in line with the prior year at 1,151,600 ounces. Platinum sales volumes
decreased by 4% in line with the reduction in refined production to 500,500 ounces and palladium sales
volumes increased by 10% to 336,200 ounces.

Full year guidance


Following the strong quarter production, full year production guidance is expected to be at the top end
of the guidance range of 4.7 - 5.0 million PGM ounces, including 2.30 - 2.40 million platinum ounces
and 1.5 - 1.6 million palladium ounces.


Refined production and sales volumes will be in line with production, but lower than 2017, which had
the Waterval smelter run-out backlog and 2017 stock count gain which equated to c.200,000 PGM
ounces including 100,000 platinum ounces of additional refined production that year.

Anglo American Platinum Final Dividend Declaration

The Board is pleased to advise that at its meeting held on 15 February 2017, the directors adopted a
pay-out ratio driven dividend policy, which is in accordance with the Company’s capital allocation
framework and in line with our commitment to sustainably return cash to shareholders through the cycle,
whilst retaining a high level of balance sheet strength.

At that meeting, the directors approved the declaration of a final gross cash dividend of 349 cents per
share on the ordinary shares from profits accrued during the six months ended 31 December 2017. The
dividend has been declared from retained earnings.

The dividend will be subject to a dividend withholding tax of 20% for all shareholders who are not exempt
from or do not qualify for a reduced rate of withholding tax. The net dividend payable to shareholders
subject to withholding tax at a rate of 20% amounts to 279.20 cents per share.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 269,681,886 ordinary shares and the Company’s tax
number is 9575104717.

Information reported to the Executive Committee of the Group for purposes of resource allocation and assessment of
segment performance is done on a mine-by-mine basis.

Changes to the segmental information
The following change to the segmental reporting was made following changes to internal reporting to the Executive
Committee:

Following the move to more detailed reporting on purchase of concentrate activities, Amandelbult has been changed to
exclude metal purchased from third parties. Also the results for toll refining activity has been moved from purchase
metal to other. These changes led to a corresponding change in the results for purchased metal.

This resulted in the following changes to the comparative figures:

12. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
The Group concluded a binding sale agreement for its 85% ownership interest in Union Mine and its 50.1% ownership
interest in Masa Chrome Proprietary Limited (Masa) to a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources Proprietary Limited (Siyanda).
The agreement was signed on 14 February 2017 and most of the critical conditions precedent were met on 1 December 2017,
such that the sale was highly probable of being concluded within 12 months. Accordingly, the criteria for
reclassification as held for sale in terms of IFRS 5 Non-current Asset Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations were met
as of 1 December 2017.

The disposal was in accordance with the Group's portfolio repositioning strategy. The two ownership interests are
classified as a single disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5.

The fair value less cost to sell on reclassification was negative R259 million, and was determined using the upfront
consideration of R400 million receivable in cash, deferred consideration based on 35% of cumulative positive
distributable free cash flows paid annually discounted using a rate of 10% over a period of 11 years and a purchase of
concentrate (POC) liability of R931 million which comprises a purchase price adjustment. The deferred consideration
receivable is a level 3 fair value of nil. This resulted in an attributable, post-tax impairment loss of R996 million.

There were no transfers between the levels during the year.

Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values
Level 2 fair values for other financial liabilities relate specifically to forward foreign exchange contracts and fixed
price commodity contracts.

The valuation of forward foreign exchange contracts is a function of the ZAR:USD exchange rate at balance sheet date and
the forward exchange rate that was fixed as per the forward foreign exchange rate contract. Fixed price commodity
contracts are valued with reference to relevant quoted commodity prices at period end.

Level 2 fair values for trade and other payables relate specifically to purchase of concentrate trade creditors which
are priced in US dollar. The settlement of these purchase of concentrate trade creditors takes place on average three to
four months after the purchase has taken place. The fair value is a function of the expected ZAR:USD exchange rate and
the metal prices at the time of settlement. The Level 2 fair value of liabilities for the return of metal is determined
by multiplying the quantities of metal under open leases by the relevant commodity prices and ZAR:USD exchange rates.

Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
The Level 3 fair value of other financial assets comprises investments in unlisted companies Food Freshness Technology
Holdings, Ballard Power Systems Inc., Altergy Systems and Greyrock Energy Inc. All these investments are classified as
available-for-sale in terms of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The deferred consideration on
the disposals of the Rustenburg Mine and Pandora Joint Venture are classified as a financial asset at fair value through
profit and loss. The fair values are based on unobservable market data, and estimated with reference to recent third
party transactions in the instruments of the Company, or based on the underlying discounted cash flows expected.

The Level 3 fair value of other financial liabilities comprises the components of the deferred consideration on the
disposal of the Rustenburg Mine, payable to Sibanye, which is classified as a financial liability at fair value through
profit and loss. The fair value is based on the underlying discounted cash flows expected.

17. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Change in estimate of quantities of inventory
During the current year, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a
physical count of in-process metals. The Group runs a theoretical metal inventory system based on inputs, the results of
previous counts and outputs. Due to the nature of in-process inventories being contained in weirs, pipes and other
vessels, physical counts only take place once per annum, except in the Precious Metal Refinery, where the physical count
is usually conducted every three years.

This change in estimate had the effect of increasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements by
R942 million (2016: increase of R618 million). This resulted in the recognition of an after-tax gain of R678 million
(2016: after-tax gain of R445 million).

Change in estimate of useful lives
The Group performed its annual comprehensive reassessment of useful lives of all assets. This process resulted in the
useful life of buildings increasing from a maximum of 20 years to a maximum of 50 years. The useful life in respect of
plant and equipment has not changed but the useful lives of individual assets within the category moved from the lower
to the higher bracket. Changes were accounted for prospectively. These changes have an effect on current and future
periods. The current year effect is a decrease in depreciation of R323 million and it is expected that the effect on
future periods will be similar to the current year.

Change in estimate of the discounting period for environmental liabilities
During the annual review of environmental liabilities, the discount periods were revised to more closely align to the
actual life of mine, limited to a period of 35 years to accommodate for estimation uncertainty beyond that point. This
resulted in an overall increase in discounting period for the purposes of determining the Group's environmental
obligations.

The decrease in the liability consequent on the overall extension of discount period was partly offset by increased
assumption of cost pertaining to ground water rehabilitation. This was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
and therefore adjusted prospectively.

As this partly comprised a change in the timing of the rehabilitation of related assets being used, the decrease was
first recognised as a reduction in the related decommissioning asset in terms of IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing
Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.

This resulted in a decrease in the decommissioning asset by R152 million to reduce it to a nil balance. The remainder of
the reduction was recognised in profit or loss.

This is a once-off adjustment and it does not impact the future periods, except for the future depreciation on relevant
decommissioning assets being nil, giving rise to an increased future gross profit on metal sales and operating profit.

Change in estimate of the run-of-mine ore stockpile
During the second half of 2017, management allocated mining costs to ore stockpiles for the first time. Historically
these stockpiles had not been expected to be processed due to limited concentrator capacity within the period considered
by management for the determination of normal production capacity in terms of IAS 2 Inventories. Hence, all on-mine costs
were allocated to work-in-progress and refined metal inventory based on concentrator capacity. Primarily as a result of a
different mining profile that was fully implemented in the current year, a drawdown of stockpiles is anticipated within
the five-year period considered by management, hence it was appropriate to allocate production costs to run-of-mine ore
stockpiles to the value of R1.8 billion. Low grade ore was measured to the extent it was expected to be processed within
the next five years, this comprised 14% of total low grade ore. Very low grade ore is below the cut-off grade for
economic viability and was accordingly not measured. Owing to a consequential impact on the value of work-in-progress and
refined metal inventory, inventory as a whole increased by R1.3 billion, similarly gross profit on metal sales increased
by R1.3 billion, and profit after tax by R905 million, in the current year.

18. DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS
Equity investments in Pandora
The Group entered into a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement on 10 November 2016 with Eastern Platinum Limited, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Lonmin plc to sell its 42.5% interest in the Pandora Joint Venture. The sale was completed on
1 December 2017, when all the conditions precedent were met, for a deferred cash consideration of a minimum of R400
million and maximum of R1.0 billion over six years. The deferred consideration receivable is a level 3 fair value as
presented and disclosed in note 14.

Long-dated resources
On 11 November 2016 the Group announced the disposal of mineral resources within the Amandelbult Mining Right, and
surface properties above and adjacent to the resource, to Northam Platinum Limited for a consideration comprising R1.0
billion in cash and an ancillary mineral resource within Northam's Zondereinde Mining Right that borders Amandelbult's
Mining Right and which provides the Company with flexibility for the placement of future mining infrastructure.

The resource is long-dated and outside of Amplats' long-term life-of-mine plans and therefore does not impact any
current or future mining plans. The transaction of the disposal of long-dated resources at Amandelbult to Northam
Platinum was completed on 6 December 2014 for a cash consideration of R1,066 million including interest. The full
proceeds was recognised as a profit on disposal, which was excluded from headline earnings.

19. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS
Equity investments in Atlatsa Resources and Bokoni Holdco and associated loans
The Group has a 22.76% shareholding in Atlatsa Resources Corporation (Atlatsa Resources) as well as a 49% shareholding
in Bokoni Holdco, which are equity accounted as associates.

On 21 July 2017 Atlatsa Resources announced the placement of Bokoni Platinum Mine on care and maintenance, which was
effected on 1 October 2017. The Group committed to support Bokoni Platinum Mine while on care and maintenance until the
end of December 2019. A total of R1.4 billion was advanced during the year ended 31 December 2017.

All funding advanced has been impaired to the extent that it comprises a loan to Plateau Resources (a wholly owned
subsidiary of Atlatsa Resources) for its 51% share of the funding requirements. The 49% effective shareholder
contribution to Bokoni Holdco was capitalised to the investment. Equity-accounted losses were applied thereto and the
balance recognised as an impairment.

In addition, a letter agreement was signed with Atlatsa Resources for the Group to acquire the Kwanda North and Central
Block Prospecting Rights for a cash consideration of R350 million. The transaction is still subject to DMR approval to
include the specified rights in the Group's adjacent mining rights. Should the acquisition be implemented the Group has
undertaken to waive the Atlatsa Holdings and Plateau indebtedness to Anglo American Platinum Limited of c.R3.7 billion.

Equity investments in Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine
The share price of Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RB Plat), which holds as its primary mining asset a 67% share in BRPM,
indicated that the Group's investment in BRPM was impaired. An impairment test was performed as at 31 December 2017
resulting in an impairment loss of R1.91 billion for the year, using the implied value derived from RB Plat share price
of R 28.00 at December 2017. This is considered to be a level 2 fair value as defined in note 14. The impairment loss is
excluded from headline earnings.

20. UNKI PLATINUM MINE INDIGENISATION PLAN
The Zimbabwean Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act was promulgated in March 2008 and seeks to plan by the
government of Zimbabwe, Amplats signed a heads of agreement with the government of Zimbabwe in November 2012 that set out
the key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for the Company's Unki Mine investment. The plan has not yet been
implemented.

In early April 2016, President Mugabe issued a press statement which sought to clarify the government of Zimbabwe's
position on the indigenisation and economic empowerment policy. In terms of the statement, existing mining companies such
as Unki would achieve compliance with the indigenisation requirements through ensuring that at least 75% of gross sales
proceeds are spent and retained in Zimbabwe. The statement concluded by stating that President Mugabe had directed that
the indigenisation legislation be amended to comply with this latest position. Amendments to the Indigenisation Act are
yet to be made.

Stakeholders will be kept informed of any material developments in this regard.

21. POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There are no post balance sheet events other than disclosed below.

Sale of Union Mine
The sale of the Group's interests in Union Mine and Masa Chrome became effective on 1 February 2018, when all
significant conditions precedent were met. The key commercial terms include:

Initial purchase price of R400 million
Deferred consideration of 35% of net cumulative positive free cash flow for 10 years (with an early settlement option)
Purchase of concentrate agreement for seven years, with a toll arrangement from year eight onwards.

Including the already recognised impairment loss, the Group expects to realise an attributable, post-tax loss on
disposal of between R1.8 billion and R2.0 billion.

Dividends declared
A final dividend of R0.9 billion for the year ended 31 December 2017 was declared on Thursday, 15 February 2018, payable
on Monday, 12 March 2018 to shareholders recorded in the register at the close of business on Friday, 9 March 2018.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented:
""I am pleased to present a strong set of results for the 2017 financial year. We have delivered on our commitments of
improving operational performance, repositioning the portfolio, ensuring industry-leading cost-control and through
disciplined capital allocation.

Our fatality performance was both disappointing and unacceptable, we lost six of our colleagues last year in work related
incidents. We have already extended our deepest condolences to their families, friends and colleagues, and do so once
again. We have a turn-around programme in place to address this poor performance and we continue to strive towards
elimination of fatalities.

Our persistent focus on value, rather than volume has resulted in a 32% increase in EBITDA to R12 billion and improved
earnings. We generated R2.4 billion of operating free cash flow and materially improved our net debt position to R1.8
billion, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times. The hard work of the past five years has enabled us to today
announce that we have reintroduced the dividend, establishing a pay-out ratio of 30% of headline earnings. This equates
to a dividend payment of R3.49 per share for 2017.

Anglo American Platinum is now a fundamentally different business, having restructured and repositioned the business. We
have seen our productivity increase by 58% since 2012, and now have 70% of our production in the first half of the cost
curve and generated an EBITDA margin and ROCE of 18% respectively. We are a more efficient and more competitive business,
generating better returns.

Looking forward, our focus will continue to be on operational excellence, and strengthening the underlying cash
generation of the business. We will maintain strict capital allocation discipline, whilst considering value-enhancing,
quick payback projects, and continue to progress the project studies at our world-class assets.""

DELIVERING ON OUR COMMITMENTS
Anglo American Platinum is delivering against its key strategic objectives by substantially improving operational
performance across the portfolio; repositioning the portfolio to own and operate the highest margin assets in the
platinum group metals (PGM) industry; removing loss-making production; and investing for the future to create a
sustainable business.

Significant progress has been made in the repositioning of the portfolio, with the disposals of Rustenburg Operations (1
November 2016), the 42.5% interest in the Pandora joint venture (1 December 2017), the sale of the long-dated resources
at Amandelbult (6 December 2017), as well as the sale of our 85% interest in Union mine and 50.1% interest in Masa chrome
(1 February 2018). In addition, Atlatsa Resources placed the Bokoni mine joint venture operation on care and
maintenance, also removing loss-making production.

Disciplined capital allocation is driving decision-making and the Company has prioritised investment in stay-in-business
capital to maintain asset integrity, including scheduled heavy mining equipment (HME) replacements, smelter furnace
rebuilds and the unplanned ACP Phase A module rebuild. In addition, the Company continues to focus on high-value,
capital-light projects with short pay-back periods, such as the optimisation project at Mogalakwena concentrators,
developing Dishaba UG2 ore reserves and the Unki smelter. Overall, a combination of capital discipline, working capital
management and operational efficiencies resulted in the generation of R2.4 billion of free cash flow from operations,
which, combined with sale proceeds from divestments, contributed to a reduction of net debt by R5.5 billion to R1.8
billion.

The Company remains committed to investment across the business to create a sustainable future. Studies are currently
underway to assess future potential projects at Mogalakwena and Der Brochen. PGM market development continues across
several demand segments including jewellery, investment and industrial as well as supporting the widespread commercial
adoption of the hydrogen economy which will aid in the commercialisation of fuel cells in the transport and other
sectors. Anglo American Platinum is committed to advancing future technology to create a modernised business, while
investing in employees and the communities in which it operates.

SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL INVESTMENT
Safety
Tragically there were six fatalities due to work related incidents in 2017. Mr Nkoliseko Jikumlambo was seriously injured
in a fall of ground incident at Amandelbult's Tumela mine on 8 April 2017, and passed away on 21 April 2017. Mr Kagiso
Ramokgatla was fatally injured in a loader incident on 7 June 2017 at Amandelbult's Dishaba mine. Mr Douw Swart suffered
chemical burns in an incident on 21 August 2017 at the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR) and succumbed to his injuries on 5
September 2017. Mr Tlou Abel Keetse was fatally injured on 9 October 2017 in a winch-related incident at Amandelbult's
Dishaba mine. Mr Arlindo Sumbe was fatally injured in a fall-of ground incident on 31 October 2017 at Union mine.
Mr Samuel Jele was fatally injured in a surface transport related incident at Waterval smelter on 21 December 2017. Our
deepest condolences go to their families, friends and colleagues.

Although we have again improved our injury frequency rates, with Total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) down 14% to
0.90, and lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) down 14% to 0.63, our fatality performance was both disappointing and
unacceptable. During 2017, we have developed a revised safety, health and environmental strategy, co-created with
management, unions and employees, to turn around this poor performance. Our safety aspiration is to eliminate fatalities.

Health
Anglo American Platinum has focused on the health and wellness of our employees, with significant reduction in
tuberculosis (TB) and HIV deaths thanks to our disease management programmes. Providing INH Prophalaxis to people
infected with TB has resulted in a significant reduction in TB related deaths from 63 in 2013, to only 4 in 2017. We have
also managed to reduce our TB incidence rate to 582 (per 100,000 people). This is below the South African national
average of 781.

We have committed to Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) together with placing those infected with HIV/AIDS on
antiretroviral treatment and viral load suppression. Anglo American Platinum is targeting to achieve the UNAIDS
commitments of 90:90:90 by 2020 - where 90% of our employees know their status, 90% of those infected are on
antiretroviral treatment and 90% on viral load suppression. Towards achieving those goals by 2020, in 2017 we counselled
96% of our employees, 80% were voluntarily tested and 86% of those who are HIV positive are on antiretroviral treatment.

Environment
Anglo American Platinum has had no major or material environmental incidents (categorised as Level 3 to 5) since 2013. We
managed a significant High Potential Hazard (HPH) at Mototolo tailings facility that could have had material safety and
environmental consequences. Following an internal review of the stability of all tailings storage facilities in the
Company, the Helena tailings facility at. the Mototolo operation was identified as having an elevated risk of
instability. A decision was taken to temporarily halt operations at the Mototolo concentrator while addressing the risk
of seepage and instability. The intervention included the construction of a rock buttress wall around the facility to
improve stability.

Our refineries that are responsible for product delivery to customers maintained certification against the international
ISO14001 environmental standard. The Precious Metals Refinery was certified against the new ISO 14001:2015 standard in
October 2017, while the Base Metals Refinery had a surveillance audit to maintain its certification against
ISO14001:2004.

We continue to reduce both our fresh water and energy consumption as well as improving water and energy intensities. Due
to our reduced energy consumption, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions through our focused carbon
management programme.

We have made considerable progress in the management of our hazardous and non-hazardous waste to landfill with programmes
and projects in place to achieve a zero waste to landfill ambition by 2020.

Social and community investment
Anglo American Platinum contributed R295 million to social labour plan (SLP) and CSI spend in 2017, equating to 6% of
normalised net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). The Mogalakwena and Twickenham next generation SLPs (SLP 2) were
approved by the DMR, and projects included developing and handing over 3 clinics in Limpopo, we expanded and upgraded 8
schools, and supported over 1400 matric learners in both Limpopo and North West with our Matric programme. Over 530
learners participated in the moral regeneration programme led by the Faith Groups in Mapela, and we have, in conjunction
with partners, installed solar street lights in eight villages and continue to deliver water to 42 villages in the Mapela
area.

In 2017, Anglo American Platinum launched the Atomatic Chrome Recovery Plant in Amandelbult which is a joint venture
between Anglo American Platinum, Siyanda Resources and the community of Mantserre. Due to the significant cash generation
of the chrome plant, a distribution of R140 million was paid to our BEE partners and community, of which R89 million was
used to settle the loan and interest and R51 million was distributed as a dividend. In addition, we have contributed to
economic development through job creation at the chrome plant.

STRIVING FOR OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Operational performance
As a result of improved operational efficiencies across the portfolio, total platinum production exceeded revised market
guidance of 2.30-2.35 million platinum ounces, despite the removal of loss-making production from Bokoni and third-party
purchase of concentrate from Maseve and the unplanned stoppage at Mototolo for remedial work on the tailings facility.

Total PGM production (expressed as platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, iridium and ruthenium metal in concentrate) was up
1% to 5,007,700 ounces in 2017 (2016: 4,973,700 ounces). Platinum production was up 1% to 2,397,500 ounces (2016:
2,381,900 ounces) while palladium increased 1% to 1,557,300 ounces (2016: 1,538,600 ounces).

The 4E built-up head grade of 3.46g/tonne was 10% higher due to higher grade from Mogalakwena, which mined through a
particularly high grade area at Zwartfontein pit, and Unki, due to improved mining reef cuts which eliminated waste. This
was partially offset by lower grade at Amandelbult due to a higher proportion of on-surface production which has lower
grade.

Own managed mines
Own managed mines (Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, Union) increased total PGM production by 5% to 2,431,000 ounces
(2016: 2,325,000 ounces). Platinum produced by own managed mines increased by 3% to 1,130,900 ounces (2016: 1,096,200
ounces) and palladium increased by 7% to 847,200 ounces (2016: 789,600 ounces).

Mogalakwena
Mogalakwena produced a record 1,098,500 PGM ounces up 12% (2016: 980,100 ounces), with platinum production up 13% to
463,800 ounces (2016: 411,900 ounces) and palladium up 13% to 508,900 ounces (2016: 452,000 ounces). Total production
included production from the Baobab concentrator plant of 83,500 PGM ounces (2016: 73,200 PGM ounces).

Mogalakwena increased production through mining a higher-grade area within the current mining cut as per the mine plan,
as well as optimisation of the North concentrator plant which led to improved concentrator throughput and recoveries.
Material was mined from the Zwartfontein pit which also contributed to higher grade, but at a lower recovery. The 4E
built-up head grade increased 2% to 3.09g/t from 3.02g/t in 2016. Tonnes milled increased 8%.

Mogalakwena contributed R4.0 billion in economic free cash flow, up from R3.2 billion in 2016. The mine delivered EBITDA
of R7.7 billion at a 48% margin, up from 41% in 2016. Return on Capital Employed increased to 32% from 22%.

Cash operating costs (costs after allowing for off-mine smelting and refining activities) decreased 4% or R0.3bn to
R7.3bn. Cash operating costs including capitalised waste stripping decreased by 9% to R8.1 billion from R8.9 billion.

Owing to a change in mining approach, which was fully embedded in our mine extraction strategy late in 2017, run-of-mine
ore stockpile material has been measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The total value of ore stockpiles
at 31 December 2017 was R1.6 billion. Consequent on the measurement of the ore stockpiles, the carrying value of refined
and work in progress metal inventory reduced by R500 million. Together this resulted in a net increase in EBITDA of R1.1
billion.

The consequent impact on unit cost was a reduction of R3,386 per platinum ounce bringing unit cost to R15,696 per
platinum ounce, down 15% (2016: R18,477). Excluding the ore stock measurement, Mogalakwena reported unit costs of R19,083
per platinum ounce, up 3% year-on-year. Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was R6,628 against
R7,766 per ounce in 2016. Excluding the measurement of ore stock, the unit cost was R8,057 per ounce, up 4% year-on-year.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) (includes operating costs as defined above, all sustaining capital expenditure,
capitalised waste stripping and allocated marketing and market development costs net of by product revenue) per Pt ounce
sold was USD340 per ounce, down from USD498 in the previous year mainly due to the benefit of increased by-product revenue.

As part of the transaction terms to sell the Company's stake in the Pandora joint venture to Lonmin, a three-year
contract was secured for the sole use and operational control of Lonmin's Baobab concentrator which commenced on
completion of the transaction and became effective on 1 December 2017. This will allow Mogalakwena to mill additional
volume and generate incremental cash flow.

Total production from Mogalakwena in 2018 is expected to stay flat at between 1.0 to 1.1 million PGM ounces (c.440,000 to
460,000 platinum ounces).

Amandelbult
Total PGM production at Amandelbult decreased by 3% to 858,000 ounces (2016: 884,600 ounces). Platinum production
decreased 4% to 438,000 ounces (2016: 458,600 ounces) and palladium decreased 2% to 202,500 ounces (2016: 207,300
ounces). Production was largely impacted in the first quarter, when excessive rainfall constrained production from the
open pit operations. The transition of mining from Tumela Upper (which will reach end of life of mine in 2021) to Dishaba
Lower UG2 will result in minimal flexibility whilst the ore reserve development takes place. Production was further
impacted by the tragic fatalities and associated section 54 safety stoppages.

Tonnes milled were maintained at 7 million tonnes as underground tonnes were supplemented with increased tonnes from
surface sources. The increased surface sources in the ore mix reduced the 4E built-up head grade by 5% to 3.86 g/t (2016:
4.07 g/t).

Amandelbult successfully commissioned a new Chrome plant during 2016, and reached steady state in 2017. The chrome plant
is 74% owned by Anglo American Platinum and 26% owned by Baphalane Siyanda Chrome (owned by the community of Mantserre
and Siyanda Resources). Production from the chrome plant increased by 178%, yielding 654,400 tonnes of chrome concentrate
(2016: 234,700 chrome tonnes). Despite a fall in the chrome price during 2017, the low production cost enabled the
Amandelbult Chrome Operation to generate attributable economic free cash flow of R577 million (2016: R320 million).

Amandelbult delivered R91 million in economic free cash flow (excluding any proceeds from the sale of long-dated
resources), from its mining and chrome activities, down from R1.0 billion in 2016. The mine delivered EBITDA of R1.2
billion at a 10% margin, down from 13% in 2016. Return on Capital Employed decreased to 6% from 7%.

Cash operating costs increased by 10% to R9.3 billion (2016: R8.5 billion), mainly due to mining inflation, chrome plant
operational costs and costs relating to the future replacement of production from Tumela Upper to Dishaba Lower UG2. The
increase in costs and lower production volume resulted in cash operating costs per platinum ounce to increase 15% to
R21,246 from R18,438 in 2016.

Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was R10,846 against R9,559 per ounce in 2016.

AISC per platinum ounce sold was USD955 per ounce, up from USD864 in the previous year due to increased costs.

As announced on 24 July 2017, Amandelbult has developed a strategy to improve the profitability of the mine by reducing
the AISC. The key steps include: operational turnaround of the asset by increasing immediately stopeable ore reserves
(IMS) at Dishaba and implementing productivity improvements; developing the Dishaba UG2 project to mine the UG2 reef at
Dishaba by utilising existing Merensky infrastructure at minimal capital investment; extracting the full value of metals
mined and expanding chrome production; and assessing two capital light replacement projects at Dishaba (15E and 62E). The
combination of these measures should enable Amandelbult to sustain production with no significant project capital
expenditure in the medium term and reduce the AISC to USD820 per ounce.

Total production from Amandelbult in 2018 is expected to increase to between 900,000 to 940,000 PGM ounces (c.450,000 -
480,000 platinum ounces).

Unki
Unki mine in Zimbabwe produced a record 165,900 PGM ounces, an increase of 2% (2016: 162,000 ounces). Platinum production
was relatively flat at 74,600 ounces (2016: 74,500 ounces) and palladium production increased 5% to 64,400 ounces (2016:
61,400 ounces).

Production increased due to an increase in tonnes milled, up 2% to 1.75 million due to improved underground productivity,
while the 4E built-up head grade increased marginally to 3.47g/t (2016: 3.46g/t)due to improved mining reef cut and
reducing waste tonnes mined.

Unki increased economic free cash flow to R0.6 billion from R61 million due to improved performance, the sale of treasury
bills of R228 million and export incentives of R63 million.

The mine delivered EBITDA of R0.8 billion at a 33% margin, up from 12% in 2016. Return on Capital Employed increased to
10% from negative 3% in 2016.

Cash operating costs were flat at R1.8 billion. The mine being a dollar denominated operation benefitted from the
strengthening of the rand which increased 9% to R13.33 from R14.63. Cash operating costs were further impacted by
measuring ore stockpiles at the mine to the value of R41 million. Ore stock ahead of the concentrator built-up during
maintenance at the concentrator. This ore stock will be depleted in full in 2018. The impact on unit cost was a reduction
of R555 per platinum ounce bringing unit cost to R23,387 per platinum ounce, down 3% (2016: R24,151). Excluding the ore
stock measurement, Unki reported unit costs of R23,942 per platinum ounce, down 1% year-on-year.

Cash operating costs per PGM ounce (metal in concentrate) was R10,519 against R11,109 per ounce in 2016. Excluding the
measurement of ore stock, the unit cost was R10,769 per ounce, down 3% year-on-year.

AISC (excluding the receipts of treasury bills) per platinum ounce sold was USD612 per ounce, down from USD959, due to the
benefit from increased by-product revenue and lower costs. The AISC including the receipt of treasury bills was USD397 per
platinum ounce sold.

The Unki smelter, a project in execution, is expected to be completed in H2 2018 at a total cost of R650 million, with
R306 million of the project capital incurred in 2017.

Total PGM production from Unki in 2018 is expected to remain at similar levels of 170,000 PGM ounces (c.75,000 platinum
ounces).

Union
Total PGM production from Union increased 3% to 308,600 ounces (2016: 298,300 ounces). Platinum production increased 2%
to 154,500 ounces (2016: 151,200 ounces) and palladium production increased 4% to 71,400 ounces (2016: 68,900 ounces).
Despite the fatal incident and associated section 54 safety stoppages, production increased due to improved stoping
efficiencies. This resulted in an increase in tonnes mined, and tonnes milled.

Masa Chrome produced 324,400tonnes of chrome concentrate (2016: 262,100 chrome tonnes).

Attributable economic free cash flow reduced to R211 million from R302 million in 2016 mainly due to the increase in
sustaining capex for mining from R59 million in 2016 to R161 million in 2017. The mine reported EBITDA of R612 million at
a 14% margin, up from 12% in 2016. Return on Capital Employed increased to 38% from 10% in 2016 mainly as a result of the
impairment of the asset ahead of its sale.

Cash operating costs rose 8% to R3.3 billion from R3.0 billion in 2016 resulting in a 5% increase in unit costs to
R21,109 per platinum ounce (2016: R20,016). Cash operating costs per PGM ounce was R10,567 against R10,145 per ounce in
2016.

AISC per platinum ounce sold was USD873 per ounce, down from USD877 in the previous year mainly due to the benefit from
increased by-product and chrome revenue.

Joint ventures (own-mined and purchase of concentrate)
Total PGM production from joint ventures was down 2% to 1,096,100 PGM ounces (2016: 1,124,100 ounces). Platinum
production was down 3% to 490,600 ounces (2016: 505,600 ounces) and palladium was down 1% to 323,100 ounces (2016:
327,800 ounces).

There was a strong production performance from Modikwa which produced 325,600PGM ounces, resulting in a 10% increase
(2016: 295,800 ounces). Despite a slow start to the year, due to a tragic fatality and associated section 54 stoppages,
Modikwa achieved an improved performance through increased underground efficiencies and improved concentrator recovery.
Platinum production from Modikwa was up 10% to 126,700ounces (2016: 114,800 ounces) and palladium production was up 9% to
124,700ounces (2016: 112,200 ounces).

Kroondal also had a strong performance, producing 585,800 PGM ounces (2016: 576,300 ounces) due to improved underground
efficiencies, and improved concentrator recoveries. Platinum production from Kroondal was up 2% to 278,600ounces
(2016: 274,100 ounces) and palladium production was up 2% to 147,900 ounces (2016: 144,900 ounces).

Production from joint ventures was impacted by the temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator on 14 August 2017, to
conduct remedial work on the Helena tailings facility to restore it to required safety standards. PGM ounces totalling
78,500 were lost during the period (36,600 platinum ounces). As part of a remedial plan to toll treat Mototolo
concentrate, Bokoni concentrator treated 11,900 PGM ounces and Modikwa concentrator purchased mined tonnes and treated
9,700 PGM ounces. There are currently ore stockpiles built-up ahead of the concentrator, which will be depleted in full
in 2018.

Purchase of concentrate from associates
Total PGM purchase of concentrate from associates was down 7% to 484,000 ounces (2016: 517,900 ounces) due to the loss-
making Bokoni mine being placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017. On an annualised basis, 190,000PGM ounces, including
115,000 platinum ounces, of production have been removed due to the closure. Production was offset by a strong
performance from BRPM as the Styldrift project ramps up, with PGM production up 8% to 367,200 ounces. In total, platinum
production from associates was down 5% to 265,500 ounces (2016: 279,300 ounces) and palladium production was down 10% to
127,900 ounces (2016: 141,700 ounces).

Purchase of concentrate from third parties
Total PGM purchase of concentrate from third parties increased substantially due to the sale of the Rustenburg mining and
concentrating operations to Sibanye. Production from Rustenburg has been purchased since 1 November 2016, when the
operation was sold to Sibanye. No further third-party purchase of concentrate is currently expected from the Maseve mine,
owned by Platinum Group Metals, following the mine being placed on care and maintenance.

Refined production and sales volume
Refined PGM production increased 7% to 5,116,200 ounces (2016: 4,787,200 ounces). Refined production was materially
affected by a Section 54 safety stoppage at the Precious Metals Refinery in 2016, as well as the run-out at the Waterval
smelter in September of that year. The recovery from these events was largely responsible for the increase in output in
2017. Refined platinum production increased by 8% to 2,511,900 ounces (2016: 2,334,700 ounces), and refined palladium
production by 14% to 1,668,400 ounces (2016: 1,464,200 ounces).

The planned rebuild of the Waterval Number 1 furnace in the first half of 2017, and a high-pressure water leak at the
Converter Plant in June 2017, delayed refining the 2016 backlog till the second half of 2017, with the full additional
200,000 PGM ounces, including 100,000 platinum ounces, refined by year-end.
Total PGM sales volumes increased by 6% to 5,382,200 ounces (2016: 5,058,100 ounces). Platinum sales volumes increased by
4% to 2,504,600 ounces (2016: 2,415,700 ounces), while palladium sales volumes increased by 3% to 1,571,700 (2016:
1,532,100), in line with the higher refined production.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2017 overview
The company has delivered a strong financial performance in 2017, despite subdued market conditions, by improving cost
structures, optimising working capital and through asset sales.

Headline earnings increased 108% to R3.9 billion (2016: R1.9 billion), with headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 1,482
cents (2016: 713 cents). Higher earnings reflect operating and overhead cost improvements and a higher dollar basket
price, offset by a stronger exchange rate compared to 2016 and measurement of ore stockpiles. Anglo American Platinum
recorded attributable post-tax impairments totalling R3.9 billion affecting basic earnings, of which R0.8 billion impacts
both basic and headline earnings. Impairments that affected only basic earnings included Union Mine and Masa Chrome
(R1.0 billion), equity interest in BRPM (R1.9 billion) and Bokoni Platinum Holdings (R0.2 billion) and the ACP plant
write-off (R16 million). In addition, we forewent term-loan facilities advanced to Atlatsa of R0.8 billion and a loan to
Bakgatla Ba-Kgafela of R69 million related to its interest in Union which has impacted headline earnings.

Owing to a change in mining approach, which was fully embedded in our strategy late in 2017, run-of-mine ore stockpile
material has been measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The total value of ore stockpiles at 31
December 2017 was R1.8 billion. Consequent on the measurement of the ore stockpile, the carrying value of refined and
work in progress metal reduced by R0.5 billion. Together, this results in a net increase in EBITDA of R1.3 billion.
The consequent impact on unit cost was a reduction of R1,280 per platinum ounce bringing unit cost to R19,203 per
platinum ounce, down 2% (2016: R19,545).

We have further strengthened the balance sheet, ending the year with net debt of R1.8 billion compared to R7.3 billion in
2016. This reduction was driven by higher underlying cash flow from operations, R1.2 billion net proceeds on asset sales
(including R1.1 billion proceeds received from the disposal of the long-dated resources at Amandelbult), as well as the
receipt of the remainder of the customer prepayment of R2.6 billion, bringing the total customer prepayment to R4.6
billion.

Sales revenue
Net sales revenue rose 6% to R65.7 billion from R62.0 billion in 2016 on the back of higher platinum, palladium and
chrome sales volumes due to the ramp-up of the new chrome plant at Amandelbult. It also reflects a marginally higher rand
basket price of R26,213 per platinum ounce sold (2016: R25,649), comprising of a US Dollar basket price of USD1,966 per
platinum ounce sold compared to USD1,753 in 2016, offset by a stronger rand of R13.33 (2016: R14.63). The average
US dollar sales price achieved on all metals improved, except for platinum at USD947 per ounce (2016: USD993). Palladium
was up 44%, rhodium up 61%, nickel up 7% and chrome up 25%.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased 1% from R56.1 billion in 2016 to R56.6 billion. Following the sale of Rustenburg operations in
November 2016, the Company now has higher purchase-of-concentrate costs and lower on-mine costs due to buying concentrate
from Sibanye.

On-mine costs (mines and concentrators) reduced by R5.9 billion to R26.9 billion due to lower mining costs after the
Rustenburg exit, partly offset by input cost inflation and increased volume at retained operations. Processing costs rose
9% or R0.6 billion to R7.8 billion on 7% higher refined volumes in 2017 and inflationary increases.

Purchase-of-concentrate costs rose to R20.9 billion (2016: R12.6 billion) on higher volumes from Sibanye, and a slightly
higher rand basket price than 2016.

Other costs increased 20% to R3.4 billion (2016: R2.8 billion), primarily due to higher costs of transporting metal (R0.3
billion) given the increased volume of chrome concentrate produced. The Company reduced overheads from R3.6 billion in
2016 to R3.3 billion in 2017. With the exit of Union, a further sustainable reduction in overhead of R0.3 billion per
annum is expected.

Through strict cost control and the benefits of exiting the Rustenburg operations, as well as the measurement of ore
stockpiles, unit costs are down 2% at R19,203 per produced platinum ounce (2016: R19,545). Before the measurement of ore
stockpiles, unit cost would have been R20,482 per platinum ounce, 5% higher than 2016, but below CPI of 5.4% and within
guidance. Lower capitalised waste production at Mogalakwena accounted for an increase in working cost of R373 per
platinum ounce, in line with accounting standards. Unit cost of PGM production was R8,871 per ounce, 5% lower than the
prior year (2016: R9,298 per ounce). AISC of USD826 per ounce (2016: USD860 per ounce) against an achieved platinum price
of USD947 per ounce reflects stringent cost management, operating model improvements and stay-in-business capital focused
on safety-critical and business continuity projects.


Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
Reported EBITDA increased 32% to R12.0 billion from R9.1 billion in 2016. The movements in EBITDA were due to:
Uncontrollable items, including inflation, US dollar metal prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate, reduced earnings
by R1.3 billion, with inflation contributing R1.7 billion and a stronger rand R4.3 billion, partially offset by stronger
metal prices of R4.7billion.

Controllable items - volume and costs - contributed R4.5 billion, with higher sales volumes increasing earnings by R0.3
billion. Costs reduced by R4.2 billion, mainly due to cost improvements and overhead reductions, the ore stockpile
measurement which reduced cost by R1.3 billion, lower restructuring costs and the benefit of a R0.3 billion higher
stock-count gain compared to 2016. EBITDA was offset by higher losses from the non-managed Bokoni mine, up R0.3 billion,
as a result of once-off care and maintenance costs.

The EBITDA margin for own mining operations was 32% (2016: 28%), on mined portion of joint ventures 20% (2016: 19%),
while the margin on purchased concentrate was 9% (2016: 9%).

Capital expenditure
Disciplined capital allocation remains a priority, aimed at maintaining asset integrity and adding value, not additional
volume.

Capital expenditure for 2017, excluding capitalised interest and waste stripping, rose 18% to R4.0 billion from R3.4
billion in 2016. Stay-in-business capital expenditure increased by R0.6 billion to R3.3 billion, focused on safety-
critical and business continuity projects, including heavy mining equipment replacement and the Waterval smelter and ACP
rebuilds. Our focus is to invest in low-capex, fast-payback, value- accretive projects. Project capital was broadly flat
at R0.6 billion, relating to the Unki smelter and Mogalakwena concentrator optimisation.

Waste tonnes mined decreased from 78Mt in 2016 to 69Mt in 2017 and the cost of mining 23Mt was capitalised (2016:
capitalisation of 39 Mt). As a result, capitalised waste stripping reduced from R1.3 billion in 2016 to R0.8 billion in
2017.

For 2018, project and stay-in-business capex is forecast between R4.7 billion and R5.2 billion and capitalised waste
stripping is expected to be around R1.1 billion. The increase reflects a once-off stay-in-business project for SO2
abatement at the Polokwane and Mortimer smelters to be incurred between 2018 and 2020 (R2.5 billion) to achieve global
benchmark emissions standards.

Working capital
We continue to focus on optimising our working capital levels. Trade working capital has been actively managed down from
R13.3 billion (75 days) at the beginning of 2016 to R6.3 billion at 31 December 2017, representing a 26-day working
capital cycle. The R1.7 billion reduction in working capital from end 2016 is largely due to receipt of the remaining
customer prepayment of R2.6 billion, offset by an increase in stock from R16.4 billion at the end of 2016
to R18.5 billion, due to the ore stockpile measurement and increase in prices. Platinum and palladium work-in-progress
inventory has reduced from around 505,000 ounces and 410,000 ounces at end of 2016 due to the Waterval smelter furnace
run-out to more normalised levels of 467,000 ounces and 379,000 ounces respectively at the end of 2017. In 2017, we had
the benefit of a 76,000 platinum ounce stock-count gain valued at R0.9 billion (2016: 62,000 ounces, R0.6 billion).

Net debt and liquidity
During the year, we made significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet. The company ended with net debt of R1.8
billion compared to R7.3 billion at the end of 2016, supported by cash generated from operations of R11.2 billion, R2.6
billion from the customer prepayment, and R1.2 billion net proceeds on asset sales (including proceeds of R1.0 billion
from disposing of long-dated Amandelbult resources). These cash flows were used to fund capital expenditure and
capitalised waste stripping of R4.7 billion; pay taxation of R1.7 billion; settle interest of R1.2 billion to our debt
providers and contribute R1.8 billion to funding our joint venture and associate operations, of which R0.8 billion was in
respect of Bokoni.

Gearing has reduced to 4.3% and net debt to EBITDA has improved to 0.2. We have increased liquidity headroom to
R20.6 billion, comprising both undrawn committed facilities of R11.2 billion and cash of R9.4 billion, and are
comfortably within our debt covenants.

Dividend
The Board has adopted a pay-out ratio driven dividend policy, which is in accordance with the Company's capital
allocation framework and in line with our commitment to sustainably return cash to shareholders through the cycle, whilst
retaining a high level of balance sheet strength.

The Board's target is to distribute a base dividend of 30% of headline earnings for each reporting period. This dividend
policy will result in variability of dividend payments in respect of each six-month period, given that the industry faces
volatility in metal prices and exchange rates, amongst other factors. Additional returns to shareholders above the base
dividend will be considered in accordance with the Company's capital allocation framework.

On reviewing the current reporting period, the Board has declared a final cash dividend of R3.49 per share, which is
equivalent to a 30% headline earnings pay-out ratio. The dividend is applicable to shareholders on the register on 9
March 2018 and payable on 12 March 2018.

PGM MARKET REVIEW
Prices
The Dollar platinum price ended the year at USD928, up 2.7% from the beginning of the year, but the average price over the
year softened 4.6% to USD947 (2016: USD993). The Palladium price was up 44% to USD876 per ounce (2016: USD610 per ounce) and the
rhodium price up 61% to USD1,094 per ounce (2016: USD680 per ounce). In USD terms, the dollar basket price was up 12% year
on year to USD1,966 per platinum ounce (2016: USD1,753 per platinum ounce). The rand strengthened by 9%, leaving the rand
basket price up only 2% at R26,213 per platinum ounce (2016: R25,649 per Platinum ounce).

Platinum
Platinum underperformed the other platinum group metals (PGMs) due to increased negative sentiment against diesel fuelled
engines in Europe, and the tightening of monetary policy in the USA. Primary supply from mine production fell by 1.6% but
was compensated for by an increase in recycling from the automotive industry, while gross demand declined 4.5%.
Consequently, platinum moved into a small surplus in 2017.

Demand for platinum from the automotive sector softened by 1.2% as diesel sales in Western Europe were impacted by
negative consumer sentiment, although there was growing demand for platinum from the heavy-duty diesel sector. Industrial
demand for platinum remained robust in 2017 as the electrical, glass and petroleum industries all contributed to an
increase in demand.

The performance of the jewellery sector was mixed. China remains the largest consumer of platinum jewellery but gross
demand for new metal fell for the fourth consecutive year. This has been due to a mix of slowing growth, a struggling
wider jewellery retail sector, which has also affected gold, and a move by retailers towards higher margin jewellery
pieces which has hurt demand for plain metal jewellery. Net demand, however, fell less heavily as jewellery recycling
fell.

Elsewhere, demand for platinum jewellery is more positive. Indian demand grew strongly despite some uncertainty over new
tax regimes, and demand exceeded 2015 levels following the disruption caused by demonetisation and floods in 2016.

Net investment demand was again positive in 2017, totalling 350,000 ounces. Investment demand from Japan was lower at
145,000 ounces, as lower platinum price volatility in Yen terms meant that consumers had fewer opportunities to buy
platinum at attractive levels, reducing demand from a strong market in 2016. The reduction in platinum investment demand
movement from 620,000 ounces to 350,000 ounces in 2017 was responsible for the majority of the 4.5% reduction in 2017.

Palladium
Palladium performed strongly in 2017 with demand now significantly outweighing supply leading to a market deficit of
670,000 ounces. The palladium price hit a 16 year high at USD1,071 with the average price of USD871, 42% higher in 2017
(2016: USD615). On 27 September, the palladium price was at a premium to the platinum price for the first time in 16 years
and contributed 28% to revenue. The automotive industry remains the principal user of palladium and demand rose by 6.0%
in 2017, while industrial demand increased by 2.6%. In the investment sector, it was another year of net disinvestment
for palladium with net ETF selling of 365,000 ounces during the year.

Rhodium
Rhodium also performed extremely well in 2017 with the average price 60% higher at USD1,108 (2016: USD694). The price
finished 2017 at a six-year high and contributed 7% to revenue. The rhodium market was reasonably well supplied in 2017
although the surplus fell to 26,000 ounces in a relatively illiquid market. Tightening emission standards coupled with
strong sales of light duty gasoline vehicles globally led to an increase in automotive demand of 4.4%. Industrial demand
was robust in 2017, with the chemical and glass manufacturing sectors purchasing more metal than in the prior year.

Minor metals
The prices of both ruthenium and iridium increased in 2017 with ruthenium increasing to an average of USD75 per ounce
(2016: USD42) and iridium increased to an average of USD898 per ounce (2016: USD576). Demand for both metals is strong from
both the chemical and electrical sectors.

Automotive
Global light duty vehicle sales increased by 2.5% in 2017 to a record 94 million units (source: LMC Automotive Global
Light Vehicle Sales Update). Sales were strong in Argentina, Brazil, Europe and Japan. Sales growth in China was 2% in
2017, compared to a 12.3% increase in 2016. The slowdown in growth was in part due to an increase in the sales tax
payable on small vehicles which was halved from 10% to 5% in 2016 but increased again at the start of 2017. In the USA,
sales of light duty vehicles contracted by 1.9% but remained strong by historical standards.

Gross automotive demand for platinum fellby 40,000 ounces or 1.2%.Diesel's share of the light duty vehicle market in
Western Europe fell from 49.5% last year to below 45% in 2017. The diesel engine has been subject to significant negative
media coverage over the course of the year. Some governments in Europe have reacted by increasing taxes and penalties on
diesel vehicles, particularly in the larger cities such as London and Paris. As a result, consumers have become wary of
purchasing diesel cars and their residual values have fallen. That said, the decline in diesel's market share of light
duty vehicles sales in Western Europe was broadly aligned to forecasts and is expected to slow in 2018.

Diesel vehicles are expected to maintain a reasonable share of sales in Western Europe over the next five years. With its
relatively low CO2 emissions, diesel is still extremely important for light and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers and
their ability to meet the stretching EU carbon-dioxide emission targets in 2021. Diesels are likely to retain a strong
position among larger vehicles, in particular. Economic growth and tightening emissions rules in China and India will
drive additional demand for platinum from the heavy duty diesel sector.

Globally, demand for palladium from the automotive sector grew by 6.0% while demand for rhodium increased by 4.4%. The
growth was predominantly driven by strong sales and tightening emissions legislation in China with the country consuming
130,000 ounces more palladium than in the previous year. In the USA, tightening emissions legislation and increasing
vehicle size led to higher PGM loadings on average for light duty vehicles and so demand for palladium and rhodium from
the USA grew, despite a fall in unit sales.

With the palladium price having sustained its position above that of platinum since September, the question of
substituting platinum for palladium in gasoline catalytic converters comes into play. While research suggests that
substitution in some of these catalysts is possible, automotive companies have yet to respond to the changing price
environment in this way. It is unlikely that there will be any meaningful progress in replacing palladium with platinum
in gasoline autocatalytic converters in 2018, although it is likely this will occur at some point.

Industrial
Industrial demand for platinum remained robust once again this year, growing by 125,000 ounces, or 6.7%, and so
outstripping global economic growth. Expansions in glass and petroleum production in China were the main contributor to
this growth. While still small, demand for platinum for use in fuel cells continues to grow. There are increasing numbers
of automotive producers looking at fuel cells for zero-emissions vehicles, in addition to battery electric vehicles. As
with battery electric vehicles, China is driving this move towards cleaner cars and its roadmap for the future targets
one million fuel cell vehicles on the road by 2030.
Industrial demand for palladium increased in 2017, by55,000 ounces. Demand from the chemical sector increased
significantly compared to 2016, which helped to compensate for a fall in demand from the dental and electrical sectors.

Jewellery
Gross global jewellery demand declined again in 2017, falling by 7.7% or 185,000 ounces to 2.23 million ounces. In China,
the largest market, gross platinum demand from the jewellery sector shrank by 14% or 200,000 ounces to roughly 1.3
million ounces in 2017, following the decline in volumes seen in 2016. Many of the same factors continue to weigh on the
wider jewellery sector and negatively affected both 24 carat gold and plain platinum jewellery sales. After several years
of strong expansion, profitability and volumes have declined across the wider jewellery retail sector in China. Retailers
have responded by moving their sales to higher margin pieces with sales of design-led or gem-set pieces performing well.
While platinum volumes have declined overall, some retailers who have adjusted their product offerings have achieved
sales growth.

Flows of unsold Chinese jewellery for recycling slowed markedly in 2017, following the previous year's destocking. As a
result, net demand declined at a slower rate than in the previous year.

Indian jewellery demand performed well in 2017, growing by 15% year-on-year in 2017, with platinum being sold in an
increasing number of stores and retail chains. Consumer interest in platinum's brand positioning is also very healthy,
with this impressive growth achieved against a backdrop of the introduction of a national sales tax and the aftereffects
of 2016's disruptive demonetisation experiment.

Japanese gross purchases of platinum for jewellery manufacturing were essentially level with previous year volumes
although lower recycling volumes meant that net demand increased. Demand in North America edged higher, with good online
sales of platinum jewellery and the early positive results of promoting platinum as a secure setting for diamonds more
than offsetting the effects of slowing economic growth. European platinum jewellery demand was little different from the
previous year.

Investment
Net investment demand for platinum remained positive in 2017 but fell significantly compared to the previous year. Net
demand totalled 350,000 ounces, compared to 620,000 ounces in 2016. ETFs saw net buying of 105,000 ounces once again,
encouraged at times by relative price weakness in US Dollar terms. The biggest contributor to the fall in platinum bar
and coin investment was Japan. Investment demand in 2017 was 145,000 ounces, compared to 545,000 ounces the year before.
In 2015 and 2016 the metal's continuing discount to gold, low absolute price in Yen and its price volatility meant that
consumers were very keen buyers. Despite the price in Yen terms being similar to 2016, it was less volatile and consumer
demand failed to materialise at the same level during 2017.

Work by the World Platinum Investment Council continues to improve availability and demand for physical products in a
number of countries. Partnerships with the likes of Bullion Vault and the Royal Mint have helped to stimulate additional
physical demand and, in the USA, the launch of the Platinum Eagle coin was well received.

It was another year of net disinvestment for palladium. ETF selling continued with 365,000 ounces sold during the year.
At the start of the year profit taking resulted in some heavy selling as the price hit highs last seen in 2014. The US
Palladium Eagle coins were well received and highlighted the potential for further physical investment demand.

STRATEGY
Repositioning the portfolio
Anglo American Platinum has achieved key strategic successes in 2017 in repositioning its portfolio. The Company aims to
own and operate the best assets in the PGM industry, consisting of Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, the joint venture
operations BRPM, Mototolo and Modikwa, and downstream processing assets.

The completion of the sale of the Rustenburg Operations in 2016, the sale of the Company's 42.5% stake in the Pandora
joint venture, and the disposal of Union mine and Masa Chrome, (post year-end), allow the Company to focus on the most
competitive assets, consisting of largely open-pit and more mechanised operations which will result in higher margin
production, a smaller and more highly skilled workforce, safer operations and a less complex organisation. The core
operations stand to benefit from dedicated management attention and technical expertise, as well asdisciplined capital
allocation.

Disposal of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right to Northam
The Company announced on 6 December 2017 that it had completed the disposal of mineral resources within the Amandelbult
mining right to Northam Platinum Limited. These resources were excluded from current life of mine plans and are long
dated. The upfront cash proceeds of R1 billion were received and used to reduce net debt.

Bokoni
As announced on 24 July 2017, shareholders were notified that Atlatsa Resources commenced the process to place Bokoni
mine on care and maintenance. This process was completed on 1 October 2017 and loss-making production ceased at the
operation.

Kroondal
The Company's stake in Kroondal is considered a non-core operation as it is not a long-life operation. However, as the
operation generates attractive cash flow for the Company it will only be disposed for value. No formal discussions have
commenced.

POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE
Optimising existing assets
The Company remains committed to delivering operational excellence across the portfolio. There are initiatives underway
to mine the assets optimally, including the optimisation of the Mogalakwena North concentrator. Post the significant
improvements made at Mogalakwena over the past few years (2012: 300,000 platinum ounces, 2017: 460,000 platinum ounces),
the Amandelbult transition plan is now the biggest optimisation project in the portfolio and will reduce AISC by 24% by
2022 to USD820/platinum ounce and increase the profitability of the mine.

Disciplined capital allocation
Disciplined capital allocation remains on sustaining capital and business continuity and quick-payback value-enhancing
projects. Anglo American Platinum will continue to assess projects which meet these criteria, including expansions of the
Amandelbult chrome plant, the Dishaba UG2 transition, the Unki smelter as well as scheduled furnace rebuilds and heavy
mining equipment replacements.

Project studies
In line with the capital allocation framework, Anglo American Platinum is continuing the assessment of unlocking value
from the high-quality project optionality in the portfolio. The Company has several value-enhancing projects which are
currently in pre-feasibility study stage, including a Mogalakwena expansion, and developing the potential at Der Brochen.
These projects will be fully mechanised and low-cost, driving the ambition to ensure all new production is in the bottom
half of the cost curve, more productive and safer. Anglo American Platinum has the portfolio of projects and assets which
can drive margin expansion in the current PGM price environment.

Market development
Development of the global platinum jewellery market is carried out by Platinum Guild International (PGI), which is funded
by Anglo American Platinum and other primary PGM producers. The PGI is focused on the four major platinum jewellery
markets of China, Japan, India and the USA, where it promotes platinum jewellery directly to the consumer, and works in
partnership with designers, manufacturers and retailers. 2017 continued to see growth rates for platinum above those for
total jewellery in Japan, India and the USA. In China, the industry continues to adapt to a slowdown in overall jewellery
consumption as the economy adapts to a more sustainable growth path. However, in the Chinese bridal market, platinum has
made gains in both acquisition levels and absolute tonnage, especially in the faster growing Tier 2 and 3 cities.

Development of investment demand for platinum is led by the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), an industry body
funded by several platinum producers including Anglo American Plaitnum. Several new partnerships were added in 2017,
including with the UK's Royal Mint to deliver the Mint's first range of platinum products, as well as launching platinum
on the BullionVault's multi-regional online vaulting platform. The WPIC also substantially expanded both its monthly
investment research output and its direct investor development programme with institutions. A presence was established in
Shanghai to begin to unlock China's vast platinum investment demand potential.

As part of ongoing investments in securing future markets for its metals, Anglo American Platinum also operates the PGM
investment programme. This is a venture capital approach that provides start-up or early-stage capital to companies
working on commercialising technology that uses or enables the use of PGMs. These investments are primarily focused on
hydrogen, fuel cells, energy storage and the clean energy transition.

During 2017, our work to add value to our portfolio of investment companies included:

Successful raising of USD32 million from third parties for Primus Power and the successful awarding of a US Technology and
Development Agency grant to support an energy storage system for Eskom, South Africa's national electricity utility. This
project will demonstrate the capabilities and use cases for industrial and utility scale energy storage systems in South
Africa. Primus is partnering with Solafrica Energy, a Johannesburg-based developer of utility scale solar power plants.
As part of the program, Primus will deploy an array of four batteries capable of delivering 100 kW of power and 500 kWh
of energy. The system will initially be installed at Eskom's Large Scale Energy Storage Testing and Demonstration
Facility in Rosherville, South Africa.
Facilitation of German-based Hydrogenious Technologies' systems, a liquid carrier of hydrogen, into the US market, via
United Hydrogen Technology. In addition, Anglo American Platinum is helping secure additional funding and entry
opportunities to new markets for Hydrogenious.
Identification and development of a number of African and Asian opportunities for Greyrock Energy, a flare glass to
liquid fuel conversion unit.

We also continue to work on areas aiding the widespread commercial adoption of fuel cells and hydrogen in the transport
sector and other sectors. This involves a range of activities from investing in companies that address specific market
challenges through the PGM investment programme, to engaging with governments across the world to ensure a fair
regulatory environment for these technologies, and assisting in demonstration programmes where appropriate. Anglo
American was a founding member of the global Hydrogen Council, launched in Davos in 2017. Together with the Chinese
Ministry of Science and Technology, the Company was instrumental in establishing the International Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Association in China this year.

Where possible, we aim to integrate this demand stimulation with developing skills and capacity building in South Africa.
In the jewellery sector, this year's 18th annual PlatAfrica competition again sought to provide opportunities for
successful South African jewellery designers to have their designs manufactured and sold in the Indian market. This year,
we announced a new partnership with Metal Concentrators, to continue to provide a metal financing scheme to local
jewellery manufacturers for working capital requirements. We also see an opportunity to position South Africa as a
manufacturing location for some of our portfolio companies and we continue to explore and develop such opportunities.

In addition, we contributed to the funding of hydrogen refueling stations to be built by Shell, in collaboration with
Honda and Toyota at seven Shell-branded retail stations across Northern California; three in the city of San Francisco,
and one in each of Berkeley, Sacramento, Citrus Heights and Walnut Creek. The hydrogen refueling stations will be
installed in strategic locations within the existing network of Shell-branded retail stations, offering existing and
future fuel cell electric vehicle drivers high-quality service with simple and straightforward car refueling in minutes.
California is a key early adopter market for fuel cell electric vehicles.

Technical innovation and modernisation
The Company has continued its journey of innovation and technology development to achieve safety, productivity and cost
benefits during 2017. Emphasis has been placed on modernisation (drill, blast and cleaning technologies) of underground,
in-stope operations at Amandelbult, automation of blast hole drilling at the Mogalakwena open pit operations and
productivity of trackless mining operations at Unki. The primary focus of modernisation across the concentrators and
Process division has been on throughput increases based on enhanced instrumentation and control systems coupled with
expanded asset management practice and integration with the Anglo American Operating Model.

We continue the trialling of new mining technology at Twickenham, and have made progress in rock cutting technology,
which eliminates the need for explosives, and increases stoping and development efficiencies. Significant progress has
been made with all elements of the narrow reef technology suite, such that deployment on a production basis at the
Amandelbult 15E section is currently being studied.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY
The Reviewed Mining Charter (MCIII)
On 15 June 2017, the South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) published its Reviewed Mining Charter 2017
(MCIII). Anglo American Platinum expressed its concern that the MCIII was not concluded through agreement between the DMR
and all relevant stakeholders, including the mining industry, despite the best efforts of those stakeholders over the
preceding year.

The Company is supportive of the legal action followed by the Chamber of Mines, with the ultimate objective of arriving
at a negotiated solution that is practical to implement, and which preserves and enhances investment in what is a
critically important industry for South Africa. Inthe absence of new investment, South Africa will fail to deliver the
economic growth required to create greater levels of employment and socio-economic upliftment for the benefit of all
South Africans. The Company is committed to meeting South Africa's transformation objectives and has been a longstanding
and major contributor to the country's transformation. The hearing on the Chamber of Mine's Declarator on the 'once
empowered always empowered' issue was heard in November 2017, with the outcome expected after 90 days. The hearing on the
review of Mining Charter has been set for 19, 20 and 21 February 2018.
Anglo American Platinum welcomed the DMR's written undertaking that the provisions of the MCIII will not be implemented
or applied in any way, pending judgment in the review application brought by the Chamber of Mines. We will continue to
engage through the Chamber of Mines.

Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA)
There was little progress in 2017 in respect of the finalisation of the draft Minerals and Petroleum Resources
Development Act (MPRDA Bill), following former President Jacob Zuma's recommendation in January 2015 that it be sent back
to Parliament for consideration, citing constitutional concerns and the lack of consultation with communities at
provincial level. In June 2017, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) convened a series of public hearings across all
nine Provinces to meet the consultation obligations. During these public hearings, submissions were made by the Chamber
of Mines, amongst others, stating that the Bill as currently drafted is in contravention of South Africa's Constitution,
owing to breaches in the separation of powers between the legislature and the Minister of Mineral Resources. Subsequent
to this consultation process, no further engagement or draft amendments to the MPRDA Bill have been forthcoming from the
regulator.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
Reserves
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Ore Reserves have decreased 2.4 % from 170.2 4E million ounces to 166.2 4E
million ounces in the review period. This was primarily due to Bokoni Mine being placed on care and maintenance by
Atlatsa Resources and the sale of the interest in Pandora Mine to Lonmin. The reduction of Ore Reserves has been
partially offset by an increase in Ore Reserves at Mogalakwena, Tumela and Dishaba mines due to the additional conversion
of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.

At Mogalakwena Mine, a combination of enhanced geological resource modelling, pit shell optimisation, production and
stockpile movements resulted in the Mogalakwena Platreef Ore Reserves increasing by 2.5 4E million ounces from 124.1 4E
million ounces in 2016 to 126.6 4E million ounces in 2017. The combination of basket metal prices and exchange rate used
to optimise the Mogalakwena pit is based on long-term forecasts in a balanced supply/demand scenario.

At the Amandelbult mining complex, the continued execution of the Tumela and Dishaba UG2 strategy has an additional 1.3
4E million ounces being converted to Ore Reserves from the exclusive Mineral Resources.

Resources
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Mineral Resource, inclusive of Ore Reserves decreased by 3.7% from 831.7 4E
million ounces to 801.2 4E million ounces in the review period. This was primarily the result of the disposal of the
interest in Pandora Mine Mineral Resources to Lonmin (less 12.0 4E million ounces) and the sale of a long-dated portion
of the Tumela Mine inclusive Mineral Resource to Northam (less 17.5 4E million ounces).

The full reserves and resources statement will be available on 12 March 2018.

OUTLOOK
In view of the current and expected market conditions for PGMs, Anglo American Platinum remains focused on its strategy
to deliver change and build a resilient business. The Company has restructured the business and implemented the
repositioning of the portfolio, to become a resilient business despite an ongoing volatile PGM pricing environment.

Underlying cash-flow generation remains the focus, and project capital will therefore be prioritised on quick-return
projects that generate meaningful incremental value. No major project capital will be committed in 2018, although the
Company continues with study plans for potential future projects at Mogalakwena and Der Brochen, to position itself to
implement these should market conditions improve.

The Company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle, only focussing on high-returning and
quick pay back projects, and therefore has committed to allocating capital to paying a sustainable dividend based on a
pay-out ratio of 30% of normalised headline earnings.

Market outlook
Independent forecasts suggest that the three major PGMs, platinum, palladium and rhodium, should collectively be in
deficit again in 2018. Rising vehicle production volumes and a healthy global economy should drive higher demand while
primary mine production is likely to be relatively unchanged compared to the previous year.

Platinum is likely to be in a small surplus again in 2018, with demand exceeded by overall supply. Gross automotive
demand may decline with diesel engines' share of new car sales in Europe set to fall, albeit at a lower rate than last
year. Heavy duty automotive demand is likely to strengthen, offsetting some of this weakness. The outlook for the
jewellery sector is mixed: a strong performance is expected in India where platinum has been successful in gaining share;
in China, gross platinum demand is more likely to decline as retailers search for higher margin jewellery opportunities,
potentially impacting sales of plain metal jewellery. A return to more normal retail recycling levels means that any
decline in gross demand would have a less marked impact on net platinum demand. Industrial demand should continue to grow
at growth rates greater than or equal to world GDP. Investment demand is dependent on price movements and on price
volatility but should be positive, aided by market development from the WPIC. Primary supply should remain flat and
limited potential for growth in recycling, leading to a small surplus.
The outlook for palladium is positive for 2018. With the number of vehicles produced likely to grow and with emissions
legislation tightening, palladium purchases by the global automotive industry are likely to rise once again. It is
unlikely that there will be any meaningful progress in replacing palladium with platinum in gasoline catalytic converters
this year, although it is likely this will occur at some point. Industrial demand will remain robust. As with platinum,
primary supply should remain relatively unchanged. In contrast to platinum, recycling volumes of spent catalytic
converters continues to rise as c.5% per annum. Nevertheless, palladium should remain in a substantial deficit even if
disinvestment of physical palladium continues.

Rhodium demand should continue to climb in 2018. Rising global vehicle production volumes and tighter emissions rules
should boost automotive demand. Supplies are likely to remain relatively flat and should move towards a balanced market.

Operational outlook
PGM production guidance (metal-in-concentrate) will be 4.75 - 5.0 million PGM ounces for 2018, including platinum outlook
of 2.3 to 2.4 million ounces. Refined production and sales volumes will be in line with production, but lower than 2017,
which had the Waterval smelter run-out backlog and 2017 stock count gain which equated to c.200,000 PGM ounces, including
100,000 platinum ounces. Unit cost guidance will be between R19,600 and R20,200 per produced platinum ounce (metal in
concentrate).

Financial outlook
The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with volatility in metal prices and exchange rates expected to continue.
Management's efforts to reposition the portfolio, taking out loss-making ounces, implementing strict cost control and
focussing on operational efficiencies should enhance margins and generate sustainable cash flow. Capital discipline will
continue, with capital expenditure projected at R4.7 billion to R5.2 billion, of which R3.9 billion to R4.2 billion will
be on sustaining capex to maintain asset integrity and meet compliance requirements.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 (“the period”)
on the Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 19 February 2018.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s trading statement released on SENS on 15 December 2017
in which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the
period were expected to be at least 20% (R373 million or 143 cents per share, respectively) higher than
for the comparative reporting period for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016 (“comparative
period”) and that basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period were also expected
to be at least 20% (R126 million or 48 cents per share, respectively) higher than for the comparative period.

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the period are likely to increase to between
R3.65 billion and R4.00 billion (or between 96% and 114% higher than the prior year figure of R1.87 billion)
and to between 1,392 cents and 1,526 cents per share (or between 95% and 114% higher than the prior
year figure of 713 cents) respectively.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to increase to between R1.85 billion and R1.97 billion (or
between 193% and 212% higher than the prior year figure of R632 million) and to between 706 cents and
751 cents per share (or between 193% and 212% higher than the prior year figure of 241 cents)
respectively.

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily a result of a strong operational
performance, strict cost control and higher Platinum Group Metal sales volumes, together with a 2%
increase in the Rand basket price. In addition, during the second half of 2017, the Company valued the
impact of ore stockpiles ahead of concentrators across the business equating to R0.9 billion post-tax in
the period, (of which R0.8 billion post-tax relates to ore stockpiles at Mogalakwena), to the extent that
these stockpiles are expected to be utilised in the foreseeable future.

Basic earnings for the period is also impacted by attributable impairments after tax of R3.9 billion (of which
R2.2 billion was recognised in the interim results to 30 June 2017 (“Interim Results”)) including the
following impairments:

     a) R1.9 billion in respect of the associate investment in BRPM due to the decline in the Royal
         Bafokeng share price which provided indication of the need for an impairment (of which R1.0 billion
         was recognised in the Interim Results);
     b) Union Mine and Masa Chrome of R1.0 billion owing to the disposal of these operations (of which
         R0.9 billion was recognised in the Interim Results);
    c) R0.2 billion in funding provided to Bokoni Mine consequent on the Company’s 49% shareholding
       therein;
    d) R0.7 billion in respect of funding provided to Atlatsa for its support of Bokoni Mine (of which
       R0.2 billion was recognised in the Interim Results); and
    e) R0.1 billion to the Bakgatla related to their interest in Union Mine (recognised in the Interim
       Results).

    The latter two, totalling R0.8 billion impact both basic earnings and headline earnings.

In addition, basic earnings benefits from the inclusion of profit on the sale of assets of R1.2 billion, largely
attributable to the disposal of long-dated Amandelbult resources. This is excluded from headline earnings.

The comparative period basic earnings were impacted by the post-tax loss on disposal of Rustenburg mine
of R0.9 billion which also did not impact headline earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or reported on,
by the Company’s external auditors.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the Transaction:

“In addition to the sales of Pandora and Rustenburg, with the completion of Union, Anglo American
Platinum has executed a core part of its strategy of repositioning the portfolio. This Transaction will
allow us to focus on our most competitive assets, which are largely open-pit and mechanised operations
which will result in higher margin production, a smaller and more highly skilled workforce, safer
operations and a less complex organisation. Our core operations will benefit from dedicated
management attention, technical expertise as well as enabling us to focus our capital allocation.”

Lindani Mthwa, Group Chairman of Siyanda Resources commented on the transaction:

“The Union Mine and Masa Chrome operations are quality assets which have long-term potential under
Siyanda’s ownership and management. Siyanda’s management team has extensive mining experience
including experience at Union Mine. This Transaction is mutually beneficial for all parties involved and,
through our partnership with the Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela and our employees, we believe that we will create
a sustainable future for the operation.”

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017


OVERVIEW

• Tragically three fatalities in Q4 2017

• Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) of 1,220,000 ounces, decreased
  4% due to the closure of unprofitable ounces from Bokoni which was placed on care and
  maintenance, as well as the temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator

• Own mined PGM production increased 4% to 624,200 ounces due to a strong performance from
  Mogalakwena, up 15%

• Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) was flat at 265,800 ounces as
  strong performances from Modikwa and Kroondal offset the production decrease due to the
  temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator

• Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates was down 27% primarily due to the closure of
  unprofitable ounces from Bokoni which was placed on care and maintenance, partially offset by
  strong production from BRPM as the Styldrift project ramps up

• Refined PGM production increased 10% to 1,455,600 ounces due to the lower refined volumes in
  Q4 2016 following the Waterval Smelter run-out in that period

• PGM sales volumes increased 19% due to the increase in refined PGM production and selling down
  of refined stock to normalised levels


REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum tragically had three fatalities in Q4 2017. Mr Keetse was fatally injured on 9
October in a winch-related incident at Dishaba mine; Mr Sumbe was fatally injured in a fall-of ground
incident on 31 October 2017 at Union mine; and Mr Jele was fatally injured in a surface transport related
incident at Waterval smelter on 21 December 2017. Our deepest condolences go to their family, friends
and colleagues. Independent and comprehensive investigations are under way to understand the
circumstances and learn from them to create a safer work environment for all. The Company remains
committed to zero harm and has a comprehensive safety turn-around strategy in place to reverse the
disappointing fatality performance.

Other safety performance indicators have shown a significant improvement over the period with the
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations
decreasing by 27% to 0.46 (Q4 2016: 0.63).

PGM PRODUCTION

Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) of 1,220,000 ounces, decreased 4%
due to the closure of unprofitable ounces from Bokoni which was placed on care and maintenance, as
well as the temporary closure of the Mototolo concentrator. Total platinum production was down 4% to
587,000 ounces and total palladium production was down 5% to 374,900 ounces.

PGM production from own-managed mines

Own mined PGM production (excluding Rustenburg for prior year comparison) increased 4% to 624,200
ounces due to a very strong performance from Mogalakwena. Platinum production was up 3% to
291,800 ounces, and palladium up 5% to 213,700 ounces.

Mogalakwena PGM production increased by 15% to 282,200 ounces as a result of an increase in built-
up head grade, in-line with the mine plan, and optimisation to the North Concentrator Plant leading to
an increase in concentrator throughput. Platinum production was up 18% to 121,700 ounces, and
palladium up 13% to 127,800 ounces.

Amandelbult PGM production decreased by 2% to 231,200 ounces primarily due to a delay in ore
reserve development at Dishaba and Section 54 related stoppages at Dishaba following the fatal
incident in October 2017. Platinum production was down 4% to 116,600 ounces, and palladium was
down 1% to 54,600 ounces.

Unki PGM production decreased 16% to 36,600 ounces due to planned maintenance to the mill feed
silo at the concentrator, which was completed in December 2017. The ore stockpile ahead of the
concentrator will be processed in 2018. Platinum production was down 18% to 16,400 ounces and
palladium was down 14% to 14,200 ounces.

Union PGM production decreased by 2% to 74,200 ounces due to the fatal incident and associated
safety stoppages, as well as difficult ground conditions. Platinum production was down 3% to 37,100
ounces and palladium was down 2% to 17,100 ounces. The sale of Union mine to Siyanda Resources
was announced on 15 February 2017 and is expected to complete in early 2018.

PGM production from joint ventures (own mined production and purchase of concentrate)

Total joint venture PGM production was flat at 265,800 ounces. Production was down primarily due to
the temporary suspension of the Mototolo concentrator to carry out remedial work on the Helena
Tailings Storage Facility to bring it back to required safety standards. This work was completed ahead
of schedule in early December 2017 and has now ramped up to normal production. This resulted in a
decrease in PGM production from Mototolo of 49% to 29,400 ounces (platinum down 51% to 13,400
ounces, palladium down 46% to 8,600 ounces). As part of a remedial plan to toll treat Mototolo
concentrate, Bokoni concentrator treated 11,900 and Modikwa concentrator purchased mined tonnes
and treated 9,700 PGM ounces.

Strong performances from Modikwa and Kroondal offset the decline from Mototolo. Modikwa PGM
production increased 25% to 80,000 ounces due to improved stoping efficiencies and plant recovery as
well as additional ore purchased from Mototolo (platinum production up 28% to 31,700 ounces,
palladium up 21% to 29,300 ounces). Kroondal PGM production rose 9% to 156,400 ounces due to
increased underground productivity (platinum and palladium up 9% to 74,500 ounces and 39,400
ounces respectively).

Purchases of PGM concentrate from associates

Purchase of PGM concentrate from associates declined 27% due to the closure of unprofitable ounces
from Bokoni which was placed on care and maintenance in Q3 2017, (platinum down 21% to 54,800
ounces, palladium down 37% to 22,100 ounces). PGM production from BRPM increased by 8% to
94,100 ounces due to the ramp up of the Styldrift project, in line with expectations, (platinum production
up 9% to 54,900 ounces and palladium production up 6% to 22,300 ounces).

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties increased 21% to 236,300 ounces. However, there
were lower purchases from other third parties (ex-Sibanye), including lower concentrate purchased from
Maseve as the mine was placed on care and maintenance in Q4 2017 removing loss making production.
Adjusting for Rustenburg mined production for October 2016 (pre-sale), the overall net movement from
third parties reduced 16% year-on-year.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production increased 10% to 1,455,600 ounces due to the lower refined volumes in Q4
2016 following the Waterval Smelter run-out in that period. Refined platinum production increased by
14% to 722,200 ounces, and refined palladium production increased by 24% to 491,400 ounces due to
significantly higher production from Mogalakwena.


PGM sales volumes increased 19% to 1,511,900 ounces in line with increased refined production and
the sell down of refined stock to normalised levels. Platinum sales increased 19% to 721,700 ounces
and palladium sales increased 32% to 473,500 ounces.

Anglo American Platinum trading statement for the twelve months ending 31 December 2017

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ending 31 December 2017 (""the
period"") on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 19 February 2018.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a
trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to
be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty, that due to cost reductions
and improved operational delivery across the Company, headline earnings and headline earnings per
share (""HEPS"") for the period will be at least 20% (R373 million or 143 cents per share) higher than
that reported for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016 (""the comparative period""). Headline
earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R1,867 million and 713 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") will also be at least 20% (R126 million or 48 cents
per share) higher than the comparative period. Basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were
R632 million and 241 cents respectively.

There is currently insufficient certainty to enable the Company to provide specific guidance on its
expected results and it is anticipated that Anglo American Platinum will publish a further trading
statement closer to the release of its annual financial results.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or
reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.

Anglo American Platinum update on the repositioning of the portfolio

Anglo American Platinum has made significant progress on the repositioning of its portfolio, continuing
to move its production down the cost curve and creating a more value enhancing portfolio. The
Company announced its intention to divest of assets which do not fit its long term strategy, including
Rustenburg (exit completed on 1 November 2016), Bokoni (placed on care and maintenance on
30 October 2017), Union, and the Pandora joint venture (""Pandora""), as well as the sale of long-dated
resources at Amandelbult. Progress has been made on the outstanding transactions as detailed below:

Completion of the disposal of long-dated Amandelbult resources to Northam

Anglo American Platinum announces the completion of the disposal of mineral resources within the
Amandelbult mining right to Northam Platinum Limited (""Northam"") on 6 December 2017. The Company
received a cash consideration of R1.0 billion which was used to reduce net debt.

Completion of the disposal of interest in Pandora joint venture

Anglo American Platinum announces the completion of the disposal of its loss-making 42.5% interest
in Pandora to Lonmin plc (""Lonmin"") for a deferred cash payment of a minimum of R400 million and a
maximum of R1.0 billion (both in nominal terms), based on 20% of free cash flow over six years; and
the use of and full operational control of Lonmin’s Baobab concentrator for a three year period
commencing on 1 December 2017.

Taking over operational control of Baobab concentrator will allow the Company to continue processing
excess ore from Mogalakwena mine and pursue optimisation initiatives at the Baobab concentrator.

Update on the progress of the disposal of Union mine

As announced on 15 February 2017, the Sale and Purchase Agreement to dispose of Anglo American
Platinum’s 85% interest in Union Mine and its 50.1% interest in MASA Chrome Company Proprietary
Limited (collectively ""Union and MASA"") to a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources Proprietary Limited
(""Siyanda""), was signed on 14 February 2017. Significant progress has since been made on completing
the conditions precedent, including approval from the South African competition authorities in
accordance with the Competition Act on 13 September 2017 and consent in terms of section 11 of the
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act on 7 November 2017. Anglo American Platinum
and Siyanda are working to ensure a smooth transition of Union and MASA to Siyanda. The Company
will provide a further update upon completion of the transaction.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the progress of the repositioning:

""We have made significant progress in the repositioning of our portfolio with the disposal of our 42.5%
interest in Pandora to our joint venture partner Lonmin, completing the disposal of long-dated resources
at Amandelbult to Northam and progressing the disposal of Union and MASA to Siyanda. We believe
we have delivered transactions that are beneficial for all parties involved, enabling a sustainable future
for the Pandora and Union mines. The benefits of operational control over the Baobab concentrator will
enable us to continue to unlock value at Mogalakwena mine, and the cash proceeds received from
Northam will allow us to further reduce our net debt position. We will continue to focus on completing
the disposal of Union and MASA, which is expected to occur in early 2018.""

Anglo American Platinum refers stakeholders to the announcement released by Lonmin plc on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Regulatory News Service of the
London Stock Exchange on 13 December 2017 regarding the Pandora Transaction.

OVERVIEW


- Tragically one fatality in Q3 2017

- Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) maintained at 621,400 ounces, with
  production efficiencies across the portfolio offset by the closure of unprofitable production at Bokoni

- Strong performances from own mine operations with Mogalakwena up 15% and Unki up 9%, partially
  offset by Amandelbult down 5%

- Joint venture production (mined and purchase of concentrate) down 4% due to a temporary stoppage
  of the concentrator at Mototolo, partially offset by strong performances from Modikwa and Kroondal

- Purchase of concentrate production from associates was down 5% primarily due to the decision to
  place Bokoni on care and maintenance and shut c.85,000 unprofitable ounces on an annualised
  basis, partially offset by a strong performance from BRPM

- Refined platinum production was up 29% quarter-on-quarter as part of the built-up inventory
  resulting from the planned Waterval smelter rebuild and the high pressure water-leak at the ACP
  earlier in the year was refined

- Sales volumes of 663,600 were up 13%


REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum tragically had one fatality in Q3 2017. Mr Douw Swart, an artisan boiler-maker
suffered a chemical burns related incident on 21 August 2017 at the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR)
and sadly succumbed to his injuries on 5 September 2017 in hospital. Our deepest condolences go to
his family, friends and colleagues. An independent and comprehensive investigation is under way to
understand the circumstances and learn from them in order to create a safer work environment for all.
The Company remains committed to zero harm.

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations has
seen a marginal improvement, reducing to 0.76 (Q3 2016: 0.78).

PRODUCTION

Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) was flat at 621,400 ounces with strong
performances from Mogalakwena, Unki and Union, partially offset by reduced production from Bokoni
mine which was placed on care and maintenance, as well as lower production from Mototolo.

Own mined production from managed mines

Own mine production decreased by 23% as a result of the sale of Rustenburg in November 2016, which
became third party purchase of concentrate.

Excluding Rustenburg, own mine production from managed mines increased 4% to 297,400 ounces.
Mogalakwena production increased 15% to 116,300 ounces due to a 5% increase in built-up head
grade in line with the mine plan, and a 6% increase in tons milled through the concentrators.

Amandelbult production decreased by 5% due to lower available ore reserves and increased
development as the mine transitions from Tumela Upper to Dishaba Lower UG2. This was partially
offset by increased production of lower grade surface material, with an overall 11% reduction in grade
compared to Q3 2016. Amandelbult production in Q3 2017 was up by 10% compared to Q2 2017.

Unki production was up 9% to 19,800 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control
have reduced mining waste, leading to increased grade and higher production.


Union production increased 6% to 39,900 ounces as a result of improved stoping efficiencies. The sale
of Union to Siyanda Resources was announced on 15 February 2017 and is expected to complete by
year-end, after which production from Union will be treated as purchase of concentrate from third parties.

Joint venture own mined production and purchase of concentrate

Total joint venture production and purchase of concentrate was down 4% to 124,400 ounces (of which
62,200 ounces is own mined production and 62,200 ounces is purchase of concentrate). Mototolo
production decreased by 49%. A decision was made to temporarily close the Mototolo concentrator
plant following seepage detected on the tailings dam wall. Our risk assessment indicated that deposition
on the tailings dam should cease until the remedial action has been completed, which should be by
year-end. Mototolo mine will continue to operate and stockpile the ore on surface for future treatment.
The impact of the temporary closure of the concentrator plant will impact production by c.45,000
platinum ounces in 2017. Alternative milling plans are being evaluated to assess the timing impact of
the mitigation plans.

The decrease at Mototolo was partially offset by Modikwa which increased by 10% to 37,200 ounces,
and Kroondal, which increased by 7% to 73,100 ounces due to production efficiencies.

Purchase of concentrate from associates

Purchase of concentrate from associates was down 5% to 73,500 ounces. Bokoni mine decreased by
32% due to the ramp-down of mining activity following the operation being placed on care and
maintenance in the quarter. This was concluded on 1 October 2017 and will result in a reduction of
unprofitable platinum ounces of c.20,000 in Q4 2017 and c.85,000 on an annualised basis. This was
partially offset by strong production from BRPM, which increased by 7% due to strong underground
production and ramp-up of Styldrift in line with mine plans.

Purchase of concentrate from third parties

Third party purchase of concentrate increased by 117,600 ounces to 126,200 ounces largely due to the
inclusion of material from Sibanye (formally Rustenburg), which has been reported as third party
purchase of concentrate since November 2016. Maseve produced 483 ounces for the period, as the
mine was placed on care and maintenance by the owners Platinum Group Metals Limited. This will
result in a reduction of c.60,000 platinum ounces of third party purchase of concentrate, if the mine had
been performing in line with ramp-up plans for 2017.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined platinum production decreased marginally by 2% to 684,100 ounces, as the comparative period
refined additional inventory that had built-up following a section 54 safety stoppage at the PMR in
Q1 2016. Refined platinum production was up 29% compared to Q2 2017, as additional inventory was
refined following the build-up as a result of the planned Waterval Number 2 furnace rebuild in Q1 2017,
and the high pressure water-leak at the ACP in Q2 2017. The remaining backlog in inventory will be
refined in Q4 2017. Sales volumes for the quarter of 663,600 ounces were up 13%.

GUIDANCE

Production guidance (metal in concentrate) has been revised to 2.30 - 2.35 million platinum ounces
(previous 2.35 – 2.40 million platinum ounces), due to c.90,000 ounces of unprofitable production from
Bokoni (c.30,000 ounces), which was placed on care and maintenance, and Maseve (c.60,000 ounces),
which will no longer produce third party purchase of concentrate. In addition, the temporary closure of
the Mototolo concentrator will impact full year production. Operational efficiencies across the portfolio,
especially at high-margin Mogalakwena have partially offset the reduction in unprofitable production.
As a result, refined production guidance has also been revised to 2.40 – 2.45 million platinum ounces
(previous guidance of 2.45 – 2.50 million platinum ounces). Refined production guidance is higher than
produced guidance as built-up pipeline inventory of c.100,000 ounces will be refined by year-end.

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the announcement released on 11 October 2016 in
respect of the disposal of long-dated resources within the Amandelbult mining right to Northam Platinum

As announced by Northam on 25 August 2017, Northam have received their consent from the Minister
of Mineral Resources in terms of section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development
Act, No. 28 of 2002 for the resource acquisition.

Anglo American Platinum has not yet received its consent from the Minister of Mineral Resources in
terms of section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, No. 28 of 2002 for the
resource disposal.

In addition to both companies needing section 102 consent, there is still a key condition precedent
remaining before the transaction can complete, specifically an Environmental Authorization as per the
requirements of the National Environmental Management Act, in order for Northam to mine the acquired
area.

20. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
This announcememt does not include information required pursuant to paragraph 15A(j) of IAS 34. The full interim report
is available on the Company's website, at the Company's registered office and upon request.


21. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Letters of comfort have been issued to financial institutions to cover certain banking facilities. There are no
encumbrances over Group assets.

The Group is the subject of various claims, which are individually immaterial and are not expected , in aggregate, to
result in material losses.

The Group has provided guarantees to certain financial institutions to cover various metal borrowing facilities. At 30
June 2017 these guarantees amounted to R1,177 million (30 June 2016: R1,322 million; 31 December 2016: R1,236 million).

The Group has, in the case of some of its mines, provided the Department of Minerals Resources with guarantees that
cover the difference between the closure costs and amounts held in the environmental trusts. At 30 June 2017, these
guarantees amounted to R2,619 million (30 June 2016: R3,567 million; 31 December 2016: R2,654 million).

22. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE FOR INVENTORY
During the current period, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a
physical count of in-process metals. The Group runs a theoretical metal inventory system based on inputs, the results
of previous counts and outputs. Due to the nature of in-process inventories being contained in weirs, pipes and other
vessels, physical counts only take place once per annum, except in the Precious Metal Refinery, where the physical
count is usually conducted every three years.

This change in estimate has had the effect of increasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements
by R942 million (30 June 2016: increase of R618 million; 31 December 2016: increase of R618 million). This results in
the recognition of an after tax gain of R678 million (30 June 2016: after-tax gain of R445 million; 31 December 2016:
after-tax-gain of R445 million).

23. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS
Impairment of equity investment in Bokoni Holdco and associated loan
Amplats has a 22.76% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco (which is equity accounted
as an associate).

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni Platinum Mine. Amplats' equity
interest was fully impaired at 31 December 2016. During the first half of 2017, after capitalising 49% of funding
provided to the mine, Amplats equity accounted losses of R161 million and impaired the remaining balance of R45
million. This impairment is excluded from headline earnings.

Atlatsa's ability to service its debt obligations in the context of the current market conditions, where Bokoni
Platinum Mine is its main source of funding, is doubtful. Amplats has impaired all but R201 million in funding provided
to Atlatsa. This resulted in an impairment loss for the period of R214 million, which is included in headline earnings.

Equity investment in Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine
The current level of the Royal Bafokeng Platinum share prices indicates that the Group's investment in BRPM may be
impaired. An impairment test was performed as at 30 June 2017 resulting in an impairment loss of R952 million, using
the implied value derived from the RB Plat share price of R34.18 at 30 June 2017. This is considered to be a level 2
fair value. The impairment loss is excluded from headline earnings.


24. DISPOSAL OF UNION MINE
As part of the Group's divesture initiatives, a binding sale and purchase agreement with a subsidiary of Siyanda
Resources was signed on 14 February 2017 for the Group's interest in Union Mine, which sets out the following key
commercial terms:

Initial purchase price of R 400 million.
Deferred consideration of 35% of net cumulative positive free cash flow for 10 years (with early settlement at the
option of the buyer).
Purchase of concentrate agreement for seven years with a toll arrangement from year eight onwards.

Amplats expects to incur an overall attributable, post-tax loss of between R1.5 billion and R1.9 billion on the
disposal of Union Mine.

This loss has been recognised in part by way of an impairment recognised in the financial results to 30 June 2017. As a
result of definitive agreements being signed, Union Mine has been considered separate from Amplats single cash-
generating unit as of this date and separately assessed for impairment. As such, the recoverable amount of the Union
Mine was calculated as the fair value of the estimated proceeds less costs of disposal, which comprises a level three
fair value. This has resulted in total attributable, post-tax impairment loss of R912 million. This impairment loss is
excluded from headline earnings.

At the effective date of disposal a further attributable, post-tax loss of between R500 million and R1 billion is
expected  due to:

The recycling of a non-controlling interest (NCI) balance in respect of Union Mine, which has arisen owing to AAP
funding the minority shareholder's share of cash calls in the past.
The tax effects of the disposal, which include the recycling of deferred tax associated with the disposed assets and
liabilities, deferred tax on the deferred consideration; and current tax implications.


25. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
In line with previously communicated strategy, Anglo American Platinum has taken a decision that it will not continue
to fund loss-making production from Bokoni. Anglo American Platinum's management effort and capital allocation is
focused on its lower-risk, lower-cost, higher-margin, and more mechanised mining operations. Anglo American Platinum
has notified Atlatsa that it will cease to fund its own, and Atlatsa's share of Bokoni mine's operating losses from 31
July 2017. It is expected that Bokoni will be placed on care and maintenance.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM - DELIVERING ON OUR VALUE DRIVEN STRATEGY IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT

Anglo American Platinum is delivering on its commitments by improving operational performance across the portfolio and
repositioning the portfolio to own and operate the highest margin assets in the platinum group metals (PGM) industry.
The strategy is focused on creating a value enhancing portfolio from mine to market and investing in the development of
demand for PGMs. Progress is on-going to divest of assets which are not strategic to the Company. In addition, the
Company continues to advance project studies to assess the most value accretive projects in the portfolio. The Company
is delivering on its commitments to build a resilient business for weak price environments, but positioned to benefit
in a stronger price environment.

Repositioning the portfolio

One of the core pillars of the Anglo American Platinum strategy is to complete the repositioning of the portfolio. 
The Company aims to own and operate the best assets in the PGM industry, moving down the cost curve and increasing 
the contribution from mechanised mining. The retained portfolio will consist of Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, joint
venture and associate operations Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM), Mototolo and Modikwa, and the downstream
processing assets. The portfolio will comprise at least 70% mechanised production resulting in lower costs, a more
highly skilled work force, safer operations and a less complex organisation with more modern mining operations.

Update on disposal processes

The exit operations comprise of Rustenburg (exit completed on 1 November 2016), Union, Pandora and Bokoni, as well as
the sale of non-core long-dated resources at Amandelbult. Progress has been made on the various transactions with
completion expected in H2 2017:

- The Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to dispose of Union mine to a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources (Siyanda) was
  signed on 14 February 2017. The Section 11 application to the DMR will be submitted shortly and is the key outstanding
  condition precedent (CP)
- The SPA to dispose of Anglo American Platinum's share of the Pandora JV to Lonmin plc (Lonmin) was signed on 10
  November 2016. The Competition Commission approval was granted on 17 May 2017, and consent was received from Northam
  (the minority partner) for the transaction to go ahead. The key outstanding CPs are the approval of the Section 11
  application which was lodged on 20 February 2017, and Lonmin lender approval
- The SPA to sell long-dated resources at Amandelbult to Northam was signed on 11 October 2016. The DMR Section 102
  approval is the only CP outstanding and was filed on 12 January 2017.

Kroondal is not seen as strategic to the Company given its short remaining life of mine, but it remains a cash
generative asset, and a transaction will only be pursued if it is value accretive.

Atlatsa Resources to place Bokoni on care and maintenance

Anglo American Platinum has undergone a rigorous process to ensure that all operations are cash flow positive. Anglo
American Platinum's management effort and capital allocation is focused on its lower-risk, lower-cost, higher-margin,
and more mechanised mining operations.

In 2013, the Company announced the intention to exit the non-managed associate operation, Bokoni. The mine underwent a
technical review to assess the mine extraction strategy, and to develop a path to a sustainable and optimised operation
with reduced costs in collaboration with Atlatsa Resources (Atlatsa), the JV's managing partner. As a result, two
unprofitable shafts, UM2 and Vertical shafts were placed on care and maintenance in Q4 2015, and in 2016 the opencast
operations at Bokoni were also placed on care and maintenance.

Further operational improvement plans were investigated, none of which could ensure that Bokoni would be a cash flow
positive business in the short to medium term. Despite these efforts Bokoni continues to be significantly cash negative
and would require substantial funding from Atlatsa and Anglo American Platinum (collectively Bokoni JV Partners). As
such, the Bokoni JV Partners are no longer able to continue funding loss-making production from Bokoni.

Shareholders are notified of the Atlatsa Resources announcement dated 21 July 2017 in which Atlatsa has commenced
the process to place Bokoni mine on care and maintenance. Bokoni Platinum Mines (Proprietary) Limited, as holder of the
mining rights and employer, have accordingly issued a notice, as contemplated in section 52 of the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Act to the Department of Mineral Resources and a notice in terms of section 189 of the
Labour Relations Act to all employees on 21 July 2017.

Anglo American Platinum has agreed to fund, via a loan account to Bokoni, all once-off costs associated with placing
the mine on care and maintenance, as well as ongoing care and maintenance costs up until 31 December 2019.

Conditional sale of Kwanda North and Central Block prospecting rights and debt write off

Anglo American Platinum has made a conditional offer to acquire the Kwanda North and Central Block prospecting rights
for a cash consideration of R300 million from Atlatsa. The transaction is subject to; inter alia, the following
conditions precedent:
- conclusion of definitive transaction agreements; and
- relevant regulatory approvals for a transaction of this nature including those required by the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Act, 28 of 2002 and registration by the Mineral and Petroleum Titles Registration Office to
complete Anglo American Platinum acquiring and including into its adjacent mining rights the resources specified in the
Central Block and Kwanda North prospecting rights.

Should the Asset Disposal be implemented, Anglo American Platinum has undertaken to, inter alia, to write off the
Atlatsa Group's indebtedness to Anglo American Platinum of c.R4.2 billion which will reduce Atlatsa Group's debt levels
to nil.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

Safety, Health & Environment

Tragically there were two fatalities due to work related incidents in H1 2017. Mr Nkoliseko Alfred Jikumlambo was
seriously injured in a fall of ground incident at Amandelbult's Tumela mine on 8 April 2017, and sadly passed away on
21 April 2017 in hospital. Mr Kagiso Zacharia Ramokgatla was fatally injured in a loader incident on 7 June 2017 at
Amandelbult's Dishaba mine.  Deepest condolences once again go to their families, friends and colleagues.

The safety aspiration remains to move towards zero harm, and despite these tragic incidents, Anglo American Platinum
has made significant progress in improving employee safety, health and wellbeing over the past decade, with significant
improvements in lost-time injury frequency rates and total recordable case frequency rates. As the portfolio of assets
is reconfigured, and given a material improvement in safety performance over time, there was a need to focus on how to
achieve the next step change in safety performance, advancing the commitment to zero harm. A revised safety, health and
environmental strategy was co-created with management, unions and employees during H2 2016 and implementation commenced
in H1 2017.

The revised safety strategy has five key focus areas including leadership and accountability, which focuses on the
creation of a leadership approach and culture conducive to innovation and safety performance improvement; re-
enforcement of compliance to standards and regulations; focus on engineered solutions and a  move up the 'hierarchy of
controls' through innovation and engineering capability so as to engineer out hazards; rigorous operational risk
management to ensure top risks and priority unwanted events are identified, assessed, and sound risk controls and
decision making is implemented; and leverage off learnings from incidents as well as operational and incident data
analysis to enable prioritization and take corrective action.

The Company has made significant progress on its disease management programme, increasing enrolment of over 70% of HIV
positive employees onto anti-retroviral therapy, ensuring greater Tuberculosis (TB) screening and administration of TB
prophylaxis (medication to prevent TB) which collectively have seen a decrease in TB cases and the number of TB deaths.

Anglo American Platinum has had no significant environmental incidents (on a Level 3-5 basis which refer to incidents
that might have a medium to major impact on the environment).

Operational performance

Total platinum production (both mined metal in concentrate and purchase of concentrate) increased 3% to 1,189,100
ounces (H1 2016: 1,152,700 ounces). Production is on track to meet year end guidance of 2.35 to 2.40 million platinum
ounces. The built up head-grade of 3.44g/tonne increased 13% due to the exclusion of Rustenburg and the Western Limb
Tailings which had a lower grade (H1 2016: 2.24 g/tonne). Platinum produced by own mines (Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and
Unki) increased 2% to 471,900 ounces (H1 2016: 461,300 ounces).

Mogalakwena
Production from Mogalakwena increased 9% to a record 225,800 ounces (including production from the Baobab concentrator
plant of 16,200). Production benefited from an increase in recoveries and grade, as well as an increase in tonnes
milled, which was seen across all three plants. Mogalakwena will produce between 410,000 - 420,000 platinum ounces in
2017, as the Zwartfontein pit will start production in H2, which has a higher grade but lower recovery.

As part of the transaction terms to sell the Company's stake in the Pandora joint venture to Lonmin, a three-year
contract was secured for the sole use and operational control of Lonmin's Baobab concentrator. This contract will
commence on completion of the transaction, and the current contract will be maintained until then.

Cash operating costs per platinum ounce, including capitalised waste stripping, were flat at R20,632 per platinum ounce
as a result of higher throughput. Despite the lower rand basket price environment, Mogalakwena maintained a 33% cash
operating margin.

Consistent with the strategy to optimise the performance of key assets, a low-cost, high-return, quick payback project
is being implemented that will upgrade both the dry and wet section of the North Concentrator Plant to increase
throughput. This project will yield c.15,000 ounces of platinum at steady state and will take 18 months to complete as
the majority of implementation will coincide with planned maintenance periods. The capex investment is a cost of c.R300
million.

Amandelbult

Amandelbult production reduced 4% to 207,700 ounces in the period (H1 2016: 217,100 ounces). The decrease in production
occurred during Q1 largely due to industrial action which resulted in loss of underground production for two days, and
excessive rainfall which constrained production from the open pit operations. The rainfall also impacted the material
flow of the UG2 feed in the chutes to the concentrators, which led to a backlog. The mine recovered in Q2 and
production was 4% higher than the same period in 2016. Platinum production guidance for the year remains at c.450,000
ounces.

Cash operating costs at Amandelbult increased by 12% to R4.4 billion (H1 2016: R3.9 billion) mainly due to mining
inflation, inclusion of chrome production costs that ramped up in 2016, as well as costs related to the future
replacement of production from the upper section of Tumela which will reach end of life by 2021. Historically this was
to be achieved via the sinking of the new Tumela 5 shaft from 2017. However, further evaluation of the asset base has
identified lower capital intensive replacement options from the UG2 reef at Dishaba which can be accessed via the
current infrastructure used for Merensky mining. The UG2 reef at Dishaba has a favourable prill split with high
platinum content as well as chrome content relative to other UG2 ore bodies on the Western limb. This replacement
production option requires minimal capital to replace the Tumela Upper section.

In preparation to transition from Tumela Upper to Dishaba, additional development and equipping needs to take place at
Dishaba to build up the ore reserves, which may reduce flexibility in mining for the next two years. Total production
from Amandelbult is expected to remain at current levels of platinum production of 450,000 ounces over that period.

Amandelbult successfully commissioned a new chrome plant at the mine in 2016 with steady-state production of 530,000
tonnes on an attributable basis expected in 2017. Even during ramp-up, the project achieved a six month payback period
for the full R400 million capital cost. Production in H1 2017 amounted to 276,300 tonnes of chrome concentrate. 
Amandelbult chrome has a low cost of production and generated cash flow of R261 million, despite the fall in the chrome 
price and the increase in chrome inventory in H1 2017.

Amandelbult is currently reviewing how to increase the profitability of the mine by reducing the all-in-sustaining
cost. The key steps to this strategy include: operational turnaround of the asset by increasing immediately stopeable
ore reserves (IMS) at Dishaba and implementing productivity improvements; developing the Dishaba UG2 project to mine
the UG2 reef at Dishaba utilising the existing Merensky infrastructure at minimal capital investment to replace Tumela
Upper; extracting the full value of metals mined and expanding chrome production; and assessing two capital light
replacement projects at Dishaba (15E and 62E).

Unki

Production from Unki mine in Zimbabwe increased by 5% to a new production record of 38,400 ounces (H1 2016: 36,400
ounces), driven by a 3% increase in tonnes milled and a 2% increase in the 4E built-up head grade to 3.48g/t from
3.40g/t through better mining reef cut, which reduced waste mining, resulting in more higher grade ore being delivered
to the concentrator. Platinum production guidance for the year is expected to be c.75,000 ounces.

Reported cash operating costs (the costs after allowing for off-mine smelting and refining activities) at Unki
decreased 6% to R881 million (1H 2016: R940 million). This decrease was driven primarily by the rand strengthening
against the dollar by 14%, as Unki is a dollar denominated operation. The mine kept on-mine costs in line with mining
inflation of 6%. The reported cash operating costs per platinum ounce for the year decreased 12% to R22,848 due to
improved production and lower rand costs.

Joint Ventures, associates and third parties

Platinum production from joint ventures and associates, inclusive of both mined and purchased production, decreased by
1% to 383,800 ounces (H1 2016: 388,300 ounces). BRPM production increased 8% to 99,300 ounces (H1 2016: 91,600 ounces)
due to the ramp-up of the Styldrift project in line with expectations, whilst Modikwa production increased 3% to 57,800
ounces (H1 2016: 56,000 ounces) due to increased stoping efficiencies from labour productivity improvements. Mototolo
production declined to 57,800 ounces (H1 2016: 62,000 ounces) due to lower grade while Kroondal production fell to
131,000 ounces (H1 2016: 137,300 ounces) due to lower grade and a two day illegal strike at two of their shafts. Bokoni
production declined to 37,900 ounces (H1 2016: 41,300 ounces) as a result of poor ground conditions and potholing as
well as a fatality and associated S54 stoppage earlier in the year.

Third party purchase of concentrate (POC) increased significantly to 255,900 ounces (H1 2016: 9,500 ounces) following
completion of the sale of Rustenburg to Sibanye and as a result production moved from own mined to third party purchase
of concentrate. Sibanye purchase of concentrate of 242,600 ounces made up the vast majority of the third party POC.
Third party purchased from Maseve increased slightly with H1 2017 production of 7,600 ounces (H1 2016: 4,400 ounces).

Non-core operations - Union

Union mine increased platinum production by 3% to 77,500 ounces (H1 2016: 75,500 ounces) due to improved crew
efficiencies in line with the optimised mine plan, despite a reduction in grade in Q2 due to mining less Merensky
material. Platinum production from Union is expected to be c.160,000 ounces in 2017. The sale of Union to Siyanda
Resources was announced on 15 February 2017 and is expected to be completed during 2017, after which Siyanda will sell
the produced concentrate to the Company.

Refined production & sales

Refined platinum production increased 10% to 1,105,600 ounces (1H 2016: 1,008,400 ounces), with Q1 2016 having been
materially impacted by a Section 54 safety stoppage at the Precious Metal Refinery (PMR).

Following the Waterval smelter run-out in Q3 2016, the Number 1 furnace at Waterval smelter was successfully rebuilt in
Q4 2016 and is running at steady-state in Q1 2017. The Waterval Number 2 furnace underwent a planned rebuild and has
been successfully ramped up to steady state. The backlog in processing pipeline material of 65,000 platinum ounces
following the run-out and rebuild is expected to be made up during H2 2017.

A high-pressure water leak at the Converter Plant (ACP) impacted one converter plant (Phase A) of the operation on 4
June 2017. The second converter plant (Phase B) which was on planned maintenance, was heated up and returned to steady
state production ten days later. The time required to reheat Phase B created a backlog of material, deferring c.90,000
ounces of refined production. The repair and maintenance of Phase A converter will cost c.R500 million, with R120
million expected in 2017 and will take between 9 to 12 months to repair and to get back to steady state.

The process operations are currently all operating at steady state. The Company continues to undergo planned
maintenance of all the processing operations, with the Mortimer smelter rebuild scheduled for 2018.

Platinum sales volumes decreased by 8% to 1,119,300 platinum ounces (H1 2016: 1,221,200 ounces). The result of the
planned rebuild of Waterval Number 2 furnace and ACP Phase A event has impacted refined production for the period, and
therefore lead to lower sales volumes. Sales are also impacted by a lower draw down from finished-goods inventory of
c.21,600 ounces compared to a drawdown of 150,000 ounces in H1 2016. It is anticipated that the increase in refined
production will be used to build-up finished inventory and will also result in increased sales in H2 2017.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Overview

Anglo American Platinum has further strengthened the balance sheet in the first half of 2017 reducing net debt to R5.9
billion as at 30 June 2017 from R7.3 billion at 31 December 2016. The reduction in net debt was driven primarily by a
reduction in working capital. As reported at 31 December 2016, the Company announced that the marketing function
engaged a key customer to advance a prepayment for future guaranteed delivery of metal.  The first payment of R2.0bn
was received in the final quarter of 2016 and the remainder of R2.3bn in H1 2017. This prepayment arrangement is part
of the Company strategy to strengthen the balance sheet.

Headline earnings decreased to R0.7 billion from the R1.6 billion for the first half of 2016. The lower earnings were
as a direct result of lower sales volume from mined production and a weaker basket price compared to H1 2016.  As a
result, headline earnings per share decreased to 285 cents per share from the restated 629 cents per share in H1 2016.

The Company has recorded attributable post-tax impairments totalling c.R2.2 billion impacting basic earnings of which
c.R0.3 billion impacts both basic and headline earnings. The impairments that impacted only basic earnings included
Union mine of c.R0.9 billion (consequent on the signature of agreements to sell the Company's interest in Union and
shareholding in Masa Chrome), equity interests in BRPM of c.R950 million and Bokoni Platinum Holdings of c.R45 million.

In addition, the Company wrote off term loan facilities advanced to Atlatsa of R0.2 billion and a loan to the Bakgatla
Ba-Kgafela of R0.1 billion related to their interest in Union, which has impacted headline earnings.

The group effective tax rate for H1 2017, adjusted for impairments, was 31.4% compared with the 29.9% recorded in H1
2016.

The increase in unit cost of production was up 3% compared to H1 2016, remaining below mining input cost inflation and
below guidance at R19,970 per platinum ounce.

Net Sales Revenue

Net sales revenue decreased by 11% to R27.3 billion, primarily due to lower PGM sales volumes and a significantly
stronger rand.

The average US dollar basket price per platinum ounce sold increased by 13% to USD1,843 from USD1,632 in H1 2016. The
average US Dollar sales price achieved on all metals improved, with the exception of platinum which was broadly flat at
USD957 per ounce. Palladium was up 42%, rhodium up 34%, nickel up 11% and copper up 25%.

The rand strengthened 14% to R13.24 (H1 2016: R15.38) and eroded the benefit from higher prices which resulted in a 3%
weaker Rand basket price of R24,400 compared to R25,100 in H1 2016.

Refined platinum sales for the period decreased by 8%, but were in line with refined platinum production, whilst sales
of refined palladium and rhodium decreased by 17% and 12% respectively. Nickel sales decreased by 13% whilst Chrome
sales increased by 38%.

Working capital

Working capital decreased by R0.4 billion to R7.6 billion as at 30 June 2017, due to the further customer prepayment of
R2.3 billion received in H1 2017, offset by an increase in work-in-progress material due to the rebuilds at the ACP and
smelters and a 76,000 platinum ounce stock count gain.  The temporary increase in work-in-progress material will reduce
in H2 2017 as the locked-up production from the smelter rebuilds and ACP incident will be refined and partially sold.

Costs

Cost of sales decreased by 9%, from R27.0 billion in H1 2016 to R24.5 billion mainly due to the increase in work-in-
progress material. Following the sale of Rustenburg operations in November 2016, the Company now has higher purchase of
concentrate costs and lower on-mine costs due to the purchase of concentrate from Sibanye.

Cash on-mine costs (mines and concentrators) decreased by R3.6 billion mainly due to the Rustenburg exit, partly offset
by input cost inflation. Excluding Rustenburg's on-mine costs from 2016, on-mine costs increased due to input cost
inflation and lower capitalised waste costs at Mogalakwena. Processing costs rose R0.4 billion to R3.0 billion, a 15%
increase due to a 10% increase in refined volume and inflationary increases. Costs for the purchase of metals increased
to R9.6 billion from R6.7 billion, principally due to additional volumes purchased from Sibanye.

Due to the improvement in the competitive position of the business through the exiting of loss making operations,
operating efficiencies and overhead reductions, the cash operating cost per platinum ounce rose by only 3% to R19,970.
This modest increase was mainly due to a reduction in Mogalakwena capitalised waste costs. Year-on-year this increased
unit costs by 2%, equivalent to R359 per platinum ounce.

EBITDA

EBITDA, before impairments, amounted to R4.0 billion, down 26%, compared to R5.4 billion in H1 2016. Uncontrollable
items which include inflation, US dollar metal prices and the rand/dollar exchange rate, reduced earnings by R1.5
billion. Operating costs and overhead were lower by R0.8 billion, including the benefit of a R0.3 billion stock count
gain compared to H1 2016, but was offset by lower sales volumes and higher losses from non-managed associates, mainly
Bokoni (R161 million) and Pandora (R32 million).

Cash flow

The Company generated cash flow from operations of R6.6 billion, which included the R2.3 billion customer prepayment.
The R4.3 billion cash generated by the underlying business, was used to pay capital expenditure and capitalised waste
stripping of R1.7 billion; taxes of R0.4 billion; interest of R0.6 billion; funding to Bokoni of R0.5 billion and other
expenditures of R0.5 billion.

Capital Expenditure

Total capital expenditure (excluding capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena) was R1.3 billion, a decrease of 6%
against the R1.4 billion spent in the comparative period as a result of lower project capital. SIB capital expenditure
of R1.1 billion, focused on safety-critical and business continuity projects, including the Waterval smelter rebuild.
Project capital was R0.2 billion, relating to the Unki smelter and Mogalakwena North concentrator optimisation. No new
major projects have been implemented.

Capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena decreased to R376 million from R616 million in H1 2016.

Net debt and dividend

Net debt at 30 June 2017 decreased to R5.9 billion from R7.3 billion at 31 December 2016, supported by net free cash
flow generated from the underlying business of R0.6 billion and the additional R2.3 billion customer prepayment, offset
by the Rustenburg purchase of concentrate pipeline payment of R1.5 billion.

The Company has increased liquidity headroom to R16.5 billion, comprising both undrawn committed facilities of R9.4
billion and cash of R7.1 billion and is comfortably within its debt covenants.

Owing to the net debt position of the Company, and considering future capital funding requirements in an uncertain
macroeconomic environment, the Board has decided not to declare a dividend in H1 2017.

Disciplined Capital Allocation

The Company will continue with disciplined capital allocation, prioritising the deleveraging of the balance sheet. The
focus remains on optimal stay-in-business capital allocation and the Company would like to re-introduce a sustainable
dividend once the balance sheet has strengthened.  In the current environment the focus will be on low capital, fast-
payback and value accretive projects.

MARKET REVIEW

Platinum

The platinum price fell to USD957 in H1 2017 from USD971 in H1 2016. The decline is partially a result of a stronger US
Dollar following expectations that the US Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in H2 2017, leading to
investment away from low-yielding commodities, including the precious metals.

Demand from the automotive sector is forecast to decline in 2017. Diesel's share of the European light duty vehicle
market, which contributes c.20% of global platinum demand, has fallen at a slightly faster rate than expected in H1
2017. Diesel has been the subject of significant negative news coverage which gained pace early in the year and the
Company expects that diesel share will continue to fall to c.30% by 2025 in the European light duty vehicle market. The
expected increase in light duty diesel outside Europe and heavy duty diesel is expected to offset some of the diesel
decline in Western Europe over the medium term as absolute numbers of these vehicles increase and as platinum loadings
increase to meet rising global emissions legislation.

The wider Chinese jewellery sector continues to struggle following a weak performance in 2016 and sales of platinum
jewellery are expected to fall once again, albeit at a slower pace of decline. There are areas of potential growth
elsewhere:  Indian demand is expected to see strong growth as the country's economic activity returns to normal
following the demonetisation in late 2016. In addition, India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) on gold and precious
metals, which came into force in July, has been set at 3%. Expectations were for GST of 5%, up from the previous level
of 2-2.5%. The proposed GST means prices for platinum jewellery will be broadly unchanged and we expect to see
increased buying of platinum in the country as a result.

Industrial demand for platinum remains strong and has grown since 2016. The chemical sector continues to be a major
purchaser of platinum for use as a clean catalyst in the manufacture of many basic chemicals. Electrical and electronic
demand for platinum has been strong and medical and biomedical demand remains robust. Net investment demand is expected
to be positive in 2017, albeit lower than H1 2016.

Palladium

Palladium has been one of the strongest performing commodities in H1 2017, with the price rising by 42% to USD780 (H1
2016: USD551). The ingot market tightened considerably in early June, demonstrating a lack of readily available metals,
with the spot price rising to over USD920, a fifteen year high. Demand for palladium is expected to outstrip supply in
2017. The automotive industry remains the principal user of this metal and, with global light duty vehicle sales
climbing year-on-year, demand from the sector has been strong in 2017 despite weakening growth in China and slowing US
vehicle sales.

Industrial demand remains robust. Net investment demand was more negative than in the same period a year earlier but
selling was slower than in H2 2016. Overall, palladium is expected to be in another substantial fundamental deficit in
2017.

Rhodium

The rhodium price increased from an average USD679 in H1 2016 to USD911 in H1 2017. Demand from the automotive sector
continues to grow due to tightening emission standards and rising global sales. The market continues to be well
supplied although growing industrial and investment demand means the annual surplus is expected to fall this year.

Minor Metals

The prices of both ruthenium and iridium increased in H1 2017, with ruthenium increasing to USD48 an ounce (H1 2016: USD41)
and iridium increasing to USD804 per ounce (H1 2016: USD514). Demand for both metals is strong, from the chemical and
electrical sectors.

Secondary supply

Recovery of platinum from end-of-life autocatalysts is expected to climb by 8% in 2017 (Johnson Matthey's Platinum 2017
report) but still remains below the peak in 2014. Palladium recovery is forecast to increase by more than 10% year-on-
year. This difference in growth rates reflects the substantial growth in use of palladium on gasoline and also on
diesel catalysts since the start of the millennium. Recovery of platinum from the jewellery sector is likely to fall
this year due to lower recycling of unsold stock by Chinese retailers and wholesalers.

Automotive

Global light-vehicle sales have expanded 2.8% in the first half of 2017 to a record 46.8 million units, a positive for
demand for PGMs. Sales in Europe, Japan and South America in particular have been strong. In the USA, sales have fallen
by 2% compared to the same period in 2016. However, demand for palladium and rhodium from the region is expected to
grow as tighter emissions legislation leads to higher loadings per vehicle. In China, the sales tax payable on the
purchase of smaller vehicles was increased from 5% to 7.5% in January. Despite this, light duty vehicle sales have
continued to grow in China but at a significantly slower rate than in 2016.

The outlook for the diesel engine remains a key concern after the emissions scandal of 2015. Diesel's share of the
light duty vehicle market in Europe has fallen to c.46%. This decline is concentrated predominantly in France, Germany,
Spain and the UK. These are all countries where major cities have suggested some or all diesel vehicles might be banned
or their use penalised in the future. While electric vehicles of all types - both battery electric vehicles and their
fuel cell equivalents - are receiving extensive media coverage, their market share remains small accounting for less
than 1% of sales in most countries across Europe. Diesel remains extremely important for light and heavy-duty vehicle
manufacturers and their ability to meet carbon-dioxide emission targets, and is likely to retain a strong position
among larger vehicles where diesel efficiency provides a superior economic performance.

Heavy duty diesel is a growing source of demand for platinum for use in emissions after-treatment. Vehicle numbers are
expected to increase by a CAGR of 3% over the next decade and emissions limits will tighten. China will implement new
emissions rules in 2017 and again in 2019 and this could boost demand by 200,000 ounces of platinum annually, and
tighter rules will also be implemented in India over a similar timescale.

Electrification of the drive train

There has been considerable focus on the continuing electrification of the drivetrain, culminating in Volvo Car's
announcement that all of its new models launched from 2019 will be part-electrified and France's plans to ensure that
all cars sold there from 2040 are electrified. These plans currently indicate that hybrid electric-internal combustion
engine vehicles will be a very significant part of the future both for Volvo and within France. Current catalyst
technology means that PGM loadings are similar on conventional and hybrid vehicles, so hybridisation itself poses
little direct threat to PGM demand.

Nonetheless, improvements in battery technology and recharging infrastructure mean that the battery electric vehicle is
likely to expand its share of the market from its current low levels. It is, though, notable, that fuel cells are
making considerable progress as an alternative route to electrify the car. The Chinese Government has plans for a
million fuel cell cars to be sold in 2030, something that could create a substantial new source of platinum demand, and
concrete progress is being made in larger vehicles today by the provision of generous subsidies for manufacturers of
fuel cell buses and trucks.

Jewellery

Gross global jewellery purchases of platinum are likely to fall for a third year in 2017 but at a slower rate than in
2016. The major negative factor continues to be slowing jewellery sales - both of pure gold and of platinum - in China,
which is the largest jewellery purchaser of platinum.  After a period of rapid expansion, the Chinese jewellery retail
sector has come under margin pressure and is going through a period of change while business models adapt to this.
Sales of plain platinum jewellery have come under pressure as a result but the gem-set and bridal sectors have
performed better. Falling jewellery recycling means that net demand here should be relatively stable in 2017.

Outside China, platinum jewellery markets continue to grow. In India, the platinum Evara brand continues to perform
well, demonstrating the success of the Platinum Guild International's approach to marketing in this country. They have
done this by working carefully with manufacturers to improve product quality, design and availability, and by working
with retailers to make platinum more visible and helping staff understand the emotional context of platinum jewellery
and what it offers the consumer. Following the setback caused by demonetisation in late 2016, jewellery demand in the
Indian market is growing and should meet the aspiration of becoming a 500,000 platinum ounce annual market by 2022. In
Japan, the PGI has focused some of its marketing on the older generation who hold a significant proportion of the
country's wealth. The platinum jewellery market in Japan is expected to continue to show modest growth in 2017 and
there is potential for further growth in US demand through the greater use of platinum in diamond ring settings.

Industrial

Industrial demand for platinum and the PGMs remain robust, particularly from the chemical and electrical
sectors. The IMF currently forecasts growth of 3.5% in global GDP this year, with Chinese growth expected to be close
to twice as rapid, and this is supportive of PGM demand. PGMs are used in the clean production of a number of chemicals
and the continuing improvement in the environmental performance of the Chinese chemical sector is therefore positive
for PGM consumption. The use of these metals in applications from anti-cancer treatments to the glass sector further
underpins demand.

Investment

Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) flows in platinum have been positive in the first six months of the year at c.122,000 ounces
(compared to net outflows of 55,000 ounces in 2016). Japanese investment demand remained positive in H1 although it has
weakened compared to 2016. Prices did not dip to sufficiently low levels in Yen terms to stimulate the strong buying
that took place in 2016. Elsewhere, the US Mint produced and sold 20,000 ounces of platinum eagle coins in January,
illustrating that there is pent-up demand for platinum as an investment material, an area that is being addressed by
the World Platinum Investment Council.

Palladium investment demand has been less positive despite its healthy fundamentals as investors continue to sell into
price strength. Palladium ETFs have decreased by 200,000 ounces year to date in 2017. However, with ETF holdings at
their lowest since early 2010, if the high prices seen in June are repeated in the second half of the year it could
encourage new investors to start buying palladium.

Market development

Anglo American Platinum continues to believe in the importance of market development and investing to stimulate demand
is therefore of key strategic importance. The Company invests in market development across a number of demand segments,
through a range of approaches that are appropriate for each activity:

Jewellery demand is developed through the Platinum Guild International (PGI). India has been a notable success story,
with demand performing well despite the challenging economic conditions seen last year as manufacturers, retailers and
consumers each see benefits available from platinum. The PGI is also focusing on further developing platinum's link to
love in the Chinese market to bolster demand for bridal jewellery and gifting. Opportunities exist to leverage from the
experience in India and apply those to building a market for men's platinum jewellery in the Middle East.

A number of South African PGM producers, including Anglo American Platinum, contribute to developing investment demand
through the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC). The WPIC has developed a multifaceted strategy which includes
improving product availability and the provision of data to allow more informed investor decisions. The WPIC is working
on the development of new types of physically-backed products, in conjunction with partners like the UK's Bullion
Vault, which launched a platinum product in conjunction with its other precious metal products. It has also recently
announced talks with organisations in China and India over the introduction of a platinum ETF. The WPIC have also
joined with Muthoot Exim, an Indian company which specialises in offerings in the precious metals space, to launch
India's first non-jewellery platinum products ""Anantavarsham"" in the form of religious figurines (deities).

Through the Anglo American Platinum investment fund, the Company takes stakes in companies that use new technologies
that use or enable the use of PGM metals. Investments have been focussed on the fuel cell value chain, but the strategy
has broadened to other areas of demand. For example, the investment in Greyrock. This company has developed a
proprietary technology allowing it to turn gas that would otherwise be flared from oil production into premium diesel
using a PGM-based catalyst. This has a direct environmental benefit in limiting carbon dioxide emissions caused by
flaring; has the potential to drive PGM demand directly through its requirements for a catalyst; and would provide an
additional source of hydrogen as a by-product, with the potential to support fuel production for fuel cell vehicles.

Anglo American Platinum is also active in developing and promoting the hydrogen economy and the potential use of
platinum-based fuel cells in combating climate change. Anglo American Plc has joined the Hydrogen Council as a founder
member. This association of over fifteen major industrial companies aims to accelerate the development and
commercialisation of the hydrogen and fuel cell sectors and to encourage key stakeholders to back hydrogen as part of
any future energy mix. As well as this work, the Company supports a number of infrastructure and demonstration projects
and has invested in a number of companies whose commercial success could be key in driving demand for our metals
through addressing specific areas in the hydrogen and fuel cell value chain.

SOUTH AFRICAN REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

On 15 June 2017, the South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) published its Reviewed Mining Charter 2017
(MCIII). Anglo American Platinum has expressed concern that, unlike the collaborative process for agreeing the 2004 and
2010 Mining Charters, the MCIII was not concluded through agreement between the DMR and all relevant stakeholders,
including the mining industry, despite the best efforts of those stakeholders over the preceding year. Unfortunately,
the practical experience of the mining industry in implementing the previous Mining Charters - which themselves have
contributed to the achievement of the significant transformation that exists across the South African mining industry
today - was not taken into account in the development of MCIII.

Anglo American Platinum is supportive of the legal course of action being followed by the Chamber of Mines, with the
ultimate objective of arriving at a solution that is practically implementable and that preserves and enhances
investment in what is a critically important industry for South Africa. In the absence of new investment, South Africa
will fail to deliver the economic growth required to create greater levels of employment and socio-economic uplift for
the benefit of all South Africans. Anglo American Platinum is committed to meeting South Africa's transformation
objectives and has been a longstanding and major contributor to the country's transformation, pre-dating such
regulatory targets.

Anglo American Platinum welcomes the decision by the ANC at its recent policy conference that further discussion on
MCIII is required with the mining industry in order to ensure that investment and employment levels are not negatively
affected. Anglo American Platinum awaits clarity on how this discussion process will unfold and will also continue to
engage through the Chamber of Mines.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT

There have been no material changes to the mineral resource and reserve estimates as disclosed in the 2016 annual
report.

OUTLOOK

In view of the current and expected market conditions for PGMs, Anglo American Platinum remains focused on its strategy
to build a resilient business. The Company has positioned itself to manage through the current environment. Stringent
cost controls have been implemented, and restructuring remains ongoing, with Bokoni to be placed on care and
maintenance by the managing joint venture partner Atlatsa.

Market outlook

Platinum is likely to be in a modest surplus in 2017, with supply outweighing demand. Primary supply of platinum is
expected to slip marginally lower than in 2016, and the combined recovery of platinum from end-of-life autocatalysts
and recycled jewellery should also decline. Looking at demand, purchasing of platinum by the automotive sector is
expected to decrease this year, reflecting a decline in the share of the European light duty vehicle sector taken by
the diesel engine and changes to lower metal content in the catalyst technology being fitted to some of these cars.
Jewellery demand too seems likely to fall modestly year-on-year: the wider Chinese jewellery sector is likely to shrink
this year, although at a slower pace than was the case in 2016; jewellery demand in other regions is set to strengthen.
Industrial demand continues to be strong. Net investment demand is expected to be positive this year but the very
strong buying that took place in Japan in 2015 and again in 2016 has not recurred yet this year, and it currently seems
unlikely that investors will push this metal into deficit this year.

In contrast, palladium is expected to be in a substantial deficit in 2017 and again over the next few years. Mine
supply is likely to fall slightly, in line with lower sales of platinum but, unlike platinum, recycling of palladium is
set to increase this year. Demand for palladium is dominated by its use in the automotive sector and, despite a
slowdown in US light duty vehicle sales and slowing growth in China, global vehicle sales are expected to increase this
year. With emissions legislation being progressively tightened in a number of countries, average catalyst loadings
should rise and automotive palladium demand should further strengthen. Even with some net disinvestment of physical
palladium taking place, total palladium demand should climb further to a new annual record in 2017.

Operational outlook

Platinum production (metal-in-concentrate) is expected to remain within guidance of 2.35-2.40 million platinum ounces.
Refined production should be higher in H2 2017, as a result of refining the build-up in work-in-progress inventory of
65,000 platinum ounces from the smelter run out in Q4 2016, and the ACP high pressure water leak which deferred
refining c.90,000 ounces. Refined platinum production guidance is 2.45 to 2.50 million ounces for 2017.

Financial Outlook

The unit cost guidance remains between R20,350 and R20,850 per platinum ounce (M&C). The Company reiterates that the
decrease in capitalised waste costs at Mogalakwena will add around R400 per ounce to unit costs for 2017.

Capital expenditure guidance for the year remains between R3.7 billion to R4.2 billion excluding capitalised waste
stripping. SIB capital is expected to be between R2.9 billion and R3.2 billion with project capital estimated between
R0.8 billion and R1.0 billion. In addition, capitalised waste stripping will be around R0.8 billion for the year.

The disposal processes for the exit of Union, Pandora and the long-dated Amandelbult resources will continue and are
expected to be completed in H2 2017, subject to the timing of the relevant DMR approvals.

OVERVIEW


- Tragically two fatalities in Q2 2017

- Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) increased 5% to 617,100 ounces

- Strong performances from own mine operations with Mogalakwena up 15%, Amandelbult up 4%
  and Unki up 10%

- Total purchase of concentrate (joint venture, associates and third party) increased by 89% due to the
  inclusion of material from Sibanye (formally Rustenburg)

- Refined platinum production decreased by 29% to 528,700 ounces. There has been a build-up of
  work in progress inventory as a result of the Waterval Furnace Number 1 run-out in Q4 2016, and
  the planned rebuild of Waterval Number 2 Furnace which delayed 65,000 ounces of refined
  production into H2 2017

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS


Anglo American Platinum tragically had two fatalities in Q2 2017. Mr Nkoliseko Jikumlambo was
seriously injured in a fall of ground incident at Amandelbult’s Tumela mine on 8 April 2017 and sadly
passed away on 21 April in hospital. Mr Kagiso Ramokgatla was fatally injured in a loader incident on
7 June 2017 at Amandelbult’s Dishaba mine. Deepest condolences go to their families, friends and
colleagues. Comprehensive independent investigations into these fatal incidents are under way to
understand the circumstances and learn from them in order to create a safer work environment for all,
and the Company remains committed to zero harm.

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations has
seen a significant improvement, reducing 13% to 0.63. (Q2 2016: 0.73).

Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) increased 5% to 617,100 ounces with
strong performances from Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and Unki. The increase in production is despite
the Twickenham project being placed on care and maintenance in the second half of 2016, reducing
unprofitable platinum production by 1,900 ounces.

With the sale of Rustenburg in November 2016, production is now treated as third party purchase of
concentrate from Sibanye, resulting in own mine production decreasing by 22%.

Mogalakwena production increased by 15% to 113,900 ounces due to a strong increase in built-up head
grade of 7% resulting from mining in a particular high grade area in line with the mine plan, and a 9%
increase in concentrator throughput due to North Concentrator Plant optimisations which increased the
runtime.

Amandelbult production increased by 4% to 110,500 ounces due to improved plant recoveries and
increased throughputs from underground sources.

Unki production was up 10% to 19,500 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control
have reduced mining waste, leading to increased grade and higher production.

Union production decreased by 3% to 39,800 ounces due to a reduction in mining of Merensky ore
which reduced the overall grade. The sale of Union to Siyanda Resources was announced on 15
February 2017 and is expected to complete by year-end.

Joint venture and associates production (mined and purchased) was down 1% to 201,100 ounces
(64,300 ounces relating to own mined share of joint ventures and 136,800 ounces purchase of
concentrate from joint ventures and associates). Production from BRPM was up 10% to 52,900 ounces
as the Styldrift project ramps up in line with expectations. Modikwa was also up 2% to 32,000 ounces
as a result of stoping efficiencies and improvements in productivity. Production from Bokoni, Mototolo
and Kroondal offset these increases, with Bokoni down 10% to 19,500 as a result of the closure of the
opencast operations and safety related stoppages; Mototolo down 7% to 29,500 as a result of lower
grade and Kroondal down 5% to 67,100 primarily due to lower grade and a plant shutdown which
impacted production for 7 days.

Third party purchase of concentrate increased by 126,400 ounces to 132,300 ounces largely due to the
inclusion of material from Sibanye (formally Rustenburg), which has been reported as third party
purchase of concentrate since November 2016. Other third party purchases, largely from Maseve
increased to 4,300 ounces (Q2 2016: 3,100 ounces) as the mine ramps up.

Refined platinum production decreased by 29% to 528,700 ounces primarily due to the planned
Waterval Number 2 Furnace rebuild and a high pressure water leak at the Converter Plant.
Following the Waterval smelter run-out in Q3 2016, the Number 1 furnace was successfully rebuilt in
Q4 2016 and is running at steady-state. The Number 2 furnace underwent planned maintenance and
has successfully ramped up to steady-state. The backlog in processing pipeline material of 65,000
platinum ounces following the run-out in 2016 is expected to be made up during H2 2017.

A high-pressure water leak at the Converter Plant impacted one converter plant (Phase A) of the
operation on 4 June 2017. The second converter plant (Phase B) was heated up and returned to steady
state production 10 days later. The time required to reheat Phase B created a backlog of material,
deferring 90,000 ounces of refined production from Q2 2017 into H2 2017. The result of the planned
rebuild of Waterval Number 2 furnace and ACP Phase A event has impacted refined production for the
period, and therefore lead to lower sales volumes.

Sales volumes for the quarter of 600,500 ounces were down 26% due to the decrease in refined
platinum production, however was more than refined production of 528,700 ounces, due to reducing
refined inventory to normalised levels, which had been built in Q2 2016 during the PMR stoppage.

GUIDANCE

Full year production guidance remains unchanged at 2.35 – 2.40 million platinum ounces.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (“the period”) on the
Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 24 July 2017.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s trading statement released on SENS on 27 June 2017 in
which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the
period were expected to be at least 20% (R329 million or 126 cents per share, respectively) lower than
for the comparative reporting period for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (“comparative period”) and
that basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period were also expected to be at least
20% (R308 million or 118 cents per share, respectively) lower than for the comparative period.

On the basis that the comparative period financial results were restated in the 2016 Annual Results,
shareholders are reminded as follows:

                                     Reported                            Restated
 Headline earnings                   R1.04 billion                       R1.65 billion
 HEPS                                399 cents                           629 cents
 Basic earnings                      R938 million                        R1.54 billion
 EPS                                 358 cents                           588 cents



Shareholders are advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the period are likely to decrease to between
R550 million and R875 million (or between 67% and 47% lower than the prior year restated figure of R1.65
billion) and to between 210 cents and 335 cents per share (or between 67% and 47% lower than the prior
year restated figure of 629 cents) respectively.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to decrease to between a loss of R1,065 million and a
loss of R1,370 million (or between 169% and 189% lower than the prior year restated figure of R1.54
billion) and to between a loss of 405 cents and a loss of 520 cents per share (or between 169% and 188%
lower than the prior year restated figure of 588 cents) respectively.

The expected decrease in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily a result of attributable post-
tax impairments totalling c.R2.2 billion impacting basic earnings of which c.R0.3 billion impacts both basic
and headline earnings. The impairments that impacted only basic earnings included Union mine of
c.R0.9 billion (consequent on the signature of agreements to sell the Company’s interest in Union and
shareholding in Masa Chrome), equity interests in BRPM of c.R950 million and Bokoni Platinum Holdings
of c.R45 million. The impairments that impacted basic and headline earnings include the write down of a
term loan to Atlatsa and a loan to the Bakgatla Ba-Kgafela Community related to their interest in Union.

In addition, expected headline and basic earnings are lower due a significant strengthening of the rand in
H1 2017 compared to H1 2016, as well as lower sales volumes. Sales volumes were impacted by refined
production.

Refined production was impacted by the Waterval Furnace Number 1 smelter run-out in Q3 2016, which
was successfully rebuilt in Q4 2016 and is running at steady-state. Waterval Number 2 furnace underwent
a planned rebuild in Q1 2017 and has successfully ramped up to steady-state. The result of the run-out in
2016 is a backlog in processing pipeline material of 65,000 platinum which is expected to be made up
during H2 2017.

A high-pressure water leak at the Converter Plant (ACP) impacted one converter plant (Phase A) of the
operation on 4 June 2017. The second converter plant (Phase B) was heated up and returned to steady
state production 10 days later. The time required to reheat Phase B created a backlog of material,
deferring 90,000 ounces of refined production from Q2 2017 into H2 2017.The result of the planned rebuild
of Waterval Number 2 furnace and ACP Phase A event has impacted refined production for the period,
and therefore lead to lower sales volumes.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company’s external auditors.

Anglo American is a globally diversified mining business. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the raw materials to meet the growing consumer-driven
demands of the world’s developed and maturing economies. Our people are at the heart of our business.
It is our people who use the latest technologies to find new resources, plan and build our mines and who

other precious metals and copper – to our customers around the world.

As a responsible miner, we are the custodians of those precious resources. We work together with our
key partners and stakeholders to unlock the long-term value that those resources represent for our
shareholders, but also for the communities and countries in which we operate – creating sustainable
value and making a real difference.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 24 July 2017.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a
trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty, that headline earnings and
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 will be at least 20% (R329
million or 126 cents per share) lower than the comparative reporting period for the six months ended 30
June 2016 (“the comparative period”). Restated headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period
were R1.65 billion and 629 cents respectively. Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) will
also be at least 20% (R312 million or 118 cents per share) lower than the comparative period. Restated
basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R1.54 billion and 589 cents respectively.
Shareholders are reminded that the comparative period financial results were restated in the 2016 Annual
Results. For reference, reported headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period before
restatement were R1.04 billion and 399 cents respectively, and reported basic earnings and EPS for the
comparative period before restatement were R938 million and 358 cents respectively.

The expected decrease in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily a result of the stronger rand.
The build-up of work-in-progress material of 65,000 platinum ounces as a result of the rebuild of Waterval
Furnace Number 1 in Q4 2016, followed by the planned rebuild of Waterval Furnace Number 2 in Q1 2017
will result in this material being refined in H2 2017 as expected. Waterval Furnace Number 2 is operating
at steady state. In addition, a high pressure water leak at the Converter Plant (“ACP”) impacted one
converter plant (Phase A) of the operation on 4 June 2017, towards the end of the period. A second
converter plant (Phase B) was heated up and returned to steady state production on 14 June 2017. The
time required to reheat Phase B created a build-up of work-in-progress material which will delay c.90,000
ounces of refined platinum production from the period into H2 2017. There is no impact to full year
production, with guidance maintained at metal in concentrate production of between 2.35 – 2.40 million
ounces.

There is currently insufficient certainty to enable the Company to provide specific guidance on its expected
results and it is anticipated that Anglo American Platinum will publish a further trading statement closer to
the release of its interim financial results which will be released on 24 July 2017 on the Stock Exchange
News Service.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the Company’s external auditors.

REVISED ANNOUNCEMENT: DEALING IN SECURITIES BY DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY
AND BY DIRECTORS OF A MAJOR SUBSIDIARY

Investors are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 9 May 2017, which
dealt with the allocation of BSP awards. A subsequent adjustment to the
allocation share price, to exclude costs in line with the rules of the scheme,
has resulted in an update to the number of shares awarded to directors, as
reflected below. The value of the award remains unchanged. As required in terms
of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, Anglo American Platinum advises of the
allocation of annual awards of Bonus Shares in terms of the company’s Bonus
Share Plan (“BSP”). The applicable vesting period relating to the BSP shares is
three years. The details of the scheme are set out in the Remuneration Report
contained within the 2016 integrated report.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2017

OVERVIEW

- Commitment to zero harm – no fatalities in Q1 2017

- Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) increased 1% to 571,900 ounces

- Strong performances from Mogalakwena up 3% offsetting operational challenges at Amandelbult

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to zero harm and had no fatalities in Q1 2017. The Lost
Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations was broadly
flat at 0.74 compared to 0.73 in Q1 2016.
Total platinum production (metal in concentrate) was up 1% to 571,900 ounces with strong
performances from Mogalakwena offsetting operational challenges at Amandelbult. The increase in
production is despite the Twickenham project being placed on care and maintenance in the second half
of 2016, reducing unprofitable platinum production by 1,100 ounces.

With the sale of Rustenburg in November 2016, production from that operation is now treated as third
party purchase of concentrate, resulting in own mine production decreasing by 26%

Mogalakwena production increased by 3% to 111,900 ounces with strong plant recoveries and
increased throughput.

Amandelbult production decreased by 12% to 97,100 ounces primarily due to unusually heavy rainfall
resulting in flooded opencast pits and affected feed chutes to the concentrator plants, as well as minor
industrial action which impacted production for two days.

Unki production was up 2% to 18,900 ounces, as continued efforts in efficient mining height control
have reduced mining waste, leading to increased grade and higher production.

Union increased production by 10% to 37,700 ounces due to improved crew efficiencies, and mining
ground closer to the access shafts in line with the optimised mine plan. The sale of Union to Siyanda
Resources was announced on 15 February 2017 and is expected to complete during 2017.

Joint venture production (mined and purchased) was down marginally to 182,700 ounces (59,000
ounces relating to own mined share of joint ventures and 123,700 ounces purchase of concentrate from
joint ventures and associates). Lower production was primarily due to a two day illegal strike and lower
grade impacting Kroondal, lower grade in the current mining area at Mototolo, and a tragic fatality and
subsequent Section 54 safety stoppage which impacted production at Bokoni. This was partially offset
by increased production at BRPM’s Styldrift project and higher production at Modikwa following
extensive focus on improving plant recoveries.

Third party purchase of concentrate increased by 119,900 ounces largely due to the inclusion of
material from Rustenburg including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment (117,600 ounces), since
the transfer of these operations to Sibanye on 1 November 2016. Other third party purchases, largely
from Maseve increased to 3,200 ounces from 1,200 as the mine ramps up.

Refined platinum production increased by 316,100 ounces to 576,900 ounces, with Q1 2016 refined
production having been materially impacted by a Section 54 safety stoppage at the Precious Metal
Refinery.

Following the Waterval smelter run-out in Q3 2016, the Number 1 furnace at Waterval smelter was
successfully rebuilt in Q4 2016 and is running at steady-state. The Number 2 furnace underwent
planned maintenance and has now been successfully rebuilt. It is ramping-up to full capacity, which is
expected in Q2 2017. The backlog in processing pipeline material of 65,000 platinum ounces following
the run-out should be made up during 2017.

Sales volumes for the quarter of 518,800 ounces were up 26% due to the increase in refined platinum
production, however was less than refined production of 576,900 ounces, due to rebuilding refined
inventory, which had been drawn down in 2016 to supplement sales during the PMR stoppage.

GUIDANCE

Full year production guidance remains unchanged at 2.35 – 2.40 million ounces.

NOTICE OF DISPOSAL OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN TERMS OF SECTION 122(1)(b) OF THE
COMPANIES ACT

In accordance with section 122(3)(b) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008 (""Companies Act""), and
paragraph 3.83(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, Anglo American Platinum advises its
shareholders that Anglo American plc (“Anglo American”) has transferred its entire 77.69% beneficial
interest in the Company from one subsidiary in South Africa to another.

This transfer is administrative in nature and has no impact on Anglo American’s beneficial interest in
Anglo American Platinum.

Specifically, Anglo South Africa Capital Proprietary Limited (""ASAC""), all of the ordinary shares of which
are owned by Anglo American, has disposed of its entire 77.69% beneficial interest in the issued
ordinary shares (""Ordinary Shares"") of the Company such that as a result ASAC no longer holds any
beneficial interest in the Company. Anglo American South Africa Investments Proprietary Limited, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American, has acquired that same beneficial interest in the Ordinary
Shares of the Company such that as a result it now holds a beneficial interest in the Company of 77.69%
of the Ordinary Shares.

As required in terms of section 122(3)(a) of the Companies Act, the Company has filed the required
notices with the Takeover Regulation Panel.

12. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The following is an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. They are grouped into levels
1 to 3 based on the extent to which the fair value is observable.

The levels are classified as follows:
Level 1 - fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - fair value is determined using directly observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs.
Level 3 - fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data.

12. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES continued
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values
Level 2 fair values for other current financial liabilities relate specifically to forward foreign exchange contracts.

The valuation of forward foreign exchange contracts is a function of the ZAR:USD exchange rate at balance sheet date and the forward exchange rate that
was fixed as per the forward foreign exchange rate contract.

Level 2 fair values for trade and other payables relate specifically to purchase of concentrate trade creditors which are priced in US dollars. The
settlement of these purchase of concentrate trade creditors takes place on average three to four months after the purchase has taken place. The fair value
is a function of the expected ZAR:USD exchange rate and the metal prices at the time of settlement.

Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets at fair value
The Level 3 fair value of other financial assets comprises investments in unlisted companies Food Freshness Technology Holdings and Greyrock Energy Inc,
which are classified as available-for-sale in terms of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the deferred consideration on the
disposal of the Rustenburg Mine which is classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values are based on unobservable
market data, and estimated with reference to recent third party transactions in the instruments of the Company, or based on the underlying discounted cash
flows expected.

The Level 3 fair value of other financial liabilities comprises the components of the deferred consideration on the disposal of the Rustenburg Mine,
payable to Sibanye, which is classified as a financial liability at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value is based on the underlying
discounted cash flows expected.

13. UNKI PLATINUM MINE INDIGENISATION PLAN
Following approval of its indigenisation plan by the government of Zimbabwe, Amplats signed a Heads of Agreement with the government of
Zimbabwe in November 2012 that set out the key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for the Company's Unki mine investment. The plan has not yet been
implemented.

In early April 2016, President Mugabe issued a press statement which sought to clarify the government of Zimbabwe's position on the indigenisation and
economic empowerment policy. In terms of the statement, existing mining companies such as Unki, would achieve compliance with the indigenisation
requirements through ensuring that at least 75% of gross sales proceeds are spent and retained in Zimbabwe. The statement concluded by stating that
President Mugabe had directed that the indigenisation legislation be amended to comply with this latest position. Amendments to the Indigenisation Act are
yet to be made.

Stakeholders will be kept informed of any material developments in this regard.

14. ANNOUNCEMENT OF DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS
Equity investment in Pandora
Amplats entered into a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) on 10 November 2016 with Eastern Platinum Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lonmin plc (Lonmin) to sell its 42.5% interest in the Pandora Joint Venture (Pandora). The consideration for this interest will comprise a deferred cash
payment of 20% of the distributable free cash flows generated by Pandora over six years, with minimum amount of R400 million; and a rental agreement for
the use and full operational control of Lonmin's Baobab concentrator for a three-year period.

Following the signing of the binding sales agreement, the investment in associate was assessed separately for impairment. As such, the recoverable value
of Pandora is calculated as the fair value of the estimated proceeds less transaction costs, and amounts to R192 million - resulting in an impairment of
R153 million. It excludes any economic value generated from the Baobab rental agreement which will be recognised for accounting purposes at the time when
the benefit is received. The recoverable amount comprises a Level 3 fair value in terms of the fair value hierarchy (as defined in note 12). The fair value
of the deferred consideration payable by Eastern Platinum Limited was determined based on the projected cash flows for Pandora's E3 operations on a mine-
to-ore basis. The relevant amounts were discounted at the cost of borrowing of Lonmin plc.

Since the transaction remains subject to DMR approval in terms of section 11, the investment has not been reclassified as held-for-sale.

Amandebult reserves
On 11 November 2016 Amplats announced the disposal of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right (the Resource), and surface properties above
and adjacent to the Resource, to Northam Platinum Limited (Northam) for a consideration comprising R1.0 billion in cash (the Proceeds) and an ancillary
mineral resource within Northam's Zondereinde mining right that borders Amandelbult's mining right and which provides the Company with flexibility for the
placement of future mining infrastructure.

The Resource is long-dated and outside of Amplats' long-term life-of-mine plans and therefore does not impact any current or future mining plans. The
transaction does not constrain the Company's next generation options for the Amandelbult mine, which has a number of shallow and less capital intensive
life extension options. The surface properties forming part of the transaction will enable Northam to access the Resource.

No impairment was recognised as the carrying value of the Resource is nil. The transaction remains subject to DMR approval under section 102.

15. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS
Equity investments in Atlatsa and Bokoni Holdco and associated loans
Amplats has a 22.76% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco (which is equity accounted as an associate). The group,
together with Atlatsa, has completed a technical review of the Bokoni Platinum Mine to develop a new optimised mine plan. Following the closure of Vertical
and UM2 shafts and reducing headcount by a third, Bokoni is implementing this new optimised mine plan.

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni Platinum Mine, Amplats impaired its equity interests in Atlatsa and
Bokoni Holdco in 2015. A further impairment of R130 million arose in 2016 with respect to the investment in Bokoni owing to the capitalisation of funding.
These write-offs are included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings, in terms of SAICA circular 2/2015.

Atlatsa's ability to service its debt obligations in the context of the current market conditions, where Bokoni Platinum Mine is its main source of
funding, is doubtful at current PGM price levels. In 2015 Amplats, therefore, for accounting purposes impaired the various loans extended to Atlatsa and
Atlatsa Holdings to the value of R1,792 million. A further impairment of R111 million was recognised in this regard during 2016. The impairment losses
arising from these loan write-offs are included in basic and headline earnings.


16. SCRAPPING OF ASSETS
During 2016 one of Amplats' furnaces suffered a leak of molten furnace matte from the Waterval furnace hearth. A preliminary
assessment of the damage to the furnace has shown that a rebuild of the furnace should be brought forward, as the most prudent means of mitigating future
potential operational risks.

The capital expenditure for the rebuild will be capitalised. The net book value of the affected assets scrapped was R7 million. The proceeds from the
insurance policy (cost incurred by Amplats less deductible) will be recognised as insurance income when received.

A claim for the rebuild has been submitted to the insurers. The insurance policy covers asset and business interruption including machinery breakdown. It
insures property against all risks of physical loss, destruction, damage and electrical or machinery breakdown and against losses resulting from
interruption with the business because of an insured property damage event and against extra expenses. The claim limit is USD1.5 billion.

17. BROAD BASED ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT (BEE) TRANSACTION
A group subsidiary, Atomatic, holds a Chrome Processing Plant adjacent to the Amandelbult Mine. As part of Amplats' commitment to transformation, Atomatic
has issued 26% of its own shares to a BEE partner, Baphalane Siyanda Chrome Company Proprietary Limited (BSCC) which was primarily funded by way of
cumulative, non-convertible and redeemable preference shares by the Amplats group. For accounting purposes, the shares issued by
Atomatic have been treated as an option over its own equity, which resulted in a once-off share-based BEE expense of R156 million on initial recognition of
the transaction. The option was effectively granted in 2014 when the transaction was substantively agreed to by all parties as there were no
conditions which would have resulted in the deal subsequently being cancelled. The transaction, however vested in 2016 when the plant was commissioned and
transferred to Atomatic. The fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow of the business at grant date using a risk adjustment discount rate.

18. DISPOSAL OF RUSTENBURG MINE
On 9 September 2015, Amplats entered into a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with Sibanye Rustenburg Platinum Mines Proprietary Limited (a subsidiary of
Sibanye Gold Limited) (Sibanye) for the disposal of Rustenburg Mine.

Amplats considers its mining, smelting and refining operations as a single cash-generating unit. Following the announcement of the signing of the SPA with
Sibanye in 2015, the assets attributable to Rustenburg Mine were assessed separately within the cash-generating unit for impairment. As such, the
recoverable value of Rustenburg Mine was calculated as the fair value of the estimated proceeds less transaction costs, and amounted to R2,798 million. It
excluded any economic value generated from the future purchase of concentrate and toll treatment arrangements which will be recognised for accounting
purposes at the time when the benefit is received. The recoverable amount comprised a Level 3 fair value in terms of the fair value hierarchy (as defined
in note 12). The fair value of the deferred consideration payable by Sibanye, and negative free cash flow funding payable by Amplats were determined based
on the projected cash flows for Rustenburg Mine. The relevant amounts were discounted at the cost of borrowing of Sibanye and Amplats respectively.

The net carrying value of Rustenburg Mine at 1 September 2015 was R7,274 million. The excess of the carrying value above the recoverable amount gave rise
to an impairment in 2015 of R6,216 million (R4,476 million net of tax). The entire impairment was attributable to property, plant and equipment. A
resulting impairment loss was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and was separately presented. This impairment loss was included in basic
earnings but excluded from headline earnings.

Rustenburg Mine was sold as a going concern for an upfront cash consideration of R1,500 million and deferred consideration amounting to 35% of the
business's distributable free cash flow for six to eight years subject to a minimum of R3,000 million. These proceeds will be offset by funding to be
provided by Amplats in the event of the business having a negative free cash flow between the closing of the transaction and 31 December 2018. This funding
is limited to R267 million per annum and is pro-rated. Taking into account the most recent cash flow estimates for the business, the estimated fair value
of the total consideration amounts to R2,033 million. This excludes any economic value generated from the future purchase of concentrate and toll treatment
arrangements which will be recognised for accounting purposes at the time when the benefit is received. A conditional section 11 approval was received on 2
August 2016 and Rustenburg Mine was reclassified as held for sale at that stage. The final section 11 was granted during the course of October 2016.

Effective 1 November 2016, Amplats disposed of its Rustenburg Mine.

19. ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR PERIODS
Inventory error
The following errors were detected in respect of inventory:
A non-systemic error in the unit cost calculation to determine the value of work-in-process and finished goods metal inventory. This arose mainly in the
current year owing to the preparatory work in separating Rustenburg Mine. The balance, which was restated back to 2014, related to the effect of the
purchase of concentrate arrangement with Union Mine that has a 15% non-controlling interest.

An error in the determination of net realisable value. All stock is valued at the lowest of Cost or net realisable value. The net realisable value
equates to the market value at month end. When determining the net realisable value for the work in progress stock, the market value should have been
reduced with the outstanding down stream cost. I.e. the net realisable value for stock in the Smelter should be reduced with the applicable Rustenburg Base
Metals Refinery and Precious Metals Refinery unit costs. This has been corrected going back to 2011.

Certain consolidation adjustments, which have been corrected going back to 2011.

For the year ended December 2015 the adjustment comprised 2% of the inventory balance and for June 2016 it comprised 6%.

Translation error
During the year it was found that Unki Dollar depreciation was being incorrectly translated at the historic exchange rate, rather the average exchange
rate. The incorrect depreciation resulted from the SAP accounting system being configured with an incorrect rule during Unki's system implementation in
2011.

Joint venture elimination error
Amplats is party to a pooling and sharing arrangement (PSA) with Sibanye Platinum (previously Aquarius Platinum) - referred to as the Kroondal PSA. The
interest is accounted for as a joint operation and proportionately consolidated. In performing a review of intercompany balances, a receivable balance
brought forward from prior years had not completely eliminated.

The above errors were adjusted through a restatement of: opening balances at 1 January 2015, for the cumulative effect of prior periods, and earnings for
the year ended 31 December 2015.

Effect on 30 June 2016 interim results
The above errors had an impact on the 30 June 2016 published interim results. Accordingly the effect to the impact has been disclosed below.

Sale of Union Mine
As part of the Group's divesture initiatives, a binding sale and purchase agreement with Siyanda Resources (Siyanda) was signed on 14 February 2017 for
the Group's interest in Union Mine, which sets out the following key commercial terms:

Initial purchase price of R400 million
Deferred consideration of 35% of net cumulative positive free cash flow for 10 years (with an early settlement option)
Purchase of concentrate agreement for seven years with a toll arrangement from year eight onwards.

As a result of definitive agreements being signed, Union Mine will be considered separate from the Amplats single cash-generating unit as of this date and
will accordingly be separately assessed for impairment.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM - DELIVERING ON OUR COMMITMENTS
Anglo American Platinum is delivering against its key strategic objectives by substantially improving operational performance across the portfolio,
repositioning the portfolio to own and operate the highest margin assets in the platinum group metals (PGM) industry to a create a value-optimised
portfolio, and investing in developing of the PGM market. Significant progress has been made in divesting of assets which are not strategic to the Company
and deemed to be non-core including:

- Completion of the sale of the Rustenburg Operations to a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited (Sibanye) on 1 November 2016
- An SPA was entered into with Northam Platinum Limited (Northam) to divest of resources within the Amandelbult mining right
- An SPA was entered into with Eastern Platinum Limited, a subsidiary of Lonmin plc (Lonmin), to divest of Anglo American Platinum's 42.5% stake in the
- Pandora joint venture
- Post year end, an SPA was entered into with a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources Limited (Siyanda), divesting of the Company's interest in the Union mine
  joint venture and Masa Chrome
- The process of the sale of the Company's interest in the Bokoni joint venture is ongoing

Disciplined capital allocation remains key, and the Company has prioritised investment in high-value, capital-light projects with short pay-back periods,
such as the Amandelbult chrome plant, which was successfully commissioned in 2016 at a cost of R415 million and has delivered an attributable R320 million
in additional operating cash flow. Overall, a combination of capital discipline, working capital management and operational efficiencies resulted in the
generation of free cash flow from operations, which, combined with sale proceeds for divestments, contributed to a reduction of net debt of R5.5 billion to
R7.3 billion.

The Company remains committed to investing in PGM market development across a number of demand segments including jewellery, investment and industrial as
well as areas supporting the widespread commercial adoption of fuel cells and hydrogen in the transport and other sectors.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Safety, health and environment
Tragically, there were seven fatalities due to work related incidents in 2016. Mr Mlamuli Cornelius Kubheka and Mr Mveliso Ntamehlo were fatally injured
in a winch-related incident at Amandelbult (Tumela Mine) on 26 April 2016. Mr Pieter Henrico was injured after being struck by a rock conveyance at
Rustenburg (Thembelani Mine) on 31 March 2016 and passed away on 9 July 2016. Mr Tamsanqa Ngqambiya sustained fatal injuries in a fall-of-ground at
Rustenburg (Thembelani Mine) on 3 June 2016. Mr Amos Mataboge was fatally injured in a fall-of-ground incident at Rustenburg (Siphumelele Mine) on 5 August
2016, and Mr Nekisile Zibhonti died after drilling into explosives at Rustenburg (Thembelani Mine) on 18 August 2016. Mr Peter Leshoella was fatally
injured in a conveyor-belt incident at Union Mine on 24 October 2016. Deepest condolences go to their families, friends and colleagues.

This increase in work-related fatalities is particularly disappointing given the steady improvement in underlying safety performance indicators in 2016.
The lost-time injury frequency fate (LTIFR, a lagging indicator) declined 26% from 0.98 in 2015 to 0.73, while the total recordable case frequency rate
(TRCFR, a leading indicator) improved 31% from 1.52 in 2015 to 1.05 in 2016. These rates include the Rustenburg Operations until 31 October 2016.


The Company's safety strategy, based on zero harm, embeds continuous improvement and review processes to incorporate lessons and to evaluate the
effectiveness of strategic focus areas. This enables the Company to continue learning from each incident, and implement measures to prevent repeats. The
priority remains further improving safety strategy and supporting employees to ensure they remained focused and consistent in applying safety measures at
all times. Particular focus will be placed on ensuring unconditional and consistent adherence to critical controls.

Significant efforts have been made to improve disease awareness and the availability of prevention programmes with a significant increase in employee
participation in disease management programmes. The encouraging uptake of anti-retroviral treatment continued to increase during the year, with a
significant reduction (48%) of HIV/Aids and tuberculosis-related deaths reported in 2016.

Operational performance
Total platinum production both mined and purchased increased 2% to 2.38 million ounces (on a metal-in-concentrate basis), towards the top end of guidance
of 2.3 million to 2.4 million ounces. Platinum produced by own managed mines, including Twickenham project which is now on care-and-maintenance, increased
5% to 956,000 from 909,000 ounces in 2015. 4E built-up head grade of 3.38g/t was 2% lower than 2015 due to lower grade from Mogalakwena and Amandelbult,
partly offset by increased grade at Unki.

Mogalakwena
Production from Mogalakwena mine increased 5% to a record 412,000 ounces (including ounces from the Baobab concentrator plant). Total tonnes mined rose 4%
to 96 million tonnes in 2016, supported by improved equipment efficiencies and increased maintenance reliability. Tonnes milled increased 8% on higher
throughput while 4E built-up head grade returned to a more normalised level of 3.02g/t from 3.09g/t in 2015.

Platinum production from Baobab rose to 31,000 ounces. As part of the transaction terms to sell the Company's stake in the Pandora joint venture to Lonmin,
a three-year contract was secured for the sole use and operational control of the Baobab concentrator.

Amandelbult
Amandelbult production increased 7% to 467,000 ounces, despite safety stoppages, following a double-fatal incident. Higher production reflects mining from
increased mineable ore reserves and improved panel-to-crew ratios. This was supported by higher tonnes milled, which rose 9% to 7.1 million tonnes. Tonnes
from surface sources were up 0.9 million tonnes due to opencast operations producing for 12 months in 2016 compared to six months in 2015. Increased
surface sources in the ore mix reduced the 4E built-up head grade by 2% year-on-year to 4.07 g/t in 2016. The 4E built-up head grade from underground
sources at 4.46g/t is 3% higher than 2015.

Amandelbult successfully commissioned a new chrome plant at the mine in 2016 with steady-state production expected from 2017. The chrome plant was built at
a capital cost of R415 million, on schedule and on budget. The plant is 74% owned by Anglo American Platinum and 26% by the Baphalane Siyanda Chrome
Company Proprietary Limited in which the Baphalane-Ba-Mmantserre community owns 75% and Siyanda Chrome Investments Proprietary Limited owns 25%. The chrome
plant produced 2.8 million tonnes of UG2 tailings, yielding 235,000 tonnes of chrome concentrate for 2016.

Unki
Unki increased production by 12% to 75,000 ounces, driven by higher productivity and improved mining reef cut, resulting in more quality-grade ore being
delivered to the concentrator and the 4E built-up head grade rising to 3.46g/t from 3.22g/t.

Twickenham project
Twickenham produced 3,000 ounces, 10,000 ounces less than 2015 as the loss-making project was placed on care-and-maintenance during the year.

Joint ventures and third parties
Platinum production from joint ventures, including both mined and purchased production, increased 2% to 785,000 ounces. Production was strong from all
operations, with Modikwa up 10% to 115,000 ounces reflecting an effective productivity improvement plan; BRPM up 9% due to increased mining of the higher-
grade Merensky reef from North Shaft Phase 3; Kroondal up 4%, the best performance since inception on improved stoping efficiencies; and Mototolo up 2% on
increased throughput. Bokoni was up 4%, after normalising for the closures of the unprofitable UM2 and Vertical shafts.

Platinum ounces from third parties rose 179% to 112,000 ounces after including Rustenburg purchase of concentrate from 1 November 2016. Excluding
Rustenburg, third-party purchase of concentrate decreased 26% from 40,000 to 30,000 ounces due to terminating some contracts at the end of 2015.

Non-core operations - Rustenburg
Total production from Rustenburg, including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment, decreased 4% from 478,000 to 460,000 in 2016, impacted by fatal
incidents and operational difficulties. Operational improvements were evident in Q4 2016 as the mine was unaffected by safety issues. The sale of
Rustenburg was completed on 1 November 2016, from which point its production is recognised as third-party purchase of concentrate and excluded from own
production. Production from the Platinum Mile tailing retreatment is a retained third party contract and has been reported as part of third party purchase
of concentrate.

Non-core operations - Union
Union production increased 7% to 151,000 platinum ounces through higher stoping efficiencies and an increase in low grade surface ore, despite a
significant reduction in labour after restructuring that was completed in June 2016 and the impact from the fatal incident. The mine also reduced its total
injuries by 40% and improved its cash on-mine costs per platinum ounce by 14% year-on-year.

Refined production and sales volume
Total refined platinum production of 2,335,000 ounces decreased 5% compared to 2,459,000 ounces in 2015, mainly due to a smelter run-out at Waterval
smelter in September 2016. This affected refined production by 65,000 ounces in 2016, and has increased the work-in-process inventory which is expected to
be refined in full in 2017. The decrease in refined inventory also reflects a lower stock gain in 2016 than 2015 of 70,000 ounces. The lower pipeline
inventory resulted in less material to refine.

Refined platinum sales declined by 2% to 2,416,000 ounces, of which 2,400,000 ounces were sales from refined metal and the balance from market activities.
Sales were higher than refined production which was supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory. Lower PGM sales volumes reflect lower refined
production after the Waterval smelter run-out in September and subsequent rebuild in Q4 2016. Sales of refined palladium and rhodium declined 4% and 1%
respectively while sales of nickel increased 7%.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2015 and H1 2016 restatement
Shareholders are advised that the Company has released restated group financial results for the year ended 31 December 2015 and half year ended 30 June
2016. The restatement arose from a correction of the exchange rate used for the translation of Unki mine's depreciation from US dollars into South African
rand, a correction of the valuation of work-in-process and finished goods metal inventory and a correction of the proportionate consolidation of a joint
venture. Anglo American Platinum corrected these as material prior period errors on the basis of the aggregated impact, and restated the comparative period
financials.

Restated basic earnings and earnings per share (EPS) for 2015 are a loss of R12,358 million (R12,125 million previously) and a loss of 4,728 cents (4,638
cents previously). Restated headline earnings and headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 2015 are a loss of R126 million (R107 million profit previously)
and 48 cents loss (41 cents profit previously).

2016 overview
Headline earnings increased to R1.9 billion in 2016 from the restated loss of R126 million in 2015. This reflected favourable foreign exchange movements,
operating and overhead cost reduction, lower restructuring costs and the impact of impairments in the comparative period. As a result, headline earnings
per share rose to 713 cents in 2016 from a loss of 48 cents in 2015.

The group effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 34.3% (2015: 13.7%). This increase is partly due to changes in Controlled Foreign
Company (CFC) legislation, which results in the profits of the marketing companies in the United Kingdom and Singapore being taxed at 28%. In addition, the
effective tax rate is impact by the impairment of loans and investments which do not have an associated tax effect.

Sales revenue
Net sales revenue rose 4% to R62.0 billion from R59.8 billion in 2015, due primarily to the weakening of the rand/US dollar exchange rate. This was partly
offset by reduced sales volumes and the decline in metal prices, particularly platinum and palladium.

The average US dollar basket price per platinum ounce sold decreased 8% in 2016 to USD1,753 from USD1,905 in 2015. This was driven by the decrease in
prices for all metals other than gold and iridium. The average US dollar sales price achieved on most metals declined, with platinum down 6% to USD993 per
ounce, palladium down 13%, rhodium down 29%, nickel down 18% and copper down 8%.

The average rand/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 15% to R14.63 from the R12.71 average in the comparative period. After including the effect of the
weakening rand against the US dollar, the average realised rand basket price per platinum ounce was 6% stronger at R25,649.

Customer prepayment
As part of the Company strategy to strengthen its balance sheet, the marketing function engaged a key customer to advance a prepayment for future
guaranteed delivery of metal. The contract is structured over five years with an initial payment of USD250 million. Of the full amount, USD153 million
(R2.0 billion) was paid in the last quarter of 2016 and contributed significantly to reduced net debt at year end. The remainder of the prepayment will be
received in Q1 2017. The transaction is cost neutral to the Company.

Working capital
The Company has actively managed down its working capital. Trade working capital decreased by R5.3 billion to R8.0 billion as at 31 December 2016 while
days decreased to 49 compared to 75 in 2015. This reflects a number of initiatives including creditor payment terms, where large creditor terms have been
extended from 30 to 60 days, materials inventory management where store areas have been consolidated, and minor metal sales programmes realising cash and
operational initiatives facilitating early settlement.

The increase in trade creditors was mainly due to higher expenditure, particularly the purchase of concentrate following the sale of the Rustenburg
Operations, and deferred revenue arising from the customer prepayment.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales rose by 3%, from R54.6 billion in 2015 to R56.1 billion. Following the sale of Rustenburg operations in November 2016, the Company will have
higher purchase of concentrate costs and lower on-mine costs due to the purchase of concentrate from Sibanye.

Cash on-mine costs (mines and concentrators) reduced by R1.1 billion to R32.8 billion due to lower mining costs as a result of the Rustenburg exit partly
offset by input cost inflation and increased volume at retained operations. Processing costs rose 5% or R350 million to R7.1 billion which was below input
cost inflation.

Purchase of concentrate costs increased to R13.5 billion from R10.2 billion in 2015 due to higher volume which now includes two months of Rustenburg
production as purchased metal, higher rand basket price compared to 2015 and R0.4 billion of metals purchased through marketing activity.

Other indirect costs increased 8% to R2.8 billion from R2.6 billion in 2015. The increase in costs was primarily due to higher transport of metal costs of
R247 million and additional royalty expenses of R188 million partly offset by lower expenditure on corporate office, share based payments and research.

The cash cost of the Company comprises labour, stores, electricity, water, contractors and other costs.

Cash operating cost per platinum ounce rose 1.4% to R19,545 from R19,266 in 2015 which is significantly below mining inflation and the South African
Consumer Price Index. This reflects the benefit of cost reductions, operating efficiencies and overhead reductions.

Overheads
The Company started an overhead reduction programme to reduce the 2015 overhead of R5.4 billion to R3.4 billion, of which R700 million was through the exit
of Rustenburg and R300 million will be through the exit of Union. Of the remaining R1.0 billion, the Company has delivered R700 million, with the full run
rate of R1.0 billion achieved in Q4 2016. The Rustenburg exit reduced overhead cost by R500 million. Expectations are that the Union exit will complete in
2017 and result in an additional R300 million overhead reduction.

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
Reported EBITDA rose by R10.7 billion to a profit of R9.1 billion from a loss of R1.6 billion in 2015 due to the prior period impairment and write-off of
assets totalling R12.0 billion. Normalised for the 2015 impairments, EBITDA increased from R8.6 billion to R9.1 billion. Stock-count gains and
restructuring costs were once-off items in both years. The 2016 stock count gain was some R0.6 billion compared to the abnormally high R2.1 billion in 2015
while restructuring costs decreased by R654 million year on year to R342 million.

Uncontrollable items which include inflation, metal prices and the rand/dollar exchange rate, reduced earnings by R1.8 billion, with inflation
contributing R2.5 billion, weaker metal prices R4.3 billion, partly offset by the weaker rand of R5.0 billion. The company's earnings are very sensitive to
price movements in the commodities sold and to the ZAR:USD exchange rate. Every R100 change in the rand basket price realised equates to R0.2 billion of
EBITDA.

Controllable items - volume and costs - contributed R3.1 billion, with lower sales volumes than 2015 reducing earnings by R300 million. Costs, after
adjusting for volume, inflation and forex, declined R3.0 billion from 2015, including lower operating costs, overhead, marketing costs and cash on-mine
costs after the Rustenburg sale, supported by higher income from associates of R427 million.

The Company's return on capital employed (ROCE) was 8.9% compared to restated 2015 ROCE of 5.8%, after adjusting for scrapping.

Cash flow
The Company generated R13.6 billion in cash from operations, including the R2.0 billion customer prepayment. Underlying cash from operations therefore was
R11.6 billion, including R342 million in restructuring costs. These cash flows were used to fund capital expenditure of R4.7 billion (excluding capitalised
interest, including capitalised waste); pay taxation of R1.1 billion; settle net interest of R1.4 billion to our debt providers and contribute R1.0 billion
to funding our joint venture and associate operations in 2016.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for 2016, excluding capitalised interest, declined 9% to R3.4 billion from R3.7 billion in 2015. Stay-in-business capital expenditure
increased by R0.2 billion to R2.8 billion in 2016, focused on safety-critical, business continuity, value-accretive projects.

Project capital expenditure decreased by R0.6 billion from R1.2 billion to R0.6 billion in 2016. This was focused on Unki smelter and housing, phase 5
expansions at Bathopele Mine and Rustenburg ore replacement projects.

Interest capitalised during the period decreased to R323 million from R406 million in 2015 due to lower assets qualifying for capitalisation of interest.

The Company capitalised costs of R1.3 billion (2015: R1.0 billion) for waste stripping at Mogalakwena mine as part of the life-of-mine plan. Waste tonnes
mined increased from 77.0Mt in 2015 to 77.6Mt in 2016. In 2016, the cost of mining 38.5Mt was capitalised against a capitalisation of 32.0Mt in 2015.

In addition, during 2016, the Company concluded a Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) transaction with regards to its Amandelbult chrome plant,
granting 26% of the equity of the plant to its BBBEE partners. An upfront consideration was received by Anglo American Platinum, which is less than the
fair value of the equity granted. The remaining consideration was settled through vendor financing assistance provided by the Company. This transaction
therefore resulted in the Company recognising a once-off IFRS2 charge (share based payment) of R156 million.

Net debt and dividend
The Company's net debt at 31 December 2016 was R7.3 billion, R5.5 billion lower than the R12.8 billion reported in 2015, representing gearing of 18% (31
December 2015: 32%). This was supported by a cash receipt of R1.5 billion for the sale of Rustenburg, partly offset by R0.1 billion transaction costs and
the R2.0 billion customer prepayment.

Owing to the net debt position of the Company and uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Board has decided not to declare a dividend in 2016.

Anglo American Platinum will continue to monitor its capital requirements and to prioritise deleveraging the balance sheet before considering future
dividend payments.

Disciplined capital allocation
The Company has a strict capital allocation policy to ensure the best use of capital to achieve the highest returns. The first priority is to maintain the
core current operations and ensure they are equipped to achieve operational excellence. Stay-in-business capital and business continuity remain the
priority with capital and the exit of Rustenburg, Pandora and now Union will enable the Company to focus its capital on its best assets.

The next priority of the Company is to deleverage the balance sheet so that it is strong enough to manage through the cycle. Net debt was reduced by R5.5
billion during the year, and the focus remains on reducing net debt further. One-off disposal proceeds from the sale of resources to Northam, and the sale
of Union to Siyanda should further contribute to a decline in net debt. In addition, the balance of the customer prepayment will be received in Q1 2017.
Thereafter the Company would like to introduce a sustainable dividend based on a pay-out ratio once the balance sheet has strengthened.

In the current environment, the decision has been taken to delay any major growth projects until the market demands more metal and the balance sheet
allows, and not until post 2017. The operating free cash flow of own operations has been improved by reducing the capital intensity of stay in business
capital, without increasing operational risk in future.

If there is any further capital to be allocated, the Company will consider a reiterative cycle of allocation between further debt reduction, capital
projects if the market needs the ounces and a further dividend distribution.

MARKETS
Platinum
Although the platinum price ended 2016 above where it began the year in US dollar terms, it declined 6% on average compared to 2015, underperforming many
commodities due to a mix of expected tightening of monetary policy in the USA and modest fundamentals for platinum. While total supply of platinum from
mine production and recycling increased, and gross demand for this metal declined marginally in the year, platinum remained in deficit for the fifth
consecutive year.

Industrial demand was the strongest performing sector for platinum as industries - from glass manufacturing to chemicals purchased more metal than a year
earlier. Demand for platinum from the automotive sector also edged 1% higher. Net investment demand was again positive in 2016 outpacing demand a year
earlier as Japanese buying continued and Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) selling slowed.

The performance of the jewellery sector was more disappointing, with demand slowing noticeably. Although there were bright spots elsewhere, Chinese
consumers bought less jewellery - both platinum and gold - than a year earlier and demand fell sharply.

Palladium
Following its weak performance in 2015, the palladium price improved in 2016 but still recorded a lower average price (a fall of 13%) than a year earlier.
In contrast to platinum, demand performed well and outweighed overall supplies. The automotive industry remains the principal user of this metal and demand
rose 3%, while industrial demand fell slightly. In the investment sector, it was another year of net disinvestment in palladium. ETF net selling was
slightly less intense than a year earlier but accelerated in the final quarter when over 300,000 ounces of metal were sold as the price rallied to highs
for the year.

Rhodium
The rhodium market was again well-supplied in 2016 despite some growth in automotive demand for this metal. Tightening emission standards in various
countries forced the fitment of catalysts with higher rhodium content and strong sales in China and, to a lesser extent, the USA and Europe contributed
additional rhodium demand. Industrial demand for rhodium edged higher, with additional buying for capacity additions in the glass sector a major factor.
The average rhodium price was 29% lower than 2015, but ended 2016 close to its yearly high.

Automotive
Global light-vehicle sales expanded 4.6% in 2016 to a record 93.2 million units. Sales were strong in Europe, North America and, particularly, China where
a cut in the tax payable on the purchase of smaller vehicles drove light-duty vehicle sales 12.3% higher. Demand for all three major PGMs grew as a result
of this strong performance.

Gross automotive demand for platinum rose 30,000 ounces or 1%, its highest level since 2008. The standout performance was in Europe, where strong demand
for new vehicles more than offset a slight decline in the share of the diesel engine. In fact, the number of diesel cars sold in Europe climbed while
loadings increased too. More negatively, diesel's share of the Indian car market fell while North American heavy-duty diesel demand for platinum was weaker
than expected.

The outlook for the diesel engine remains a key factor, after the emissions scandal of 2015. Diesel share has fallen in Europe, but only in line with prior
expectations as the smallest vehicles move away from this technology where it is least economically attractive. Catalyst loadings edged higher in 2016 but
could fall in 2017 before rising again as the later stages of the new, tougher European emissions rules, Euro 6, are phased in. While electric vehicles of
all types - both battery electric vehicles and their fuel cell equivalents - are receiving extensive media coverage, their market share remains small.
Diesel is therefore still extremely important for light and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers and their ability to meet carbon-dioxide emission targets, and
is likely to retain a strong position among larger vehicles.

Automotive demand for palladium climbed again to 7.8 million ounces as higher vehicle production outweighed the ongoing effects of thrifting. Strong growth
in Chinese car sales, driven by domestic stimulus efforts, was a factor. In fact, despite some growth in palladium demand in Europe and Japan, China alone
took 300,000 ounces more metal than the prior year. Gross automotive rhodium demand edged 2.0% higher, with higher global car production outweighing the
impact of slowing thrifting.

Industrial
Demand for platinum from other industrial applications was healthy in 2016, growing 185,000 ounces or 9.7%, much faster than the pace of global economic
growth. The glass manufacturing sector took more metal than a year earlier and other industries purchased more platinum too. Although still small, demand
for platinum for use in fuel cells continues to grow and exceeded the 50,000 ounce level last year. In the short term, much of this demand is from using
fuel cells in niches such as telecommunications back-up power or fork-lift trucks. However, there are also positive signs of increasing demand from the
transport sector, including the launch of a number of semi-commercial fuel cell vehicle models.

Industrial demand for palladium fell slightly in 2016, by 50,000 ounces or 2.5%, partly due to thrifting in electronic applications. Higher demand for
rhodium from the glass sector helped boost industrial and other demand for rhodium by 20,000 ounces to 185,000.

Jewellery
Gross global jewellery purchases of platinum fell for a second year in 2016, dropping 15.3% or 430,000 ounces. The major negative factor was slowing
jewellery sales - both gold and platinum - in China, which is the largest jewellery purchaser of platinum. A decrease in the availability of credit to
jewellery retailers and manufacturers combined with relatively weak consumer confidence to send retail purchasing of all types of jewellery lower.
Additionally, instead of the stockbuilding over 2010-2013, there was some destocking across the industry due to store closures and lower sales. There may
be scope for a rebound in demand in 2017, but we do not anticipate a rapid return to 2012-2014 levels.

Outside China, there were some positives for jewellery demand. In India, the platinum Evara brand continues to perform well, demonstrating the success of
the Platinum Guild International's approach to marketing in this country, although sales were affected at the end of the year by the decision to withdraw
some high-denomination bank notes from circulation. We see considerable potential for further demand growth here, driven by these market developments,
although the recent demonetisation process could pose a short-term headwind. Elsewhere, North American demand expanded, reflecting strong economic growth
and returning consumer confidence in the USA in particular. European jewellery demand was stable.

Investment
Net investment demand for platinum was healthy, at close to its five-year average, and grew by 31% or 140,000 ounces from the prior year. ETF liquidation
slowed and even reversed at times: US dollar strength meant that the platinum price provided some interesting buying opportunities in many currencies. Just
as significantly, Japanese investors bought approximately 500,000 ounces of platinum: the metal's continuing discount to gold and low absolute price in yen
meant that consumers were very keen buyers for a second successive year. Work by the World Platinum Investment Council has helped to improve availability
and demand for physical products in a number of countries.

ETF flows were the dominant factor in palladium investment demand. As the palladium price firmed in US dollar terms, and even more in other currencies,
this provided an opportunity for profit-taking and ETF investors reduced their holdings by a net 590,000 ounces over the year. Investment demand for
rhodium and the minor metals was boosted by improved product availability, although rhodium investment flows were negative on a net basis.

STRATEGY
Restructuring
Anglo American Platinum continues to make progress in implementing its value-driven strategy through restructuring. Since 2013, the company has reduced
unprofitable platinum production by some 400,000 ounces after placing Marikana on care-and-maintenance; consolidating Rustenburg mines from five to two
mines; consolidating Union from two to one mine and closing the declines; restructuring Bokoni to place the unprofitable Vertical and UM2 shafts on care-
and-maintenance; and placing Twickenham project on care-and-maintenance in 2016.

Significant headcount reductions have occurred since the start of the restructuring in 2013, ensuring that the Company is appropriately sized to service a
smaller and less complex organisation. Operational efficiencies have enabled production volumes to be sustained with fewer employees and without the need
for capital.

Repositioning the portfolio
Anglo American Platinum has achieved key strategic successes in 2016 in repositioning its portfolio, announced in 2014. The Company aims to own and operate
the best assets in the PGM industry, consisting of Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, and our JV operations, BRPM, Mototolo and Modikwa and the processing
assets.

The completion of the sale of the Rustenburg Operations in 2016, and the SPA's announced for the sale of the Company's 42.5% stake in the Pandora joint
venture, and the disposal of Union mine and Masa Chrome, (both of which are anticipated to complete during 2017), allow the Company to focus on the most
competitive assets, consisting of largely open-pit and more mechanised operations which will result in higher margin production, a smaller and more highly
skilled workforce, safer operations and a less complex organisation. As a result, the core operations stand to benefit from dedicated management attention
and technical expertise, as well as disciplined capital allocation.

Disposal of Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye
The Company announced on 1 November 2016 that it had completed the disposal of Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye Rustenburg Platinum Mines Proprietary
Limited, a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited (Sibanye). The upfront proceeds of R1.5 billion were paid in cash and used to reduce net debt. The Company
will also receive a deferred consideration of R3.0 billion over six to eight years in the form of 35% of distributable free cash flow from the Rustenburg
Operations. The Company has also entered into a purchase of concentrate and tolling agreement, to purchase concentrate for two years (to 2018) and to then
toll treat the material for up to eight years. The transaction is cashflow, earnings and ROCE accretive for the Company.

Disposal of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right to Northam
The Company announced on 11 October 2016 that it had signed a SPA to dispose of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right and surface
properties above and adjacent to Northam's resource. These resources are excluded from current life of mine plans and are long dated. The consideration
comprises cash of R1 billion and an ancillary mineral resource within Northam's Zondereinde mining right that borders Amandelbult's mining right, that can
provide the Company with flexibility for the placement of future mining infrastructure. It is envisaged that the transaction will complete in 2017 and the
cash proceeds be used to reduce net debt.

Disposal of Anglo American Platinum 42.5% stake in Pandora to Lonmin
The Company announced on 11 November 2016 that it had entered into a conditional Sales and Purchase agreement to dispose of its 42.5% stake in the Pandora
Joint Venture, to Lonmin plc (Lonmin). The consideration will comprise of a deferred cash element of a minimum of R400 million and a maximum of R1.0
billion over six years and a rental agreement for the use of and full operational control of Lonmin's Baobab concentrator for a three year period
commencing on completion of the Transaction. It is envisaged that the transaction will complete in 2017.

Disposal of Union mine and Masa Chrome to Siyanda
Anglo American Platinum announces that it signed an SPA on 14 February 2017 to sell its 85% interest in Union mine and 50.1% interest in Masa Chrome
Company Proprietary Limited to Siyanda Resources (Siyanda). The consideration comprises an initial purchase price of R400 million in cash, as well as a
deferred consideration based on 35% of cumulative distributable free cash flow paid annually as an earn-out, for a period of ten years from the date of
completion of the transaction. The Company has no obligation to pay towards any negative cash flow generated by these assets.

In addition to the initial and deferred consideration, Anglo American Platinum has entered into a purchase of concentrate agreement for seven years and
thereafter an agreement to toll treat the 4E metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold) until the end of life of mine. The transaction is subject to
conditions precedent typical of a transaction of this nature, which include the granting of the Section 11 consent from the Department of Mineral Resources
(DMR) and the approval of the transaction by the competition authorities of the Republic of South Africa. The transaction is expected to complete during
2017.

Bokoni
Technical work to review the mine extraction strategy and to develop a path towards a sustainable and optimised operation was completed in collaboration
with our JV partner. Following the closure of Vertical and UM2 shafts and reducing headcount by a third, Bokoni is implementing its new optimised mine
plan, and will close the open pit operations. Discussions on the most appropriate exit for Anglo American Platinum are ongoing.

Kroondal
The Company's stake in Kroondal is considered a non-core operation. However, as the operation generates attractive cash flow for the Company it will only
be disposed for value. No formal discussions have commenced.

POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE
Market development
Anglo American Platinum's global PGM market development initiatives are focused on offsetting the risk of lower demand in existing demand segments using a
mix of marketing initiatives in existing or near-term applications and targeted development in longer-term growth areas, such as fuel cells, hydrogen and
clean energy generally. South African beneficiation objectives form part of our broader market development activities.

The Company invests in market development and beneficiation across a number of demand segments, using a range of approaches that are appropriate for each:

- Global and local development of platinum jewellery markets is carried out through the Platinum Guild International (PGI) which is funded by Anglo American
  Platinum and some of the other primary PGM producers. The PGI is focused on a number of important countries, including China, India, Japan and the USA,
  where it promotes platinum as a jewellery material by working with designers, manufacturers and retailers
  Further development of investment demand for platinum is led by the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), an industry body funded by a number of
  platinum producers including Anglo American Platinum. 2016 achievements include partnering with Valcambi, a Swiss refiner, to increase the availability of
  physical investment products, the UK's BullionVault to offer vaulted products, and Mitsubishi UFJ to stimulate further Japanese demand for platinum through
  an Exchange Traded Fund or ETF

- The Company also operates a PGM investment programme. This uses a venture capital-type approach to provide start-up or early stage capital to companies
  working on the commercialisation of technology that utilises one or more of the platinum group metals. Many of the investments have focused on hydrogen,
  fuel cells and clean energy such as the 2016 investments in Greyrock, which is developing and commercialising technology used to produce clean fuels from
  flare gas, and in United Hydrogen Corporation, which is working on low cost hydrogen, a key issue for the adoption of fuel cell vehicles. In addition, we
  sponsor academic research into the use of the PGMs at a number of universities in South Africa and elsewhere

- The Company also continues to work on areas aiding the widespread commercial adoption of fuel cells and hydrogen in the transport sector and other sectors.
  This involves a range of activities from investing in companies that address specific market development opportunities through the PGM investment
  programme, to engaging with government to ensure equitable regulatory terms for these technologies, and assisting in demonstration programmes where these
  are appropriate

Mining innovation
Anglo American Platinum initiated a new innovation strategy in 2011 to find alternatives for conventional mining and, in 2013, changed strategy to aim for
70% mechanised production from the core retained portfolio. The move to mechanisation will ensure that these alternative mining methods will be safer and
more productive, as well as ultimately more cost effective for the Company.

The Company is focused on finding alternative ways to modernise mining in narrow tabular orebodies in the platinum industry by using different equipment,
layouts and techniques that will change the conventional way of mining. In 2016, testing for this technology moved to Twickenham from Bathopele mine as
this mine was exited with the sale of the Rustenburg Operations.

Anglo American Platinum has developed a number of new technologies and equipment, including electro-hydraulic hand-held drills; extra-low profile fleet of
drill rigs and bolters; ultra-low profile drill rig, bolter, dozer and sweeper units; cutting technologies that include the rapid mining development
system; continuous conveyor belts and more. In addition, significant progress has been made with fuel cell technologies and, within the Company's fleet, a
dozer and two locos are now running on hydrogen fuel. Assistance has also been given at Mogalakwena mine, with developments in autonomous drilling,
blasting fragmentation and anti-collision devices on vehicles.

Social and labour plan investment
In 2016, the pace of delivering on social and labour plan (SLP) commitments normalised after accelerated investment in 2015 to counter prior delays. In
South Africa, the Company invested R337 million (2015: R547 million) in community development, in line with mining charter requirements. Since 2010, 114
SLP projects have been initiated. By the end of 2016, 107 projects had been completed with the remaining seven due for completion in 2017.

With the official completion of the first phase of SLPs, known as SLP1 (2011-2016), we were required to develop, submit and implement SLP2 for all
operations. A total of 96 projects were identified in consultation with communities, local municipalities and ratified by relevant provincial departments.
Implementation is under way, with six already completed.

Wage negotiations
The Company signed a three year wage agreement on 27 October 2016 with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), retrospectively
applied from 1 July 2016 when the previous agreement concluded. This agreement was extended to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), United Association
of South Africa (UASA) and non-union affiliated employees in terms of section 23 of the Labour Relations Act, Act 66 of 1995.

The agreement followed a constructive and collaborative negotiation process, resulting in a cost-to-company increase of 6.71% in year 1, 6.56% in year two
and 6.96% in year three, or 6.74% on average over the three-year period - an outcome deemed fair to employees and one that ensures a sustainable future for
the business.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY
Mining Charter III
Anglo American Platinum recognises the invaluable contribution that mining has made, and continues to make, to South Africa's economic and social
landscape. The Mining Charter provides important guidelines in advancing the transformation of the mining industry, covering a range of transformation
pillars-from ownership, mine community development, employment equity, housing, to living conditions and procurement. The Company is confident that it has
met its targets, in accordance with the current Mining Charter.

A proposed Draft Reviewed Mining Charter was published on 15 April 2016 in the Government Gazette. Anglo American Platinum-through a submission by Anglo
American plc-has voiced its serious concerns regarding the Draft Reviewed Mining Charter, and called amongst others for a regulatory impact assessment to
be conducted by the Government to determine the potential consequences of the Draft Reviewed Mining Charter on the mining industry and South African
economy. The Company believes that were a Draft Reviewed Mining Charter to result from an agreement between Government and industry (as was the case
previously in 2004 and 2010), the effect would be greatly enhanced regulatory certainty and investor confidence.

The Company remains committed to working with the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), through the Chamber of Mines, to ensure the industries concerns
are appropriately addressed.

Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA)
Amendments to South Africa's MPRDA, which have been under parliamentary review for nearly two years, have recently been sent to the National Council of
Provinces (NCOP) for approval, after a favourable National Assembly vote on the bill being referred to the NCOP, the upper house in parliament and the
final step before promulgation. Minister Zwane has publicly stated he believes the bill will pass constitutional muster.

Some of the mining industry's concerns on the MPRDA amendment relate to the status of the mining charter in the bill, capping exports of strategic minerals
(still to be defined by the minister, a level of discretion that concerns the industry) and the fact that the minster has discretion on pricing minerals to
local users to encourage beneficiation.

The Company continues to engage the minister and DMR, via the Chamber of Mines, on these aspects of the proposed bill, in an attempt to find a resolution
before promulgation which, from DMR indications, is likely to happen in the first half of 2017.

Unki indigenisation in Zimbabwe
After approval of its indigenisation plan, Anglo American Platinum signed a heads of agreement with the government of Zimbabwe in November 2012 that set
out key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for Unki mine investment. The proposed transaction would have resulted in the disposal of up to 51% of
the equity in Unki, facilitated through a notional vendor-funded transaction.

The plan has not yet been implemented as the government of Zimbabwe has been refining its position on indigenisation. In April 2016, President Mugabe
issued a press statement that sought to clarify the government's position on the indigenisation and economic empowerment policy. In terms of the statement,
existing mining companies such as Unki would achieve compliance with indigenisation requirements by ensuring that at least 75% of gross sales proceeds are
spent and retained in Zimbabwe. The statement concluded by noting that President Mugabe had directed that indigenisation legislation be amended to comply
with this latest position. Amendments to the Indigenisation Act are yet to be made.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Ore Reserves decreased from 184.6 4E Moz to 170.2 4E Moz in the review period. This was primarily as a result of
the sale of the Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye Gold Ltd. The reduction of Ore Reserves associated with the sale of the Rustenburg Operations has been
partially offset by an increase in Ore Reserves at Mogalakwena and Amandelbult's Dishaba mine due to the additional conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore
Reserves. At Mogalakwena Ore Reserves increased significantly due to pit shell design changes and at Amandelbult's Dishaba mine, Ore Reserves increased
materially due to a revised UG2 extraction strategy.

The South African and Zimbabwean Mineral Resource, inclusive of Ore Reserves decreased by 9.2% from 916.4 4E Moz to 831.7 4E Moz equivalent in the year
under review. This was primarily the result of the disposal of the Rustenburg Mineral Resource, inclusive of Ore Reserves to Sibanye. This disposal has
been partially offset by the increase in Mineral Resource, inclusive of Ore Reserves at Mogalakwena mine due to the pit shell design changes.

Anglo American Platinum maintains an industry leading Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve status, even after the sale of the Rustenburg operations, and after
revisions to future economic assumptions.

OUTLOOK
In view of the current and expected market conditions for PGMs, Anglo American Platinum remains focused on its strategy to deliver change and build a
resilient business. The Company has positioned itself to manage through the current environment. Stringent cost controls have been implemented,
restructuring completed at Union and unprofitable production at Twickenham placed on care and maintenance which will deliver cost savings in 2017.
Restructuring the business has resulted in a further R700 million of overhead savings.

Underlying cash-flow generation remains a focus, and project capital will therefore be prioritised on quick-return projects that generate meaningful
incremental value. No major project capital will be committed in 2017, although the Company continues with study plans for potential future replacement and
growth projects to position itself to implement these should market conditions improve. The Company aims to strengthen the balance sheet to manage through
the cycle and execute on high-returning projects when market conditions require additional production. Given project capital expenditure will be limited in
the current environment, and in keeping with capital-allocation policy, the Board will continue to monitor the potential to reinstate a dividend in 2017.

Market outlook
Anglo American Platinum expects the economic environment to remain challenging for PGMs in 2017, with relatively low prices.

Although there were numerous positives for platinum demand last year, in the form of investment, automotive and industrial demand, there were some notable
challenges, particularly in the jewellery sector. These headwinds suggest that overall demand will change little in 2017. A combination of limited capital
expenditure in recent years and the ageing of some older mines across the industry means that mine supply is more likely to decline than increase over the
medium term. Even limited growth in existing applications would therefore be expected to support the platinum price to some extent. If the industry's
market-development initiatives in investment, jewellery, fuel cells and hydrogen are successful, these should result in fundamental deficits.

In contrast, palladium is expected to remain in substantial deficits over the next five years, as growth in autocatalyst demand drives overall demand
higher. The outlook for rhodium is less positive: although there are signs of additional demand developing, this metal is currently in surplus and is
unlikely to move into deficit rapidly.

The outlook for platinum demand in 2017 is largely neutral compared to 2016. Automotive demand is expected to contract marginally as the diesel engine
continues to lose market share in smaller cars in Europe, although the introduction of tighter emissions rules involving real-world driving could boost
individual catalyst loadings. Industrial platinum buying should remain strong in many sectors, with the chemical and glass sectors set to buy more metal.
While investment demand is difficult to forecast, the current metal price and initial success of some of the industry's market-development work suggests
that demand in this sector could again be relatively strong. In the short term, however, the area of greatest concern is the performance of the jewellery
sector. The Chinese jewellery sector contracted for a variety of reasons in 2016, with platinum suffering too. Some of these factors may be one-offs but,
given lower prevailing economic growth, we anticipate at best a modest recovery in demand here. The Indian jewellery sector continues to show great promise
but its performance in 2017 is likely to be hampered by the ongoing effects of the recent demonetisation programme.

Macroeconomic and political factors, such as US interest rate hike expectations, impact of the new Republican government under Donald Trump, and further
information on Brexit, among others, will probably affect sentiment and therefore price as much as supply and demand fundamentals.

Operational outlook
Platinum production guidance (metal-in-concentrate) will be 2.35-2.40 million ounces for 2017, driven by increased purchase-of-concentrate from third
parties. Own mine and managed production will remain constant year on year.

Financial outlook
The Company recorded input cost inflation of around 7.5% in 2016. Cost inflation is likely to remain a challenge in 2017. While some costs have been
mitigated by restructuring the Company and implementing various initiatives, inflationary pressures from wages and electricity remain.

The decrease in capitalised waste costs in 2017 at Mogalakwena will add around R400 per ounce to unit costs for 2017 as overall volume is maintained at 99
million tonnes, and a lower amount of volume is capitalised (in line with IFRIC 20), however there will be no cash-flow impact. Further initiatives have
been identified to reduce the impact of cost escalations and we expect the unit cost per platinum ounce produced to be between R20,350 and R20,850, an
increase of 2% to 5% excluding Mogalakwena capitalised waste costs.

There are no significant restructuring activities envisaged for 2017 as all operational restructuring is complete.

The sale of out-of-plan resources at Amandelbult to Northam for R1 billion in cash, the upfront proceeds from the sale of Union mine of R400 million and a
second customer prepayment for USD100 million will be used to reduce debt in 2017.

Anglo American Plat announces sale of its interests in Union Mine Joint Venture & MASA Chrome to Siyanda Resources

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
(Registration number: 1946/022452/06)
Share Code: AMS
ISIN: ZAE000013181
(""Anglo American Platinum"" or “the Company"")

Anglo American Platinum announces the sale of its interests in the Union Mine Joint Venture
and MASA Chrome to Siyanda Resources

Introduction

Anglo American Platinum announces that Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (“RPM”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to sell
its 85% interest in Union Mine and its 50.1% interest in MASA Chrome Company Proprietary Limited
(“MASA Chrome”) (together, the “Disposal Assets”) to a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources Proprietary
Limited (“Siyanda”) (“the Transaction”). Anglo American Platinum will retain the Mortimer smelter
operation.

Description of the Disposal Assets

Union Mine and MASA Chrome are located in both the Limpopo and North West provinces of South
Africa and Union Mine operates under a mining right covering an area of 119 square kilometres.

Disposal Consideration

Under the terms of the SPA, the Transaction consideration comprises an initial disposal consideration
of R400 million, payable in cash, as well as a deferred consideration based on 35% of cumulative
positive distributable free cash flow paid annually as an earn-out, for a period of ten years from the
effective date of the Transaction, which deferred consideration has a cap of R6 billion. The maximum
Transaction consideration receivable by the Company is therefore R6.4 billion. Anglo American
Platinum has no obligation to contribute towards any negative cash flow that may be generated by the
Disposal Assets. Anglo American Platinum intends to use the Transaction consideration proceeds to
reduce debt.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented on the Transaction:

“We are pleased to deliver another important milestone in the strategic repositioning of Anglo
American Platinum’s portfolio. The Union Mine and Masa Chrome operations are quality assets that I
believe have long-term and sustainable potential under Siyanda’s ownership. This Transaction is
beneficial for both parties, whilst also creating a sustainable future for the operation.”

Purchase and Toll Treatment of Concentrate

Siyanda will sell concentrate produced by the Union Mine to Anglo American Platinum for a period of
seven years from the effective date of the Transaction on pre-agreed commercial terms and thereafter
Anglo American Platinum will toll treat concentrate for the remaining life of Union Mine. The charge
payable by Siyanda under the toll treatment arrangement will reflect smelting and refining costs as
well as an economic return on the proportional share of the capital base that Anglo American
Platinum has invested in its processing assets.
Conditions precedent and effective date

The Transaction is subject to the fulfilment or waiver (where capable of waiver) of the following
conditions precedent by no later than the long-stop date of 30 June 2018:
    - the granting of the Section 11 consent from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR);
    - the approval of the Transaction by the competition authorities of the Republic of South Africa;
    - the conclusion of Siyanda’s BEE structure; and,
    - the conclusion of various ancillary agreements required for implementation of the
         Transaction.

The Transaction is expected to complete during the second half of 2017.

Rationale for the Transaction

In January 2013, Anglo American Platinum announced its intention to reconfigure, and thereafter exit
the Disposal Assets. Since then, significant restructuring has been delivered at Union, including
combining North and South Mines into a single operation and placing North declines, South declines
and the Mortimer Merensky concentrator on care and maintenance. Operational improvements have
also had a significantly positive effect on Union Mine’s cost position and cash generation. The
Company, however, has more value accretive capital options in its portfolio and would not prioritise
capital investment into the Disposal Assets, and is therefore not the best owner of these assets.

The sale of Union Mine and MASA Chrome advances the Company’s repositioning to focus on its
most competitive assets, consisting of largely open pit and mechanised operations which will deliver
higher margin production, a more highly skilled workforce, safer operations and a less complex
organisation.

Value of the net assets and profits attributable to the net assets

As at the Company’s year ended 31 December 2016, the value of the net assets pertaining to the
Disposal Assets was R1,654 million. The profits attributable to the Disposal Assets is not separately
disclosed recognising the nature of the Company’s smelting and refining activities.

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction constitutes a Category 2 disposal for the Company and, as such, no shareholder
approval is required.

Updated trading statement for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016

Anglo American Platinum will release its financial results for the twelve months ended 31 December
2016 (“the period”) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 15 February 2017.

The Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited require companies to publish a trading statement as soon
as they are satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial results to be reported
on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s trading statement released on SENS on 10 November 2016
in which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the
period were expected to be at least 20% (R21 million or 8 cents per share) higher than for the twelve
months ended 31 December 2015 (“comparative period”) and that basic earnings and basic earnings per
share (“EPS”) for the period were also expected to be at least 20% (R2.425 billion or 928 cents per
share) higher than for the comparative period.

Headline earnings for the period is likely to increase to between R1.64 billion and R2.00 billion and
HEPS for the period is likely to increase to between 625 and 760 cents per share. This compares to
headline earnings in the prior period of R107 million and HEPS of 41 cents per share.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to increase to between R550 million and R670 million
and per share to between 210 cents and 255 cents respectively. This compares to basic earnings in the
prior year of a loss of R12.125 billion and a loss per share of 4,638 cents.

The increase in basic earnings in the period is largely due to impairments and write offs in the
comparative period of R14.0 billion (post-tax). Of these impairments, R1.8 billion impacted headline
earnings. In addition, higher restructuring costs in the comparative period of R850 million (post-tax)
impacted both basic and headline earnings.

The Company has additional impairments in the second half of 2016 of R283 million (post tax) of which
R130 million is in respect of an impairment of the investment in Bokoni, and R153 million in respect of an
impairment of the investment in Pandora following the signature of a conditional Sales and Purchase
Agreement to sell the Company’s 38% interest in Pandora to Lonmin plc. These impairments will impact
basic earnings only and will not impact headline earnings.

Following the completion of the sale of Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye Gold Limited released on
SENS on 1 November 2016, basic earnings has been impacted in the period by a loss on disposal of
the Rustenburg Operations of R919 million (post-tax). The loss on disposal of the Rustenburg
Operations has not impacted headline earnings.

During 2016, the Company concluded a Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE)
transaction with regards to its Amandelbult Chrome plant, granting 26% of the equity of the plant to its
BBBEE partners. An upfront consideration was received by Anglo American Platinum, which is less than
the fair value of the equity granted. The remaining consideration was settled through vendor financing
assistance provided by the Company. This transaction therefore resulted in the Company recognising
R156 million or 60 cents per share in the form of an IFRS 2 (share-based payment) charge which
impacts both basic and headline earnings for the year to 31 December 2016. This is a one-off charge
calculated on conclusion of the transaction.

Basic and headline earnings were impacted by the lower USD metal prices, a lower 2016 stock count
gain than 2015 (which was abnormally high), offset by a weaker ZAR and cost improvement initiatives
across the Company.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company’s external auditors.

PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

OVERVIEW

-   Tragically, one fatality at Union mine in Q4 2016
-   Total platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) was 2% higher than the prior year at
    610,100 ounces. Q4 production is seasonally lower than Q3 due to the impact of the public holidays.
-   Strong operational performances achieved by retained own mines, with Mogalakwena up 5% and
    Unki up 7%, as well as from JV operations’ BRPM and Kroondal
-   Following the run-out of molten furnace matte at the Waterval Smelter on 10 September 2016,
    refined production was impacted by 59,000 in the quarter, with total full year refined production
    impacted by 65,000 platinum ounces
-   The Number 1 furnace at Waterval smelter has subsequently been successfully rebuilt and is
    operating at full capacity
-   Refined platinum production decreased 15% to 631,600 ounces for the quarter, reflecting the impact
    of the Waterval smelter run out reducing feed to the Precious Metal Refinery
-   Sales volumes of 606,500 ounces were down 2%, impacted by the Waterval smelter run-out which
    reduced refined platinum available to sell. In addition, refined production was used in part to rebuild
    refined inventory

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Tragically we had one loss of life due to a work related incident during the fourth quarter of 2016. Mr.
Peter Lesholla was fatally injured in a conveyer belt incident on 24 September 2016 at Union Mine. An
independent and comprehensive investigation into this fatal incident is under way to understand the
circumstances of and learn from this fatal incident in order to create a safer work environment for all.
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations
reduced 36% to 0.61 compared to the LTIFR of 0.95 of Q4 2015.

Total platinum production (metal in concentrate) was up 2% to 610,100 ounces as a result of improved
performances during the quarter at Mogalakwena, Unki, and at JV operations’ Kroondal and BRPM.
Twickenham was on care and maintenance in the second half of 2016, which led to a reduction of 4,200
unprofitable platinum ounces in Q4 2016.

Mogalakwena production increased by 5% to 103,400 ounces driven primarily by a 2% increase in
grade to 3.1g/t.

Amandelbult production was constant at 121,100 ounces.

Unki production increased 7% to 19,900 ounces driven by increased tonnes milled and higher grade.

Joint venture production (mined and purchased but excluding third party purchase of concentrate)
decreased by 5% to 189,500 ounces. A record production for the quarter at Kroondal and strong
production from BRPM was offset by lower production at Bokoni due to closures of unprofitable
production from UM2 and Vertical Shafts at the end of 2015. On a normalised basis, excluding
production from the closure of the two vertical shafts, production at Bok oni increased 4% year-on-year.

Following the restructuring at Union in 2016, which led to a significant reduction in labour, the mine
continued to perform in line with its optimised mine plan, despite the impact of a fatality, maintaining
production at 38,100 ounces.

Total mined production from Rustenburg operations including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment
increased 9% year-on-year and 7% on Q3 2016, reflecting a quarter of production not impacted by
safety issues. The sale of Rustenburg completed on 1 November 2016. From this date production from
Rustenburg was recognised as third party purchase of concentrate and excluded from own production .
Rustenburg own mine production therefore decreased by 62%, which is due to only one month of
production in Q4 2016.

Production from third party purchase of concentrate increased by 90,900 to 93,900 ounces due to the
inclusion of Rustenburg purchase of concentrate from 1 November 2016. This was partially offset by a
reduction in purchase of concentrate from other producers.

Refined platinum production decreased by 15% to 631,600 ounces, following the Waterval Smelter run -
out in September and subsequent furnace rebuild impacting refined production by 59,000 ounces in Q4
and 65,000 ounces in total during 2016. Mining and concentrating activities were unaffected.

The Number 1 furnace at Waterval smelter has been successfully rebuilt and is operating at full capacity.
The rebuild was completed ahead of schedule and at lower expected capital expenditure of R95 million.

Sales volumes for the quarter of 606,500 ounces were less than refined production of 631,600 ounces,
due to the impact of the smelter run out which reduced refined production and therefore sales. In
addition, refined production was used in part to rebuild refined inventory, which had been drawn down
to supplement sales during the precious metals refinery safety stoppage.

Anglo American Platinum announces the sale of its 42.5% interest in the Pandora Joint Venture
to Lonmin

Anglo American Platinum announces it has entered into a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement
on 10 November 2016 with Eastern Platinum Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lonmin plc
(“Lonmin”) to sell its 42.5% interest in the Pandora Joint Venture (“Pandora”) for a deferred cash
payment of a minimum of R400 million and a maximum of R1.0 billion over six years (nominal terms);
and a rental agreement for the use of and full operational control of Lonmin’s Baobab concentrator for
a three year period (the “Transaction”).

Rationale for the Transaction

In 2014 Anglo American Platinum announced the repositioning of its portfolio to focus on our most
competitive assets, consisting of largely open pit and mechanised operations which will result in higher
margin production, a smaller and more highly skilled workforce, safer operations and a less complex
organisation. Anglo American Platinum accordingly announced its intent to exit from certain non-core
operations including its interest in Pandora.

Deferred payment consideration

Anglo American Platinum will receive a deferred cash consideration calculated as 20% of the
distributable free cash flows generated by Pandora on an annual basis for a period of six years subject
to a minimum consideration of R400 million and maximum of R1.0 billion (in nominal terms). This
deferred consideration is based on the Pandora E3 operations cash flows on a mine-to-ore basis as set
out in the ore sales agreement.

Use of Baobab Concentrator

Lonmin will allow Anglo American Platinum continued access to, and full operational control of the
Baobab concentrator for a period of three years from the date of completion of the Transaction. The
Company will continue to pay Lonmin an annual rental fee, estimated in future at R46 million. Baobab
contributed 23,500 ounces of platinum production (metal in concentrate) in 2015

The use of the Baobab concentrator is of strategic importance to Anglo American Platinum, allowing it
to process excess ore and unlock value at Mogalakwena mine. Taking over operational control of
Baobab concentrator will allow the Company to integrate the operation into its supply chain activities,
resulting in cost reduction opportunities for Mogalakwena.

Conditions precedent and effective date

The Transaction remains subject to certain conditions precedent including the approval of the
Transaction by the competition authorities of the Republic of South Africa; and all necessary consents
being obtained from the Department of Mineral Resources of South Africa, including the section 11
approval for the transfer of the mining right to Lonmin. The Transaction is also subject to approval from
the remaining JV partner, Northam Limited. The Transaction is expected to become unconditional
during 2017 following the fulfilment of all conditions precedent.
Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the Transaction:

“Anglo American Platinum is pleased to announce another milestone in the repositioning of our portfolio
with the disposal of our 42.5% interest in Pandora to our joint venture partner Lonmin. We believe we
have concluded a beneficial transaction for both parties, whilst also securing a sustainable future for
the Pandora mine. The benefits of operational control over Baobab will enable us to unlock further value
at Mogalakwena mine and achieve cost savings”

Anglo American Platinum’s refers stakeholders to the announcement released by Lonmin on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Regulatory News Service of the
London Stock Exchange on 11 November 2016, regarding the Transaction.

Trading statement for the twelve months ending 31 December 2016

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a trading
statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders that, mainly due to the benefit of foreign exchange
movements as well as cost saving initiatives across the Company, headline earnings and headline
earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2016 will be at least 20%
(R21 million or 8 cents per share) higher than reported headline earnings and HEPS for the twelve
months ended 31 December 2015 (“the comparative period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period were R107 million and 41 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) will also be at least 20% (R2.425 billion or
928 cents per share) higher than reported basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period. Basic
earnings and EPS for the comparative period were a loss of R12.125 billion and a loss of 4,638 cents
respectively due to the asset impairments and write-offs in the comparative period.

There is currently insufficient certainty to enable the Company to provide specific guidance on its
expected results and it is anticipated that Anglo American Platinum will publish a further trading
statement closer to the release of its annual financial results which will be released on 15 February
2017 on the Stock Exchange News Service.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, or
reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.

Anglo American Platinum completes sale of Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye

Anglo American Platinum confirms the completion of the sale of the Rustenburg Operations by its wholly
owned subsidiary Rustenburg Platinum Mines to Sibanye Rustenburg Platinum Mines Proprietary
Limited (""Sibanye"") (the ""Transaction""), and that Sibanye has now taken over ownership, control and
management of those operations.

The Rustenburg Operations comprise the Bathopele, Siphumelele (including Khomanani), and
Thembelani (including Khuseleka) mining operations, two concentrating plants, an on-site chrome
recovery plant, the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment Plant, associated surface infrastructure and
related assets and liabilities on a going concern basis, including normalised levels of working capital.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the Transaction:

""This is a major step in the repositioning of Anglo American Platinum’s portfolio. The sale of the
Rustenburg Operations allows us to focus on our most competitive assets, consisting of largely open-
pit and more mechanised operations which will result in higher margin production, a smaller and more
highly skilled workforce, safer operations and a less complex organisation. As a result, our core
operations stand to benefit from dedicated management attention and technical expertise, as well as
our disciplined capital allocation model.""

Upfront disposal proceeds and use of proceeds

The upfront disposal proceeds of R1.5 billion (""Upfront Proceeds"") received in the form of cash will
reduce net debt and further strengthen Anglo American Platinum’s balance sheet.

Deferred proceeds

As set out in the announcement dated 9 September 2015, Sibanye will also pay minimum deferred
proceeds of R3.0 billion (in nominal terms), to be earned through a 35% share of the distributable free
cash flows generated by the Rustenburg Operations on an annual basis for a period of six full years
commencing from 1 January 2017.

To the extent that there is an outstanding minimum deferred proceeds balance at the end of the six
year period, Sibanye has the option to extend the payment period for up to two years (to 31 December
2024), or until the minimum deferred payment has been paid in full (whichever is earlier). Sibanye has
the option to settle the outstanding balance in cash or listed Sibanye Gold Limited ordinary shares at
the end of the six or eight year period.

Adjustments to the purchase consideration

After the closing of the Transaction on 1 November 2016, if the distributable free cash flow generated
by the Rustenburg Operations is negative in 2016, 2017 or 2018, there will be a downwards adjustment
to the Upfront Proceeds received up to R267 million per annum, or a lesser amount required to reduce
any negative distributable free cash flow to zero.

In 2016, the maximum amount payable is R44.5 million, pro-rated from 1 November 2016 as the closing
date of the Transaction. In 2017 and 2018, the maximum payable amount is R267 million per annum,
plus any difference between the amounts actually paid and the maximum payable amount in the
previous periods. In total the maximum adjustment to the purchase consideration is R578.5 million (in
nominal terms), if the distributable free cash flow generated by the Rustenburg Operations is negative
in 2016, 2017 or 2018.

Sale and toll treatment of concentrate agreement

Anglo American Platinum has entered into a sale and toll treatment of concentrate agreement with
Sibanye.

Sibanye will sell all concentrate produced by the Rustenburg Operations to Anglo American Platinum
until 31 December 2018 based on pre-agreed commercial terms.

Thereafter, for a period of up to eight years (and no less than two years) starting 1 January 2019,
Sibanye will enter into a toll treatment arrangement where Anglo American Platinum will undertake the
smelting and refining activities in respect of the Rustenburg Operations on pre-agreed commercial
terms. The charge payable by Sibanye under the toll treatment arrangement will reflect smelting and
refining costs as well as economic return on the proportional share of the current capital base that Anglo
American Platinum has invested in its processing assets.

Financial effects of the Transaction

On 1 November 2016 the net assets of the Rustenburg Operations will be derecognised from Anglo
American Platinum’s balance sheet. After taking into account the estimated value of the upfront
proceeds, deferred disposal proceeds, adjustment to purchase consideration and transaction costs, an
accounting loss on disposal of the Rustenburg operations of an estimated R1.5 billion will be recognised
(conditional on final financials for October), which will impact basic earnings in the year ended
31 December 2016.

Anglo American Platinum and AMCU sign wage agreement

Anglo American Platinum announces that it has signed a three-year wage agreement (“the
Agreement”) with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (“AMCU”), retrospectively
effective from1 July 2016. This agreement has been extended to the National Union of Mineworkers
(“NUM”), the United Association of South Africa (“UASA” – The Union) and non-union affiliated
employees in terms of section 23 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995.

The Agreement includes:

    -   An annual increase of R1,000 or 7% (whichever is greater), per month in basic pay for
        bargaining unit employees for the three-year period, with increases ranging from 12.5% for
        the lowest paid employees to 7% for other bargaining unit employees in higher level bands;

    -   Living out allowances, housing rent subsidies and home ownership allowances increase by
        R120 per month for each year of the three year agreement;

    -   The employer’s medical aid contributions will increase by 6.4% from 1 January 2017 and on
        the first of January for each succeeding year of the wage agreement by 5.5%. The
        pensionable emolument bases for retirement and provident funds will increase by 6.4% from
        1 July 2016 and 5.5% for the second and third year of the agreement;

    -   The Holiday Leave Allowance (HLA) (thirteenth cheque) increases by the same percent as
        the basic wage, however off a lower base. The base will increase over the three years to end
        at the same level as the basic monthly wage at the end of the agreement period. Other
        allowances have lower increases.

The Agreement will result in an increase in the labour cost, with a cost-to-company increase of 6.71%
in year 1, 6.56% in year two and 6.96% in year three, or 6.74% on average over the three year period.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented:

“We are pleased to have reached agreement following a constructive and collaborative negotiation
process. The current economic environment continues to place significant pressure on platinum
mining companies, as well as mineworkers, and we are glad to have achieved an agreement that is
fair to our employees, benefiting the lowest paid workers the most with a 12.5% increase in basic pay,
while still ensuring our business remains viable for the long-term.”

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Tragically we had two losses of life due to work related incidents during the third quarter of 2016.
Mr Amos Mataboge was fatally injured in a fall of ground incident at Rustenburg East mine
(Siphumelele) on 5 August 2016 and Mr Nekisile Zibonti was fatally injured in an explosion related
incident at Rustenburg West mine (Thembelani) on 18 August 2016. An independent and
comprehensive investigation into these fatal incidents are under way to understand the circumstances
and learn from them in order to create a safer work environment for all.

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations
reduced 19% to 0.77 compared to the LTIFR of 0.95 of Q3 2015.

Total platinum production was up 1% to 619,100 ounces as a result of improved performances during
the quarter at Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, and at JV’s Modikwa, Kroondal and BRPM.

Mogalakwena production increased 12% to 100,700 ounces. This was driven by a 19% increase in total
tonnes milled, though the comparative period was impacted by community disruption partially offset by
a return to normalised lower grades of 2.92g/t in the period (with normalised grade ranging between
2.8g/t to 3.0 g/t).

Amandelbult production increased marginally, up 1% to 128,300 ounces.

Unki production increased 16% to 18,200 ounces for the period. The increased production was due to
improved underground mining efficiencies which resulted in a 5% increase in tonnes milled, and a 9%
increase in grade due to improved mining height control.

Joint venture production (mined and purchased) was broadly unchanged, down 1% to 207,100 ounces
driven primarily by Bokoni due to closure of two shafts in Q4 2015, offset by strong performance at
Modikwa, Kroondal and BRPM. On a normalised basis, excluding production from the closure of the
two vertical shafts, production at Bokoni increased 12% year-on-year.

Platinum production from Rustenburg operations including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment
(WLTR) was down 3% to 120,900 ounces. Mine production was impacted by two fatal incidents in Q3
2016, and the subsequent safety stoppages. This was offset by a strong performance from the WLTR
which increased 38% to 13,800 ounces in part due to new production from the East tailings dams.

Following the significant restructuring at Union, the mine continued to perform in line with its optimised
mine plan, maintaining production at 37,700 ounces, despite a reduction in labour.

Refined platinum production increased by 14% to 694,600 ounces following recovery at the Precious
Metals Refinery in processing additional matte material that was built-up ahead of the refinery, after a Section
54 safety stoppage in Q1 2016.

Sales volumes for the quarter of 588,000 ounces were less than refined production of 694,600 ounces,
as leases of 49,000 ounces were repaid and the balance used to build up refined inventory.

As announced on 13 September 2016, the run-out of molten furnace matte at the Waterval Smelter on
10 September has resulted in the need to bring forward a planned furnace rebuild from 2018 to Q4
2016. This rebuild impacted Q3 2016 refined production by c.6,000 ounces and is now estimated to
impact full year refined production by c.75,000 ounces (previously 70,000-100,000 ounces). This will
result in a build-up of concentrate ahead of the smelters; however the concentrate will be processed in
full by the end of 2017. Mining and concentrating activities are unaffected, therefore there is no change
to the full year production guidance.


GUIDANCE

Full year guidance remains in place for 2016 with produced ounces (metal in concentrate) between
2.3 - 2.4 million platinum ounces; Unit costs between R19,250 and R19,750 per platinum ounce (metal
in concentrate); SIB and project capex guidance between R3.5 and R4.0 billion; and capitalised waste
stripping of c.R1.2 billion.

The full impact on refined production from the run-out of the Waterval smelter is unlikely to flow through
to sales volumes in 2016, which will be supplemented by inventory and market activities. The estimated
impact in 2016 on EBIT will be c.R750 million.

Anglo American Platinum disposes of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right
to Northam Platinum Limited for R1 billion cash plus an ancillary contiguous resource

Anglo American Platinum announces that its wholly owned subsidiary, Rustenburg Platinum Mines
Limited has signed an agreement to dispose of mineral resources within the Amandelbult mining right
(the “Resource”), and surface properties above and adjacent to the Resource, to Northam Platinum
Limited (“Northam”) for a consideration comprising R1.0 billion in cash (the “Proceeds”) and an
ancillary mineral resource within Northam’s Zondereinde mining right that borders Amandelbult’s
mining right and which provides the Company with flexibility for the placement of future mining
infrastructure (the “Transaction”).

The Resource comprises an area of Merensky and UG2 resources containing approximately
16.7 million 4E ounces and bordering the west side of Northam’s Zondereinde mine. Shareholders
may view a map of the relevant area on the Company’s website, www.angloamericanplatinum.com.

The Resource is long-dated and outside of Anglo American Platinum’s long term life-of-mine plans
and therefore does not impact any current or future mining plans. The Transaction does not constrain
the Company’s next generation options for the Amandelbult mine, which has a number of shallow and
less capital intensive life extension options. The surface properties forming part of the Transaction will
enable Northam to access the Resource.

In addition to the Proceeds, the Transaction consideration includes an ancillary mineral resource
located on the north-west corner of the Zondereinde mining right. This area gives Anglo American
Platinum flexibility for the placement of future mining infrastructure, including options for next
generation replacement or expansion plans at Amandelbult.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum commented on the Transaction:

“We are pleased to announce the disposal of certain long-dated mineral resources within the
Amandelbult mining right to Northam. The Transaction is mutually beneficial and allows us to exit
resources for value which are outside of our life-of-mine plans and do not impact current mining or the
future potential of Amandelbult. We have also secured an ancillary contiguous resource that provides
us further flexibility for our future plans for the mine. The Proceeds will be used to further reduce net
debt and strengthen Anglo American Platinum’s balance sheet.”

The Transaction is subject to the necessary consents being obtained from the Minister of Mineral
Resources, including approval in terms of Section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act.

 ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM’S WATERVAL SMELTER FURNACE NUMBER ONE – SHUTDOWN
 AND REBUILD


 Anglo American Platinum advises that it has safely effected a shutdown of the furnace number one at
 Waterval smelter in South Africa, after a leak of molten furnace matte was detected from the furnace’s
 hearth on Saturday, 10 September 2016. All emergency procedures, including actions to safeguard all
 site personnel, were successfully implemented and no one was injured.

 A preliminary assessment of the damage to the furnace has shown that a rebuild of the furnace should be
 brought forward, as the most prudent means of mitigating future potential operational risks. While the
 extent of the damage to the furnace has yet to be fully quantified, early indications are that the rebuild,
 and associated production ramp-up, is likely to take approximately three to four months to complete.

 The Company’s remaining smelters are operating at full capacity and consequently, smelting losses
 associated with this unplanned shutdown, will not be recovered during 2016. This furnace represents
 circa 20% of the Company’s smelting capacity. As a result, platinum production for the 2016 financial
 year is expected to be impacted by between 70,000 and 100,000 platinum ounces.

 There will be a build-up of concentrate stocks during the rebuild which will be released as refined metal in
 the future. The capital expenditure for the unplanned rebuild will be circa R125 million, resulting in total
 capital expenditure for the year to be at the upper end of our previously guided range of between R3.5
 billion and R4.0 billion.

 The Company’s mining and concentrating activities are unaffected, therefore not impacting the previously
 guided range of produced (metal in concentrate) of 2.3 and 2.4 million platinum ounces.

 Shareholders and key stakeholders will be kept updated on the progress of the rebuilding of the furnace
 and associated impacts.

Information reported to the Executive Committee of the Group for purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is done on a mine

Changes to the segmental information 
The following change to the segmental reporting was made following changes to internal reporting to the Executive Committee: 
For the current period and the year ended 31 December 2015, purchased metals exclude tailings from Anglo American Platinum Limited's mines treated by a
third party with the concentrate being purchased by Anglo American Platinum Limited. The results for this have been included in the operation from which
the tailings arose. Consequently, the results for the six months ended 30 June 2015 were reclassified in a similar manner. This resulted in the following
changes to the 30 June 2015 comparative figures:

13.  FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
This announcement does not include the information required pursuant to paragraph 16A(j) of IAS 34. The full interim report is available on the Company's
website, at the Company's registered offices and upon request.

14.  IMPAIRMENT OF EQUITY INVESTMENT IN BOKONI HOLDCO AND ASSOCIATED LOAN
The Group has a 49% equity investment in Bokoni Holdco, which is equity accounted as an associate. The Group fully impaired the investment in Bokoni at 31
December 2015. During the six months ended 30 June 2016, the Group advanced further funding to Bokoni, 49% of which was capitalised to the equity
investment. 51% of the funding was recognised as a loan to Plateau at amortised cost.

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni Platinum Mine, the Group has fully impaired its additional equity
interest in Bokoni Holdco by R104 million to reflect the recoverable amount at its value in use. This impairment is included in basic earnings but excluded
from headline earnings. The Group has further fully impaired the loan to Plateau to the value of R111 million, which impairment is included in basic and
headline earnings.

15.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE FOR INVENTORY
During the current period, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a physical count of in-process metals. The
Group runs a theoretical metal inventory system based on inputs, the results of previous counts and outputs. Due to the nature of in-process inventories
being contained in weirs, pipes and other vessels, physical counts only take place once per annum, except in the Precious Metal Refinery, where the
physical count is usually conducted every five years. The Precious Metal Refinery physical count was conducted by exception again in 2016.

This change in estimate has had the effect of increasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements by R589 million (30 June 2015:
increase of R2,175 million; 31 December 2015: increase of R2,175 million). This results in the recognition of an after tax gain of R424 million (30 June
2015: after-tax gain of R1,566 million; 31 December 2015: after-tax gain of R1,566 million).


16.  UNKI PLATINUM MINE INDIGENISATION PLAN
Following approval of its indigenisation plan by the Government of Zimbabwe, Anglo American Platinum signed a Heads of Agreement with the Government of
Zimbabwe in November 2012 that set out the key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for the Company's Unki mine investment. The plan has not yet been
implemented.

President Mugabe issued a press statement in early April 2016, which sought to clarify the government of Zimbabwe's position on indigenisation. In terms of
the statement, existing mining companies such as Unki, would achieve compliance with the indigenisation requirements through ensuring that at least 75% of
gross sales proceeds are spent and retained in Zimbabwe. President Mugabe concluded by stating that he had directed that the Indigenisation legislation be
amended to comply with this latest position. Amendments to the Indigenisation Act are yet to be made.

Stakeholders will be kept informed of any material developments in this regard.

17.  DISPOSAL OF RUSTENBURG MINE
In 2015, Amplats entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Sibanye Rustenburg Platinum Mines Proprietary Limited (a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold
Limited) (Sibanye) for the disposal of Rustenburg Mine. The transaction required various regulatory approvals. Progress has been made in fulfilling the
conditions precedent including the approval by Sibanye shareholders and the South African Competition Authorities. The application in terms of section 11
of the MPRDA for the transfer of the relevant Mining Right and the Prospecting Right to Sibanye was submitted to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR)
on 4 February 2016. Although it is envisaged that the transaction will become unconditional during the second half of 2016, the approval by the DMR remains
a key outstanding condition precedent and therefore Rustenburg Mine cannot be reclassified as held-for-sale at this stage.

18.  POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There have been no material events subsequent to 30 June 2016.

19.  AUDITOR'S REVIEW

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM'S STRATEGY
Restructuring
Anglo American Platinum continues to make progress in implementing its value driven strategy and delivering on promises. Since 2013, the Company has
reduced unprofitable platinum production by over 350 koz arising from placing Marikana on care and maintenance, the consolidation of Rustenburg mines from
five to two mines and Union from two to one mine, closure of the Union declines, and the restructuring at Bokoni placing the unprofitable Vertical and UM2
shafts on care and maintenance.

Significant headcount reductions have occurred since the start of the restructuring in 2013, ensuring that the business across our operations and support
services is rightsized to service a smaller and less complex organisation. Operational efficiencies have enabled production volumes to be sustained without
the need for capital.

The Company has identified R1.0 billion of overhead cost savings through the reduction of 400 managerial positions, resulting in R200 million per annum of
overhead labour cost savings, and R800 million of non-labour overhead savings. In H1 2016, R0.4 billion of these overhead savings had been achieved with
the full R1 billion run rate to be achieved by Q4 2016.

The Twickenham project continued to make substantial cash losses and unlikely in the current environment to generate positive cash flow. As a result, the
decision was taken to place Twickenham on care and maintenance, with 1,000 positions identified to exit the project, reducing the cash losses made in 2015.
Union Mine needed to align headcount with the smaller operation as a result of restructuring. A further 1,000 positions were also identified to exit
Union Mine. The Company embarked on a section 189 process in H1 2016 which concluded on 30 June 2016. Through retrenchment mitigation plans, a number of
employees left the organisation through voluntary separation packages, early retirement, reskilling, redeployment to other operations where vacancies were
left open as well as natural attrition. Only a limited number of employees had to be retrenched. In total the cost of the restructuring amounted to c.R150
million and will result in annual cost benefits of R320 million per annum.

Repositioning the portfolio
One of the core pillars of the Anglo American Platinum strategy is to complete the repositioning of the portfolio. The Company aims to own and operate the
best assets in the PGM industry, moving down the cost curve and increasing the contribution from mechanised mining. The retained portfolio will consist of
Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki, and our JV operations, BRPM, Mototolo and Modikwa and the processing assets. The portfolio will comprise at least 70%
mechanised production resulting in lower costs, a more highly skilled work force, safer operations, a less complex organisation and more modern mining
operations. The consequence of this strategy is that we are in the process of exiting Rustenburg, and will exit Union, Bokoni, Pandora and Kroondal.

Update on the disposal of Rustenburg Operations to Sibanye
The announcement of the disposal of the Rustenburg Operations (the Transaction) on 9 September 2015 to a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited (Sibanye) was a
significant step in transitioning the portfolio, allowing the Company to better focus its management and capital allocation. Progress continues to be made
towards fulfilling the conditions precedent of the Transaction, and key steps have been made including:

- Sibanye obtaining shareholder approval on 18 January 2016, as per JSE Listing Requirements;
- South African Competition Authorities approving the Transaction in accordance with the Competition Act on 16 March 2016; and
- Sibanye and Anglo American Platinum completing various ancillary agreements on separation areas.

The application in terms of section 11 of the MPRDA for the transfer of the relevant Mining Right and the Prospecting Right to Sibanye was submitted to the
Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) on 4 February 2016. Although it is envisaged that the Transaction will become unconditional during the second half of
2016, the Section 11 approval remains the key outstanding condition precedent for the completion of the Transaction.

Union
As a result of the implementation of a revised and optimised mine plan, including reducing loss-making production and various cost reduction initiatives,
the mine has significantly improved its financial performance. The sales process continues and the Company will update the market with further information
as appropriate.

Bokoni
Technical work to review the mine extraction strategy and to develop a path towards a sustainable and optimised operation, in collaboration with our
partner, is well advanced. Following the closure of Vertical and UM2 shafts and reducing headcount by a third, Bokoni is implementing its new optimised
mine plan. Discussions with our partner to agree the most appropriate exit for Anglo American Platinum are ongoing.

Pandora
The Company continues to assess options to exit its stake in Pandora.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Safety, Health and Welfare
Tragically we had four losses of life due to work related incidents during the first half of 2016. Mr. Mlamuli Cornelius Kubheka and Mr Mveliso Ntamehlo
were fatally injured in a winch related incident at Amandelbult on 26 April 2016. Mr Tamsanqa Ngqambiya sustained fatal injuries in a fall of ground at 
Rustenburg on 3 June 2016. Mr Pieter Henrico was injured when struck by a rock conveyance at Rustenburg on 31 March 2016 and passed away on 9 July 2016. 
Our deepest condolences go to the families, friends and colleagues of Mr Kubheka, Mr Ntamehlo, Mr Ngqambiya and Mr Henrico. We are conducting independent
investigations into these incidents and will incorporate the learnings into our Safety, Health and Environmental strategy, as well as intensify
the focus on critical controls.

The tragic fatal incidents came after a record fatality-free period of 323 days, highlighting the Company's focus on improving safety. Anglo American
Platinum's lost-time-injury-frequency-rate (LTIFR) was 0.75, a record performance, reducing 28% compared to the LTIFR of 1.04 in the first half of 2015
(comparative period). The Company continues to strive for zero harm, and has a well-established safety strategy in place to drive this ambition.

Significant efforts have been made to improve our disease awareness and prevention programmes. The Company has seen a significant increase in employee
participation in the Disease Management Programme. The encouraging uptake of anti-retroviral treatment has also increased during the year, with early signs
of a reduction of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis related deaths. The Company has implemented support mechanisms, and increased our tuberculosis prevention
efforts through various awareness and social campaigns, underpinned by active management of cases.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
The operational performance of the Company improved with platinum production (on a metal in concentrate basis) increasing from 1,125 koz to 1,153 koz, a 2%
increase versus the comparative period. Retained own mine operations, excluding projects, saw an 8% improvement in platinum production to 461 koz.

Mogalakwena
Production from Mogalakwena increased to 208 koz, a 2% improvement. Mogalakwena had a strong milling performance which increased 6% year-on-year partly
offset by the return to lower normalised grades. Expected production for the full year remains at 400 koz including the concentrate which is treated at
Baobab concentrator. Cash operating costs increased as a result of inflationary increases, exacerbated by the weakening of the Rand (c.25% of Mogalakwena's
overall cost base is US Dollar related). Mogalakwena continued to produce cash operating margins of 49% and produced R2.1 billion of operating free cash
flow.

Mogalakwena has increased production from 305 koz in 2012 to 392 koz in 2015 through operational efficiencies, without the need for expansion project
capital. Previously it was anticipated that the next phase of scaling the mine was to increase production from 360 koz to 420 koz through a debottlenecking
of the concentrator. However, given the excellent mining performance, the debottlenecking project is being rebased to take into account the latest
operational performance.

Amandelbult
Amandelbult production increased by 15% to 217 koz due to operational efficiency improvements from underground operations, and production from the new UG2
opencast area, which contributed 18 koz. The cash operating cost per platinum ounce decreased by 3% year-on-year to R18,425 per ounce. The lower unit cost
was achieved through increased volume and the benefits of labour reductions during the 2015 restructuring process. Amandelbult delivered R916 million of
operating free cash flow for the period.

The new chrome plant at Amandelbult was commissioned in June 2016 and is expected to reach steady state production by the end of H1 2017. The R400 million
plant is expected to generate additional free cash flow of c.R350-400 million per annum (based on current prices and FX rates) once it reaches steady
state.

The Tumela Upper section which accounts for c.100 koz of annual production will reach the end of its life by 2020-2022. The best solution was previously
thought to be to replace Tumela Upper through sinking the Tumela 5 vertical shaft. As Dishaba and Tumela mines were consolidated to simplify the business
and reduce overhead, new options for replacement ounces were developed looking at the two mines as one complex. Recent studies have indicated that there is
a lower capital option to replace the depleting Tumela Upper. The pre-developed UG2 reef at Dishaba has remained unmined to date and will only require
limited stay-in-business (SIB) capital for infrastructure upgrades and development. The UG2 reef at Dishaba has a good prill split with high platinum
content relative to other UG2 ore reserves across the Western Bushveld. This strategy ensures that all major capital projects at Amandelbult will be
delayed post 2020.

Unki
Production from Unki in Zimbabwe increased by 13% to 36 koz, mainly due to an increase in milled volumes through mining production efficiency improvements,
as well as an increase in grade through improved mining height control. Higher volumes and rigorous cost control led to a 15% reduction in cash
operating costs to USD1,680 per platinum ounce. However, in Rand terms, cash operating cost per platinum ounce increased to R25,832 reflecting the
continued weakness of the Rand against the US Dollar. Unki generated R73 million of operating free cash flow. A feasibility study for the construction
of a smelter using equipment readily available within the Company is complete. Construction is expected to begin during Q3 2016 once all the remaining
regulatory approvals have been secured. Commissioning of the smelter is expected during H2 2018.

Joint ventures and third parties
Platinum production from Joint Ventures, inclusive of both mined and purchased production, increased by 8% to 388 koz. All mines showed year-on-year
improvements with the exception of Bokoni. Modikwa production increased 19% due to improved crew efficiencies and commencement of South 2 Phase 2 shaft.
BRPM production increased 16% due to start of production at Styldrift shaft and improved North Shaft. Mototolo production increased 11% and benefited from
increased throughput, increased grade and improved concentrator recoveries. Kroondal achieved the best first half performance since inception up 6% to 137
koz due to strong mining performance and concentrator plant recovery improvements. Production at Bokoni was down 16%. However, on a normalised basis,
accounting for the closure of the unprofitable UM2 and Vertical shafts in Q4 2015, Bokoni saw an increase in production despite the two fatalities and
community unrest which caused a loss of ten production shifts.

Platinum ounces purchased from third parties decreased by 76% year-on-year from 25 koz to 6 koz as a result of the termination of certain contracts in
2015.

Non-core operations - Rustenburg and Union
Platinum production from Rustenburg, including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment (WLTR), decreased by 10% to 219 koz. Lower production was due to
section 54 safety stoppages, mining through difficult ground areas and marginally lower grade. This was partially offset by an improvement in production
from the WLTR which increased by 13% to 26 koz, in part due to new production from the East tailings dam. Rustenburg generated R439 million of operating
free cash flow, while the cash operating cost increased by 10% to R21,920 per platinum ounce. The unit cost increase was as a result of lower volumes,
notwithstanding the implementation of cost saving initiatives.

Platinum production from Union increased 15% to 75 koz, the mine's best performance since 2013, as a result of implementation of the optimised mine plan
and productivity improvements. This was achieved despite the closure of the decline sections which removed c.60 koz of annual production and closure of
marginal production areas. Union generated R212 million of attributable operating free cash flow, while the cash operating cost decreased by 23% to R19,310
per platinum ounce. The unit cost reduction was achieved through increased volumes, benefiting from the restructuring process and cost saving initiatives
on mining materials.

Refined production and sales
Refined platinum production decreased by 9% to 1,008 koz owing to a section 54 safety stoppage at the precious metal refinery (PMR) in Q1 2016 which
stopped production for 12 days and impacted production build-up for a further 37 days. The PMR has recovered to steady state and made up most of the
shortfall in production. The remainder of the shortfall in refined production is expected to be recovered in H2 2016.

Refined platinum sales volumes increased by 5% to 1,221 koz despite the reduction in refined production in the period. Platinum sales were higher than
refined production by 213 koz, and were delivered through the drawdown of refined inventory and some market activities. A limited number of these market
instruments are due to close out in Q3 2016.

The annual physical stock count of in-process metals resulted in the Company increasing its estimate of the quantity of inventory by an additional 60 koz
of platinum and 26 koz of palladium. This is significantly lower than the additional inventory found in the stock count process in the comparative period
which was abnormally high and resulted in an additional 133 koz of platinum and 75 koz of palladium.

Section 54 safety stoppages have impacted production in the period across almost all operations. The Principal and Chief Inspectors continue to be engaged
to ensure the impact of these notices can be limited and that Section 54s are only used as a last resort by the regulator.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Overview
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), after normalising for stock gains in both H1 2015 and H1 2016, increased by 12% to R1.5 billion. The 2015 earnings
benefited from a pre-tax stock gain of R2.2 billion compared to R0.6 billion in 2016. Net debt reduced by R2.9 billion to R9.9 billion.

The decline in US Dollar metal prices was partly offset by a weaker Rand resulting in the Rand basket price per platinum ounce ending 3% weaker at R25,100,
compared to R25,748 in H1 2015.

The Company's cash operating costs of R17.8 billion increased by 5%, well below the level of mining inflation, as a result of cost reduction initiatives
and benefits from the 2015 restructuring process.

Unit costs at R19,436 per platinum ounce increased by 2% over R19,095 achieved in H1 2015.

Sales and working capital
Net sales revenue increased by 3% to R30.7 billion, primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of platinum and despite a weaker Rand basket price.

Refined platinum sales for the period increased to 1,221 koz, an increase of 5%, however sales of refined palladium and rhodium decreased by 2% and 7%
respectively. Nickel sales increased by 5% as a result of an increase in production from Mogalakwena.

The average US Dollar basket price per platinum ounce sold decreased by 24% in 2016 to USD1,632, versus USD2,157 achieved in 2015. The average US Dollar
sales price achieved on all metals declined, with platinum down by 16% to USD971 per ounce; palladium down by 29%, rhodium down by 40%, nickel down by 36%
and copper down by 12%.

The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate weakened by 29% to R15.38/USD from the R11.94/USD average during the comparative period in 2015. After taking into
account the effect of the weakening of the Rand against the US Dollar, the average realised Rand basket price per platinum ounce was 3% weaker at R25,100.

Working capital decreased by R1.3 billion to R12.3 billion as at 30 June 2016. This is a further decrease following the R1.0 billion decrease in 2015.
Working capital days decreased to 43 days compared with 76 in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to extending creditor payment periods for key suppliers.

Costs
Cost of sales increased by 9%, from R25.5 billion to R27.9 billion mainly as a result of an increase in cash operating cost by R1.0 billion, R1.6 billion
higher costs for purchase of metals and R0.6 billion movement in metal inventory, partly offset by lower overhead costs of R0.4 billion and lower
amortisation of R0.4 billion. R0.8 billion of purchased metals relating to market activities will reverse when the instruments are closed out.

Costs for purchases of metal increased by 31% to R6.7 billion. The higher costs are due to leasing and buying of metals to fill contractual sales
obligations post the section 54 safety stoppage at the PMR, the weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate and marginally higher volumes of metals purchased,
partly offset by lower US Dollar metal prices used in determining the cost of purchased metals. R0.8 billion of purchased metals relating to market
activities will reverse when the instruments are closed out.

The cash operating cost per platinum ounce (excluding projects) was R19,436, an increase of less than 2% over H1 2015 and less than 1% over 2015.

EBIT
EBIT amounted to R2.1 billion, compared to R3.5 billion in H1 2015, principally due to a R1.6 billion lower pre-tax stock gain in 2016. Therefore, on a
normalised basis, EBIT increased by 12% from R1.3 billion to R1.5 billion. Positive contributions to normalised EBIT included the weakening of the Rand
against the US Dollar contributing R5.0 billion, lower costs of R1.4 billion, which was partly offset by lower prices of R4.6 billion and lower sales
volumes, in particular palladium and rhodium.

Cash flow
Despite the decline in the rand PGM basket price in 2016, the Company generated free cash flow from operations of R3.2 billion. This was delivered after
paying for capital expenditure and capitalised waste stripping of R2.0 billion; taxes of R0.4 billion; interest of R0.7 billion; funding to associates of
R0.3 billion and other expenditures of R0.1 billion.

Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure (excluding capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena) was R1.4 billion, a decrease of 15% against the R1.6 billion spent in the
comparative period. SIB capital expenditure was in line at R1.1 billion, and project capital was R334 million, a 45% decrease as no new major projects have
been implemented. Capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena amounted to R616 million, an increase of R73 million.

Net debt and dividend
The balance sheet position of the Company has further improved as a result of ensuring operations are cash positive, disciplined capital allocation and
overheads are rightsized. In addition, the Company is focused on decreasing its working capital. Consequently the debt position has improved to
R9.9 billion at 30 June 2016 from R12.8 billion at 31 December 2015.

The Company has committed facilities of R22.3 billion and is comfortably within its debt covenants. R19 billion of the facilities are committed for one to
five years; R2.3 billion is committed for a rolling period of 364 days; while the rest is committed for less than 364 days. The Company has adequate
committed facilities to meet its future funding requirements.

Owing to the net debt position of the Company, and considering future capital funding requirements in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Board has
decided not to declare a dividend in H1 2016.

Anglo American Platinum will continue to monitor its capital requirements and to prioritise deleveraging the balance sheet before considering future
dividend payments.

Disciplined capital allocation
Disciplined capital allocation is a key priority for Anglo American Platinum. The Company has a number of high quality and high returning projects with the
ability to be at the lower end of the cost curve, however current market conditions dictate that these capital decisions be delayed until after 2017. Anglo
American Platinum is able to maintain current production in the near term without any major capital investment.

Aside from the normal quantitative and qualitative assessments, any projects will only be considered if the Company sees market demand for additional
ounces and if the Company has adequate balance sheet strength.

SIB capital allocation was re-engineered with the introduction of a specialised capital excellence team (CET), an SIB investment committee and a revised
project execution strategy in late 2014. Capital is allocated to sustain operational performance without introducing risk. The primary mission of the CET
is to review SIB projects to find optimal solutions. The SIB Investment Committee comprising representatives from Technical, Operations, Finance and
subject matter experts, scrutinise and recommend SIB projects for execution. The Project execution strategy provides for embedded professional project
execution of SIB projects at the operation at a lower cost, with more focus. These SIB tactics have resulted in a thoughtful, risk based approach,
allocating SIB capital appropriately to sustain operations.

MARKETS
Platinum
Despite the increase in platinum price over the first six months of 2016, the average price remains below 2015 levels. The platinum price rallied from a
multi-year low in US Dollar terms in January 2016 as concerns over the US and the global economy depressed the US Dollar, although it remains below
previous year levels. US monetary policy has been a key factor for the platinum price. Mixed data out of the US and wider economic concerns continue to
impact the US Federal Reserve's stance on interest rate hikes. Platinum moved higher as expectations of an interest rate hike were pushed out. Further safe
haven buying was supported by uncertainty created in financial markets following Britain's vote to leave the European Union at the end of H1 2016. Platinum
market sentiment has improved over the first six months of 2016 evidenced by the increase in platinum New York Mercantile Exchange net length of
approximately 1,400 koz to 1,800 koz.

The global platinum market is expected to remain tight in 2016 driven by constrained primary supply in South Africa. Demand growth is expected to remain
muted. Autocatalyst demand is supported by positive momentum in light vehicle sales in Western Europe, up 9%, with platinum light duty diesel loadings set
to rise again in 2016 as a result of Euro 6b implementation. Initial indications show the Chinese platinum jewellery market has stabilised and could return
to growth after a challenging 2015. Industrial applications continue to support platinum consumption alongside positive investment demand. Potential for
South African primary supply growth is limited as the low price environment weighs on development capital and operating costs. Secondary supply from
autocatalyst recycling is forecast to strengthen modestly following a fall in 2015, owing to weaker scrappage economics during last year.

Palladium
Palladium demand is forecast to remain strong, benefiting from car production growth in China, the largest gasoline market. Light duty vehicle sales in
China, c.97% gasoline share, are up 7.6% year-on-year through to the end of June, whilst US sales increased by 1.5% providing a stable base for palladium
automotive demand. Palladium ETF net metal liquidation is expected to offset some of the growth in automotive and industrial usage. However the major
liquidation seen in 2015 of 663 koz ounces is not expected to be repeated in 2016 with year-to-date liquidation amounting to 125 koz. The palladium price
in the first half of the year remained relatively range bound.

Rhodium
The rhodium market is expected to be well supplied in 2016. Autocatalyst demand is expected to benefit from tightening emissions legislation and technology
changes in China and Europe respectively, supported by automotive production growth. Industrial demand is expected to grow due to expansion in the glass
sector.

Automotive
Slow growth in global platinum autocatalyst demand is forecast in 2016. Europe is expected to lead platinum autocatalyst demand growth, more than
offsetting a decline in demand from North America and Japan. Western European light duty vehicle sales have been strong to date, up 8.5% in comparison to
the same period in 2015. Platinum usage is expected to increase with marginally higher loadings in 2016 attributable to the Euro 6b implementation. Despite
heightened media focus on diesel vehicles following news of emissions irregularities, diesel's share remains resilient at marginally under 50%. The Chinese
Heavy Duty Diesel (HDD) sector is forecast to be a growth market for platinum with demand expected to increase in 2016, albeit off a low base, through an
increase in both loadings and production. Emissions legislation is and will be the key focus in many regions going forward. For example India is moving
directly to Bharat Stage 6 legislation (Euro 6 equivalent) and China is working towards rolling out China 5 and China V rules in the light and heavy duty
markets respectively. Light duty vehicle sales in the US are up 1.5%, whilst Japan and Brazil have underperformed over the first half of the year down 6.4%
and 18.9% respectively.

The automotive industry is making concrete steps towards zero emissions through greater electrification of the passenger vehicle's powertrain. Hybrid
technology is the first step in a journey to full electric vehicles, whether powered by a battery or a fuel cell.

Sales of full electric vehicles and hybrids currently account for two million units per year from annual global volumes of 90 million light duty vehicles
but this figure is expected to grow to just under 10 per cent of the market over the next decade. During this period, the internal combustion engine -
whether diesel or gasoline-fuelled - is expected to play a dominant role and overall forecast growth in the number of automobiles produced annually to just
under 120 million units by 2025 suggests that not only will this technology continue to be central to the automotive sector but that the number of internal
combustion engine vehicles produced each year is likely to grow over this period. With almost all of these fitted with a PGM-containing catalyst, this
should be supportive of PGM demand over this timescale.

This stage of the journey towards fully electric vehicles is also supportive of demand for our metals. Hybrid cars all use a type of combustion engine and
consequently require the use of PGM-based emissions after treatment. Further penetration of this technology at the expense of conventional vehicles
therefore presents a minimal risk of disruption to metal demand over the next decade. In the longer term, we see opportunities for fuel cell electric
vehicles (FCEV) and battery electric vehicles in different segments of the passenger vehicle market. FCEV, which utilise a platinum catalyst, currently
seem better positioned to provide greater range and ease of refuelling, and the commercialisation of this technology could provide a significant boost to
platinum demand over the longer term.

Industrial
Industrial demand provides a steady base for platinum consumption, generally growing in line with the global economy. There is potential for industrial
demand to achieve growth in excess of this in 2016. Industrial demand is typically from a combination of metal to replace in-process losses and metal for
new plant capacity. Consumption in chemical, electrical, petroleum refining and bio-medical applications is in line with expectations. The glass sector is
expected to be the primary driver of industrial growth this year due to potential expansion of capacity in both display glass and fibreglass segments. PGM
containing stationary applications using fuel cell technology are expected to grow in 2016, in particular in large power generation, residential combined
heat and power units and telecommunications, albeit off a low base.

Jewellery
The Chinese platinum jewellery sector is expected to stabilize and return to growth in 2016 after a challenging 2015. China is the largest platinum
jewellery market accounting for more than 60% of global platinum jewellery demand. Platinum volumes on the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) have performed well
year-to-date, up 3.7%. Using SGE volumes as a high level indicator for platinum jewellery performance, initial indications in 2016 are therefore
encouraging and are supported by market development activities. Platinum Guild International (PGI) is our conduit for market development efforts in the
jewellery markets. Jewellery companies supported by the PGI continue to benefit from these initiatives, outperforming other market participants in key
regions. Targeted PGI marketing efforts in India continue to support this growth market for platinum jewellery which grew by nearly 30% in 2015. This trend
is expected to be extended in 2016.

Investment
Following an exceptional year in 2015 for physical investment in platinum bars in Japan of 630 koz, positive momentum was carried into 2016 with
approximately 320 koz of buying in the first six months of the year. Buying was strong in the first quarter before slowing due to an increase in the
platinum price. Liquidation of 230 koz in platinum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in 2015 was symptomatic of wider market sentiment last year. In contrast
platinum ETF holdings were fairly steady in the first six months of 2016, declining by only 35 koz. Weak sentiment towards palladium has extended into 2016
as evidenced by the liquidation in ETF holdings, albeit at a slower rate than last year. Palladium year-to-date liquidation amounts to 125 koz. The World
Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) has increased its range of market development activities to promote platinum as an investment product. In the first half of
2016 the Austrian Mint issued its first platinum coin as part of the prestigious Vienna Philharmonic range.

PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE
Market development
Market development forms a core part of Anglo American Platinum's commercial strategy. The Company has continued to increase its focus to stimulate demand
across jewellery, investment and industrial segments.

In the jewellery sector, the industry-funded PGI continues to show success with PGI-supported retail partners outperforming their industry peers in China,
the US and Japan. In India, a new brand driven approach that leverages co-funding from retailers and which sets aggressive targets/criteria for retailers
to qualify as partners is proving successful. The PGI-owned bridal jewellery brand, Evara, has proven hugely successful with platinum jewellery demand in
India growing from 23 koz in 2008 to 225koz in 2015.

On the industrial front the objective is to accelerate the uptake of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to increase demand not only for platinum, but
also for the minor metals: rhodium, ruthenium and iridium. The Company continues to focus on FCEV activities that support consumer perception and hydrogen
infrastructure in key markets (USA, Germany, UK) while leveraging third party funding to maintain scale and impact. In the first half of the year the
Company spearheaded a world record-setting event, with Anglo American Platinum's Hyundai iX35 hydrogen car setting the record for the world's longest
continuous journey in a fuel cell electric vehicle of 6,096 miles over six days, and the longest FCEV journey in the UK on a single tank of hydrogen,
travelling 406 miles.

The Company's PGM Investment Programme (PGMIP) also continued to invest in technologies that aim to address the high delivered cost of hydrogen which is a
key lever to enable the economic viability of hydrogen refuelling stations and hence the uptake of FCEVs. During H1 of 2016, Hydrogenious Technologies',
one of the PGMIP's portfolio companies, launched its first commercial hydrogen storage and logistics system using the innovative Liquid Organic Hydrogen
Carrier technology. Hydrogenious Technologies also signed a deal with United Hydrogen Group (UHG), a hydrogen distribution company based in the United
States, which is also part of the PGMIP portfolio. The technology will increase delivery ranges and decrease the operating costs of hydrogen logistics for
UHG. Further, the agreement enables Hydrogenious Technologies to enter the USA, which represents over 50% of the global hydrogen market, and will catalyse
the rollout of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure for FCEVs.

On the investment segment, the industry-funded WPIC continues to make progress and has become a trusted source of objective and reliable market data to
platinum investors worldwide. The WPIC continues to stimulate investor demand for physical platinum globally through targeted market initiatives, this
includes for example the exclusive agreement between WPIC and Rand Merchant Bank to extend the global reach of platinum bullion coin custodial certificates
to retail and institutional investors. Furthermore WPIC have established a partnership with Valcambi, a precious metals refiner, to increase the
availability of platinum bar and coin products for the global retail market. This partnership provides a platform for platinum investment growth in the US.

Mining innovation
Anglo American Platinum continues to invest in new mining and processing technology (NMT) in key areas which could unlock value in mining and processing,
as well as support the strategy to modernise the Company. The Company moved the NMT centre from Rustenburg to Twickenham (Hackney shaft) which will provide
the platform to prove the value of advancements in technologies in an operational environment. The Company has started testing the advanced Extra Low
Profile and Ultra Low Profile equipment which enables mechanised mining of narrower stoping widths of 1.6m and 1.2m respectively. Locomotives and Dozers
fuelled from fuel cell technology have also been developed.

People and communities
In support of the Company's strategy, an integrated and holistic human resource development plan is in place that takes cognisance of the changing make-up
and skills sets that will be required of the workforce as operations increasingly modernise over time. As an element of this plan, employees and learners
are provided the opportunity to obtain skills required to perform roles within the Company and advance along defined career paths, based on opportunity and
suitability.

Employee financial well-being is a critical component of overall employee wellness and ensuring employees are focused and productive at work. Therefore the
Company continues to make good progress with Summit Financial Solutions (Summit) on the implementation of its employee financial wellness program,
Nkululeko. The program is intended to address high levels of personal debt and challenge irresponsible lending practices to employees. To date 7,809
employees have approached the Nkululeko financial consultants for advice on how to reduce debt and 1,490 employees are on formal debt counselling programs,
with c.R30 million saved for employees in annual debt installments. The number of emolument attachment orders have been reduced from 5,877 in 2011 to 1,088
in 2016 and court proceedings, against certain debt administrators to stop abusive practices are continuing.

The Company is focussed on investing in, and building relationships with employees and surrounding communities. The Company has invested over R300 million
per annum in the development of host communities around our operations to ensure harmonious relationships, and to ensure our employees live in stable and
serviced communities. Despite these efforts, there remains a tangible back-log in the provision of services in many of the communities around operations
and the Company will continue to work with government and communities to reduce this back-log over time.

Mining Charter
The Mining Charter provided guidelines on the key milestones of mining industry transformation that had to be achieved between 2004 and 2014. It included a
range of transformation pillars on ownership, human resources development, employment equity, procurement and enterprise development, housing and living
conditions, mine community development, and sustainable development and growth. The beneficiation pillar was suspended pending finalisation of policy and
legislation on beneficiation.

Anglo American Platinum submitted its Mining Charter compliance report ahead of the 14 March 2015 deadline to the DMR using the prescribed template. Anglo
American Platinum has not received any notification or report from the DMR setting out the DMR's assessment of progress in achieving the targets set out in
the Mining Charter, and the Company remains of the view that it has met its targets as contained in the Mining Charter.

Following the publication for comment of the Reviewed Broad Based Black-Economic Empowerment Charter for the South African Mining and Minerals industry on
15 April 2016, Anglo American plc submitted comprehensive comments, which comments contain material concerns. Anglo American Platinum's comments were
incorporated into the submission made by Anglo American plc. We continue to participate in high level discussions with the DMR to achieve a sustainable
outcome for the South African mining industry.

Wage negotiations
The wage agreement that was in place for the period 2013-2015, expired on 30 June 2016. All wage demands from the negotiating Unions have been received and
new wage negotiations are currently underway. In advance of the wage negotiations, the Company has been communicating at various levels including bilateral
conversations by the CEO with the senior leadership of the Unions, and at 'Future Forums' with employees. These engagements are aimed at reaching a shared
common understanding of the current economic environment the Company is operating in. The Company will retrospectively apply the agreed increases from 1
July 2016.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
There have been no material changes to the mineral resource and reserve estimates as disclosed in the 2015 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources report.

OUTLOOK
In view of the current and expected market conditions, Anglo American Platinum is proactively aligning its business to manage through the current
environment. Stringent controls have been placed on costs, and restructuring recently completed at Union Mine and Twickenham project will deliver
additional cost savings. Cash flow generation remains a key focus, and in light of the current market conditions, project capital expenditure remains on
projects-in-process. The Company looks to strengthen its financial position to enable the business to manage through the cycle and be able to execute on
high returning projects when the market conditions require more metal.

Market outlook
Anglo American Platinum continues to focus on delivering on the strategy of value and not volume; repositioning the portfolio; exiting non-
core assets and continuing to focus on market growth opportunities while its operations deliver on their full potential. Macro-economic factors, including
the global economic outlook and wider monetary policy stances are expected to be key in platinum price determination in the short term. After a recovery in
South African production in 2015, supply growth is expected to be limited in the near term as industry capital expenditure is constrained in the current
low price environment. Secondary supply is set to return to near normal levels in 2016 and steady growth thereafter, in line with expectations. Platinum
usage and consumption is underpinned by the autocatalyst and industrial demand segments in the short to medium term, with potential for growth in jewellery
and investment markets. Strategic market development activities in these demand segments are pivotal to sustaining and growing these markets. Similar to
2015, platinum markets are expected to remain tight.


Operational outlook
Platinum production has a seasonal production profile that is skewed to the second half of the year. This is due to a higher proportion of public holidays
occurring in the first half of the year, as well as normal stock takes and maintenance occurring in the first half of the year. Production is
likely to be at the upper end of our guided range of 2.3 - 2.4 million ounces.

Financial outlook
Cost inflation remains a challenge, with labour, electricity and foreign currency denominated input costs under continued inflationary pressure. Mining
inflation currently runs at around South African CPI +1.3%. Anglo American Platinum has implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives which aim to
offset mining inflation. As such, the Company reiterates its estimates that cash unit costs will be between R19,250 and R19,750 per platinum ounce (M&C)
which equates to a 0% to 2.5% increase in 2016, significantly below mining inflation.

The Company's project portfolio has been aligned to the strategic proposals of the Portfolio Review released in 2013. Capital investment decisions have
been delayed to after 2017, and will be dependent on market demand for additional ounces, and the balance sheet strength of the Company. Capital
expenditure guidance for the year has slightly reduced to between R3.5 billion to R4.0 billion excluding capitalised waste stripping for 2016 (previously
R3.7 billion to R4.2 billion). SIB capital is between R2.7 billion and R3.0 billion with project capital estimated between R0.8 billion and R1.0 billion.
In addition, capitalised waste stripping will be around R1.2 billion for the year. SIB capital expenditure and project capital expenditure are expected to
remain at similar levels for 2017.

The Rand remained weak against the US Dollar during the first half of 2016, and our earnings remain highly geared to the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate.

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

OVERVIEW

Tragically, 3 fatalities occurred during the quarter

Group platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) was marginally higher than the comparative period in 2015 at 586,000 ounces

Strong operational performances achieved by Unki, Union and the joint ventures operations

Refined platinum production increased by 33% to 748,000 ounces for the quarter, reflecting the recovery at the Precious Metals Refinery after a planned
stock take and safety stoppage in Q1 2016

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Tragically we had three losses of life due to work related incidents during the second quarter of 2016. Mr Mlamuli Kubheka and Mr Mveliso Ntamehlo were
fatally injured in a winch related incident at Amandelbult mine on 26 April 2016 and Mr Tamsanqa Ngqambiya sustained fatal injuries in a fall of ground at
Rustenburg Mine on 3 June 2016. Our condolences go to the families, friends and colleagues of Mr Kubheka, Mr Ntamehlo and Mr Ngqambiya. These tragic
incidents came after a record fatality-free period of 323 days highlighting the Company's focus on improving safety.

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (""LTIFR"") per 200,000 hours worked at managed operations reduced 35% to 0.72 compared to the LTIFR of 1.11 of Q2
2015.

Total platinum production was up 1% to 586,000 ounces as a result of improved performances during the quarter at Unki, Union and the joint venture
operations.

Mogalakwena increased total milled volumes by 6% in Q2 2016, however a return to normalised lower grades resulted in a 3% decrease in platinum production
to 99,000 ounces.

Amandelbult production increased 1% to 106,000 ounces. This strong mining performance was offset by a single incident on 26 April 2016 that resulted in two
fatalities, and the subsequent mine stoppage which resulted in a loss of 18,000 ounces.

Unki production increased by 12% to 18,000 ounces for the period. The increased production was due to improved underground mining efficiencies which
resulted in increased milled volume, and a 9% increase in grade due to improved mining height control.

Joint venture production (mined and purchased) increased 9% to 203,000 ounces due to strong production performances from Modikwa, Mototolo, BRPM and
Kroondal which was partly offset by Bokoni. Production at Bokoni decreased by 14% as a result of community unrest causing 10 days production loss.

Platinum production from Rustenburg operations including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment (WLTR) was down 8% to 112,000 ounces. Mine production was
lower due to the impact of the Section 54 safety stoppage associated with the fatality, mining through difficult ground areas, and
marginally lower grade. WLTR increased 27% to 14,000 ounces in part due to new production from the East tailings dams.

Following the significant restructuring at Union, the mine continued to improve performance against its optimised mine plan with production 31% higher at
41,000 ounces mainly due to improved underground mining efficiencies and increased stability at the concentrator plant.

Refined platinum production increased by 33% to 748,000 ounces. The increase is a result of refining the backlog of production not processed in Q1 2016 as
a result of a planned stock take at the PMR and a Section 54 Stoppage which closed the PMR for 12 days, and materially impacted production for a further 37
days. The remainder of the shortfall in refined production will be caught up in H2 2016.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (“the period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 25 July 2016.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s trading statement released on SENS on 21 June 2016 in
which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) respectively
for the period were expected to be at least 20% (R494 million or 189 cents per share) lower than for the
comparative reporting period for the six months ended 30 June 2015 (“comparative period”) and that basic
earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) respectively for the period were also expected to be at
least 20% (R489 million or 187 cents per share) lower than for the comparative period.

Following the end of the period, shareholders are advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the period
are likely to decrease to between R745 million and R1,235 million (or between 70% and 50% lower than
the prior year) and 285 cents and 470 cents per share (or between 70% and 50% lower than the prior year)
respectively. This compares to headline earnings and HEPS of R2,471 million and 945 cents respectively
reported for the comparative period.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to decrease to between R645 million and R1,130 million
(or between 74% and 54% lower than the prior year) and 245 cents and 430 cents per share (or between
74% and 54% lower than the prior year) respectively. This compares to basic earnings and EPS of R2,444
million and 936 cents respectively reported for the comparative period.

The expected decrease in basic earnings and headline earnings is primarily due a higher inventory gain in
the comparative period arising from the annual inventory count (equating to a gain of R1.6 billion or 599
cents per share post-tax) which was substantially higher than the inventory gain in the current period
(equating to a gain of R424 million or 162 cents per share post-tax). In addition, basic earnings and
headline earnings were negatively impacted by a decrease in dollar metal prices in the current period.
Restructuring costs are similar for both reporting periods.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company’s external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

Anglo American Platinum Limited (“the Company”) will release results for the six months ended 30 June
2016 (""the period"") on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 25 July 2016.

With reference to the listings requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to publish a trading
statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be reported
on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty, that headline earnings and
headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 will be at least 20% (R494
million or 189 cents per share) lower than the comparative reporting period for the six months ended 30
June 2015 (“the comparative period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R2.5
billion and 946 cents respectively. Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) will also be at
least 20% (R489 million or 187 cents per share) lower than the comparative period. Basic earnings and
EPS for the comparative period were R2.4 billion million and 936 cents respectively.

The decrease in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily due the stock take adjustment in the
previous period which resulted in an after tax-tax gain of R1.6 billion or 599 cents per share, and a decrease
in dollar metal prices which were partially offset by a weaker rand. The Company cannot yet quantify a
specific range, and will release a further announcement once there is more certainty.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and
reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.

PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2016

OVERVIEW

-   Commitment to zero harm – no fatalities in the period and our longest fatal free period of 324
    days as at 31 March 2016

-   Group platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) increased 4% to 567,000 ounces
    due to an increase in production at Amandelbult, Mogalakwena and Unki, partially offset by lower
    production at Rustenburg

-   Refined platinum production decreased by 52% to 261,000 ounces due to a planned stock take at
    the PMR and a Section 54 Stoppage which closed the Precious Metals Refinery (“PMR”) for 12
    days, and materially impacted production for a subsequent 37 days

-   The PMR has been brought back to steady state operation as of 6 April 2016

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to zero harm and saw an improvement in safety
performance during the period. The Company had no fatalities in Q1 2016 and has extended its
current fatal free period to 324 days to 31 March 2016. The Lost time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”)
per 200,000 hours at managed operations for the quarter was 0.73, a 33% improvement compared to
the LTIFR of 1.09 in Q1 2015.

Total platinum production increased by 4% to 567,000 ounces. Platinum production from own mines
and tailings retreatment increased by 7% to 381,000 ounces from 357,000 ounces due to higher
production from Amandelbult, Mogalakwena and Unki, partially offset by lower production at
Rustenburg.

Amandelbult increased by 33% to 111,000 ounces due to improved mining efficiencies and increased
concentrator recoveries. Production at Mogalakwena increased 7% to 109,000 ounces due to higher
grade and improved concentrator throughput. Production from Unki increased 14% to 19,000 ounces
due to improved running time of the concentrators and increased head grade. In total, production from
retained own mine operations increased 18% compared to the prior period.

Union mine had a solid performance during the quarter, maintaining production at 34,000 ounces.
Rustenburg (including Western Limb Tailings Retreatment) production decreased by 15,000 ounces
to 106,000 ounces due to mining through difficult ground areas and lower grade.

Production from Joint Venture Operations and Associates (mined and purchased), excluding third
party purchase of concentrate, increased by 6% to 185,000 ounces due to improved production at
Kroondal, BRPM and Mototolo.

Third party purchases were down 10,000 ounces due to termination of contracts in 2015.

Refined platinum production for the quarter was materially impacted by a planned stock take at the
PMR and a Section 54 stoppage which closed the PMR for 12 days. Due to the crash stop’ nature of
the Section 54 stoppage, there was a period of process instability at the PMR, which impacted
production for a subsequent 37 days until 6 April 2016. As a result refined platinum production
decreased by 52% to 261,000 ounces with similar decreases for palladium and rhodium during the
period.

The PMR has since been brought back to steady state operation and it is anticipated that these
shortfalls in refined production in Q1 2016 will be caught up in Q2 and Q3 2016. This will have a short
term impact on the financial position of the Company at the end of H1 2016.

Full year guidance of 2.3 - 2.4 million ounces of produced production remains unchanged. Unit cost
guidance remains between R19,250 – R19,750 per produced platinum ounce (metal in concentrate).

Information reported to the Executive Committee of the Group for purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is done on a mine-by-mine basis. 

Changes to the segmental information 
The following changes to the segmental reporting were made following changes to internal reporting to the Executive Committee: 
- During the current year, the Group restructured its business around large mining complexes, consolidating adjacent mines with the concentrating operations. As a result,
  the following segments were consolidated into single reporting segments: 
- Tumela Mine and Dishaba Mine were consolidated into Amandelbult Mine; and 
- Bathopele Mine, Thembelani Mine, Siphumelele Mine and Western Limb Tailings Retreatment were consolidated into Rustenburg Mine. 
  Accordingly, the comparative figures have been aggregated to reflect this change. 
- During the current year, purchased metal excludes tailings from Amplats mines treated by a third party with the concentrate being purchased by Amplats. The results for
  this have been included in the operation from which the tailings arose. Consequently, the results for the year ended 31 December 2014 were restated in a similar manner. 

This resulted in the following changes to the comparative figures:

14. UNKI PLATINUM MINE INDIGENISATION PLAN 
Following approval of its indigenisation plan by the Government of Zimbabwe, Amplats signed a Heads of Agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe in November 2012. That
agreement set out the key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for the Group's Unki Mine investment. The plans envisaged the sale of 51% of the investment through a
notional vendor funded 10-year transaction. The plan has not been implemented. 

On 8 January 2016, the Minister of Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment in Zimbabwe published a General Notice which sought to simplify and clarify the
framework, procedure and guidelines for complying with the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act. A concerning provision within the General Notice is a requirement
that, for the resource sector, the 51% shareholding will be acquired in exchange for the mineral resource being exploited and at no monetary cost to the Government. The
Group is still studying the full implication on its indigenisation compliance plan should the provision contained in the General Notice become law. Engagements with the
Zimbabwean Government are ongoing, and the Group is not yet certain of the impact of the General Notice on the proposed Unki indigenisation transaction.

Rustenburg Mine will be sold as a going concern, for an upfront consideration of R1,500 million and deferred consideration amounting to 35% of the business's distributable
free cash flow for six to eight years subject to a minimum of R3,000 million. These proceeds will be offset by funding to be provided by Amplats in the event of the
business having a negative free cash flow between the closing of the transaction and 31 December 2018. This funding is limited to R267 million per annum and is pro-rated.
Taking into account the most recent cash flow estimates for the business, the estimated fair value of the total consideration amounts to R2,798 million. This excludes any
economic value generated from the future purchase of concentrate and toll treatment arrangements which will be recognised for accounting purposes at the time when the
benefit is received. The transaction requires various regulatory approvals, including approval by the South African competition authorities and the Department of Mineral
Resources. Since the transaction remains subject to these significant approvals, Rustenburg Mine cannot be reclassified as held for sale at this stage. It is expected that
it will take approximately six to 12 months to implement and complete the transaction. 

16. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS 
Rustenburg Mine 
Amplats considers its mining, smelting and refining operations as a single cash-generating unit. Following the announcement of the signing of the SPA with Sibanye, the
assets attributable to Rustenburg Mine were assessed separately within the cash-generating unit for impairment. As such, the recoverable value of Rustenburg Mine is
calculated as the fair value of the estimated proceeds less transaction costs, and amounts to R2,798 million. It excludes any economic value generated from the future
purchase of concentrate and toll treatment arrangements which will be recognised for accounting purposes at the time when the benefit is received. The recoverable amount
comprises a Level 3 fair value in terms of the fair value hierarchy (as defined in note 13). The fair value of the deferred consideration payable by Sibanye, and negative
free cash flow funding payable by Amplats were determined based on the projected cash flows for Rustenburg Mine. The relevant amounts were discounted at the cost of
borrowing of Sibanye and Amplats respectively. 

The net carrying value of Rustenburg Mine at 1 September 2015 was R7,274 million. The excess of the carrying value above the recoverable amount gives rise to an impairment
of R6,216 million (R4,476 million net of tax). The entire impairment is attributable to property, plant and equipment. A resulting impairment loss has been recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income and is separately presented. This impairment loss is included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings. 

Equity investments in Atlatsa and Bokoni Holdco and associated loans 
Amplats has a 22.76% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco. The Group, together with Atlatsa, has completed a technical review of the
Bokoni Platinum Mine to develop a new optimised mine plan. On 16 September 2015, Atlatsa announced the implementation of its restructuring plan of Bokoni Platinum Mine.
Bokoni Platinum Mine is likely to remain cash negative for some time as it funds development at Brakfontein and Middelpunt Hill. 

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni Platinum Mine, Amplats has fully impaired its equity interests in Atlatsa and Bokoni
Holdco with a carrying value of R1,406 million. These write-offs are included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings. 

Atlatsa's ability to service its debt obligations in the context of the current market conditions, where Bokoni Platinum Mine is its main source of funding, is doubtful at
current PGM price levels. Amplats has, therefore, for accounting purposes fully impaired the various loans it has extended to Atlatsa and Atlatsa Holdings, with an
accounting carrying value of R1,792 million in aggregate. The impairment losses arising from these loan write-offs are included in basic and headline earnings. 

Equity investment in BRPM and available-for-sale investment in RBPlat 
Amplats has an 11.68% shareholding in RB Plat and a 33% direct interest in BRPM. In November 2010, when RB Plat listed, the investments in both RB Plat and BRPM were
required to be revalued for accounting purposes to the fair value at that date, which resulted in fair value gains of R690 million (after tax) and R2,938 million (after
tax) respectively. Subsequent to this, the Group continued to equity account 33% of the earnings of BRPM. This resulted in the carrying value of the investment in BRPM
increasing from R4,394 million to R6,125 million. In addition, the 11.68% holding in RB Plat was marked to market with the gains and losses being reflected in other
comprehensive income. 

Given the decrease in PGM prices and the reduction in the market value of RB Plat shares, the Group has assessed the carrying value of both investments for impairment. The
recoverable amount of the investment in RB Plat was the quoted market price at the date of impairment, which comprises a Level 1 fair value in terms of the fair value
hierarchy. The recoverable amount of the investment in BRPM was its value in use and amounted to R3,449 million at the date of impairment. This comprises a Level 3 fair
value in terms of the fair value hierarchy. The value in use was determined based on the in-situ value for 4E ounces outside the life of mine plan and the net present
value of the current life of mine plan using the following assumptions, which were based on analyst consensus prices in August 2015: 

-Platinum USD1,269 per ounce (real long-term) 
-Palladium USD809 per ounce (real long-term) 
-A long-term real rand/US dollar exchange rate of R11.57:USD1 
-A real discount rate of 7.5% 
-A life of mine of 30 years. 

Consequently, the investment in RB Plat has been written down by R775 million (after tax) by recycling previously recognised losses in other comprehensive income through
profit or loss for the period, and the investment in BRPM has been written down by R2,676 million (after tax). These impairments are included in basic earnings but
excluded from headline earnings. 

17. SCRAPPING OF ASSETS 
Development on the Twickenham project has been suspended and the operation restructured to reduce cash losses, including placing the Twickenham shaft on care and
maintenance. Production continues at the Hackney shaft. The mine is being redeveloped from a conventional mine to become a largely mechanised operation, which seeks to
increase productivity and the profitability of the mine. Previous development on a conventional mine and some of the related infrastructure and assets will not be utilised
in the new mechanised mine layout. These assets of R3,435 million, including capitalised interest and study costs, have been written off. The resulting loss of R2,473
million (after tax) is excluded from headline earnings. 

Furthermore, the Group reviewed alternative business cases for the life extension at Tumela and concluded that a lower capital, higher returning option than the Tumela 5
shaft is the preferred replacement project. Accordingly, development of the Tumela 5 shaft has been stopped and the feasibility study and early development expenditure
amounting to R388 million (R279 million after tax) has been written off. This write-off is included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings. 

18. POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS 
Amplats' strategy is to continue to reposition its assets into a value optimising portfolio, with its assets positioned in the first half of the primary PGM production
cost curve. Given the industry headwinds, the Amplats Board on 4 February 2016 considered the progress made with respect to the strategic repositioning of the portfolio
and approved the following refinements to the portfolio: 

-Commence the process of placing Twickenham Mine on care and maintenance; and 
-Consider exiting Amplats' 50% interest in the Kroondal PSA at the right time for value, while ensuring the value generated from the purchase of concentrate agreement is
 maintained. 

The carrying value of Twickenham Mine assets is R2.3 billion (post the write-off of assets of R3.2 billion). As Twickenham remains a key part of the Amplats portfolio and
development will resume once the market demands the additional PGMs and the Group's balance sheet allows, the remaining assets that will be used in developing a mechanized
mine, have not been written off. 

Furthermore, the Group will continue to account for the Kroondal Mine as a joint operation until the Group has entered into a binding contract to exit from its interests
in the mine.

OPERATIONS
Safety, Health and Welfare
Tragically we had two losses of life due to work related incidents during the first half of 2015. Mr Michael Malesa was fatally injured when he was struck by a utility
vehicle underground at Twickenham mine on 26 January and Mr Joseph Khesa sustained fatal injuries in a fall of ground at Thembelani mine on 12 May. Our deepest condolences
go to the families, friends and colleagues of Mr Malesa and Mr Khesa.

Amplats' lost-time-injury-frequency-rate (LTIFR) for the full year was 0.98, marginally higher than the normalised strike impacted LTIFR for 2014. There has been an
improvement in safety performance in the second half of 2015 due to focused interventions at operations that showed any slight deterioration in safety performance,
addressing specific risks at those operations. The Company had no fatalities in the second half of the year which is the longest fatality-free period in the Company's
history - at year-end 232 days fatality free. Amplats continues to make safety the priority and has an ultimate ambition of zero-harm.

During 2015, the Company continued its initiative of proactive campaigns to highlight the importance of HIV and TB management. These disease management plans included
engaging HIV positive employees not currently on the programmes, and encouraged their participation. There was a significant improvement in the health and welfare of our
employees, with a notable decline in disease related deaths.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Amplats had a strong recovery in platinum production in 2015, with the previous period being materially impacted by the five-month industrial action and subsequent
ramp up. Strong operational performances were achieved by Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and Unki, with improved performances at Rustenburg and Union as they benefited from an
increased focus on operational efficiency.

Total platinum production (metal in concentrate) from the mines managed directly by the Company and joint venture operations for the twelve months to 31 December 2015
(""the period"") was 2,337 koz, a 25% increase versus the twelve months to 31 December 2014 (""the comparative period""). On a strike-adjusted basis, and accounting for the
closure of the Union mine declines in 2014, platinum production year-on-year benefited from operational improvements.

Mogalakwena mine continued its strong production performance trajectory, with a further improvement in production to 392 koz, a 6% increase from 370 koz. Production
includes 24 koz processed at the Baobab concentrator. Improved mining performance, higher grade and increased concentrator recovery performance resulted in higher
production, despite community unrest around the mine, which led to an 8.6 koz impact in Q3 2015.

As a result of increased production and reduced costs, cash costs per platinum ounce at Mogalakwena improved year-on-year, decreasing by 7% to R17,502 from R18,900. The
basket price per platinum ounce at Mogalakwena for the period was R32,850 resulting in the mine achieving a cash operating margin of 50%.

Amandelbult mine's platinum production increased by 219 koz to 437 koz against the strike affected comparative period. The first quarter performance was affected by
section 54 safety stoppages impacting 36 days of production, as well as regional water supply disruptions which impacted on the concentrator. Production stability and
output increased significantly thereafter as a result of improved panel-to-crew ratios due to the establishment of increased mineable ore reserves - a result of forward
planning during the five-month industrial action.

Unki mine produced 66 koz platinum ounces a 7% increase due to improved mining efficiencies and higher grade. In the first half of the year, 12,300 tonnes of concentrate
were stockpiled in Zimbabwe as negotiations with the Government of Zimbabwe over export taxes were undertaken. Upon resolution, this material was exported to Polokwane
smelter, and processed during the second half of 2015.

Rustenburg mine, including Western Limb Tailings Retreatment, had an improved production performance in the period, up 202 koz to 485 koz, due to the comparative period
being impacted by the strike. Rustenburg has been further consolidated into two mines; East and West mine, and is in the process of implementing its optimised mine plan.
Progress on the plan has led to increased immediately available ore reserves, improved productivity and increased profitability.

Union mine produced 141 koz, up 53 koz year-on-year owing to the comparative period being impacted by the strike, and after accounting for the closure of the south
declines which had an annual production run-rate of 61 koz. The mine was impacted by Section 54 safety stoppages and the regional water shortage during the year, but
operational improvements are seen through the implementation of the optimised mine plan.

Platinum production from joint ventures and associates, inclusive of both mined and purchased production, decreased by 2% to 768 koz. Lower production was largely as a
result of safety stoppages following fatal incidents at Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM), lower grade at Mototolo and closure of two shafts at Bokoni. This was
partly offset by higher production from Kroondal.

Platinum ounces purchased from third parties decreased by 40% from 55 koz to 33 koz.

Section 54 safety stoppages have impacted production in the period across almost all operations. The Department of Mineral Resources has been engaged by the Company to
ensure the impact of these notices can be limited and that Section 54s are used as a last resort.

Total refined platinum production of 2,459 koz in 2015 increased by 30% as production returned to normal following the 2014 strike and operational improvements. In
addition, a physical count of in-process metals was conducted in the first half of the year, which led to an increase in inventory of 130 koz of platinum and 75 koz of
palladium. The increased inventory was processed which led to an increase of refined production of 2,459 koz over produced ounces of 2,337 koz.

Refined platinum sales volumes increased by 17% to 2,471 koz versus the previously strike impacted performance in 2014 of 2,115 koz.

""Equivalent refined production"" which was the previous operational production performance metric for Amplats, was calculated as mines' production and purchases of metal in
concentrate converted to equivalent refined production using internal standard smelting and refining recoveries. This has been discontinued following the interim reporting
period and has now been replaced by ""platinum ounces produced"" (i.e. mines' production and purchases of metal in concentrate) in line with market benchmarks.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Overview
The financial performance of the Company was materially impacted by the steep decline in the dollar price for all metals, as well as one-off costs and impairments in the
period. However, the performance of the Company improved year-on-year on a normalised basis.

EBIT, after adjusting for the impairment and scrapping of assets, increased to R3.6 billion from R1.2 billion due to improvement in operational performance following the
protected industrial action in the comparative period, an increase in sales volumes and weakening of the South African Rand versus the US dollar.

Headline earnings decreased to R107 million from R786 million in 2015, due to the sharp dollar PGM price declines as well as one-off restructuring costs of R848 million
(post tax) and the once-off write-off of loans to Atlatsa of R1.8 billion (post-tax). Excluding these one-off items, headline earnings increased to R2.7 billion or
452 cents per share.

Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders reduced to a loss of R12.1 billion, largely due to one-off impairments. On a normalised basis, excluding the one-off
impairment and restructuring costs, profit attributable to ordinary shareholders increased to R2.7 billion from R624 million in the previous period.

Attributable loss for the period was 4,638 cents per share compared to earnings of 239 cents per share in the comparative period while headline earnings were 41 cents per
share compared to 301 cents per share in the comparative period.

Impairments
The Company has recorded impairments totalling R14.0 billion (post-tax) with R1.8 billion impacting headline earnings.

Post-tax impairments which impacted basic earnings, included Rustenburg operations (R4.5 billion), Twickenham (R2.5 billion), Tumela 5 (R0.3 billion), MIG plants (R0.1
billion), equity interests in RB Plats (R0.8 billion) and BRPM (R2.7 billion) and equity interests in Atlatsa and Bokoni Platinum Holdings (Bokoni Holdco) (R1.4 billion).

In addition, the Company wrote off senior loans and working capital facilities loaned to Atlatsa and Atlatsa Holdings leading to an impairment of R1.8 billion (post-tax)
which has impacted headline earnings.

Sales and working capital
Net sales revenue increased by 8% to R59.8 billion from R55.6 billion in 2014, due primarily to increased sales volume of platinum, palladium and rhodium, as well as the
weakening of the rand/US dollar exchange rate. This was partly offset by lower sales volume of nickel, iridium and ruthenium, and exacerbated by lower dollar metal prices.

Refined platinum sales for the year increased to 2,471 koz, an increase of 17%. Sales of refined palladium and rhodium increased by 27% and 33% respectively. Nickel sales
declined by 10% as the tolling of nickel copper matte finished at the end of 2014.

The average US dollar basket price per platinum ounce sold decreased by 21% in 2015 to USD1,905 versus USD2,413 achieved in 2014. The decline was driven by the decrease in
prices for all metals. The average US dollar sales price achieved on all metals declined with platinum down by 24% to USD1,051 per ounce; palladium down by 12%, rhodium
down by 16%, nickel down by 31% and copper down by 25%.

The average rand/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 17% to R12.71: USD1.00 from the R10.87 average during the comparative period. After taking into account the effect of
the weakening of the Rand against the US dollar, the average realised Rand basket price per platinum ounce was 8% weaker at R24,203.

Working capital decreased by R1.0 billion to R13.6 billion as at 31 December 2015. This is a further decrease following the R1.4 billion decrease in 2014. Working capital
days decreased to 77 days compared with 108 in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction in metal inventory to enhance cash inflows and lower trade debtors, partly
offset by lower trade creditors. The decrease in trade creditors was mainly due to lower expenditure, particularly purchase of concentrate and capital expenditure, as
creditors' days remained unchanged at 26.

The stock count completed in the first half of 2015 indicated an additional 130 koz of platinum and 75 koz of palladium, in the processing facilities. These ounces,
together with minor changes in rhodium and nickel, were valued at R2.2 billion (pre-tax) and are included in the movement in metal inventories in earnings.

Costs
Cost of sales increased by 3%, from R53.0 billion to R54.5 billion mainly as a result of cash operating production costs (cash mining, smelting, treatment and refining
costs) increasing by 17% to R35.5 billion from R30.2 billion in 2014. The higher costs are primarily as a result of increased mining, milling and refined volumes compared
to the previous period which was affected by the five month industrial action.

Costs for purchases of metal reduced to R10.2 billion down 17% from R12.4 billion in 2014. The lower costs are ascribed to the lower dollar metal prices used in
determining the cost of purchased metals and marginally lower volume purchased, somewhat offset by the weaker ZAR/USD exchange rate.

Reorganisation
The support and service functions have been reorganised and overhead structure rightsized to support a more focused and less complex business with a reduction of 420
positions mainly in managerial and supervisory roles. This reorganisation will deliver annual labour cost savings of R200 million from 2016. In addition, non-personnel
overhead savings of R800 million will be delivered by 2017, an increase of R200 million from previous guidance of R600 million.

Optimisation plans focusing on the need to be cash positive have identified opportunities to further increase efficiencies at the operations. The revised development and
project timeline and plan for Twickenham led to 547 contractors exiting the Company. During the Section 189 process involving support and services functions, voluntary
severance packages (VSPs) were offered to all employees at the Company's own mines. This resulted in a further reduction in headcount of 1,000 at Rustenburg, 450 at Union
and 400 at the Company's retained portfolio. In addition, restructuring plans at the Bokoni mine, managed by our joint venture partner Atlatsa Resources Corporation
(""Atlatsa""), to stop loss making production, led to some 1,079 employees and contractors exiting the Bokoni mine by 31 December 2015.

The cash outflow to the Company arising from the severance packages plus headcount reductions at Bokoni mine, is R1.1 billion (pre-tax), and has been fully charged in the
period to 31 December 2015, and impacts basic and headline earnings.

Capital expenditure
Disciplined capital is a key priority for Amplats. Given the particularly weak PGM price environment since mid-2015, the Company has postponed investment in all growth and
replacement projects. While these projects are high quality and high margin, with the ability to be at the lower end of the cost curve, current market conditions dictate
that these capital decisions be delayed until at least 2017.

Stay in Business (SIB) Capital allocation was re-engineered with the introduction of a specialised capital excellence team (CET), an SIB investment committee and a revised
project execution strategy. Capital was allocated to sustaining the operational performance without introducing risk. The primary mission of the CET was to review SIB
projects to find the optimal solution. The SIB Investment committee comprising representation from Technical, Operations, Finance and subject matter experts, scrutinised
and recommended SIB projects for execution. The Project execution strategy provided for embedded professional project execution of SIB projects at the operation at a lower
cost, with more focus. These SIB tactics have resulted in a thoughtful, risk based approach, allocating SIB capital appropriately to sustain operations.

Total capital expenditure excluding Mogalakwena mine waste stripping was R3.7 billion, down 36% against the R5.8 billion spent in the comparative period. SIB capital
expenditure was R2.5 billion, down R1.4 billion, whilst growth capital was R1.2 billion, down R648 million as major capital project decisions have been delayed until 2017.
Capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena amounted to R999 million, up from R561 million capitalised in 2014.

Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)
EBIT was severely impacted by the one-off items however after adjusting for impairments and scrapping of assets, EBIT increased by R2.4 billion to R3.6 billion compared to
R1.2 billion in the comparative period. Positive contributions to EBIT for the year included the weakening of the Rand against the US dollar contributing R7.8 billion;
additional margin from higher sales volumes amounting to R0.9 billion; the strike impact on 2014 adding R2.9 billion and lower cash costs of R0.7 billion. Earnings were
further supported by R2.2 billion arising from the positive adjustment to inventory from the annual stock count (compared to a minor negative adjustment in 2014). These
increases were partly offset by the decline in metal prices of R9.2 billion, CPI inflation of R1.7 billion and higher restructuring costs of R1.1 billion compared to R0.2
billion in 2014. Restructuring costs comprise mainly expenses arising from voluntary separation packages paid to employees.

Cash flow
Despite the decline in PGM prices in 2015, the Company generated free cash flow from operations of R4.0 billion (before the R1.1 billion final settlement with the South
African Revenue Service and restructuring costs of R1.1 billion (pre-tax) . This was after paying all capital expenditure of R4.7 billion; taxes of R0.7 billion; interest
of R1.3 billion; funding to associates of R0.8 billion and other expenditures of R0.3 billion.

Net debt and dividend
The balance sheet position of the Company remains strong as a result of focusing on ensuring operations are cash positive, disciplined capital allocation and ensuring
overheads are right-sized. Consequently, the net debt position has improved from R14.6 billion at 31 December 2014 to R12.8 billion.

The Company has legally binding committed facilities of R22.3 billion and is comfortably within its debt covenants. The committed facilities that were due to mature in
2015 were rolled over and only R1.5 billion of facilities are due to mature in 2016.

Owing to the net debt position of the Company, and considering future funding requirements in a weak macroeconomic environment, the Board has decided not to declare a
dividend in 2015.

Amplats will continue to monitor its capital requirements, ability to manage debt levels adequately and will consider future dividend payments when the financial situation
of the Company allows.

Post balance sheet events
Amplats' strategy is to continue to reposition its assets into a value optimising portfolio, with its assets positioned in the first half of the primary PGM production
cost curve. Given the industry headwinds, the Amplats Board on 4 February 2016 considered the progress made with respect to the strategic repositioning of the portfolio
and approved the following refinements to the portfolio:

Commence the process of placing Twickenham Mine on care and maintenance; and
Consider exiting Amplats' 50% interest in the Kroondal PSA at the right time for value, while ensuring the value generated from the purchase of concentrate agreement is
maintained.

The carrying value of Twickenham Mine assets is R2.3 billion (post the write-off of assets of R3.2 billion). As Twickenham remains a key part of the Amplats portfolio and
development will resume once the market demands the additional PGMs and the Group's balance sheet allows, the remaining assets that will be used in developing a mechanised
mine, have not been written off.

Furthermore, the Group will continue to account for the Kroondal Mine as a joint operation until the Group has entered into a binding contract to exit from its interests
in the mine.

MARKETS
While platinum and palladium demand exceeded supply from mining and recycling for the fourth consecutive year, PGM prices declined in a challenging year for the
commodities. This in turn reflected lower global growth, while the prospect of monetary tightening in the USA weighed on non-interest bearing asset classes. In addition,
growth concerns in China, uncertainty surrounding Greece's possible exit from the euro, and the vehicle emissions scandal all dampened sentiment towards PGMs.

Platinum
Gross global platinum demand increased by 2% or 147 koz. A decline in jewellery demand was offset by strength in the automotive, investment and industrial sectors. After a
strike affected 2014, primary production in South Africa recovered to levels above 2013. However this recovery in South African production was partially offset by modest
reductions in Russia and North America. Levels of recycling declined, mainly due to reduced jewellery recycling volumes in China and lower automotive scrappage incentives
owing to falling scrap steel and copper prices. The annual platinum market remained in deficit, amounting to 703 koz.

Palladium
Gross global palladium demand decreased by 14% or 1,524 koz. The change in investor sentiment, in comparison to 2014, resulted in the liquidation of holdings in Exchange
Traded Funds after an exceptional year for investment in 2014. Growing demand from the auto sector and steady industrial demand was offset by lower investment demand and
jewellery use. Palladium supply in South Africa recovered in 2015 by 420 koz, but decreased in North America and Russia. With lower recycling volumes, overall supply was
only marginally higher than 2014. The annual palladium market remained in deficit by 228 koz.

Rhodium
In 2015, gross rhodium demand decreased by 1% or 11 koz, due to slowing growth in China and weaker-than-expected conditions in Japan and emerging markets. Due to
concentration of rhodium supply in South Africa, the recovery in primary supply was only partially offset by a decline in recycling, which moved the rhodium market into a
surplus of 10koz.

Autocatalysts
Global light-vehicle sales grew by 2% in 2015 to 89.1 million units, driven by sustained growth in North America and Western Europe. However, challenging economic
conditions in markets such as Brazil, Eastern Europe and Japan weighed on local car sales. Vehicle sales in China slowed in mid-2015 as a result of the turmoil in the
equity markets, before regaining momentum from stimulus measures (sales tax cut on 1.6 litre engines), to finish the year up 5.3%.

Gross demand for platinum in autocatalysis increased by 167 koz or 5.3%, primarily due to sustained growth in demand for vehicles in the Western European light-duty
market. The phased implementation of Euro 6b, which applied to all new vehicles from September 2015, resulted in a continued increase in loadings versus 2014. This trend
is expected to continue in 2016. Palladium used in autocatalysis increased by 56 koz in 2015. Increased palladium purchases in North America were partially offset by
weakness in Japan and emerging markets. Gross rhodium use in autocatalysis was similarly impacted by weaker-than-anticipated auto sales in gasoline-dominant markets and by
thrifting in three-way catalysts.

The vehicle emissions scandal was a key feature in the automotive industry in 2015. While this is expected to affect diesel penetration in the North American market,
diesel share in Europe has remained relatively steady. Regulators are expected to review the implementation of emissions legislation and more stringent legislation is
expected in an effort to align emissions standards to real world driving conditions. The new European standard, Euro 6d, will be phased in over several years and will
introduce real driving emissions testing.

Jewellery
The gross global jewellery market declined by 246 koz or 8.5%. The economic slowdown in China, combined with the government's anti-corruption measures, particularly on
jewellery gifting, and the negative wealth effect of falling equity markets saw China's share of the global platinum jewellery market fall from 67% to 62% over the year.
This was partially offset by a decline in jewellery recycling, with net jewellery demand decreasing by 5% in 2015.

However, bridal sales expanded in lower-tier Chinese cities due to continued uptake of the Platinum pair ring concept. Similarly, the mature North America platinum
jewellery market provided steady demand, rising by 5 koz over the year. India reaffirmed its status as the leading growth market for platinum jewellery as demand increased
by 28.5% or 50 koz which follows growth in excess of 20% in 2014. The Evara brand launched by Platinum Guild International (PGI) boosted sales, particularly in the second
half of the year.

Industrial
Industrial platinum demand increased by 83 koz or 4.3%. This was due to expansion in the glass sector and steady growth in chemical and fuel cell applications, offsetting
the fall in platinum use in the petroleum sector. Fuel-cell demand continues to grow, particularly in the telecommunications and off-grid sectors. Progress was made in the
road-transport sector, as efforts towards the adoption of fuel cell technology into the powertrain portfolio were extended by Toyota, Honda, Daimler and Hyundai. In
addition the Chinese government has invested in the technology with the largest fleet, to date, of fuel-cell buses expected to be rolled out in 2016.

Palladium industrial use increased marginally in 2015 by 49 koz or 2.3%, mainly due to a strong performance in the European chemical sector. Rhodium demand from industrial
applications increased by 1 koz to 158 koz.

Investment
Investment demand includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings and over-the-counter metal holdings in vaults. The liquidation of both platinum and palladium holdings in
ETFs was symptomatic of market sentiment, with holdings of gold and silver also down. Liquidation took place in European, North American and South African funds as
platinum and palladium ETF holdings declined by 231 koz or 8% and 663 koz or 22% respectively.

Physical investment in platinum bars in Japan offset these losses as low prices and a strengthening yen in the third quarter were perceived as a buying opportunity. This
buying amounted to 629 koz of platinum for the year.

Rhodium investment amounted to 5 koz during the year due to the launch of the Standard Bank fund, down from additional investment demand of 11 koz in 2014.

Marketing strategy
Amplats' global PGM market development initiatives continue to focus on de-risking demand across the industrial, jewellery and investment segments. South African
beneficiation objectives are supported as part of broader market development activities.

The company invests in market development and beneficiation across four broad demand segments:

-Global and local development of platinum jewellery markets;
-Product development, commercialisation and marketing activities for platinum-containing fuel cells;
-Equity investments in early-stage industrial applications or technologies that use or enable the use of PGMs and
-Stimulating platinum investment demand through the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC)

Together with Lonmin and Impala, Amplats invests in the Platinum Guild International (PGI), which has provided market development, sales support and training to all levels
of the global jewellery trade for more than 30 years. Key targets are the growth markets of China and India. In South Africa, we support skills development and capacity
building in the design and manufacturing of platinum jewellery through the annual PlatAfrica design and manufacture competition. Together with Rand Refinery, we provide a
metal financing scheme to local jewellery manufacturers to finance their working capital requirements.

The Company continues to focus on accelerating the global adoption of platinum-based proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. There is an opportunity to position South
Africa both as a market and as a manufacturing location for fuel-cell products. The creation of a fuel-cell industry, along with manufacturing, installation and
maintenance jobs, is aligned with the national development plan and government's industrial development priorities. The Company and selected partners continue to operate
the worlds' first methanol-based fuel-cell mini-grid system at the Naledi Trust community in the Free State. Fuel-cell systems are cost-effective replacements for
conventional batteries or diesel generators in rural schools, clinics and communities far from existing power grids.

In 2015, the Company sponsored three hydrogen-based fuel cells at three schools in the Cofimvaba district as part of the Department of Science & Technology's TECH4RED
programme. Both Amplats and the government believe that the development of new PGM products can be enabled only by strengthening research capacity and building skills in
the fields of science and engineering. Accordingly, the Company supported two fuel cell-related research programmes at North-West University and University of Cape Town,
both in partnership with the Department of Science & Technology's HySA programme.

The PGM investment programme was created to invest in new technologies that use or enable the use of PGMs in their products or processes. The programme provides start-up
and growth capital to innovators and entrepreneurs in early-stage development and commercialisation of PGM technology. In 2015, the Company continued to contribute via
board participation in companies in which it invests and to originate and screen over 60 opportunities. Amplats also sponsored research into PGM base medical devices in
partnership with the Medical Research Council and the Department of Science & Technology, as well as PGM-related research at the University of Loughborough and Columbia
University.

In 2015, the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) established itself as a credible source of industry supply and demand data. WPIC has progressed with a number of
market-development opportunities, including work on establishing new ETFs and platinum-accumulation programmes in Asian markets.

STRATEGY
Amplats continues with its strategic repositioning to create a high quality asset portfolio with low cost, high margin production, low safety risk and high productivity
through mechanisation. The Company continues to focus on its value driven strategy, resulting in a portfolio which has been repositioned to generate attractive returns
through the cycle. The restructuring of the portfolio has ensured that all operations are cash flow positive in the current weak commodity price environment. The focus of
this strategy is centred on:

-Disciplined capital allocation - in the current tight market environment the decision has been taken to delay growth projects until at least 2017. The operating free cash
 flow of own operations has been improved by reducing the capital intensity of stay in business capital, without increasing the operational risk in the future
-Operational improvements have been delivered across the portfolio of assets and aligning overhead to production resulting in significant overhead cost savings
-The Company has reacted with a supply response through mine closures and rationalisation which commenced in 2013 with the consolidation of the Rustenburg and Union mines
 and further actions taken to close unprofitable ounces in 2014 and 2015. Decisive action has been taken at our operations where improvement and cost savings plans cannot
 yield improved financial performance
-Amplats plans to exit the non-core assets of Rustenburg, Union, Bokoni and Pandora.
-The Company has commenced with the process to place Twickenham on care and maintenance
-Amplats will consider an exit of Kroondal for value

This continued restructuring and repositioning will create a high quality asset portfolio with low cost, high margin production to be profitable through the cycle.

The announcement of the disposal of the Rustenburg Operations (""the Transaction"") on 9 September 2015 to a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited (""Sibanye"") was a significant
step in transitioning the portfolio, allowing the Company to focus its management and capital allocation on priority projects in a more focused portfolio. Progress
continues to be made towards fulfilling the conditions precedent of the Transaction, and key steps have been made including:

-The South African Competition Commission filing being submitted on 13 November 2015;
-Amplats concluding a Services Agreement and a Rail Transportation Services Agreement with Aquarius Platinum South Africa on 16 November 2015, in which Aquarius Platinum
-South Africa consented to the agreements being ceded to Sibanye;
-Sibanye obtaining consent from its lenders to implement the Transaction in November 2015;
-Sibanye obtaining shareholder approval on 18 January 2016, as per JSE Listing Requirements; and
-The application in terms of section 11 of the MPRDA for the sale of the Mining Right and the Prospecting Right to Sibanye was submitted to the DMR on 4 February 2016.

It is envisaged that the Transaction will become unconditional during the latter part of 2016.

Union
The Company continues with its process to dispose of Union mine. Significant restructuring has taken place, including consolidating the mines from two to one and resulted
in a substantial reduction in production in 2015 from a baseline level of 220koz to 140koz to return the mine to profitability. Further production was closed at the
marginal decline areas as they were uneconomic, enabling the closure of surplus concentrators and a reduction in overhead to match the reduced production profile. The
Company remains focused on ensuring the mine is cash positive and is progressing with the sale. If Union does not generate cash and a sale cannot be progressed in the
first half of 2016, then, the Company will consider alternative options including plans to place Union on care and maintenance.

Atlatsa and Bokoni Platinum Holdings (""Bokoni Holdco"")
Amplats has a 23% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in Bokoni Holdco with Atlatsa owning the other 51%. Atlatsa is optimising Bokoni Platinum Mine's
operations, to focus on the development of its Brakfontein and Middelpunt Hill shafts after the closure of the Vertical and UM2 Merensky shafts.

In light of the difficult market conditions Amplats has written off its equity interests in Atlatsa and Bokoni Holdco and the various loans it has extended to Atlatsa and
Atlatsa Holdings (Atlatsa's Black Economic Empowerment shareholder), with a total carrying value of R3.4 billion. This total was included in basic earnings, of which
R1.8 billion relating to the loans was included in headline earnings.

The Company continues to proceed with the exit of its interests in Atlatsa and Bokoni Holdco and discussions with our partners are ongoing.

Pandora
The Company continues to assess options to exit its stake in Pandora.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY
The Company engaged Government extensively during the course of 2015 on key policy matters, regulatory and others issues affecting the mining sector and the Company
specifically.

Mining Charter review
The Mining Charter provided guidelines on the key milestones of mining industry transformation that had to be achieved between 2004 and 2014. This included a range of
transformation pillars on ownership, human resources development, employment equity, procurement and enterprise development, housing and living conditions, mine community
development, and sustainable development and growth. The beneficiation pillar was suspended pending finalisation of policy and legislation on beneficiation.

Amplats submitted its Mining Charter compliance report ahead of the 14 March 2015 deadline to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) using the prescribed template. It
is the Company's view that we have complied with the requirements of the Mining Charter; in particular we have exceeded the ownership requirements of 26% BEE ownership.
Since this deadline, the Minister of Mineral Resources publicly announced that in the DMR's view, the mining industry had not achieved the targets set by the Charter and
would commence with engagements with individual mining right holders who have failed to comply with the laws. Amplats has not received any notification or report from the
DMR outlining its status of compliance or notice of failure to comply, and remains of the view that it has met the requirements of the Mining Charter.

One area where the DMR and the industry appear to have a difference of opinion is the understanding of the ownership element. The DMR and the Chamber have jointly agreed
that the court be approached to seek clarity on this matter. This is being done by seeking a declaratory order as to the interpretation and legal status of provisions of
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) Amendment Bill and of the Mining Charter(s). Answering affidavits were received from the DMR and the Chamber
has submitted it's replying affidavits. A court date for hearing of the application has been set for 15-16 March 2016.

MPRDA review
The Company, through the Chamber of Mines and Anglo American plc, provided extensive input into the drafting of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA)
Amendment Bill during 2014 and the Bill was passed by both houses of Parliament in 2014. On 26 January 2015 President Jacob Zuma referred the Bill back to Parliament
citing a number of concerns around its constitutionality.

Mining Phakisa
Operation Phakisa was announced by President Jacob Zuma in his State of the Nation Address in 2014. This Government, multi-stakeholder led initiative is designed to fast-
track the implementation of solutions to critical development issues. It is based on Malaysia's Big Fast Results Methodology. The mining specific leg of Operation Phakisa
is aimed at identifying key constraints to investment in, and growth of, the industry as well as develops a shared vision and growth strategy for the long-term development
and transformation of the sector. Work on Mining Phakisa commenced in August. Government convened all key stakeholders in the industry in a workshop colloquially known as
the LAB process, which was conducted during November 2015. The main objective of the Phakisa is to develop implementable results that will transform the industry and
increase investment, in line with the goals of the National Development Plan. The Phakisa Mining LAB process was a concentrated five-week process within the context of
Government's long term Phakisa program. The LAB has created a good platform for meaningful engagement by the industry with other key stakeholders, including other
Government departments beyond just the DMR. Currently all the Phakisa LAB reports, that will list all the key initiatives, are being finalised by the Phakisa Secretariat
before they are presented to the Phakisa participants for input and comment in the first quarter of 2016.

Unki Indigenisation
Following approval of its indigenisation plan by the Government of Zimbabwe, Amplats signed a Heads of Agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe in November 2012. That
agreement set out the key terms of the approved indigenisation plan for the Company's Unki mine investment. The plan envisaged the sale of 51% of the investment through a
notional vendor funded 10 year transaction. The plan has not been implemented due to a decision by the Government of Zimbabwe to reconsider the proposed indigenisation
transaction.

On the 8 January 2016, the Minister of Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment in Zimbabwe published a General Notice which sought to simplify and clarify the
framework, procedures and guidelines for complying with the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act. A concerning provision within the General Notice is a requirement
that, for the resource sector, the 51% shareholding will be acquired in exchange for the mineral resource being exploited and at no monetary cost to the Government. The
company is still studying the full implication on its indigenisation compliance plan should the provision contained in the General Notice become law. Engagements with the
Zimbabwean government are on-going, and the Company is not yet certain of the impact of the General Notice on the proposed Unki indigenisation transaction.

SOCIAL GOVERNANCE
Amplats engages on a regular basis with a wide spectrum of stakeholders and seeks to ensure each stakeholder group is fully informed, fairly treated, and their concerns
are understood and responded to through our management programmes. The Company's overall social governance programme, with its associated management plan, is guided by the
Anglo American 'social-way' set of standards. The programme is reviewed annually to monitor progress, check effectiveness and to take any corrective action that may be
deemed necessary.

Community aspects
In South Africa, every mining operation has a Social and Labour Plan (""SLPs"") that is developed through a consultative process with the DMR, local municipalities and
through regular interaction with host communities via each operation's community engagement forum. Good progress was made in 2015 on the delivery of the community projects
listed in the SLPs. Of the 114 community projects identified in the operations' 2010-2015 SLPs, 98 have been completed and 16 projects will continue to be implemented in
2016, following project delays owing to community disputes. The 2016-2020 SLP's were submitted to the DMR for approval in mid-2015 and the Company is continuing to engage
the DMR accordingly with respect to implementation.

In September 2015, Mogalakwena mine's operations were disrupted by local community protests as communities were dissatisfied with the limited employment, procurement and
other opportunities in the area and a perceived lack of action by the mine to respond to their issues. The resulting disruptions to production led to 8.6 koz lost in Q3
2015, damage to property and increased tensions. In order to resolve the conflict in the communities, a task team was established by the Minister of Mineral Resources, and
facilitated by the South African Human Rights Commission, with representation from the mine and the 32 host villages located within Mapela Traditional Authority. The task
team is working together to address community concerns and ensure progress on the agreed actions.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT
The combined South African and Zimbabwean Ore Reserves inclusive of the Rustenburg operations have decreased from 205.3 4E Moz to 184.6 4E Moz in the year under review.
This was primarily due to the mined volumes and the result of the decrease in the PGM prices causing the reallocation of Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources in the
Mogalakwena, Dishaba and Twickenham mining areas.

The South African and Zimbabwean Mineral Resource including the Rustenburg operations (inclusive of Ore Reserves) increased from 913.6 4E Moz to 916.4E Moz in the year
under review. This was mainly the result of new geological information in the Mogalakwena Mining Rights area.

Amplats will maintain an industry leading Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve status, even after the sale of the Rustenburg operations is complete, and after revisions made
to future economic assumptions.

OUTLOOK
In view of the current market conditions and expectations that key macro-economic issues will likely create a tough economic environment, Amplats is proactively managing
the business during this period of low PGM prices. Positive cash flow generation at every operation is the on-going focus, and cash conservation along with stringent cost
controls has been enforced. Disciplined capital allocation and right-sizing overheads will deliver additional cost savings. Decisions on major capital projects have been
delayed to at least 2017. As a result of these initiatives, the Company believes the financial position remains strong to manage through the current weak PGM price
environment.

Market outlook
Amplats expects the challenging global market conditions to persist with prices in the PGM markets remaining depressed. The platinum market is expected to move closer to
balance in the short term before primary supply is constrained in future years by closures and reduced capital expenditure. Steady growth in demand fundamentals should
then result in a move back to deficits. Targeted market development initiatives are likely to continue to increase platinum demand in fuel cell applications, investment
and in key jewellery markets.

Autocatalyst demand is forecast to grow as Euro 6 emissions legislation requires higher PGMs loadings. Positive sales momentum, particularly in Western European markets,
is expected to continue. Despite the increased focus on particulate emissions in 2015, diesel share in the European market appears resilient, although this should continue
to normalise. Automotive demand and steady growth in industrial consumption is expected to underpin platinum demand. The fall in secondary supply from autocatalyst scrap
evident in 2015 is expected to continue in the short term due to low copper and steel prices. A modest increase in primary supply is expected in 2016.

Amplats expects the palladium market to remain in deficit in the short and medium term due to growth in global automotive production and ex-African supply constraints. The
rhodium market is forecast to remain in balance; however any platinum supply shortfall, especially from the UG2 Reef, could result in a return to a deficit market.

Operational outlook
It is anticipated that platinum production (metal in concentrate) for 2016 will remain between 2.3 and 2.4 million ounces, with improvements in operational performance in
line with optimised mine plans offsetting a reduction in third party ounces.

Financial outlook
Cost inflation continues to be a challenge, with labour, electricity and foreign currency denominated input costs under inflationary pressure. The Company has implemented
a number of business initiatives which aim to curb the effects of inflationary cost pressure, resulting in an estimate on 2016 cash unit costs per platinum ounce of
between R19,250 and R19,750. Amplats believes the focus on cost rationalisation will enable the Company to meet its goal of keeping costs at below mining inflation.

The Company's project portfolio has been aligned to the market environment. As such, capital expenditure is set to be minimal with all major capital project decisions
delayed until at least 2017. Therefore, capital expenditure for the year will be between R3.7 billion and R4.2 billion for project and stay-in-business capital.
Capitalised waste stripping at Mogalakwena will be around R1.2 billion for the year.

The Rand remained weak against the US dollar, with further weakening post 31 December 2015, and our earnings remain highly geared to the Rand/USD exchange rate.

Any forecast information included in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported on by the company's external auditors.

PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

OVERVIEW

-   Commitment to zero harm – no fatalities in the period
                                                                         
    Group platinum production (expressed as metal in concentrate) (see note 1 below) was largely constant year-on-
    year at 598,000 ounces with operational improvements at own operations, offset by a reduction in
    purchase of concentrate ounces from third parties

-   Amandelbult production increased by 13% due to improved mining efficiencies, increased
    concentrator recoveries and the start-up of opencast mining

-   Refined platinum production increased by 30% to 745,000 ounces, following a return to normal
    production after the industrial action, as well as processing pipeline inventory

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

OPERATIONS

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to zero harm and saw an improvement in safety
performance during the period. The Company had no fatalities. The Lost time Injury Frequency Rate
(“LTIFR”) per 200,000 hours at managed operations for the quarter was 0.95, the same compared to
the normalised LTIFR (adjusting for the strike) for 2014.

Total platinum production was largely constant at 598,000 ounces compared to 603,000 ounces in Q4
2014, with operational improvements at own and joint venture operations, offset by a reduction in
purchase of concentrate ounces from third parties. Seasonally, production in the fourth quarter is
lower in the third quarter due to less production shifts than the third quarter.

Platinum production from own mines and tailings retreatment increased to 398,000 ounces from
389,000 ounces due to higher production from Amandelbult and Unki, partially offset by lower
production at Union and Rustenburg.

Amandelbult production increased from 106,000 to 121,000 ounces due to improved mining
efficiencies, increased concentrator recoveries and the start-up of opencast mining. Production from
Unki increased to 19,000 from 15,000 ounces due to improved mining efficiencies and plant
performance, whilst Mogalakwena production was largely flat at 98,000 ounces.

Rustenburg (including Western Limb Tailings Retreatment) platinum production decreased from
122,000 ounces to 118,000 ounces due to lower production from lower achieved grade and safety
related stoppages. Production from Union decreased from 43,000 to 38,000 ounces, mainly due to
the closure of the decline section in Q4 2014.

Independently managed production (mined and purchased) excluding third party purchases of
concentrate, was broadly unchanged at 199,000 ounces.

Refined platinum production increased by 30% to 745,000 ounces, following a return to normal
production after the industrial action and subsequent ramp up in Q3 2014 and processed pipeline
inventory. Refined palladium and rhodium increased for similar reasons. The mix of metals returned to
normal compositions as all mines produced at normal rates.

Base metal tonnes increased 14% due to Q4 2014 being impacted by the ramp-up to normal
production following the strike, as well as an improved and stable operational performance of the
Base Metal Refinery. There was no third party tolling in Q4 2015 as all the stockpiles of Nickel and
Copper Matte accumulated during the expansion and subsequent ramp-up of the BMR have been
depleted.


(Note 1)   In keeping with industry benchmarks, production disclosure has been amended to reflect own mine production and
           purchases of metal in concentrate. Previous disclosure of own mine production and purchases of metal in concentrate was
           converted to equivalent refined production using standard smelting and refining recoveries.

UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2015 (“the
period”) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 8 February 2016.

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s business update and trading statement released on SENS
on 8 December 2015 in which the Company advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per
share (“HEPS”) for the period were expected to be at least 20% (R157 million or 60 cents per share)
lower than for the comparative reporting period for the twelve months ended 31 December 2014
(“comparative period”) and that basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period were
also expected to be at least 20% (R125 million or 48 cents per share) lower than for the comparative
period.

Following the end of the period, shareholders are advised that headline earnings and HEPS for the
period are likely to decrease to between R60 million and R135 million (or between 92% and 83% lower
than the prior year) and 25 cents and 55 cents per share (or between 92% and 82% lower than the prior
year) respectively. This compares to headline earnings and HEPS of R786 million and 301 cents
respectively reported for the comparative period.

Basic earnings and EPS for the period are likely to decrease to between a loss of R12.1 billion and a
loss of R12.2 billion (or between 2,039% and 2,055% lower than the prior year) and a loss of between
4,630 cents and 4,665 cents per share (or between 2,037% and 2,052% lower than the prior year)
respectively. This compares to basic earnings and EPS of R624 million and 239 cents respectively
reported for the comparative period.

The expected decrease in earnings and headline earnings is largely due to impairments and write-offs of
the carrying value of assets of R14.0 billion (post-tax), with only R1.8 billion impacting headline earnings;
restructuring costs amounting to R850 million (post-tax) due to reorganising the support and service
functions to ensure a rightsized overhead structure to support a more focused business; and the
implementation of operational plans which focus on the need to deliver positive cash flows and further
increase efficiencies which ultimately led to a reduction in contractors and employees.

As previously announced in the Company’s FY15 interim results released on 20 July 2015 and the
business update and trading statement released on 8 December 2015 on SENS, certain one-off items
have impacted headlines earnings for the full year to 31 December 2015. Excluding these one-off items
of the write off of Atlatsa loans (equating to a loss of 686 cents per share post-tax), restructuring costs
(equating to a loss of 325 cents per share post-tax) and the increase in inventory based on the result of
an annual inventory count (equating to a gain of 599 per share post-tax), the headline earnings
performance of the Company would have improved by a total of 412 cents per share, against a headline
earnings of 301 cents per share in the comparative period.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company’s external auditors.

BUSINESS UPDATE AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2015

BUSINESS UPDATE
Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders of the decisive action under way to mitigate the
effects of the low Platinum Group Metal (“PGM”) price environment that is expected to prevail in
the short to medium-term and its accounting consequences.

-   Managing the business for the weak PGM price environment  
    - Optimisation of mine plans to ensure each mining complex is cash positive 
    - Reduction in indirect labour and overhead cost savings well advanced 
    - Capital discipline continues, with major capital project decisions delayed until 2017 
        
-   Repositioning of the portfolio continues 
    - Signed the Sale & Purchase agreement for Rustenburg operations with Sibanye 

-   Balance sheet strength maintained 
    - Robust committed liquidity headroom
     
-   Restructuring costs of R0.9 billion (pre-tax) and impairments/ write-offs of the
    carrying value of assets of R14.2 billion (post-tax), with R2.0 billion impacting
    headline earnings   
    -   Basic and headline earnings will be at least 20% lower than the comparative period
        largely due to such costs and charges

MANAGING THE BUSINESS FOR THE WEAK PGM PRICE ENVIRONMENT

Rightsizing the organisation and restructuring overhead
As previously announced, the support and service functions have been reorganised and
overhead structure rightsized to support a more focused and less complex business with a
reduction of 420 positions mainly in managerial and supervisory roles. The majority of
employees in these positions have accepted and been paid voluntary severance packages
(“VSPs”), with the remaining positions to leave the Company during 2016. This reorganisation
will deliver labour cost savings of R200 million per annum from 2016. In addition, non-personnel
overhead savings of R600 million will be delivered by 2017, with further upside identified.
Optimisation plans focusing on the need to be cash positive have identified opportunities to
further increase efficiencies at the operations. The revised development timeline and plan for
Twickenham has led to 550 employees and contractors leaving the Company. During the section
189 process involving support and services functions, VSPs were offered to all employees at the
Company’s own mines. This will result in a reduction in headcount of 900 at Rustenburg, 400 at
Union and 450 at the Company’s retained portfolio. In addition, restructuring plans at the Bokoni
mine, managed by our joint venture partner Atlatsa Resources Corporation (“Atlatsa”), to stop
loss making production will lead to some 2,500 employees and contractors exiting the Bokoni
mine, largely by 31 December 2015.

The cash outflow to the Company arising from the severance packages paid for the full reduction
in headcount is c.R0.9 billion (pre-tax) and will be charged to the Income Statement in the period
to 31 December 2015, impacting basic and headline earnings. A provision of R200 million (pre-
tax) of this amount was raised in the Company’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2015
for the reduction in mainly managerial and supervisory roles.

Disciplined and focused capital allocation
Disciplined capital allocation remains a key focus for Anglo American Platinum. Given the
particularly weak PGM price environment since mid-2015, the Company has decided to
postpone investment in all growth and replacement projects. While these projects are high
quality and high margin, with the ability to be at the lower end of the cost curve, current market
conditions dictate that these capital decisions be delayed until at least 2017.

This decision has triggered the following impairments, which will be accounted for in the year to
31 December 2015:

Twickenham
Development on the Twickenham project has been suspended and the operation restructured to
reduce cash losses, including placing the Twickenham shaft on care and maintenance.
Production continues at the Hackney shaft. The mine is being redeveloped from a conventional
mine to become a largely mechanised operation, which seeks to increase productivity and the
profitability of the mine. Previous development on a conventional mine and some of the related
infrastructure and assets may not be utilised in the new mechanised mine layout. These assets,
together with capitalised interest and study costs have been written off, resulting in a R2.4 billion
(after-tax) impairment. Twickenham’s accounting carrying value after the impairment is R2.2
billion. This impairment will be included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings.

Tumela 5 project at Amandelbult
The Company reviewed alternative business cases for the life extension at Tumela and
concluded that a lower capital, higher returning option than the Tumela 5 shaft is the preferred
replacement project. Accordingly, development of the Tumela 5 shaft has been stopped and the
feasibility study and early development expenditure amounting to R0.3 billion (after-tax) has
been written off. This write-off will be included in basic earnings but excluded from headline
earnings.

Other assets
The Company owns three Mainstream Inert Grinding Mills which are no longer expected to be
brought into use. The carrying value of these assets of R0.1 billion (after-tax) has been written
off. This write-off is included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings.

Royal Bafokeng Platinum (“RB Plat”) and Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (“BRPM”)
Anglo American Platinum has a 12% shareholding in RB Plat and a 33% direct interest in BRPM.
In November 2010, when RB Plat listed, the investments in both RB Plat and BRPM were
required to be revalued for accounting purposes to the fair value at that date, which resulted in
fair value gains of R0.7 million (after-tax) and R2.9 billion (after-tax) respectively. Subsequent to
this, the Company continued to equity account 33% of the earnings of BRPM. In addition, the
12% holding in RB Plats was marked to market with the gains and losses being reflected in
Other Comprehensive Income. This has resulted in the carrying value of the investment in
BRPM increasing from R4.4 billion to R6.1 billion.

Given the decrease in PGM prices and the reduction in the market value of RB Plat shares, the
Company has assessed the carrying value of both investments for impairment. Consequently,
the investment in RB Plat has been written down by R0.8 billion (after tax) to R0.6 billion and the
investment in BRPM has been written down by R2.7 billion (after tax) to R3.5 billion. These
impairments will be included in basic earnings but excluded from headline earnings.

Atlatsa and Bokoni Platinum Holdings (“Bokoni”)
Anglo American Platinum has a 23% shareholding in Atlatsa as well as a 49% shareholding in
Bokoni. The Company, together with Atlatsa, has completed a technical review of the Bokoni
operations to develop a new optimised mine plan. As announced by Atlatsa on 16 September
2015, this plan is currently being implemented. Bokoni is likely to remain cash negative for some
time as it funds development at Brakfontein and Middelpunt Hill.

In light of the difficult market conditions and negative cash flows incurred by Bokoni, Anglo
American Platinum has written off its equity interests in Atlatsa and Bokoni with a carrying value
of R1.4 billion. These write-offs will be included in basic earnings but excluded from headline
earnings.

Atlatsa’s ability to service its debt obligations in the context of the current market conditions,
where Bokoni mine is its main source of funding, is doubtful at current price levels. Anglo
American Platinum has therefore, for accounting reasons, written off the various loans it has
extended to Atlatsa and Atlatsa Holdings (its Black Economic Empowerment shareholder), and
those loans it expects to extend in December 2015, with an accounting carrying value of R2.0
billion in aggregate. The write-off of these loans will be included in basic and headline earnings.
The Company continues with its discussions to exit from its interests in Atlatsa and the Bokoni
mine.

REPOSITIONING THE PORTFOLIO
Anglo American Platinum continues with its repositioning to create a high quality asset portfolio
with low cost, high margin production, low safety risk and high productivity through
mechanisation. The announcement of the signed Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) of the
Rustenburg operations on 9 September 2015 was a significant step in transitioning the portfolio,
allowing the Company to focus its capital allocation decisions on higher priority capital projects in
a more focused portfolio.

For accounting purposes, Anglo American Platinum considers its mining, smelting and refining
operations as a single Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”). Following the announcement of the
signing of the SPA, the Rustenburg assets can now be assessed separately within the CGU for
impairment. As such, the recoverable value of the Rustenburg operations is calculated as the
fair value of the estimated proceeds less transaction costs. It excludes any economic value
generated from the future purchase of concentrate and toll treatment arrangements which will be
recognised for accounting purposes at the time when the benefit is received. Accordingly, the
Company will impair the fixed assets of the Rustenburg operations by R4.6 billion (after-tax)
during the year ending 31 December 2015.
As the transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals, the Rustenburg operations
have not been reclassified as held for sale at this stage.
The Company continues to proceed with the exit of the other mines identified as non-core, being
Union, Pandora and Bokoni. The Union mine plan is being refined in order to facilitate an exit
process during 2016, and the Company is in discussions with its joint venture partners to enable
its exit from the Bokoni and Pandora mines.

BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH MAINTAINED
The balance sheet position of the Company remains strong as a result of focusing on ensuring
operations are cash positive, disciplined capital allocation and ensuring overheads are right-
sized. Consequently, the net debt position has improved from the year ended 31 December
2014 of R14.6 billion. The Company has legally binding committed facilities of R22 billion and is
comfortably within its debt covenants. The committed facilities that were due to mature in 2015
were rolled over and only R1.5 billion of facilities are due to mature in 2016.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2015
Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ending 31 December 2015
(""the period"") on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on [8] February
2016.

With reference to the listings requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial
results for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding reporting period.

Anglo American Platinum advises shareholders, with reasonable certainty and largely due to
the asset impairments and write-offs set out above, that headline earnings and headline
earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2015 will be at least
20% (R157 million or 60 cents per share) lower than the reporting period for the twelve months
ended 31 December 2014 (“the comparative period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period were R786 million and 301 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) will also be at least 20% (R125 million or
48 cents per share) lower than the comparative period. Basic earnings and EPS for the
comparative period were R624 million and 239 cents respectively.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed, or reported on, by the Company’s external auditors.
