Safety performance

We remain committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy 
work environment for all employees. As reported in the first half
of the financial year (1H F2020), three colleagues were fatally
injured in separate accidents at the Two Rivers, Nkomati and
Tweefontein mines. No fatalities were reported in the second half
of the 2020 financial year (2H F2020).

The group lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per 200 000 man-
hours increased marginally to 0.45 (F2019: 0.42). There were 86
lost time injuries (LTIs) reported in F2020 compared to 90 in
F2019. Of these, 63 were reportable injuries (F2019: 76).

Safety achievements in F2020 include:

-   Beeshoek Mine achieved 18 000 fatality-free production shifts
    on 16 August 2019, an accomplishment that has taken 16 years
    and 5 months to achieve. On 9 September 2019 the mine recorded
    365 successive days without an LTI
-   Khumani Mine achieved 3 million fatality-free shifts on 29 November 2019
-   Black Rock Mine achieved 8 million fatality free shifts on 
    11 March 2020 which was a first for ARM Ferrous and took 11 years
    and two months to achieve. The mine also improved its LTIFR
    by 21% year-on-year
-   Modikwa Mine achieved 1 million fatality-free shifts on 6 January 2020

Note: LTIs and LTIFR are presented on a 100% basis and are reported
for those operations where ARM has direct or joint management and
exclude the ARM Coal, Sakura and Harmony operations.

Financial performance

Headline earnings

The financial year ended 30 June 2020 was challenging, particularly
in the second half of the year with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.
In this environment we are pleased to report a 6% increase in
headline earnings to R5 534 million (F2019: R5 226 million). Our
diversified portfolio of commodities again stood us in good stead
as higher PGM and iron ore prices more than offset the negative
impact of lower manganese ore, manganese alloys and thermal coal
prices.

The weaker Rand against the US Dollar also contributed positively
to headline earnings. The average realised Rand weakened by 11%
versus the US Dollar to R15.68/US$ compared to R14.19/US$ in F2019.
For reporting purposes, the closing exchange rate was R17.36/US$
(30 June 2019: R14.09/US$).

The F2020 headline earnings include re-measurement gains on partner
loans of R441 million (F2019: R49 million).

Attributable headline earnings for ARM Ferrous were 10% lower at
R4 479 million (F2019: R4 960 million) as a 9% increase in headline
earnings in the iron ore division was more than offset by a 48%
decrease in the manganese division headline earnings. Despite lower
iron ore sales volumes (mainly as a result of the lockdown),
profitability in the iron ore division improved driven by higher
Rand export iron ore prices. In contrast, average realised Rand
manganese ore prices were 22% lower which, coupled with a 6%
decrease in manganese ore sales volumes, significantly impacted
the manganese divisions headline earnings. Unit costs were well
controlled at the manganese ore operations with on-mine unit
production costs decreasing by 2% in the reporting period.

ARM Platinum attributable headline earnings increased by 
R1 030 million to R1 142 million in F2020 from R112 million in F2019. 
The Two Rivers and Modikwa mines benefitted from 6%, 54% and 144%
increase in average realised platinum, palladium and rhodium
prices, respectively. Modikwa Mine further benefited from its
almost 1:1 platinum to palladium ratio. It should be noted that
the temporary improvement in the purchase-of-concentrate agreement
at Modikwa Mine expired on 31 December 2019.

Headline earnings at the PGM operations were impacted by penalty
and treatment charges of R303 million and R11 million for Two
Rivers and Modikwa Mine, respectively.

Production and sales volumes at both PGM operations were lower
owing to grade challenges experienced in 1H F2020 and the lockdown
in 2H F2020 (as discussed on page 6 of the full announcement). Unit
cost increases at both operations were above inflation mainly due
to the decline in volumes.

Nkomati Mine reported an attributable headline loss of R704 million
for F2020. Scaling down of the Nkomati Mine in preparation for care
and maintenance is progressing well with the mine now expected to
cease production in February 2021 (previously September 2020).

Due to Nkomati Mine approaching the end of its economic life of
mine and the planned care and maintenance the following expenses
and provisions were included in the mine's F2020 attributable
headline earnings:

-   a provision relating to an increase in rehabilitation and
    decommissioning obligations of R384 million (discussed in
    detail on pages 12 and 13 of the full announcement).
-   a provision relating to a tax diesel rebate currently under
    dispute with the South African Revenue Services of R131 million
-   a provision for restructuring costs of R77 million
-   an inventory write-down of R76 million
-   off-take penalties for out of specification concentrate of
    R99 million

ARM Coal reported an attributable headline loss of R2 million
(F2019: R411 million headline earnings) which includes re-
measurement gains of R485 million (F2019: R245 million) on partner
loans. Excluding the re-measurement gains, the ARM Coal headline
loss was R487 million (F2019: R272 million headline earnings) as a
result of the sharp decline in export thermal coal prices, lower
sales volumes (owing to weather-related mining challenges) and
above-inflation unit cost increases.

The Machadodorp Works headline loss was R163 million as research
into the development of more energy efficient smelting technology
progressed. In 2H F2020 expenditure at Machadodorp Works was
curtailed to conserve cash in light of uncertainty due to COVID-19.

ARM Corporate and other headline loss was R85 million compared to
R257 million in F2019. The reduced loss was mainly due to an
increase in re-measurement gains of R108 million, and higher
interest received of R62 million.

Basic earnings and impairments

Basic earnings were R3 965 million and include attributable
impairments of the ARM Coal assets of R1 680 million before tax
and R1 524 million after tax. An impairment indicator assessment
was performed on Goedgevonden Mine and the PCB investment (as
stand-alone and separate cash generating units). Impairment
indicators were identified (including lower expected production
and above inflation unit cost increases) which resulted in
attributable impairment losses (after tax) of R559 million and
R1 121 million being recognised for the Goedgevonden Mine and PCB
investment cash generating units, respectively.

The recoverable amounts for the Goedgevonden Mine and PCB
investment cash generating units were determined based on the fair
value less cost of disposal calculation performed in terms of
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Financial position

ARM improved its financial position despite the operational and
economic challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are
pleased be able to declare a final dividend of R7.00 per share even
during these difficult times while maintaining a robust financial
position to further navigate this uncertain environment.

At 30 June 2020, ARM was in net cash position of R3 790 million
(30 June 2019: R2 601 million), an improvement of R1 189 million
compared to the net cash at the end of the corresponding year. This
amount excludes attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM
Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R 3 208 million (30 June 2019: 
R3 053 million). There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either of the two
reporting periods.

ARM's financial position was further strengthened by a positive
revaluation adjustment of R2 325 million (net of deferred capital
gains tax) on the Harmony Gold Mining Company (Harmony) investment
as the Harmony share price increased by 126% from R31.74 at 30 June
2019 to R71.86 per share at 30 June 2020.

Cash flow

Cash generated from operations increased by R1 743 million to
R3 866 million (F2019: R2 123 million) after a R1 189 million
increase in working capital requirements (F2019: R555 million)
which was mainly due to an increase in debtors at the PGM
operations.

Dividends received from the Assmang joint venture were R3 750 million 
(F2019: R3 315 million). In F2020, R2 717 million in
dividends was paid to ARM shareholders representing the final
dividend of R9.00 per share declared in F2019 (total amount paid
was R1 741 million) and the interim dividend of R5.00 per share
declared for 1H F2020 (total amount paid was R976 million).

Net cash outflow from investing activities was R2 343 million
(F2019: R1 271 million) and include investments in financial assets
of R1 539 million. Certain cash and cash equivalents were invested
in longer dated fixed deposits in F2020 to achieve better returns.

The Board approved a share buy-back which commenced on 19 March
2020. R57 million was spent acquiring approximately 623 thousand
ARM shares at an average price of R90.86 per share. The share buy-
back was terminated on 24 March 2020 to conserve cash owing to
uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management continues
to review share buy-backs in line with ARM's capital allocation
guiding principles.

Borrowings of R264 million (F2019: R595 million) were repaid in
the period, reducing gross debt to R1 925 million (30 June 2020:
R2 031 million). Modikwa Mine repaid R485 million of its partner
loans.

The Broad-Based Economic Empowerment (BBEE) Trust fully repaid its
loan with Nedbank in October 2019.

Capital expenditure

Segmental capital expenditure was R3 506 million (F2019: R3 242 million) 
and included R394 million of capitalised waste stripping
at the iron ore operations (F2019: R397 million).

Dividend declaration

ARM aims to pay ordinary dividends to shareholders equal to
approximately 40-70% of annual dividends received from its group
companies.

Dividends remain at the discretion of the Board which considers
the company's capital allocation guiding principles as well as
other relevant factors such as financial performance, commodities
outlook, investment opportunities, gearing levels as well as
solvency and liquidity requirements of the Companies Act.

ARM aims to pay an interim and final dividend. The weighting between
the interim and final dividends is likely to result in the final
dividend being higher than the interim dividend. ARM does not
borrow funds to pay dividends.

For F2020, the Board has approved and declared a final dividend of
700 cents per share (gross) (F2019: 900 cents per share). The
amount to be paid is approximately R1 563 million.

The dividend declared will be subject to dividend withholding tax.

JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional information is
disclosed:

AFRICAN RAINBOW MINERALS (ARM) BUSINESS UPDATE ON IMPACT OF COVID-19

ARM refers to the SENS announcement released on 27 March 2020 in which
the Company announced that in compliance with the nationwide lockdown,
all ARM mining operations including Khumani, Beeshoek, Black Rock,
Modikwa, Two Rivers and Nkomati mines had been placed on temporary
care and maintenance for the duration of the 21-day lockdown period.

Subsequent to the initial announcement made by the President of the
Republic of South Africa on 23 March 2020, the list of essential goods
and services has been refined through continuous engagement and
consultation with stakeholders.

Exemptions to the lockdown restrictions have been granted for certain
additional goods which are considered critical to the nation's economy
and its revitalisation post the COVID-19 pandemic.

ARM’s joint venture, Assmang (Pty) Ltd, has received authorisation
from the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy to operate its load-
out stations at Khumani and Beeshoek mines in order to continue loading
iron ore from the mines’ respective stockpiles.

Transnet has mobilised the requisite resources and reactivated the
rail and port export system from the Northern Cape to the Port of
Saldanha which reactivation supports exports at approximately 40% of
normalised iron ore volumes for the week commencing 30 March 2020.
Transnet plans to ramp up volumes for the remainder of the lockdown
period depending on availability of rail and port services. The iron
ore operations have sufficient inventory to load for the remainder of
the lockdown period.

The safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors remains a
key priority. The loading functions require less than 2% of the total
mine workforce to be on-site. Strict hygiene, health and safety
protocols are being maintained to protect employees who will be
executing the loading functions.

ARM refers shareholders to the SENS announcement released on 24
March 2020.

The safety and wellbeing of all ARM employees and contractors
remains a priority in ARM’s response to the evolving COVID-19
global pandemic.

In compliance with the nationwide lockdown, all ARM mining
operations including Khumani, Beeshoek, Black Rock, Modikwa, Two
Rivers and Nkomati mines have been placed on temporary care and
maintenance for the duration of the lockdown period.

All activities at Machadodorp Works have been suspended. Cato
Ridge Works has switched off its furnaces and converter. The Sakura
Ferroalloys operation located in Malaysia remains in full
operation in accordance with local Malaysian regulations.

ARM Coal operations supply coal to Eskom and are considered
essential to the maintenance of power generation in South Africa.
These operations continue to operate in terms of the lockdown
regulations, and in terms of the guidelines issued by the
Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to continue to supply
Eskom. Any export of coal will need to be approved by the
Department of Mineral Resources and Energy and will be subject to
the availability of rail capacity.

Necessary care and maintenance work will continue at all affected
operations to ensure that integrity of assets is maintained and
to ensure a safe and efficient ramp up after the lockdown.

Additional safety, health and hygiene provisions are in place to
protect the wellness of employees that continue to work during the
lockdown.

In addition to the above, Two Rivers Mine received notice of force
majeure from Impala Platinum Limited (Impala). In terms of this
notice, Impala indicated that for the duration of the lockdown
period it will not be able to receive concentrate in terms of the
agreement whereof Impala purchases concentrate as delivered by Two
Rivers Mine.
                                                                
Management does not anticipate this notice will have any
additional negative impact over and above the impact of the
temporary care and maintenance described above.

We remain committed to preventing the spread of COVID-19 and to
South Africa’s return to social and economic stability. Under no
circumstances will the safety of our employees be compromised.

ARM’s robust financial position gives us flexibility to
responsibly navigate this period of uncertainty and ensure ARM’s
long term sustainability.

FORCE MAJEURE NOTIFICATION RECEIVED FROM ANGLO AMERICAN
PLATINUM LIMITED (AMPLATS) WITH RESPECT TO MODIKWA MINE
PURCHASE OF CONCENTRATE AGREEMENT

ARM refers to the announcement by Amplats on Friday, 6 March
2020 regarding temporary shutdown of its converter plant.

ARM confirms that its subsidiary, ARM Mining Consortium
Limited (ARM MC), has received written notification of force
majeure from Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (RPM) in terms
of the purchase of concentrate agreement between ARM MC and
RPM. ARM MC holds 50% of Modikwa Mine while the remaining 50%
is held by RPM, a subsidiary of Amplats.

RPM indicated that it will not be able to complete the
processing of concentrate produced at Modikwa Mine until
repair work to the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B is
complete. According to Amplats, repair work on ACP Phase B is
expected to take approximately 80 days to complete.

ARM MC will continue to deliver concentrate produced at
Modikwa Mine to RPM.

Safety

We are committed to creating and maintaining a safe work environment for all our employees. Regrettably three
colleagues were fatally injured in separate accidents at our operations.

On 8 September 2019, Mr Mpedi Ishmael Malatji, a load haul dump operator at Two Rivers Mine was fatally injured
in an accident involving moving machinery. At Nkomati Mine Mr Makoti Marks Tshwale, a water truck operator
employed by a contractor, was fatally injured on 31 October 2019 when he lost control of the truck he was driving
which overturned. At Tweefontein Coal Mine, Mr Simon Sandamela was fatally injured in a blasting accident on 
10 November 2019.

We extend our deepest condolences to the families of Mr Malatji, Mr Tshwale and Mr Sandamela and to their
colleagues and friends.

Initiatives are ongoing at the operations to ensure that safety training continues and safety standards are
strictly upheld.

A total of 52 lost time injuries (LTIs) occurred in the six months under review (1H F2019: 40) of which 41 were
reportable injuries (1H F2019: 37). The group's lost time injury frequency rate per 200 000 man-hours was 0.48
compared to 0.36 in the corresponding period.

Note: Lost time injuries and lost time injury frequency rates are presented on a 100% basis and are reported for
those operations where ARM has direct or joint management and exclude the ARM Coal, Sakura and Harmony operations.

Financial results overview

Headline earnings

ARM continued to benefit from its commodity portfolio diversification as higher palladium, rhodium, platinum and
iron ore prices offset the decline in manganese ore, manganese alloys and thermal coal prices. Headline earnings
were therefore only marginally lower at R2 155 million or R11.14 per share (1H F2019: R2 201 million or R11.49
per share). A 4% weakening of the average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate to R14.69/US$ (1H F2019: R14.19/US$) 
contributed positively to earnings. The closing exchange rate was R14.00/US$ (31 December 2018: R14.09/US$).

Headline earnings for ARM Ferrous were 13% lower at R1 848 million (1H F2019: R2 127 million) as a 16% increase
in headline earnings in the iron ore division was more than offset by a 52% decline in headline earnings in the
manganese division. The iron ore division's improved profitability was driven mainly by higher average realised
US Dollar iron ore prices due to supply disruptions in the global seaborne iron ore market coupled with 
better-than-expected steel production in China. Conversely, manganese ore prices declined sharply in the latter part 
of the review period as increased seaborne manganese ore supply put prices under pressure. The negative impact of
lower manganese ore prices on headline earnings was partially offset by a 13% increase in export sales volumes
as ramp-up of Black Rock Mine progressed on schedule and within budget. The manganese ore operations decreased
on-mine unit production costs which also contributed positively to headline earnings. Headline earnings for the
manganese alloy operations were 153% lower, primarily due to lower alloy prices and sales volumes, increased
production costs, as well as inventory net realisable value adjustments at period end.

ARM Platinum headline earnings increased by 193% to R489 million as both the Two Rivers and Modikwa mines doubled
headline earnings compared to the corresponding period. Average realised platinum, palladium and rhodium prices
were up 9%, 58% and 97% respectively and Modikwa Mine benefited from its almost 1:1 platinum to palladium ratio.
Production volumes were lower at both operations as Two Rivers Mine continued to be affected by lower grades due
to mining a split reef. Installation of 40 000 tonnes per month of additional milling capacity at Two Rivers Mine
has been approved and is expected to increase production volumes to between 360 000 to 380 000 PGM ounces per
annum. Construction and installation of this milling capacity is expected to take 18 months from May 2020 and
ramp-up to steady state within six months thereafter. At Modikwa Mine lower-grade material was blended with
higher-grade fines to optimise plant milling capacity, which negatively impacted the grade. Production volumes
are expected to improve slightly for 2H F2020 at Two Rivers Mine, while volumes are expected to recover to an
annualised rate of approximately 320 000 tonnes at Modikwa Mine.

Nkomati Mine headline loss was impacted by the following charges (100% basis):

  -  a provision relating to South African Revenue Services (SARS) diesel rebates (and related interest) currently
     under dispute of R271 million;
  -  a provision for restructuring costs of R84 million;
  -  an inventory adjustment of R96 million; and
  -  penalty and treatment charges of R63 million.
 
Scaling down this loss-making operation is progressing on schedule. As previously reported, production at Nkomati
Mine will cease from end-September 2020, after which the mine will be placed on care and maintenance in preparation
for closure. Engagement with affected employees, communities and suppliers is continuing. An assessment of total
closure and rehabilitation costs for the operation is under way and expected to be completed by end of March 2020.

ARM Coal reported a headline loss of R101 million which includes a re-measurement gain of R104 million 
(1H F2019: R202 million re-measurement loss) on the ARM Coal loans which were restructured in F2018. Excluding the 
re-measurement gain, ARM Coal headline loss was R209 million, mainly due to a sharp decline in seaborne thermal coal
prices (as lower natural gas and renewable energy prices in the United States and Europe put seaborne thermal
coal prices under pressure). In addition, lower volumes owing to weather-related mining challenges and above-inflation 
unit cost increases negatively affected headline earnings. Seaborne thermal coal prices have improvedin recent months 
and production volumes are expected to recover to normal annualised levels at both the Goedgevonden (GGV) and Participative 
Coal Business(PCB).

ARM Corporate and other headline loss was R81 million compared to R158 million in 1H F2019. The decrease is
mainly due to higher interest income (R60 million), higher ARM Mining Consortium and ARM Coal intercompany loan
re-measurement gains (R118 million), partially offset by lower fee income (R26 million), higher operating expenses
(R25 million), higher taxation (R30 million) and Machadodorp Works operating expenses which are included in the
Corporate and other segment (R11 million) since acquiring this business from Assmang. The intercompany loans 
re-measurement are partially eliminated at group level.

Basic earnings were R2 132 million (1H F2019: R1 306 million). Comparative basic earnings included an attributable
impairment of Nkomati Mine assets of R892 million after tax.

Financial position

ARM maintained a robust financial position which allows continued investment in our existing business while giving
us flexibility to pursue growth and pay dividends in line with our dividend guiding principles.

At 31 December 2019, ARM was in a net cash position of R2 869 million (30 June 2019: R2 601 million, 
31 December 2018: R2 914 million). This amount excludes attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM Ferrous 
(50% of Assmang) of R3 107 million (30 June 2019: R3 053 million, 31 December 2018: R2 186 million). Total borrowings of
R147 million (1H F2019: R167 million) were repaid in the period, reducing gross debt to R2 024 million 
(31 December 2018: R2 132 million) which mostly relates to the ARM Coal debt. The ARM Broad-based Economic Empowerment
(BBEE) Trust loan from Nedbank was fully repaid in October 2019. There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either of the two 
reporting periods.

Cash flow

Cash generated from operations increased by R140 million to R921 million (1H F2019: R781 million) despite a 
R1 280 million increase in working capital requirements (1H F2019: R570 million increase). Dividends received from
the Assmang joint venture were R2 000 million (1H F2019: R1 750 million). Capital expenditure for the period was
R492 million, all for sustaining capital (1H F2019: R505 million). Dividends paid to ARM shareholders in 1H F2020
include R1 741 million paid in October 2019 as a final dividend (1H F2019: R1 433 million).

Net cash outflow from investing activities was R492 million (1H F2019: R715 million). The corresponding period
included ARM's R211 million participation in a Harmony rights issue.

Capital expenditure

Segmental capital expenditure (attributable basis) was R1 573 million for the review period and included R215 million 
(H1 F2019: R242 million) of capitalised waste stripping at the iron ore operations. Waste is no longer capitalised at 
Nkomati Mine as the operation scales down.

Changes to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as disclosed in the integrated
annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 2019, other than depletion due to continued mining activities
at the operations. An updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Statement will be issued in our F2020
integrated annual report.

Changes to board of directors

ARM announced the following changes to its board of directors, effective from 18 December 2019:

  -  Mr Andre Wilkens stepped down as an executive director of ARM. Mr Wilkens served for many years as an
     executive director, including a long and successful tenure as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
  -  Mrs Jongisa Magagula was appointed as Executive Director for Investor Relations and New Business Development.

Dividend declaration

ARM aims to pay ordinary dividends to shareholders equal to approximately 40-70% of annual dividends received
from its group companies.

Dividends remain at the discretion of the board of directors and consider the company's capital allocation
principles as well as other relevant factors such as financial performance, commodities outlook, investment
opportunities, gearing levels as well as solvency and liquidity requirements of the Companies Act.

ARM aims to pay an interim and a final dividend. The weighting between the interim and final dividends is
likely to result in the final dividend being higher than the interim dividend. ARM does not borrow funds to pay
dividends.

For the review period, the board has approved and declared an interim dividend of 500 cents per share (gross)
(1H F2019: 400 cents per share). The amount to be paid is approximately R1 119 million.

The dividend declared will be subject to dividend withholding tax. In line with paragraphs 11.17(a) (i) to (x)
and 11.17(c)of the JSE Listings Requirements the following additional information is disclosed:

    -   The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
    -   The South African dividends tax rate is 20%;
    -   The gross local dividend is 500 cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividends tax;
    -   The net local dividend is 400 cents per share for shareholders liable to pay dividends tax;
    -   At the date of this declaration, ARM has 223 879 043 ordinary shares in issue; and
    -   ARM's income tax reference number is 9030/018/60/1.

A gross dividend of 500 cents per ordinary share, being the dividend for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
has been declared payable on Monday, 23 March 2020 to those shareholders recorded in the books of the company
at the close of business on Friday, 20 March 2020. The dividend is declared in the currency of South Africa.
Any change in address or dividend instruction applying to this dividend must be received by the company's
transfer secretaries or registrar not later than Tuesday, 17 March 2020. The last day to trade ordinary shares
cum dividend is Tuesday, 17 March 2020. Ordinary shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 18 March 2020. The
record date is Friday, 20 March 2020 while the payment date is Monday, 23 March 2020.
 
No dematerialisation or rematerialisation of share certificates may occur between Wednesday, 18 March 2020 and
Friday, 20 March 2020, both dates inclusive, nor may any transfers between registers take place during this period.

Review by independent auditors

The financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2019 have not been reviewed nor audited by the
Company's registered auditors, Ernst & Young Inc.

Any reference to future financial performance included in these results has not been reviewed nor reported
on by ARM's external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, a listed
company is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it
is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the
financial results for the period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

ARM's basic earnings for 1H F2020 are expected to increase by
between 60% and 65% to between R2 090 million and R2 155 million
(1H F2019: R1 306 million). Basic earnings for the six months ended
31 December 2018 (1H F2019) included an attributable impairment of
Nkomati Mine assets of R892 million after tax. The 1H F2020 basic
earnings per share are expected to be between 1 081 and 1 114 cents
(1H F2019: 682 cents).

Headline earnings for 1H F2020 are expected to decrease by between
1% and 3% to between R2 128 million and R2 176 million (1H F2019:
R2 201 million) as higher headline earnings at the platinum group
metals (PGM) and iron ore operations were offset by lower headline
earnings from the manganese, nickel and coal operations. Headline
earnings per share are therefore expected to be between 1 100 cents
and 1 125 cents (1H F2019: 1 149 cents).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based
has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors
of ARM.

The Company's 1H F2020 financial results will be released on or
