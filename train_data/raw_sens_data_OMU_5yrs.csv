INTERNAL TRANSFER OF NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED (“NEDBANK”) SHARES FROM OMLACSA TO OLD MUTUAL
EMERGING MARKETS PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“OMEM”)

OMLACSA hereby notifies its debt investors that it intends to transfer 62 131 692 Nedbank ordinary shares
(“Nedbank shares”) internally to OMEM (“the Transaction”). OMLACSA and OMEM are both wholly owned
subsidiaries of Old Mutual Limited (“OML”). The Transaction is subject to receiving the necessary regulatory
approval and will result in greater capital efficiency for the group.

The Transaction will have no impact on the financial results and net assets of OML as this transaction does not
change the total number of Nedbank shares held by the Old Mutual group. In the separate financial statements
of OMLACSA, the Transaction will result in a reduction in the net asset value equivalent to the market value of
the Nedbank shares transferred to OMEM (at 30 June 2020, the market value of the Nedbank shares, based on
a share price of R101.55 per share, was c.R6,3 billion). The net asset value of OMLACSA will change further by
the recognition of deferred tax on the Nedbank shares that remain within OMLACSA.

At the end of June 2020, the solvency ratio was 182% for the OML group and 208% for OMLACSA. Post the
Transaction, the solvency ratios of Old Mutual group and OMLACSA are expected to remain comfortably within
the solvency target ranges. This demonstrates the capital strength and resilience of our balance sheet.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our business, our lives and on how we work and interact. Although the resultant lockdown adversely
affected us, particularly the productivity of our physical distribution channels, we were agile and adapted to this new normal. We leveraged our digital
capability and through the use of digital sales platforms and the provision of data and network access, we enabled most of our employees and certain of our
advisers to work remotely. There is still a considerable amount of uncertainty around what we can expect within the next 12 months. However, we believe we
have taken sufficient actions to provide for the impact of the pandemic in the short term. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make further
provisions if necessary. We believe that the actions we have taken to maintain our capacity will allow us to take advantage of opportunities in this
environment and be in a position to accelerate activity as restrictions are lifted.

Although the pandemic adversely affected earnings in the first half of the year, our business remains robust, with sufficient levels of liquidity and strong
solvency positions in our regulated subsidiaries. We have performed stress tests to assess our liquidity and solvency positions under various recovery
scenarios. In all scenarios, our liquidity levels remain positive and our solvency ratio remains within our target range. Due to the significant level of
uncertainty in the current environment we have deferred our decision to declare an interim dividend. We believe this action is necessary in a period of
heightened uncertainty and we will revisit this decision for the full year dividend declaration when we have more clarity on the shape of possible economic
recovery scenarios.

New business sales volumes were negatively impacted, as most of our tied advisers in the Mass and Foundation Cluster were unable to sell during the lockdown
period due to the partial closure of the branch network and lack of access to customers' homes, worksites and branches. In Personal Finance, the impact was
less severe as we could enable remote working for a larger proportion of advisers. Although lockdown restrictions have been eased, and economic activity has
somewhat resumed, sales levels remain below prior year levels. The continued financial pressure on our customers led to a decline in sales activity and poor
persistency experience, which adversely affected distribution efficiencies. Customers also opted for lower margin risk and investment products resulting in a
significant decline in VNB compared to the prior year. The decline in closing and average equity markets led to pressure on our asset based fees and resulted
in unrealised mark to market losses in our equity portfolios. Initially lagging the equity markets, credit spreads widened in the second quarter as the
crisis contributed to a weakening economic outlook. Credit spreads increased by between 50bps and 100bps, higher than increases seen in the previous
financial crisis, resulting in significant mark to market losses in our unlisted credit portfolio. There was an increase in business interruption and rescue
claims in Old Mutual Insure during the second quarter.

We have presented certain of these COVID-19 impacts separately within our presentation of Results from Operations, in order to reflect the underlying results
of our segments on a more comparable basis to the prior year. Only items that are separately identifiable and reliably measurable have been presented in this
line item. Accordingly, Normalised Results from Operations, excluding COVID-19 impacts, was down 4% from the prior year largely driven by a significant
decrease in Mass and Foundation Cluster's profits due to lower sales volumes, poor persistency, and higher credit losses experienced in Old Mutual Finance due
to the strengthening of our provisioning. This was mostly offset by a decrease in catastrophe losses in Old Mutual Insure and growth in profits of Personal
Finance and Wealth Management due to improved mortality and a release of reserves following a change in the investment strategy for the closed annuity fund.
Rest of Africa profits were up 27% mostly due to lower losses in West Africa and foreign exchange gains as the rand depreciated most notably against the
Kenyan shilling and Malawian kwacha.

Despite the changes the pandemic has brought to the business, our focus remains unchanged. We continue to put customers first and simplify our business
through digital transformation. With the scaling of Old Mutual Protect, we have implemented digitalised customer and intermediary service models with a large
degree of straight-through processing. Continued use of robotics and artificial intelligence to service customers and process transactions have saved 8
million processing minutes to date. These initiatives do not only provide a better experience for customers and intermediaries, but also simplify various
business processes which lead to cost efficiencies. We continue to drive our cloud strategy via Amazon WebServices, with the first 85 workloads now live on
the cloud. This has resulted in no unplanned downtime experience for customers and has allowed us to rapidly deploy solutions across the business.

Changes in the macro environment including negative GDP growth forecasts and interest rate cuts, have resulted in increased uncertainty around future cash
flow projections for certain assets. This has resulted in the recognition of impairments in respect of the carrying value of our investment in Nedbank and the
goodwill related to our investment in Old Mutual Finance. In calculating the valuation for our investment in Nedbank we performed a range of valuations
assuming several different earnings and economic recovery scenarios and, although in certain scenarios a higher value could be supported, greater weight was
given to the downside scenarios given the increased uncertainty around forward looking information in the current environment. These impairments are
recognised in the IFRS income statement, however, are not recognised in Headline Earnings (HE) as this is an explicit adjusting item in accordance with the
JSE Circular. Accordingly they are also not recognised in AHE.

OUTLOOK

The increased levels of forecast risk and observed variability in possible recovery scenarios has made it increasingly difficult to provide guidance around
the achievement of previously disclosed medium term targets. In light of this, we are withdrawing our guidance in respect of these targets and replacing them
with targets more appropriate for measuring our progress as we transition the business through the crisis. These targets focus on the maintenance of
appropriate levels of solvency and liquidity and improving the efficiency of our business given the pressure on revenues COVID-19 introduces. To demonstrate
improved efficiency we will deliver R750 million of pre-tax run rate savings on a like for like basis by the end of 2022. During the second half of 2020 we
will focus on improving adviser productivity to normalised levels as rapidly as possible, improving customer access through increased digitalisation and
finding opportunities for further cost efficiencies. Further guidance on expected outcomes for the full year 2020 will follow once we have greater certainty
on the expected impacts of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised that we expect HEPS and EPS for the year ended 31
December 2020 to be more than 20% lower than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (FY 2019 HEPS: 236.1 cents, FY 2019 EPS: 208.3 cents) due to
the significant impact COVID-19 has had on our results. We will publish a further update once there is more certainty on the probable ranges of the expected
decrease in HEPS and EPS.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited is currently in the process of
finalising its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (""current
period""). This trading statement provides an indication of a range for Headline
Earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity holders
of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements compared to the six months ended 30 June 2019
(""comparative period""). The Group's interim results will be released on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Tuesday, 1 September 2020.

Further to our previous communication to shareholders on the 29 May 2020, the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on our business,
our lives and how we work and interact. Government enforced restrictions to
control the spread of COVID-19 in most geographies we operate in have
dramatically reduced the level of economic activity during the first half of
2020 and negatively impacted growth forecasts for the remainder of the year. In
this challenging environment we adapted to this new normal by leveraging our
digital capability to enable most of our employees and certain of our advisers
to work remotely.

New business sales volumes were negatively impacted, as most of our tied
advisers were unable to sell during the lockdown period due to the partial
closure of the branch network and lack of access to customers’ homes, worksites
and branches. Although lockdown restrictions have been eased, and economic
activity has somewhat resumed, sales levels remain below prior year levels.
This impact was most severe in the Mass and Foundation Cluster, where sales
volumes were too low to cover the largely fixed initial expenses and this
resulted in negative Value of New Business for H1 2020 for this segment.

Although local and global equity markets have recovered in the second quarter,
the JSE SWIX was down 8% at the end of June 2020 and average equity market
levels were 10% lower than the prior year. During the second quarter we saw
credit spreads widening by between 50bps and 100bps, more than increases in
previous market crises.

Throughout the period, in this tough economic environment, our solvency capital
has remained strong. At the end of June 2020, the solvency ratio was 182% for
the Group and 208% for OMLACSA. This demonstrates the capital strength and
resilience of our Group to withstand periods of prolonged market stresses and
positions us well to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.

The significant deterioration in the operating environment compared to the
comparative period has however negatively impacted our earnings. While there is
still much uncertainty around the pandemic and the impact that it will have on
experience, we have raised short term provisions in anticipation of worsening
mortality, morbidity and persistency experience in the second half of 2020.
These reserves are intended to allow for expected short term variances to our
long term assumptions.

Weaker growth forecasts and higher observed credit spreads have led to notable
unrealised mark to market losses in the first half of the year in our unlisted
equity and credit portfolios in Specialised Finance, although we believe the
quality of our credit book remains high. As these are unrealised they could
reverse in future periods as market conditions recover. We have also increased
our provisions for expected credit losses in Old Mutual Finance in recognition
of declining GDP forecasts, and the anticipated impact of this on future credit
losses.

There was an increase in business interruption (BI) claims in Old Mutual Insure
during the second quarter. We also made a decision to offer commercial
settlements to certain qualifying Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME)
customers to enable them to continue operating.

Taking into account the operating environment and factors outlined above
shareholders are advised that the Group’s key profit measures are expected to
fall within the ranges outlined below:

 Key Performance Indicators
 (R million unless stated                  Estimated          Estimated
 otherwise)                                 % change       30 June 2020   30 June 2019
 Results from Operations              (61%) to (71%)      1,760 - 1,308          4,512
 Adjusted Headline Earnings           (62%) to (72%)      1,980 - 1,459          5,211
 AHEPS (cents)¹                       (60%) to (70%)        43.7 - 32.7          109.1

1. AHEPS defined as Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by WANS adjusted to reflect the
Group's BBE shares and shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds.

The notable decrease in the GDP growth for South Africa and increased
uncertainty around future cashflow projections is expected to result in the
recognition of material impairments in respect of the carrying value of our
investment in Nedbank and the goodwill related to our investment in Old Mutual
Finance. These impairments are recognised in the IFRS income statement,
however, are not recognised in Headline Earnings as this is an explicit
adjusting item in accordance with the JSE Circular. Accordingly they are also
not recognised in Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE).

Headline earnings is higher than AHE, as AHE excludes the results related to
the operations of Residual plc and Zimbabwe and the adjustment in respect of
investment return for group equity and debt instruments held in life funds, all
of which were positive in H1 2020.

Taking into account the decrease in operating earnings and the significant
impairments outlined above shareholders are advised that HEPS and Basic EPS are
expected to fall within the ranges outlined below:

 Key Performance Indicators
 (R million unless stated                  Estimated   Estimated 30 June
 otherwise)                                 % change                2020   30 June 2019
 Headline Earnings                    (23%) to (33%)       4,507 - 3,922          5,854
 HEPS (cents)                         (20%) to (30%)        102.5 - 89.7          128.1
 IFRS profit after tax                  Greater than    (5,621) - (6,745)         5,817
 attributable to equity holders               (100%)
 of the parent
 Basic EPS (cents)                      Greater than    (128.5) - (154.2)         127.3
                                              (100%)

OLD MUTUAL VOLUNTARY OPERATING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020.


The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had far reaching impacts on the global
economy, with many countries around the world enforcing lockdowns in varying
severity. The significant declines seen in global capital markets and commodity
prices, the decrease in economic activity due to lockdown restrictions and low
investor and consumer confidence have created a challenging operating
environment for businesses and individuals. In South Africa, the pandemic has
resulted in the rand weakening against major currencies and substantial
outflows from the local bond and equity markets following a further credit
rating downgrade.

To manage the spread of COVID-19, governments in most countries where we operate
have introduced full or partial lockdowns, restricting the movement of goods and
people. Despite the start of gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, we expect
a slow recovery due to the severity of global and local economic contraction
suffered during the crisis. During this pandemic the safety and wellbeing of our
employees, intermediaries and customers remains a top priority. The Group has
experienced minimal disruption to our business operations, with the exception of
our distribution processes where the disruption levels have been higher. We were
able to successfully mobilise and enable the majority of our employees to work
from home and this has allowed us to continue to serve our customers. Although
lockdown restrictions are being eased we envisage that all those business
functions able to operate effectively from home will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future to minimise the number of employees physically onsite in our
primary office locations of Pinelands and Sandton. The small group of employees
who are working from our premises have been engaged and briefed on the strict
protocols they need to follow to ensure their safety, and the safety of other
employees and our customers remains a priority.


Many of our tied advisers have been unable to sell during the lockdown period
due to the partial closure of the branch network and lack of access to customer’s
homes, worksites and branches. The majority of our branch consultants are unable
to work from home and therefore the necessary closure of the majority of our
branch network has slowed loan disbursements and negatively impacted funeral,
savings and credit life sales. These factors have significantly impacted
productivity and new business acquisition during April and May. We have
implemented various intermediary initiatives during lockdown including the
provision of airtime and network access to enable communication with customers,
promotion of digital platforms for sales and the introduction of lower hurdles
for academy advisors to earn base allowances for the duration of the lockdown.
We are actively monitoring the lifting of restrictions to ensure we can return
to full operating capacity as soon as restrictions are lifted.

We have continued to make progress against our strategic priorities during the
first quarter, with focus on improving our customer enablement and servicing
journey and digitally enabling our employees. We have implemented a number of
enhancements and introduced new digital channels and functionality such as the
use of USSD and WhatsApp platforms to service funeral claims and
disinvestments. We added Old Mutual Insure to our Rewards programme, and new
rewards partners such as Uber and Checkers are expected to assist our rewards
members during this difficult period. We have been able to continue with the
roll out of Old Mutual Protect to customers and onboarding of advisers, with
over 1,000 advisers now using the product.


Capital position and Liquidity


The Group’s liquidity management remains robust and we have cash reserves more
than sufficient to cover our business requirements. We have performed a series
of stress tests to assess our liquidity position under various recovery scenarios
and liquidity levels remain positive under all of these.


The solvency ratio for OMLACSA for the three months ended 31 March 2020 was 211%,
at the top end of our target range of 175%-210%. The decrease in our solvency
ratio from the reported 216% in our FY2019 results, was largely due to a reduction
in own funds driven by the significant decrease in Nedbank’s share price year to
date and a decrease in the related solvency capital requirement. The impact on
our capital ratio of market driven decreases on the rest of the portfolio was
largely mitigated by our hedging programme, which proved effective during this
period of volatility. We also continue to monitor our Group solvency ratio and
we remain well within our target range of 155%-175%.


Following the severe market downturn in March 2020, the monthly investment
returns earned on our Absolute Growth Portfolios, our flagship smoothed bonus
portfolios, fell to negative levels in excess of -15%. We exercised our right
of discretion to declare a less severe negative bonus of -5% to protect benefit
payments to customers. This is the first time in the history of this product
that a negative bonus has been declared and we remain confident that the Bonus
Smoothing Reserve will be restored over the medium term. Investment risk for our
customers is being managed through the diversification of underlying portfolios
within mandate, the smoothing of investment returns and the offering of explicit
capital guarantees. The guarantee risk for shareholders is managed on an ongoing
basis through various management actions including applying Market Value
Adjustments to voluntary withdrawals, reducing bonuses, declaring negative
bonuses or removing non-guaranteed account values. In addition, the Group holds
an explicit Investment Guarantee Reserve and employs a hedging strategy on the
assets supporting this reserve. Our smoothed bonus funds have been managed well
during this period of volatility.

 (RFO)
1Comparative   amounts represent FY2019 balances.


Life APE sales have decreased largely due to lower recurring premiums flows
experienced across the business partially offset by strong single premium sales.
The decline in recurring premium life sales is driven by lower umbrella sales in
Old Mutual Corporate and lower sales volumes in Mass and Foundation Cluster and
Personal Finance, reflecting lower levels of customer disposable income.


Net Client Cash Flow remains positive due to strong single premium life sales
and higher institutional and retail inflows in Wealth and Investments, despite
increased outflows as customers seek liquidity and withdraw funds to supplement
income. FUM levels have decreased largely due to a decrease in equity market
levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the positive
impact of foreign denominated FUM due to the weakening rand.


We experienced stable growth in Loans and Advances compared to the prior year,
with deliberate slowed disbursements to manage credit risk. Gross Written
Premiums showed good growth driven by the ongoing benefits from strategic
partnerships in Old Mutual Insure and strong renewal rates and new business
acquisition in East Africa.


The decrease in RFO is due to lower asset based fees and negative fair value
movements on unlisted equity and credit portfolios in Wealth and Investments.
Lower life sales volumes not sufficient to cover fixed distribution related
costs, deterioration in underwriting experience in Old Mutual Corporate and the
impact of poor persistency and higher credit losses, specifically in Mass and
Foundation Cluster have further contributed to the decline in profits. This was
partially offset by improved underwriting experience in Old Mutual Insure
compared to significant catastrophe losses in the prior year.


Trading update


Despite a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in South Africa and in many
countries where we operate, we expect the pandemic to impact our performance for
the remainder of the 2020 financial year as levels of uncertainty continue to
impact economic conditions and consumer confidence. The value of issued life
sales in the month of April was significantly lower than in the prior year,
reflecting the impact on our sales force. Issued sales in Mass and Foundation
Cluster were down around 90% and almost 50% in Personal Finance, respectively.
We expect sales levels to recover subsequent to lockdown and specific management
actions have been put in place to accelerate sales and greater access to
customers. The significant drop in issued sales will negatively impact reported
Life APE sales in H1 2020, and therefore we expected this metric to be lower
than prior year as the impact of lower issued sales volumes comes through.


Low levels of issued sales in April and May, whilst the distribution cost base
remains largely fixed, will have a negative impact on our reported profits and
Value of New Business (VNB) for H1 2020. Initiatives in the form of premium
holidays, discounts and deferrals of rate increases will pose further downside
pressure on revenue levels. In response, expenses are being tightly managed.


The risk of rising infection rates may adversely impact mortality experience,
whilst other COVID-19 related claims such as business interruption claims could
also negatively impact underwriting experience. We have seen an increase in
business interruption incidents in April and May, however we expect to be able
to rely on our existing reinsurance programme. The consumer will remain under
significant pressure, with increased levels of unemployment expected. This is
likely to reduce levels of disposable income resulting in lower sales volumes,
worse persistency and higher credit losses on our loan book. Shareholder
investment returns are expected to be below prior year due to year to date
decline in the equity markets and negative fair value movements on certain
classes of invested shareholder assets.


Taking into account these indicators of H1 2020 performance, In terms of paragraph
3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised
that Headline Earnings per share (HEPS) and Earnings per share (EPS) for the six
months ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower than the reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS: 128.1 cents, H1 2019 EPS:
127.3 cents). We will publish a further update once there is more certainty on
the probable ranges of the decrease in HEPS and EPS.


Our contribution to society

We have remained conscious of our commitment to support our customers and
communities in this time of severe stress and continue to make positive
contributions through various initiatives.

Key initiatives include the following:

?   R4 billion worth of free life cover made available to approximately 430 000
    registered healthcare workers across South Africa.
?   We pledged R50 million towards relief efforts that address immediate
    educational needs, hygiene awareness and nutritional support and R5 million
    towards national initiatives that provide access to personal protective
    equipment for essential service workers. As part of these efforts, we have
    refurbished a former training centre close to our office in Pinelands which
    will in part be used by Lancet Laboratories for COVID-19 testing. The remainder
    of the facility was refurbished as an isolation and quarantine facility and
    handed over to the Western Cape government on 27 May 2020.
?     Our business in Namibia committed N$5 million towards the provision of food
      supplies, the expansion of testing capacity, and the National Disaster Fund.
      In Kenya, we contributed KES6 million in support of government initiatives to
      contain the virus. In Zimbabwe, we offered ZWL$2 billion life insurance cover
      to health professionals on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19.
?     We are providing ongoing customer relief such as premium payment holidays,
      premium discounts, delays in annual rate and fee reviews and grace periods
      for loan repayments.
?     We included the Solidarity Fund as a beneficiary on our staff Payroll Giving
      Programme in which employees are encouraged to give generously. Our Executive
      Committee members agreed to forego salary increases and the company is
      directing these funds to the Solidarity Fund.
?     Old Mutual Insure pledged R50 million in total to support SME customers and
      partners during this period.


Outlook


Over the past few weeks, we have performed a detailed scenario planning exercise
which has focused on modelling the financial impact on key earnings, liquidity
and capital measures under a range of possible economic scenarios. The outcome
of these scenarios shows that, whilst we do expect to experience earnings pressure
in the short term, our capital and liquidity remain at appropriate levels in
all scenarios, with the Group solvency capital ratio falling marginally below
our target range pre-management actions only in the most extreme scenario tested.
In order to mitigate the expected pressure on earnings we have implemented a
series of management actions focusing on reducing expenses in 2020. We are also
working on a number of medium term initiatives to capitalise on the growth
opportunities the pandemic presents, these will be communicated in due course.
Whilst we expect market circumstances to place pressure on earnings in the short
term we remain confident in the strength of our cash reserves and balance sheet
to withstand this volatility, ensuring we will continue to be able to deliver on
our promises to customers and providing a platform to accelerate growth as
economic conditions improve.

SUSPENSION OF FUNGIBILITY OF OLD MUTUAL LIMITED SHARES ON THE ZIMBABWE STOCK
EXCHANGE

Shareholders holding Old Mutual shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (“ZSE”)
are advised that on 15 March 2020, the Zimbabwe Minister of Finance issued
the Exchange Control (Suspension of Fungibility of Certain Shares) Order,
2020 (Government Notice 583 of 2020) (“the Fungibility Suspension Order”).

The Fungibility Suspension Order suspends every exchange control authority,
directive or order granted by any exchange control authority allowing the
fungibility of the Company’s shares listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
until 12 March 2021. It does not affect transactions conducted on the ZSE on
or before 13 March 2020 and in respect of which settlement was due by 18
March 2020.

The Company’s understanding is that the shares listed on the ZSE remain
tradable subject to the limitations introduced by the Fungibility Suspension
Order and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe’s related audit
of transactions. This may have a material effect on the price of the
Company’s securities traded on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities on the ZSE until a further announcement is made as may
be necessary.

FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND DIVIDEND CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS

Shareholders   are  referred   to   Old  Mutual’s   Preliminary   Results
announcement dated 16 March 2020, wherein the company declared a final
dividend of 75 cents per share, which will be paid on Monday, 4 May 2020.
The dividend of 75 cents per ordinary share will be subject to a local
dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net final dividend, to
those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 60
cents per ordinary share. International shareholders who are not exempt
or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation
agreement, will be subject to a dividend withholding tax at a rate of
20%.


Shareholders on the London, Zimbabwean, Malawian and Namibian registers
will be paid in the local currency equivalents of the final dividend.
Distributions made through the dividend access trust or similar
arrangements established in a country will not be subject to South African
withholding tax but may be subject to withholding tax in the relevant
country. We recommend that you consult with your tax advisor regarding
the in-country withholding tax consequences.


The local currency equivalents of the final dividend have now been
established as follows:
Malawi                            32.34   Malawian kwacha per share
Namibia                           75.00   Namibian cents per share
United Kingdom                     3.71   GBP pence per share
Zimbabwe                          91.37   RTGS cents per share

These local currency equivalents have been calculated using the following
exchange rates:
Malawi                          43.1139   Malawian   kwacha per Rand
Namibia                          1.0000   Namibian   cents per Rand
United Kingdom                  20.2070   Rand per   Pound sterling
Zimbabwe                         0.8208   Rand per   RTGS dollar
The timetable released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 16 March
2020 remains unchanged.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR INTERIM CEO

Our business was resilient against significant headwinds in 2019. We faced challenging macroeconomic conditions in South Africa, our largest market, and many
of our operating countries in the Rest of Africa. This put pressure on the disposable income levels of our customers and on the ability of our businesses to
grow value for our customers and investors. We remain confident that our diversified business allows us to protect value for stakeholders in tough economic
times. After careful consideration of the relevant facts and actions, our Board took the difficult decision to dismiss our former chief executive, Peter Moyo.
We remained focused on reassuring our customers, investors and employees during the heightened media attention and scrutiny that followed, through transparent
and regular communication. The Board remains confident that the decision made was in the best interests of our stakeholders and that their duties were
discharged in line with the high standard of governance and ethics expected of an established and respected organisation like ours.

Our financial results were resilient after taking into account the impact of external factors in our operating environment. Results from Operations (RFO)
decreased by 2% reflecting positive assumption changes offset by a decrease in Old Mutual Insure's underwriting result. Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) was
up 5% mainly due to stronger shareholder investment returns in South Africa, partially offset by reductions in the fair value of properties in East Africa. We
delivered positive Net Client Cash Flow (NCCF) which is commendable in the tough macroeconomic environment and Funds under Management (FUM) increased by 2% in
line with the increase in average market levels.

Our business in China showed good growth in 2019 and is well positioned to penetrate the life insurance market which is relatively new and underpenetrated.
Previously, we offered primarily investment products, but have since expanded our offering to include protection solutions such as life, disability and
critical illness. Despite tough external factors, we have made great strides to be more operationally efficient so we remain relevant to our customers of the
future. Since listing in 2018, we have been deliberate and focused on making what we believe to be essential culture shifts to champion positive futures for
our customers every day and to attract top talent. We have been working relentlessly to become a digitally enabled business. We have made good progress on
simplifying our legacy systems and processes, transforming the business to be more agile and able to meet our customers' needs and expectations. 2019 was a
year in which our customers and communities were vulnerable and we remained dedicated to make an impact to their everyday lives through our responsible
business efforts. Embedding a culture of being a responsible business has been a key focus since listing. We continue to create awareness amongst our
employees to act responsibly, as we believe this will positively impact our ways of working and interactions with customers and the communities we serve. We
have organised ourselves to make an impact through specific focus areas which align with the needs of our stakeholders and we are in the process of refining
targets to track desired outcomes in each focus area.

We returned significant levels of capital to our shareholders, including share buybacks totalling R4.9 billion and total ordinary dividends of 120 cents per
share, an increase of 3% from last year.

On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 (Coronavirus) was declared as a pandemic due to the rising rate and scale of infection observed. The rapid spread of virus since
the start of 2020, and particularly in recent weeks, has caused significant disruption in global equity markets. The volatility of movements on global
exchanges such as NYSE and FTSE is comparable to previous crises. In South Africa, the JSE SWIX has decreased by 23% since the start of the year to date. In
China and Italy, significant proportions of the populations have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus, with other countries responding to the
risk with increased screenings and travel restrictions.

We are monitoring this situation on a daily basis. We have established a special committee to ensure that our employees in all of our locations can continue
to work safely, whether that is from our premises or from their homes. We have placed restrictions on all cross border business and personal travel to ensure
we limit the risk of infection to our employees and customers. We also regularly model the impact of 'perfect storm' scenarios on our solvency capital and
liquidity levels. These stress tests have shown we remain sufficiently capitalised with appropriate liquidity levels through these scenarios. We remain
confident that the benefits of our well diversified business, strong balance sheet and stable cash generating ability will stand us in good stead, in what is
anticipated to be a difficult year.

The achievement of our RFO target of nominal GDP+2% CAGR is dependent on an improvement in the macroeconomic environment in South Africa, which remains our
largest operating country, and higher equity market levels. Given the anticipated disruption in global equity markets and significant downward pressure on
GDP growth rates we do not anticipate being able to achieve this target for the 2020 financial year.

IFRS profit after tax for the comparative period includes the accounting impacts of the transactions executed to complete the Managed Separation. These
included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of Nedbank. IFRS profit after tax for the comparative period therefore included the consolidated
profits in respect of Quilter plc and Nedbank, both of these were classified as profit from discontinued operations. IFRS profits for the comparative period
also included the profit recognised on the distribution of Quilter plc and Nedbank of R23,175 million. IFRS profit after tax for the current period no longer
includes the impact of these items, which is the main driver of the decrease. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent on a
comparable basis increased by 34% from the prior year. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders on a comparable basis is derived by adjusting the
comparative to remove the impact of Managed Separation transactions and to reflect Nedbank as if it had been accounted for as an associate for the full year
in 2018. The increase of 34% is driven by material Residual plc losses in 2018 which did not recur, partially offset by a decrease in Zimbabwe earnings.

TRADING STATEMENT AND PERFORMANCE UPDATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019


Financial performance

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited is currently in the process of
finalising its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""current
period""). This trading statement provides an indication of a range for Headline
Earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity holders
of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements compared to the year ended 31 December 2018
(""comparative period""). The Group's annual results will be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Monday, 16 March 2020.

Results from Operations (RFO) is expected to decrease by approximately 0% to 5%
compared to the comparative period, a resilient outcome in the context of low
economic growth in South Africa. Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is expected to
increase by approximately 2% to 7% mainly driven by higher shareholder investment
return in South Africa. Accordingly, AHE per share is expected to increase by
approximately 4% to 9% to 202.9 - 212.6 cents in the current period compared to
195.1 cents for the comparative period.

1Restated   to exclude the results of Zimbabwe.
2AHEPS defined as Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by WANS adjusted to remove the Group's BBBEE
shares and shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds.

IFRS profits in the 2018 financial year include the accounting impacts of the
transactions executed to complete the Managed Separation. These transactions
included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of Nedbank Group
Limited (Nedbank). Profit after tax for the comparative period therefore included
the consolidated profits in respect of the Quilter plc and Nedbank businesses,
these were classified as profit from discontinued operations. Profits for the
comparative period also included the profit recognised on the distribution of
Quilter plc on 24 June 2018 and the unbundling of Nedbank on 15 October 2018.
Profit after tax for the current period no longer includes the impact of these
items related to the execution of Managed Separation, which is the main driver
of the expected decrease. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders
of the parent on comparable basis is expected to increase by approximately 30%
to 37%. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent on a
comparable basis is adjusted to remove the impact of Managed Separation
transactions and to reflect Nedbank as if it had been accounted for as an
associate for the full 2018 year.

The table below sets out the impact of the Managed Separation transactions
included in profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent for
the comparative period:
R million                                  31 December 2018
Profit from discontinued operations -      1,275
Quilter
Profit from discontinued operations -      7,241
Nedbank
Profit on Quilter distribution and         23,175
unbundling of Nedbank

Accordingly, we expect Basic earnings per share to decrease by approximately 73%
to 75% to 204.9 - 197.0 cents compared to 788.1 cents in the comparative period.
Headline Earnings (HE) is expected to decrease by approximately 24% to 28%. We
expect Headline Earnings per share (HEPS) to decrease by approximately 22% to
25% to 230.2 - 239.4 cents compared to 306.9 cents in the comparative period.

OLD MUTUAL ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS

On 8 October 2019, S&P Global Ratings (""S&PGR"") assigned Old Mutual a long-term
South Africa National Scale issuer credit rating of  zaAA-  and a short-term
South Africa National Scale issuer credit rating of  zaA-1+'. These are Old
Mutual's maiden ratings.

The ratings reflect the Old Mutual group's overall creditworthiness and Old
Mutual's structural subordination as a non-operating holding company. Old Mutual
Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited's (""OMLACSA"") resilient balance
sheet and the sound regulatory solvency ratios of both the Old Mutual group and
OMLACSA are also reflected in the rating. As at the end of June 2019, OMLACSA
reported a solvency ratio of 218% and the Old Mutual group reported a solvency
ratio of 166%.

DIVIDEND CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS


Shareholders are referred to Old Mutual's Interim Results announcement dated 2
September 2019, wherein the company declared an interim dividend of 45 cents per
share, which will be paid on 14 October 2019. The previously published timetable
remains the same.


Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be
paid in the local currency equivalents of the interim dividend. In Malawi,
Namibia and Zimbabwe these payments will be made through the dividend access
trust or similar arrangements established in each country.


The local currency equivalents of the interim dividend has now been established
as follows:
Malawi                      21.69            Malawi kwacha per share
Namibia                     45               Namibian     cents      per

Zimbabwe                    33.80            RTGS cents per share


These local currency   equivalents    have   been   calculated    using    the   following
exchange rates:
Malawi                      48.2074          Malawi kwacha per Rand

(1) The % change has been calculated with reference to FY 2018.

IFRS profit after tax for the 2018 financial period includes the accounting impacts of the transactions executed to 
complete the Managed Separation. These transactions included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of 
Nedbank. IFRS profit after tax for the comparative period therefore included the consolidated profits in respect of the 
Quilter plc and Nedbank businesses, these were classified as profit from discontinued operations. IFRS profits for the 
comparative period also included the profit recognised on the distribution of Quilter plc on 24 June 2018. IFRS profit 
after tax for the current period no longer includes the impact of these items related to the execution of Managed Separation, 
which is the main driver of the decrease.

(1) The profit in respect of the distribution of Quilter plc was restated to correct the allocation of foreign exchange 
    differences recycled to profit. Further the consolidated profits in respect of Nedbank and Quilter plc were restated

INTERIM DIVIDEND DECLARATION

The Board of directors has approved and declared a gross interim dividend of 45 cents per ordinary share. 

The interim dividend of 45 cents per share is in line with Old Mutual Limited's dividend policy, which is set at 
40% of Adjusted Headline Earnings. The interim dividend will be paid out of distributable reserves and is payable 
on 14 October 2019 to all ordinary shareholders recorded on the record date. The dividend of 45 cents per ordinary 
share will be subject to a local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net interim dividend, to those 
shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 36 cents per ordinary share. International shareholders 
who are not exempt or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation agreement will be subject 
to dividend withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be paid in the local currency equivalents 
of the interim dividend. In Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe these distributions will be made through dividend access 
trust or similar arrangements established in each country and will not be subject to South African withholding tax.
Old Mutual Limited's income tax number is 9267358233. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's 
share register at the date of declaration is 4,831,264,848.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMME

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual intends to commence a share repurchase programme of the Company's ordinary 
shares up to a maximum consideration of R2.4 billion. The repurchase programme of OML shares on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange will commence on 3 September 2019. The share repurchase programme will be effected in accordance with 
the General Authority received by way of a shareholder resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting, held on 
24 May 2019, allowing the Company to repurchase up to 169 094 269 ordinary shares equivalent to 3.5% of the issued 
share capital of the Company. 

The Board believes that the share price is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and is of the view that a share repurchase 
programme will deliver longer term incremental value to shareholders. The management team remains committed to following 
a disciplined trading approach under the share repurchase programme and will only repurchase shares to the extent that 
market conditions are favourable. The purpose of the repurchase programme is to reduce the share capital of the Company.

TRADING STATEMENT AND PERFORMANCE UPDATE FOR THE 6 MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2019


Financial performance

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited is currently in the process of
finalising its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (""current
period""). This trading statement provides an indication of a range for Headline
Earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity holders
of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements compared to the six months ended 2018 (""comparative
period""). The Group's interim results will be released on the Stock Exchange
News Service of the JSE Limited on Monday, 2 September 2019.

Results from Operations (RFO) is expected to be between a decrease by 1% and an
increase of 4% compared to the comparative period. Adjusted Headline Earnings
(AHE) is expected to increase by approximately 6% to 12% mainly driven by higher
shareholder investment return in South Africa. Accordingly AHE per share is
expected to increase by approximately 7% to 13% to 106 -111 cents in the current
period compared to 98.9 cents for the comparative period.

    RFO (Rm)                             4,377 –          4,426               (1%) to 4%

 Restated to exclude the results of Zimbabwe.

 AHEPS defined as Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by WANS adjusted to reflect the Group's BBE
shares and shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds.

IFRS profits in the 2018 financial year include the accounting impacts of the
transactions executed to complete the Managed Separation. These transactions
included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of Nedbank. Profit
after tax for the comparative period therefore included the consolidated profits
in respect of the Quilter plc and Nedbank businesses, these were classified as
profit from discontinued operations. Profits for the comparative period also
included the profit recognised on the distribution of Quilter plc on 24 June
2018. Profit after tax for the current period no longer includes the impact of
these items related to the execution of Managed Separation, which is the main
driver of the expected decrease. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity
holders of the parent on a comparable basis is expected to increase by
approximately 8% to 13%.

The table below sets out the impact of the Managed Separation transactions
included in profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent for
the comparative period:
    R million                                          30 June 2018(1)

    Quilter
    Profit from discontinued operations -              4,133
    Nedbank
    Profit on Quilter distribution                     4,023
1
 The profit in respect of the distribution of Quilter plc was restated to correct the allocation of
foreign exchange differences recycled to profit. Further the consolidated profits in respect of
Nedbank and Quilter plc were restated to reverse the amortisation reported as part of these results
as required under IFRS 5 ""Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"". The IFRS
profits reported for December 2018 corrected for these items, therefore will not be restated. The
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2019 will include
further detail and disclosure on these restatements.

Accordingly we expect Basic earnings per share to decrease by approximately 53%
to 55% to 123.5 - 129.8 cents compared to 277.2 cents in the comparative period.
Headline Earnings (HE) is expected to decrease by approximately 33% to 36%. We
expect Headline Earnings per share (HEPS) to decrease by approximately 31% to
35% to 124.3 - 130.7 cents compared to 190.6 cents in the comparative period.

distribution of Quilter plc was restated to correct the allocation of foreign exchange differences

restated to reverse the amortisation reported as part of these results as required under IFRS 5
""Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"". The IFRS profits reported for December
2018 corrected for these items, therefore will not be restated. The condensed consolidated financial
statements for the six months ended 30 June 2019 will include further detail and disclosure on these
restatements.


Treatment of Zimbabwe

During the first half of 2019, the Group concluded that Zimbabwe was a
hyperinflationary economy and made a decision to account for it as such. This
decision was supported by a rapid increase in the inflation rate, which at the
end of June 2019 was far in excess of 100% at 176%, the significant
deterioration in the traded interbank RTGS dollar exchange rate over the period
and the lack of access in Zimbabwe to foreign currency to pay foreign
denominated liabilities.

We have applied hyperinflation accounting from 1 October 2018 and used the
Zimbabwe Consumer Price Index (CPI) to inflation adjust reported numbers. The
results, net assets and cash flows are then translated into rand at the closing
rate of 1 RTGS to 2.13 ZAR. The closing rate used to translate the December
2018 results was 1 RTGS to 4.35 ZAR.

Until such time as we are able to access capital by way of dividends from our
business in Zimbabwe, we will manage it on a ring fenced basis. Consequently,
the results of this business have been removed from RFO and AHE. The ability to
access capital is exacerbated by the volatility that hyperinflationary economy
and the reporting thereof introduces. This adjustment has been applied from 1
January 2019 and we have restated comparatives to reflect this decision.


The financial information in this trading statement is the responsibility of the
Board of Directors and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's
external auditors.

UPDATE ON PETER MOYO AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

The Old Mutual Board (""Board"") refers stakeholders to previous announcements
regarding the suspension of the Old Mutual CEO, Mr Peter Moyo, as released on
SENS on 24 May 2019, and various subsequent media reports.

The Board wishes to inform stakeholders that Mr Moyo has, on 17 June 2019, been
given notice of termination of employment. The Board considers it appropriate
to provide certain material facts that have led to this.

There is a duty on directors of all institutions to be vigilant regarding the
management of conflicts of interest.   The importance of this duty has been
highlighted by a number of recent corporate governance breakdowns within both
the private and public sector.

Mr Moyo's conflicting interest in the NMT group of companies was declared upon
his employment and was governed by a specific protocol to regulate the conflict
of interest in addition to the general obligations flowing from his employment
contract.   During the latter half of 2018, the Old Mutual Related Party
Transaction Committee (RPTC), a Committee of Independent OML Board members,
requested a report on Mr Moyo's related party transactions, and confirmation
that the terms of his employment contract had been adhered to.

During this process, various concerns emerged relating to Mr Moyo's conduct in
relation to his conflicting interest. One of the concerns raised involved two
declarations of ordinary dividends by NMT Capital during 2018 totalling R115m.
The resultant benefit to Mr Moyo and his own personal investment company was
R30.6m.   These dividends were declared in breach of Old Mutual's rights as
preference shareholder, since arrear preference dividends were unpaid at the
time and, at the time of the second dividend declaration, the preference share
capital was redeemable. The preference share capital remains unpaid. Mr Moyo
chaired the board meeting of NMT Capital at which the second ordinary dividend
of R105m was declared.

These matters were investigated and reported to the RPTC in February 2019. The
RPTC reported to the OML Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee (NomCom)
in March 2019. This was followed by engagements, both through members of the
RPTC and Old Mutual's legal counsel, with the NMT Group, as well as with Mr Moyo
personally, in an effort to secure information relevant to these events. NomCom
considered these matters at several meetings during April 2019. The Board
deliberated on them at two meetings during May 2019.

The Board has not been provided with an acceptable explanation why, in clear
contravention of the relevant preference share agreement with Old Mutual as well
as Mr Moyo's employment obligations, ordinary dividends were declared whilst
debt to Old Mutual was outstanding. On 23 May 2019 the Board discussed these
matters at length and considered its options, noting its duties towards its
stakeholders. The Board came to the conclusion that there was a material breakdown
in trust and confidence in Mr Moyo.

After reaching this conclusion and in the course of 23 May the Board engaged
with Mr Moyo regarding the possibility of an agreed separation, but no agreement
could be reached on this. The Board decided that in the circumstances it was
appropriate to suspend Mr Moyo. This was announced on 24 May 2019. Mr Moyo's
actions since the suspension contravened his fiduciary duties to Old Mutual, his
contract of employment and his notice of suspension.      Following unsuccessful
attempts to engage on the terms of separation, the Board has now resolved to
give notice of termination of employment.

The Board will shortly initiate a process to appoint a new CEO. T his process
will follow our recruitment policies and the requisite Board approvals. Iain
Williamson will continue to act as CEO for Old Mutual, until further announcements
are made.

OPERATING UPDATE FOR THE 3 MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2019


Operating environment
In South Africa, our largest market, the economic environment remains challenging
with low economic growth and rising fuel prices expected to place further pressure
on our customers? disposable income levels. During the first 3 months of 2019,
the JSE delivered its best first quarter since 2007 with the ALSI rising 7.1%
reflecting the strong performance of resource and industrial sectors. Whilst
equity markets in South Africa are up from December 2018 the absolute levels are
still below where they were in the first quarter last year, placing pressure on
earnings.


In Zimbabwe, the equity markets remain volatile, decreasing 17% since the
beginning of the year. Inflation reached 67% at the end of March 2019, reflecting
the increased cost of imports. Our customers? in this market are impacted by the
rising inflation and the resultant impact thereof on their disposable income
levels. On 20 February 2019 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that RTGS had
been recognised as an official currency and established an inter-bank foreign
exchange market to allow trading between RTGS and other currencies. At the end
of March 2019, the RTGS was trading at 3.01 to the USD dollar.


Financial performance
Despite the challenging economic environment the business continues to attract
new business from customers. Life APE sales of R2,945 million were 4% ahead of
prior year largely due to higher recurring premium SuperFund sales in Old Mutual
Corporate.


Gross flows of R39.3 billion were 10% behind prior year due to lower flows in
Wealth and Investments and lower single premium sales in Old Mutual Corporate.
NCCF in the first quarter of 2019 was negative (-R1.1 billion) mainly reflecting
lower net flows in Wealth and Investments.


Funds under Management was up from December 2018 at R1,084 billion in line with
equity market returns in South Africa.
Corporate activity
The sale of our business in Latin America completed on 1 April 2019, with gross
proceeds of R4.4 billion ($308 million) received. The associated costs are
expected to be approximately $40 million. We expect to realise an IFRS profit on
the disposal of this business.

We have repurchased shares under the share repurchase programme announced on 11
March 2019. The price at which shares were repurchased ranged from 2,222 to 2,313
cents. The shares repurchased will be cancelled and revert to authorised but
unissued share capital. Following the shares repurchased to date the Group will
have 4,831,264,848 ordinary shares in issue.

Outlook
Our RFO target of GDP + 2% CAGR will become increasingly challenging to achieve
over the three year target period due to negative RFO growth in 2018. If poor
economic conditions persist during 2019 in our key markets, this will further
challenge the achievement of this target. We remain on track to deliver on our
other medium term targets.

We anticipate making a further operating update ahead of the publication of our
2019 Interim Results announcement on 2 September 2019.

This update for the 3 months ended 31 March 2019 has not been audited or reviewed
by the Group?s auditors.

UPDATE: SUSPENSION OF OLD MUTUAL LIMITED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

The Board of Old Mutual (""Board"") has decided to separate with the Group CEO,
Peter Moyo. Pending conclusion of this and to manage it effectively, the Board
considered it appropriate to suspend Mr Moyo, so releasing him from his duties
and enabling the appointment of an interim chief executive officer.

The separation was a result of a material breakdown      of trust and confidence,
which occurred due to the management of conflicts        of interest in business
relations with related parties. These business          relations pre-exist the
appointment of Mr Moyo as CEO of Old Mutual and were    considered at the time of
the appointment to be manageable.

The competing interests were regulated in the chief executive's contract of
employment and were disclosed in the Old Mutual pre-listing statement and the
annual financial statements. Unfortunately the Board and Mr Moyo have disagreed
materially on how the conflict of interest has been managed, resulting in a
breakdown in the required mutual trust and confidence.

The decision to separate with the chief executive officer is neither the result
of performance or financial misconduct related to the Old Mutual business, and
is purely related to the conflict of interest issue.

The board has appointed Old Mutual's Chief Operating Officer, Iain Williamson,
as acting Chief Executive Officer. Iain is a seasoned executive at Old Mutual
and we are confident that he will provide the appropriate stewardship during
this period.

B-BBEE CERTIFICATE

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement on 29 March 2019, advising
shareholders of, inter alia, a consultation process in relation to the
recognition of value distributed to B-BBEE shareholders through the unbundling
of an asset in Old Mutual's B-BBEE scorecard. This consultation process involved
the Association for Savings and Investments South Africa (""ASISA"") and the
Financial Services Transformation Council (""FSTC""). Shareholders were advised
that the outcome of this process would impact the recognition of the value of
assets distributed by Old Mutual to its B-BBEE shareholders during 2018 as part
of the Managed Separation and that Old Mutual would re-issue its B-BBEE
certificate following completion of the consultation process.
 Old Mutual is pleased to announce that the FSTC has now confirmed the recognition
principles in respect of the value distributed by Old Mutual to its B-BBEE
shareholders as part of Managed Separation. In accordance with these recognition
principles, Old Mutual's deemed Black South African ownership percentage was
22.8% as at 31 December 2018. A revised B-BBEE certificate was issued on 30
April 2019 and is available on the Company's website at:
www.oldmutual.co.za/about-us/transformation/black-empowerment/bee-

EXTENSION OF OLD MUTUAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMME

Old Mutual announces that the share repurchase programme announced by the Company
on 11 March 2019 has been extended by R500 million, bringing the maximum
consideration of the share repurchase programme to R2.5 billion (the ""Extended
Programme"").

As previously, the Extended Programme will be effected in accordance with the
General Authority received by way of a shareholder resolution passed at the AGM,
held on 6 March 2018, allowing the Company to repurchase up to 247 102 418
ordinary shares, equivalent to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
OML has approval from the Prudential Authority for the Extended Programme.

The OML Board believes that OML is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value
and is of the view that a share repurchase programme will deliver longer term
incremental value to shareholders. The management team remains committed to
following a disciplined trading approach under the share repurchase programme
and will only repurchase shares to the      extent that market conditions are
favourable. The purpose of the repurchase programme is to reduce the share
capital of the Company.


The Repurchased Shares shall be cancelled as issued shares and will revert to
authorised but unissued share capital status.

CHANGE IN RESPONSIBILITIES OF A DIRECTOR

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Listing Requirements, the Board of
Old Mutual has considered an arms-length transaction by                Ms. T M Mokgosi-
Mwantembe in her personal capacity and, given the nature of the transaction,
have resolved that Ms. Mokgosi-Mwantembe can no longer be classified as an
independent Director on the Old Mutual Limited Board.               Ms. Mokgosi-Mwantembe
has therefore stepped down as Remuneration Committee Chairperson and the Board
has appointed Ms. N T Moholi as member of the Remuneration Committee as well as
its Chairperson.      To allow Ms. Moholi sufficient time to discharge this role,
she has stepped down as Technology and Platforms Committee Chairperson with Mr.
S van Graan assuming that role.            These changes are effective immediately.

The Chairman of the Board, Mr. T A Manuel, would like to thank Ms. Mokgosi-
Mwantembe     for    her    significant       contribution   as   Remuneration    Committee
Chairperson, especially steering the Committee during the period of Managed
Separation, where the Committee was instrumental in providing the Board with
guidance and direction in respect of the Remuneration Philosophy and Policy for
the newly listed entity.          The Chairman further congratulated Ms.         Moholi and
Mr. van Graan on their new roles.

BEE CERTIFICATE AND ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORT

Shareholders are advised that the Company's 2018 BEE certificate and the Annual
Compliance Report in terms of section 13G(2) of the Broad-Based Black Economic
Empowerment (""B-BBEE"") Amendment Act, No 46 of 2013, are available on the
Company's website at: www.oldmutual.co.za/about-us/transformation/black-
empowerment/bee-certificates


Overall BBBEE status

Old Mutual has retained its Level 2 BBBEE status for the 10th consecutive year.


Deemed Black South African Economic interest in Old Mutual

The Old Mutual share register became more South African following the share-for-
share exchange between Old Mutual plc (""OM plc"") and Old Mutual Limited (""OML"")
and the subsequent listing of OML on the JSE. This shift towards a more South
African register had a positive impact on Old Mutual's deemed South African Black
Ownership as measured in accordance with the Amended Financial Sector Code
(""Black Ownership"").

An industry wide process which involves the Association for Savings and
Investments South Africa (""ASISA"") and the Financial Services Transformation
Council (""FSTC""), constituted in terms of the Financial Sector Code with the
objectives of, inter alia, reviewing implementation guidelines and supporting
compliance, is underway to clarify the recognition of value distributed to BBBEE
shareholders through the unbundling of an asset.

As the consultation process is still on-going and in the absence of an agreed
approach with the FSTC, Old Mutual has excluded the value of assets distributed
to its BBBEE shareholders as part of the Managed Separation from its Black
Ownership disclosed in the OML BBBEE certificate dated 13 March 2019. This has
more than offset the positive impact of a more South African register resulting
in a net reduction in Old Mutual' s Black Ownership from the 21.5% reported as
at 31 December 2017, to 19.5% reported as at 31 December 2018.
Old Mutual is of the view that value distributed to its BBBEE shareholders during
2018 as part of the Managed Separation should be appropriately recognised.

Should this process deliver a favourable outcome, Old Mutual will re-issue its
BBBEE certificate. In this instance its Black Ownership is expected to increase
to a level above 21.5%, reported as at 31 December 2017, but to remain below the
FSC target of 25%.

                            DIVIDEND CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS

Shareholders are referred to Old Mutual's Preliminary Results announcement dated
11 March 2019, wherein the company declared a final dividend of 72 cents per
share, which will be paid on Friday, 29 April 2019.


Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be
paid in the local currency equivalents of the final dividend. In Malawi, Namibia
and Zimbabwe these payments will be made through the dividend access trust or
similar arrangements established in each country.


The local currency equivalents of the final dividend has now been established as follows:

Malawi                        35.91            Malawi kwacha per share
Namibia                       72               Namibian cents per share
United Kingdom                3.73             GBP pence per share
Zimbabwe                      13.67            RTGS cents per share


These local currency equivalents have been calculated using the following exchange rates:

Malawi                        49.8712          Malawi kwacha per Rand
Namibia                       1.0000           Namibian cents per Rand
United Kingdom                19.2791          Rand per Pound sterling

MESSAGE FROM THE CEO

""I am pleased with the progress we
made on our eight battlegrounds.
We delivered particularly good sales
and NCCF in a tough economic and
competitive environment. We delivered
very well against the promises we made
to investors. Sadly we did not meet our
Results from Operations (RFO) growth
target of GDP+2%. We are still confident
that we will meet all our targets in
the medium term noting that the
RFO target will be difficult given the
negative growth in 2018.
We have improved our customer
experience through digital enhance-
ments and the delivery of key phases
of our IT refresh journey. Whilst we
continue to see economic headwinds
in the near term, our Group is resilient,
well capitalised and managing its costs
tightly.""


PETER MOYO

2018 was a momentous year for our Group. We completed
the Managed Separation, highlighted by our successful
listing on 26 June 2018. This was followed by the unbundling
of 32% of Nedbank on 15 October 2018, returning a total
of R38.8 billion to our shareholders and retaining 19.9%. In
addition, we have distributed and declared R10.7 billion
in special and ordinary dividends. We have also made
good progress on accelerating the conversion of Residual
plc net asset value to cash with the repayment of all
outstanding international debt. We delivered well against
the commitments we made to our investors, with the
exception of Results from Operations. I am pleased with
the progress we made on our eight battlegrounds. These
results were delivered in a difficult operating environment.
We have conducted our operations in a responsible way
and managed the business within our risk appetite.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
2018 was characterised by volatility in global equity, currency
and bond markets due to escalating global trade tensions.
These global dynamics, in addition to weak local economic
data, negatively affected the South African economic
landscape resulting in low GDP growth in 2018.

Persistently high unemployment rates, a Value Added Tax
(VAT) rate increase and fuel hikes contributed to lower
real disposable incomes for our retail customers in South
Africa. This adversely affected our customer acquisition and

persistency, especially in the middle income market. The
economic outlook has marginally improved relative to the
previous year, when political uncertainty prevailed and credit
downgrades led to an even weaker operating environment.
Improvements in governance and accountability taking
place at State Owned Entities (SOEs) have resulted in some
increase in business and consumer confidence. However,
investor confidence is still fragile with concerns around
government debt levels and policy uncertainty particularly
around the proposed policy on land expropriation without
compensation.

The South African equity market declined with the JSE
SWIX down 14% in the year and down 9% from the end of
the first half of 2018.

Inflation continued to remain within the South African
Reserve Bank (SARB) target range at a 12-month average of
4.6% for 2018. The inflation outlook is benign, although it is
expected to be closer to the upper end of the target range
in the short to medium term due to upward pressures from
effects such as rising utility, transport costs and oil prices.

Although a new government under President Mnangagwa
came into power in the year, economic and political
instability still persists in Zimbabwe. Equity markets were
volatile, with a 40% rise in the second half of the year,
resulting in substantial mark to market gains. In order to
mitigate shortages of physical currency (US dollars) in

Zimbabwe, the use of electronic money was encouraged.
This is facilitated through the Real Time Gross Settlement
(RTGS) system. The increased reliance on RTGS, which
is purely a mechanism for settlement of Bond Notes,
effectively became a de facto currency. On 20 February 2019,
the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that the RTGS
would be recognised as an official currency and that an
inter-bank foreign exchange market would be established
to formalise trading in RTGS balances with other currencies.
In line with industry consensus on this matter we have
applied a reporting change to the functional currency for
our businesses in Zimbabwe from 1 October 2018. This
change has reduced both reported profits and net asset
value in 2018.

Macroeconomic indicators in Kenya remained broadly
stable in 2018 with overall inflation within target, GDP
growth and short term interest rates remaining low. Equity
markets remained volatile with a decline in the levels over
the period.

In Nigeria, economic growth accelerated in the third quarter
of 2018, assisted by improved dynamics in both the oil and
non-oil economy. Oil output increased in the second half of
the year following a reduction in pipeline disruptions.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
We delivered our 2018 financial results in tough economic
and market conditions in our key markets. Strong sales and

excellent Net Client Cash Flow (NCCF) supported average
Funds under Management (FUM) levels which rose in the
year. Closing FUM of R1.044 billion declined by 3% from the
end of 2017, largely reflecting lower equity market levels in
the fourth quarter.

Return on Net Asset Value (RoNAV) of 18.6% was ahead of
our Cost of Equity (COE)+4% target of 17.4%.

Results from Operations (RFO) of R9,963 million decreased
by 4% over the period reflecting net reserve movements,
and mortality and morbidity losses in Personal Finance in
the first half of 2018 and the change in functional currency
in Zimbabwe.

We delivered Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) of
R11,512  million, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior
period. The primary cause of this was the lower RFO, lower
investment income in South Africa as a result of weaker
equity markets and in Zimbabwe, the change in functional
currency in the fourth quarter. This decrease was partially
offset by higher income from associates, reflecting higher
earnings from our stake in Nedbank.

We have delivered R750 million of cost savings, putting us
in a good position to meet our R1 billion efficiency target
next year.

The Group solvency ratio1 increased to 170% (FY 2017: 161%),
reflecting the robust capital position of the Group.

defined through our eight battlegrounds.

                           within inflation thereafter

NEDBANK UNBUNDLING
We completed the distribution of 158,726,732 Nedbank
shares worth R38.8 billion to our shareholders in the
fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to view our remaining
shareholding of 19.9% as a long-term investment and this ownership
underpins significant commercial benefits we derive from
the continuation of this relationship. During 2018, around
R900 million of insurance premiums arose in Old Mutual
Limited sourced via the Nedbank distribution channels.

OUR ROLE IN SOCIETY
Having entered a new phase in our journey following
the completion of Managed Separation, we continue to
build a business with a conscience. During 2018 we paid
R91.5 billion in claims and benefits. This includes insurance
claims, annuity payouts and investment maturities. We
also regularly review the value our products provided to
customers and assess whether they adequately provide for
the identified need.

Developing our people is crucial to achieving our targets.
As such, we supported our employees through learning and 
development activities to the value of c. R165 million.

We remain committed to uplifting the communities in
which we operate. During 2018 we allocated R500 million
to a ring-fenced Enterprise Supplier Development Fund to
support small and black-owned businesses, in recognition of
the commitment made under the Framework Agreement
agreed with the Minister of Economic Development ahead
of the listing of Old Mutual Limited. The Fund's intention
is to generate additional jobs in the Group's ecosystem to
be evidenced by the end of June 2021. By the end of 2018,
R50 million of the Fund had been allocated to the Black
Distributors Trust, an entity that promotes the development
and advancement of black advisers in the tied and
broker segment of the insurance industry. The remaining
R450 million will be allocated in the near term.

The completion of our water filtration plant at our Mutualpark
office will help us save 10 million litres of municipal water
per month. This will help alleviate the water requirement
pressures faced by Cape Town.

We remain committed to transforming our organisation to 
reflect the societies we operate in.

For the 2018 period, we maintained a level 2 B-BBEE 
contributor status.

As part of our Managed Separation and listing process 
we committed to the Economic Development Department in 
South Africa to achieve an effective black ownership level 
of 25% within three years of listing and to be best in class, 
as measured at the time of listing, within five years of 
listing. We are formulating a plan to achieve this through 
internal and if necessary external mechanisms. This will be 
guided by a close review of the shareholder value to be created 
by achieving the score and facilitating transformation 
in South Africa.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE BUYBACK
We continue to develop our capital management to support
the delivery of total return to shareholders both in recurring
and sustainable ordinary dividend and one-off capital
returns where appropriate.

For 2018, we have declared a final dividend of 72 cents per
share to be paid on 29 April 2019. In accordance with our
stated dividend policy, consideration has been given to
the Group's underlying cash generation, fungibility of
earnings, targeted liquidity and solvency levels, business
strategic requirements and market conditions. We paid an
interim dividend of 45 cents per share in October 2018 which
brings the total ordinary dividend for 2018 to 117 cents per
share and is covered 2.04 times by AHE per share. This is in line with
our dividend policy. Further details of the timetable for the
exchange rate conversion for dividends payable in currencies
other than Rand will be communicated in due course.

We are also pleased to announce a share buyback
programme. Following a review of all capital available at
31 December 2018, and taking into account capital and
liquidity projections to the end of the 2019 financial year,
we have identified sufficient excess capital available to
conduct on market share buybacks for up to R2 billion.

Going forward, we anticipate future cash inflows from the
completion of the sale of Latin America and further inter
company dividends as we carry on converting Residual plc
net asset value into cash. We will assess the capacity for further
returns when such proceeds are received, taking into account
our solvency capital position and projections at the time.

OUTLOOK
Global growth is still expected to continue for 2019,
assuming trade tensions and equity market risks do not
result in a loss of confidence. This presents the opportunity
for our operations in those regions to grow our consumer
base and develop our product lines.

GDP forecast for 2019

South Africa                                 1.4%
Sub Saharan Africa                           3.5%
Zimbabwe                                     4.2%
Nigeria                                      2.0%
Ghana                                        7.6%
East Africa                           6.1% - 7.8%

National elections are planned for 8 May 2019 in South
Africa and elections in several other key markets are also
planned, and in the case of Nigeria, have occurred during
the first half of 2019.

At a segment level we are encouraged by the strong flows
secured in Corporate and operational improvements in Old
Mutual Insure. In Mass and Foundation Cluster and Personal
Finance, we are focussed on driving further growth through
expanding our multi-channel distribution capabilities. We
remain on track to deliver R1 billion in recurring expense
savings in 2019, and grow expenses within inflation thereafter.

Our RFO target of GDP+2% CAGR will become increasingly challenging 
to achieve over our three year target period due to negative RFO 
growth in 2018. AHE will continue to be influenced by investment returns 
in South Africa and the Rest of Africa. Despite the weak growth outlook 
in South Africa, the above macroeconomic risks and strong competitive 
pressures, we remain confident in delivering our medium term targets.

(1)   Reflects the key financial indicators of the Group before applying the functional currency change.
(2)   The application of the change in functional currency has been applied prospectively in our financial results for the 2018 reporting period. For inclusion
      in the condensed consolidated income statement of the Group, Zimbabwe results have been translated at the average US dollar exchange rate for the period up to
      30 September 2018 and at a RTGS US Dollar exchange rate of 3.3 to 1 for the remaining three months of the financial year. For inclusion in the condensed
      consolidated statement of financial position, Zimbabwe results have been translated RTGS US Dollar exchange rate of 3.3 to 1.

ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF
MANAGED SEPARATION
Managed Separation resulted in the separate listings of Old
Mutual Limited and Quilter. The majority of the shares in
Quilter (86.6%) were distributed to existing Old Mutual plc
shareholders with the sale of 9.6% to new shareholders. The
listing of Old Mutual Limited was effected via a UK court
scheme of arrangement which inserted Old Mutual Limited
as the new holding company of Old Mutual plc, after the
Quilter distribution, by way of a share for share exchange.

From an accounting perspective Managed Separation was
treated as a reorganisation of an existing group. The insertion
of a holding company between shareholders and an existing
group does not result in any change in the economic
substance of the reported group. As such, the condensed
consolidated financial statements of Old Mutual Limited
have been prepared on a predecessor basis. Consequently,
the current period results up to listing and the comparatives
presented for Old Mutual Limited reflect the values from
the financial statements of the previous 
Old Mutual plc Group with the exception of the equity structure
that has been adjusted to reflect that of the new entity,
being Old Mutual Limited. Refer to Note A1 in the condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other accounting impacts of Managed Separation
include the recognition of a profit of R4,023 million and
R19,152 million in respect of the distribution and sale of
Quilter shares and the unbundling of circa 32% of Nedbank
Group Limited, respectively. The profit on the distribution of
Quilter includes a profit on the recycling of foreign currency
translation reserves of R1,352 million. The profit recognised
on the unbundling of Nedbank has been calculated as the
difference between the market value and the consolidated
net asset value of the Group's shareholding in Nedbank on
the date of distribution. Directly attributable costs incurred
to execute these transactions has been offset against the
profits recognised. Refer to Note G5 in the condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The share for share exchange and the distribution of Quilter
and Nedbank shares led to an after tax accelerated vesting
charge of R354 million recognised in the condensed consolidated
income statement. This was as a result of the modification
of the underlying share awards subject to the existing share-
based payment arrangements of the former Old Mutual
plc Group.

ACCOUNTING IMPACT OF ZIMBABWE

The continued us dollar shortages experienced in Zimbabwe
have led to the increased use of electronic money through
the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, giving rise to
parallel market activities and multiple pricing mechanisms
where bond notes and RTGS balances have been trading at
a discount to the official US dollar exchange rate. Consensus
has developed to apply a change in functional currency for
our businesses operating in Zimbabwe from 1 October 2018,
being the date that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)
directed all banks to ring-fence Nostro foreign currency
accounts (FCAs) by separating them into two categories,
namely Nostro FCAs and RTGS FCAs.

During February 2019, a trading mechanism for RTGS
balance and bond notes with international currencies was
established, however before this, authorities maintained
that the US dollars represented in the RTGS system were
at a 1:1 exchange rate. We have estimated a RTGS US dollar
exchange rate of 3.3 to 1 (RTGS rate) by assessing various
inputs that impact inflation. The inputs considered in this
estimate include the relative food and fuel prices and the
official inflation rate. A further observable input taken into
consideration was the premium at which the Old Mutual
and PPC shares trade on the Zimbabwe stock exchange
relative to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

The application of the change in functional currency has
been applied prospectively in our financial results for the
2018 reporting period. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated
income statement of the Group, results in respect of
Zimbabwe have been translated at the average US dollar
exchange rate for the period up to 30 September 2018 and
at the estimated RTGS rate for the remaining three months
of the financial year. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated
statement of financial position, results have been translated
at the estimated RTGS rate.

The following table highlights the sensitivity of our key
financial measures to the estimated RTGS rate.

RFO is the primary measure of the business performance
of each of the operating segments. Activities related to the
Group's management of the capital structure and central
costs form part of the Other Group Activities segment, to
the extent that they are not managed as part of operating
segments.

A Central Expenses
Central expenses were R425 million in 2018, a decrease of
16% or R81 million from R506 million in the prior period. The
main driver for the decrease was a change in the central cost
allocation methodology implemented by the Group in 2018.
As part of an increased effort to more accurately measure the
economic contribution of each segment, project costs that
were previously accounted for centrally have been allocated
to segments. This was offset by an increase in costs to establish
and capacitate reporting and management functions for Old
Mutual Limited as a standalone listed entity.

B Shareholder investment return
Shareholder investment return was R2,880 million in 2018,
a decrease of 41% or R2,040 million from R4,920 million in
the prior period. South African equity markets declined by
14% during the year which contributed to lower shareholder
investment return. The majority of the shareholder return
in Rest of Africa is generated by Zimbabwe, where equity
markets have continued to be volatile, with a 40% rise in
the second half of the year, resulting in substantial mark to
market gains. The positive investment returns generated in
Zimbabwe equity markets was impacted by the translation
of shareholder investment return at the RTGS rate for the last
three months of the year.

C Finance costs
Finance costs on long term debt, that supports the capital
structure of the Group, decreased by 3% to R601 million in 2018
(FY 2017: R622 million). Finance costs related to subordinated
debt instruments issued by Old Mutual Insure in November
2017, to the nominal value of R500 million were incurred for
the full period contributing to an increase in finance costs. Fair
value gains earned on interest rate swaps more than offset the
increase in finance costs during the period.

D Income from associates
After the completion of the Nedbank unbundling, effective
15 October 2018, the Group retained a minority shareholding
of 19.9% in Nedbank in its shareholder funds. Nedbank is
managed as part of Other Group Activities and it has been
included on this basis in AHE. An odd-lot offer was executed
by Nedbank on 21 December 2018 which increased the
Group's shareholding to 20.2%. Income from associates, as
reflected in AHE, increased by 13% to R2,593 million (FY 2017:
R2,305 million) as Ecobank Transnational Incorporated
(ETI) returned to profitability which had a positive impact
on Nedbank's headline earnings. Our investment in China,
which is also reported in income from associates generated
a loss of R88 million (FY 2017: R41 million loss).

(1) IFRS does not allow the recognition of investment returns on Group debt and equity instruments held by life policyholder funds, however, these returns are
    recognised in the valuation of the related policyholder liabilities. This creates a mismatch in IFRS, which is eliminated in AHE. The movement is a function of the
    fair value movement for the period.

(2) Represents the elimination of non-recurring expenses or income related to material acquisitions, disposals or a fundamental restructuring of the Group. These
    items are removed from AHE as they do not represent operating activities of the Group. Amounts in the current period largely reflect the accelerated vesting
    of the IFRS 2 charge as a result of the share for share exchange and the distribution of Nedbank and Quilter shares. Current and comparative period includes
    Managed Separation costs.

(3) AHE includes associate income in respect of 19.9% shareholding in Nedbank for the full period as if the unbundling took place on 1 January 2018. Earnings for 9.5 months
    are removed as part of this reconciliation as the associate earnings for the 2.5 months post unbundling is included in the IFRS results.

(4) The majority of the profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments relates to the profit on distribution of Quilter and Nedbank,

A Discontinued operations

Nedbank
Nedbank delivered a resilient financial performance with
Headline Earnings of R13.5 billion, an increase of 14%, assisted
by the ongoing turnaround in the share of associate income
from ETI. Strong performance was further supported by
accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year
partially offset by a gradual increase in impairments.

Nedbank was classified as held for distribution and
presented as part of discontinued operations up to the date
of unbundling, effective 15 October 2018. We subsequently
ceased to consolidate Nedbank in our financial results and
have equity accounted our retained stake, in shareholder
funds, as an associated undertaking. The retained portion of
Nedbank shares was recorded at the market value prevailing
on the effective date of unbundling. An IFRS profit of
R19,152 million was recognised as a result of the transaction.

Latin America
Profits of our businesses in Latin America increased to
R318 million (FY17: R7 million loss). We saw continued
good profits as a result of the growth in pension offerings
in Colombia and higher asset based fees in Mexico, and
good expense management. AIVA profits also grew
following reduction in expenses and growth in Funds under
Management.

The sale of our businesses in Latin America is subject to
required regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions.
All required regulatory approvals have been received. As the
date of this announcement, the sale of businesses in Latin
America remains on track to be completed in the first half
of 2019.

Quilter
As a result of applying predecessor accounting our results
for 2018 includes profit generated by Quilter up to its listing
on 25 June 2018. Quilter's contribution to the Group's profit
from discontinued operations, in addition to the profit on
distribution, was R1,275 million (FY 2017: R1,451 million).
Refer to Note G5 in the condensed consolidated financial
statements for additional information on discontinued
operations.

Old Mutual Bermuda
Old Mutual Bermuda was deregistered as an insurer with the
Bermuda Monetary Authority in October 2018 subsequent
to all of the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulations Benefit
(GMAB) reinsurance obligations maturing. Old Mutual
Bermuda contributed R34 million to the Group's profit,
reflecting favourable developments in the run-off of the
book during 2018. The liquidation provision established at
the end of December 2017 has been sufficient to cover all
operational losses incurred during 2018.

B Residual plc
The loss in Residual plc reduced by 52% to R2,349 million
largely due to lower finance costs incurred during 2018. The
purchase of remaining debt securities, at a lower premium
than that in 2017 when previous tranches of debt securities
were repurchased contributed towards lower finance costs in
2018. Higher advisory costs were incurred given the heightened
activity leading up to the listing of both Old Mutual Limited
and Quilter in the first half of 2018. Other income increased
following the release of a deferred tax provision.

IFRS PROFIT AFTER TAX
Profit after tax increased by more than 100% from the prior period largely due the distribution and sale of Quilter shares
and the unbundling of Nedbank shares resulting in the recognition of a profit of R23,175 million in the consolidated results.
Included within this profit is a loss on the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves of R1,352 million.

(1)  Fungibility restriction represents the free surplus generated in Zimbabwe which cannot be remitted.

Operating segments generated gross free surplus of
R8,912  million, representing 101% of AHE, demonstrating
the high level of cash earnings generated by our businesses.
After allowing for capital requirements the free surplus
conversion decreases to 72% of AHE, compared to 82% in
the prior period. The increase in capital requirements
reflects an increase in capital requirements in our Banking
and Lending business in line with the increase in Loans and
Advances. We also increased the levels of capital held in
our Life and Savings businesses during 2018. This increase
in capital held at subsidiary level is to ensure that each of
our operating subsidiaries has appropriate levels of capital
where the risks are managed. In the prior year the amount
of capital required benefitted from a release of capital
related to the Property and Casualty business as a result
of the transition to the Prudential Standards. Nedbank
generates free surplus of 50% of AHE, which is in line with
their dividend policy of 1.75 - 2.25x covered by Headline Earnings. Cash
generated by our business in Zimbabwe is not recognised in
our free surplus measure as it is not fungible. The lower cash
conversion rate of Nedbank earnings and the fungibility
restriction in respect of Zimbabwe earnings reduces the
overall group free surplus generation to 57% of AHE.

Capital management
We actively manage the supply and demand of the
Group's capital to maximise shareholder value, within
our risk appetite. In achieving this objective, we balance
the requirements of key stakeholders including investors,
regulators and our customers.

In terms of the supply of capital, we manage debt and equity
levels to minimise the weighted average cost of capital,
within our risk appetite, which allows the Group to maintain
strong interest coverage and an acceptable leverage ratio
post a moderate stress event. Our target gearing ratio is in
the range of 15% to 20%.

In term of capital demand, RoNAV serves as the Group's key
capital efficiency measure for directing capital investments.
We aim to maximize shareholder value by deploying capital
to entities and initiatives that are able to deliver a RoNAV that
supports the Group achieving its target of cost of equity +4%.

The Group has an optimal solvency capital coverage ratio
target of 155% - 175%. The range has been set to ensure
that we maintain a strong balance sheet to protect
policyholders whilst returning excess capital to shareholders.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had a capital coverage of
170% which is within the target ratio.

All material entities within the Group have solvency capital
coverage targets to ensure that appropriate capital is held
where risks are managed. The risk appetite and requirements
of relevant regulators, customers and other key stakeholders
are considered when determining the level of capital that is
required for the relevant entities.

We target a dividend cover, based on AHE, of 1.75x to 2.25x.
When determining the appropriateness of a dividend, we
consider the underlying cash generated from operations,
fungibility of earnings, targeted liquidity and solvency levels
as well as the Group's strategy.

On 21 February 2019, Standard & Poor's (S&P) affirmed a
South African National Scale Rating of zaAAA for OMLACSA
and zaAA- for its subordinated debt. Further to this, S&P
upgraded the capital and earnings strength rating of
OMLACSA due to continued improvement in OMLACSA's
capital adequacy and management.

A Residual plc
Old Mutual Bermuda has completed its run off process, with
the last reinsurance obligations maturing in August 2018.
Old Mutual Bermuda has been deregistered as an insurer
with the Bermuda Monetary Authority in October 2018, and
surplus capital of R389 million ($27 million) was repatriated
to Old Mutual plc. This brings the total capital repatriated
during 2018 from Old Mutual Bermuda to Old Mutual plc
to R2,127 million ($167 million). The remainder of the surplus
capital is expected to be repatriated following the ultimate
closure and final dissolution of the business during early 2019.

Following the listing of Old Mutual Limited, Old Mutual plc
(which was re-registered as a Private Company Limited in
February 2019 under the name of OM Residual UK Limited) is
now a wholly owned, non-operating subsidiary of the Group.
The decrease in net asset value of 68% to R4.9 billion at 31
December 2018 (R15.1 billion at 31 December 2017) is largely
due to the payment of dividends of R4,681 million to Old
Mutual Limited in the second half of the year. The settlement
of certain intercompany loans between Old Mutual plc and
Quilter in anticipation of the listing of Quilter had a negative
impact on net asset value. This decrease was offset by the
cash proceeds received by Old Mutual plc following the sale
offer of 9.6% of Quilter shares to new shareholders.

During 2018, Old Mutual plc settled the final transaction
and advisory costs incurred to execute Managed Separation.
Certain corporate costs continue to be incurred until the
head office wind down is completed. These costs remain in
line with previous guidance.

The realisable economic value of Residual plc at
December 2018 is estimated at R4,052 million (GBP221 million),
a decrease of R3,634 million (GBP203 million) from June 2018.
This decrease is largely due to the dividends paid to Old
Mutual Limited partially offset by a release of R979 million
(GBP54 million) of surplus following the settlement of debt.

Further dividends to Old Mutual Limited will remain subject
to inter alia, the undertaking to the UK Court as described in
the announcement dated 20 June 2018 in respect of Old
Mutual plc. The UK court scheme allows for reviews of the
surplus assets on a quarterly basis that commenced on
1 October 2018. Any potential transfer will need to take
into account the developments and future assessments
by the board of OM Residual UK Limited, at such a point in time,
of liabilities and contingent liabilities and in line with its
fiduciary duties. The final development of economic value
and surplus assets is subject to changes in estimates and
uncertainty.

B RoNAV
RoNAV decreased by 430 bps to 18.6% (FY 2017: 22.9%).
The change in functional currency of Zimbabwe negatively
impacted RoNAV by 150 bps.

RoNAV in South Africa decreased by 320 bps to 17.8%
(FY 2017: 21.0%). AHE attributable to South Africa reduced
by 5% due to reduced investment income and lower
profit in Personal Finance. The increase in average equity of 12%
was a result of the dividend received from Residual plc of
R4,681 million (GBP255 million) and retained profits partially
offset by dividends paid to external shareholders and the
impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments which results in
higher day one provisions for expected credit losses.

RoNAV in Rest of Africa decreased by 910 bps to 22.0%
(FY 2017: 31.1%). Before the application of the functional
currency change for Zimbabwe, RFO for Rest of Africa
increased by R396 million or 37% in 2018 as a result of strong
operational performance. AHE for Rest of Africa increased by
R603 million or 18% mainly due to an increase in shareholder
investment return from strong equity market performance
in Zimbabwe albeit lower than in the second half of 2017.
The increase in operating profits and the weakening of the
Rand against the Kenyan Shilling were the main drivers of an
increase in average Adjusted IFRS equity of 24% (before
functional currency change).

Reported AHE for Rest of Africa decreased by 29% with
a corresponding decline in average Adjusted IFRS equity
of 1% mainly due to the change in functional currency
change that resulted in the translation of Zimbabwe results
at the RTGS rate.

C Invested Shareholder Assets
Invested shareholder assets decreased by 6% to R34.5 billion
(FY 2017: R36.6 billion). The asset base in South Africa saw a
R1 billion or 5% increase over the period, mostly due to net
increase in cash reflecting profits earned less dividends paid
out and continued positive shareholder investment returns.

Despite strong shareholder investment return generated
in Zimbabwe during the period which increased the asset
base, there was a decrease of R3.1 billion or 22% in Rest of
Africa. This was largely a result of the change in functional
currency in Zimbabwe which resulted in the translation of
shareholder asset balances at the RTGS rate.

For the listed equities held in South Africa we aim to
limit capital losses through the use of hedges. The impact
of weak equity markets in 2018 was reduced due to our
hedging strategy. The hedging strategy is executed in the
form of a zero-cost collar where the downside is limited to
5% - 15% whilst capping the upside.

D Gearing
Gearing ratios as calculated for the Group exclude the
equity and debt relating to non-core and assets held for
sale and distribution. The gearing ratio decreased by 50 bps
in 2018 mainly due an increase of R2,698 million or 6% in
equity attributable to operating segments. The increase is
largely a result of a dividend of R4,681 million (GBP255 million)
received from Residual plc in addition to operating profits.

This was partially offset by higher dividends paid to external
shareholders, considering the special dividend of 100 cents
per share, and the impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments
which results in higher day one provisions for expected
credit losses. Interest cover decreased to 25.7 times (FY 2017:
28.3 times) mainly as a result of a decrease of 11% in AHE
from the prior period.

EMBEDDED VALUE
The table below sets out the components of embedded value.

Embedded Value              66,398    63,661           4%   
Return on Embedded value     12.6%     14.1%    (150 bps)   

The return on embedded value remained strong at 12.6%,
despite a decrease of 150 bps from 14.1% for FY 2017.
Operating EV earnings decreased by 3% to R7,990 million
(FY 2017: R8,244 million) mainly due to a less profitable mix
of new business sold in Rest of Africa during the year and
lower positive assumption changes when compared to the
prior period.

Positive experience variances, which increased by R253 million
compared to the prior period, coupled with improved
expense variances had a positive impact on Operating EV
earnings. This was partially offset by worse claims experience
in Personal Finance. Persistency experience improved during
the year, but remained negative reflecting the continued
challenges created by the macro environment. Overall claims
experience was positive despite the unfavourable experience
in Personal Finance. Poor group disability experience in
Old Mutual Corporate with some improvement during the
period. Recurring expenses remained lower than assumed,
reflecting continued progress in achieving our cost efficiency
targets across the business. Investment returns on equities
were significantly lower than in 2017, resulting in a negative
investment variances compared to positive variances in the
prior year.

(1)  FY 2017 amounts have been represented to exclude the use of the iterative risk margin approach in calculating solvency capital requirements.

The Insurance Act came into effect on 1 July 2018 and to
date we have not yet been designated as an Insurance
Group. For OMLACSA we have presented our best estimate
of the solvency ratio based on approvals received from the
Prudential Authority to date. The Group solvency ratio is
presented consistent with the disclosure in the pre-listing
statement, except for the use of the iterative risk margin
approach in calculating solvency capital requirements. 

The increase of the Group solvency ratio to 170% at
December  2018, was largely due the remittance of
dividends from Old Mutual plc to Old Mutual Limited and
the change in the functional currency in Zimbabwe. The
change in the functional currency for Zimbabwe reduces
its contribution to the Group, increasing the solvency ratio.

Own Funds of Zimbabwe are deemed non-fungible, and
therefore only an amount equal to its Solvency Capital
Requirement is taken into account for the Group solvency
ratio. As at 31 December 2018, the Group was and is
expected to remain financially sound on a regulatory basis
for the foreseeable future.

DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS 
The Board of directors has approved and declared a final dividend of 72 cents per ordinary share.
The final dividend of 72 cents per share, results in a full dividend cover of 2.04 for the 2018 year which is in line with
Old Mutual Limited's dividend cover target of 1.75x to 2.25x. The final dividend will be paid out of distributable reserves
and is payable on 29 April 2019 to all ordinary shareholders recorded on the record date. The dividend of 72 cents
per ordinary share will be subject to a local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net final dividend, to those
shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 57.6 cents per ordinary share. International shareholders
who are not exempt or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation agreement will be subject to
dividend withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be paid in the local currency
equivalents of the final dividend. In Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe these distributions will be made through dividend
access trust or similar arrangements established in each country and will not be subject to South African withholding tax.

Old Mutual Limited's income tax number is 9267358233. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share
register at the date of declaration is 4,942,048,355.

SHARE REPURCHASE 
Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited (""OML"" or ""the Company"") intends to commence a share repurchase
programme of the Company's ordinary shares up to a maximum consideration of R2.0 billion. The repurchase of OML
shares will take place on both the Johannesburg and London Stock Exchanges during the period 12 March 2019 until the
next annual general meeting (""AGM"") of the Company on 24 May 2019. The share repurchase programme will be effected
in accordance with the General Authority received by way of a shareholder resolution passed at the AGM, held on 6 March
2018, allowing the Company to repurchase up to 247 102 418 ordinary shares, equivalent to 5% of the issued share capital
of the Company. OML has received approval from the Prudential Authority for the share repurchase programme.

The OML Board believes that OML is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and is of the view that a share repurchase
programme will deliver longer term incremental value to shareholders. The management team remains committed to
following a disciplined trading approach under the share repurchase programme and will only repurchase shares to the
extent that market conditions are favourable. The purpose of the repurchase programme is to reduce the share capital
of the Company.

SEGMENT REVIEWS

MASS AND FOUNDATION CLUSTER REVIEW

DEFEND AND GROW OUR SHARE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN MASS MARKET

We maintained our leading position in the mass market despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and
increased competitor activity in our market. Consumers remain under pressure with high unemployment rates, VAT
and fuel price increases through 2018 contributing to lower disposable income.

We opened 25 new branches in 2018 increasing our total retail branch network to 348. Improved sales force productivity
has translated into strong life and loan sales growth, even though challenging market conditions persisted in H2 2018.
Old Mutual Money Account remains one of the most competitive transactional solutions in the South African market.
We have opened 1 million Money Accounts since inception of which 0.4 million were during 2018. The number of
active accounts increased by 67% in 2018 with nearly a quarter of accounts opened to date being active. We have
made continuous process improvements to pay funeral claims faster, which led to an improved customer experience.
We have reduced pay out times of qualifying funeral claims from 24 hours to less than 8 hours. Claims initiated via the
Money Account app and call centre are typically paid within 4 hours.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows increased by 14% to R13,700 million due to
strong life sales and annual premium increases on in-force
book, combined with good growth in savings flows into
Money Accounts. Life APE sales of R4,579 million showed
strong growth of 12%, despite the expected moderation
that took place in H2 2018 due to continued pressure on
the consumer. The increase in life sales is largely due to
growth in adviser headcount and productivity, premium
increases and higher credit life sales off the back of growth
in loans disbursed, which contributed to a R0.4 billion or
7% increase in NCCF to R6.5 billion. The retail branch
network contributed 30% of Life APE sales and continues to
deliver better persistency and productivity experience than
other distribution channels.

Gross loans and advances increased by 37% to R16,518 million.
Process enhancements in terms of customer take-on
increased consultant productivity and we deployed a more
risk sensitive scorecard that aligned the market offering in
terms of loan size and term to the risk profile of our customer
base. This allowed us to better compete, and achieve
significant growth, in lower risk scored customers while
keeping overall loan approval rates consistent with prior
years. After taking into account growth in disbursements in
2018, we still have less than 10% of the unsecured lending
market and we see opportunities for further market share
growth.

The net lending margin of 13.7% decreased by 250 bps in
line with expectations as good credit experience was offset
by higher financing charges resulting from the growth in
our book.

RFO of R3,129 million marginally increased by 3% with flat
Life and Savings profits and 29% growth in Banking and
Lending profits. Life and Savings profits were affected by a
12% reduction in credit life profits following price cuts for
lower risk rated customers giving better customer value
for money. The remainder of Life and Savings profits were
impacted by positive growth in the book and good cost
management which was partially offset by less positive year
end assumption changes and lower new business profits.
Banking and Lending profits mostly benefited from the
decrease in amortisation of acquired intangibles related
to Old Mutual Finance compared to 2017. The provision for
loans disbursed following the implementation of IFRS 9 -
Financial Instruments was R90 million higher than it would
have been under the previous applicable IFRS standard. This
was more than offset by the unwind of R214 million of the
day one transitional adjustment provision recorded in equity
as a result of excellent collections experience and improved
behavioural scores during 2018. The current year provision
release is in line with a prior year release that related to the
alignment of provisioning models to payment behaviour in
anticipation of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments.

The credit loss ratio of 5.9% was 90 bps worse than 2017,
mainly due to a decrease in the collections experience of
previously written off bad debts and is influenced by both
the size and the pace of growth of the loan book. The ratio
remains well within our expected range. Whilst we plan to
grow our market share, the pace of growth could moderate
in future periods.

VNB of R1,222 million decreased by 1% but remains healthy
at a margin of 10.3% despite the decrease of 30 bps during
the year. This is due to the margin mix of risk products sold
during the period driven by sales promotions. An increase
in the portion of debit order sales versus payroll deduction
further negatively impacted VNB.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

The start of the year is seasonally slow from a sales perspective with the added backdrop of a strained consumer
environment. High levels of competitor activity in our market means we will need to drive our business to maintain
our market position.

We will continue to grow our retail branch network and gradually add to the number of Old Mutual branded ATMs.
One Financial Plan, an advice enablement tool, is being rolled out to our tied agent force, further strengthening our
advice value proposition to customers. We remain vigilant on collections experience on both insurance and lending,
actively supporting customers during the tougher economic times. We will do this by highlighting appropriate
features in our product solutions, like premium holidays and premium cashback benefits, and promoting our
affordable transactional account with fully accessible savings functionality.

PERSONAL FINANCE REVIEW

DEFEND AND GROW IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN PERSONAL FINANCE MARKET

Consumer confidence remained subdued in the second half of the year due to a continued weak economic
environment. Lower than inflation average salary increases and VAT and fuel price increases have had an adverse
impact on consumer disposable income, customer acquisition and retention especially in the middle income market.
Intense competition remains a characteristic of this market.

A number of management actions and initiatives were taken during 2018 to drive flows and sales in the tough
economic environment. These included the re-pricing of guaranteed annuity products and tactical improvements to
the pricing of disability and severe illness to improve competitiveness. We launched the Old Mutual Rewards loyalty
programme in an effort to strengthen our penetration in the middle income market. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we
extended our risk product proposition with the launch of Greenlight Sickness Benefits to support recurring risk sales.

Our distribution channels performed well, generating gross flows of R69.2 billion in 2018 with a contribution of
R37.2  billion to Wealth and Investments and R6.5 billion to Corporate. Good growth was seen in new digital channels 
with saving sales up 29%, and Life APE sales sold through iWYZE was up more than 300% albeit off a low base. 
Our adviser force in Old Mutual Finance branches grew by 67% to 315 advisers and we now have presence in over 181 
branches country wide. In line with our vision to become life time financial partners to our customers through 
meeting their core needs every day, we have been able to meet 3+ needs of 33.3% of our customer base. In the 
Black Middle Income group, a key growth market segment for us, nearly half of our customers have 3+ needs met with Old Mutual.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows increased by 5% to R26,165 million mainly
due to 9% increase in single premium sales and positive
growth in recurring flows across Life and Savings and Asset
Management businesses.

Despite improvement in mortality and morbidity claim
levels in the second half of the year, NCCF for the year was
adversely affected by poor claims experience and higher
disinvestments. Negative NCCF of R3.6 billion was recorded 
for the year, a decrease of R0.8 billion from the prior year. 
Legacy NCCF was recorded at negative R9.8 billion (R0.4 billion 
lower than the prior year) while NCCF related to new generation 
products was R6.2 billion, R0.4 billion lower than the prior year. 
NCCF outflows and the decline in the South African equity
markets contributed to a decrease of 6% in FUM to R181.4
billion at 31 December 2018.

Life APE sales grew modestly by 2% to R2,556 million
due to good growth in single premium savings sales and
guaranteed annuity sales due to improved pricing. Growth
was partially offset by slightly lower recurring premium sales
on savings and risk products reflecting pricing competition
in the market.

RFO of R2,021 million decreased by 36% when compared to
the prior period. Net positive reserve releases that occurred
in 2017 were not repeated and had a negative impact on
the year on year profit growth rate. Higher than expected
death and disability claims, with a number of larger death
claims which fell below the reinsurance threshold during
the first half of 2018 negatively impacted profit levels. Claims
experience was approximately R300 million higher than
expected as a result. Claims levels returned to expected
levels in the second half of the year. Several management
actions have been put in place in response to the negative    
claims experience including an analysis of causes of death,   
non-disclosure trends and a review of medical testing         
practices.
                                                   
VNB increased by 14% to R418 million mainly due to            
higher sales in annuity products at improved margin. This     
was partially offset by lower margin due to mix on other      
products which negatively impacted VNB. The VNB margin        
increased by 20 bps to 2.6%.                                  

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

Although we saw some good improvement in mortality experience in the second half of 2018 we will continue to monitor our
claims experience carefully during 2019. The actions we are taking in response to the mortality experience will only have
impacts on our financial results in the second half of 2019.

We expect a constrained environment for our customers if the challenging economic climate and political uncertainty
persists in South Africa. This may reduce their ability to make investment decisions and could therefore have an adverse
effect on our growth.

We are on track to launch a new protection proposition, a technology enabled advice model, in the first half of 2019. This
will provide enhanced product features and will simplify and digitise journeys for the intermediaries and customers to
improve overall customer experience.

WEALTH AND INVESTMENTS REVIEW

IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF WEALTH AND INVESTMENTS

We delivered a good set of results in the context of a challenging macroeconomic environment, declining equity
markets and high levels of competition. Strong retail NCCF was supported by an improved Wealth proposition and
solid investment performance in our core funds. This outcome demonstrates a strengthened market position in tough
industry conditions. The institutional flows in our Asset Management business held steady with marginally positive
NCCF, despite absorbing approximately R5 billion of net outflows relating to index funds that were internalised
by the relevant fund providers in line with industry trends. Record high transaction activity in Specialised Finance
and the benefit from our continued participation in South Africa's renewable energy sector through Alternatives
demonstrate the diversification benefits of our segment. Khaya Gobodo was appointed as Managing Director, effective
1 January 2019, succeeding Dave Macready who retired at the end of December 2018.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows of R89,214 million increased marginally by 1%
due to strong sales in Old Mutual International and the
retail Wealth platform, partially offset by lower institutional
inflows to Asset Management. Positive NCCF of R10.8
billion was supported by strong flows into the retail Wealth
platform, up 35% from prior year, and good flows in the
institutional Asset Management business resulting from
improved investment performance. Outflows were higher
due to mandate terminations by certain multi-managers
following their decision to internalise indexation capabilities
and asset realisations in Alternatives. AUM was slightly
down from the prior year, with the positive impact of strong
retail and institutional inflows offset by outflows in the form
of asset realisations, and weak equity market performance
during 2018.

Total revenue increased by 3% to R5,013 million. Annuity       
revenue increased by 3% compared to the prior period           
supported by an increase in average AUM compared to the        
prior period despite closing AuM ending 2% lower than          
2017. This growth was pleasing in an environment which         
exhibited some margin compression, primarily in the retail     
business. Non-annuity revenue has been at exceptional          
levels in 2017 and 2018. For 2018, development fees earned     
on renewable energy investments in Alternatives and            
strong gains in the credit portfolio of Specialised Finance    
combined with origination income contributed to non-           
annuity revenue. Non-annuity revenue is down 3% as result      
of high non-recurring investment returns in the Alternatives   
boutique in the prior period.                                  

RFO was R1,611 million, an increase of 8% from the prior
year. The increase is largely attributable to acquisition-
related intangibles being fully amortised in 2017 and higher
asset based fees on the 7% higher average AUM during the
period. The diversified asset base of the Wealth and Asset
Management businesses, which include bonds, cash and
offshore equities, supported growth in RFO.

RFO for the Wealth and Asset Management business
increased by 3% compared to 2017. The diversified nature of
assets it manages mitigated the impact of poor performance
of South African equities. However, the industry margin
pressure, primarily in the retail space resulted in some drag
on the earnings growth.

Our Alternatives business had an exceptionally strong year
in RFO, up by 89% from 2017 due to high non-annuity
revenue, largely contributed by development fees in the
unlisted infrastructure space. The goodwill amortisation
in 2017 was not repeated in 2018 and contributed to the
increase in RFO. Annuity fee income held up well during
the year in line with average AUM, despite closing AUM
ending slightly lower at year end as a result of distributing
value to investors through asset realisations in one of the
infrastructure funds.

The Specialised Finance business performed well during
2018 benefitting from higher asset origination levels. The
quality of the balance sheet portfolio reduced the impact of
market wide credit spread contraction. The RFO decreased
by 8% largely due to increased funding cost as a result of
the implementation of a revised Group funding approach.

Our core funds continue to show strong investment
performance. Retail funds performed well with 75% of
core funds above median over three years and 88% over
five years. Institutional funds also performed well with
75% of core funds above median over three and five years.
Our multi-asset funds performed strongly in 2018 with all
eight core retail and institutional offerings above median
over 3 years. The Flexible Fund remains top quartile over
three and five years with our flagship retail Balanced Fund
top quartile over three years. All four core retail multi-asset
funds are 4* Morning star rated.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

During 2018, our business generated high levels of annuity revenue that contributed 90% of the total revenues.
In particular our Wealth and Asset Management businesses contributed 80% of the annuity revenue. The outlook
remains challenging for 2019 given increasing pressure on revenue margins in the industry, despite some recovery in
equity market levels during the early part of the year.

Our business is geared to equity market levels which are influenced by the broader economic environment and
investor confidence, We anticipate some challenges ahead with limited GDP growth forecast for the near term. The
Alternatives business, which is the biggest contributor to the non-annuity flows, is likely to experience limitations
around deal flow and fund raising if these conditions persist.

OLD MUTUAL CORPORATE REVIEW

DEFEND AND GROW OUR SHARE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN CORPORATE MARKET

After more than 50 years of delivering value to our customers, we are pleased that members of retirement funds can
continue to invest in our industry leading smoothed bonus investment offering subsequent to the introduction of the
new default investment portfolios regulations 37.

We continue to invest in improving the customer experience of the Old Mutual SuperFund umbrella with the launch
of a new self-service portal in 2018. The SuperFund umbrella continues to attract good flows from both converting
standalone schemes as well as customers moving from competitor umbrella funds. OMCC OnTrack is our new
consulting tool that measures the health of retirement outcomes at member level and promotes awareness of
retirement goals and planning. This will be a valuable tool to improve retirement outcomes.

Management actions undertaken to improve Group Risk underwriting experience gained good traction. These actions
included income protection re-pricing and the launch of the new Well4Work range of four flexible Group Income
Protection benefits that allow clients to tailor the desired balance between benefits and price. Management actions
continue to be taken to further improve Group Income Protection underwriting margins to expected long-term levels.

We continued to strengthen our industry profile and thought leadership credentials by winning in three categories
at the 2018 Imbasa Yegolide Awards. These awards recognise service providers in the employee benefits industry who
meet the needs and expectations of retirement fund members by delivering excellent service. In addition, the Institute
of Retirement Funds awarded Old Mutual Corporate with two best practice certificates for ""Financial Management
and Reporting"" and ""Stakeholder Engagement and Education"".

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows increased by 20% to R42,669 million due to
a combination of improved Life APE sales and strong
institutional multi-manager flows. Life APE sales achieved
growth of 15% to R3,133 million, despite a large recurring
premium SuperFund deal in the prior period, with good
growth across all major product lines except annuities.
Strong inflows from new mandates together with improved
termination experience contributed to a significant
improvement in NCCF of R9.1 billion to R2.0 billion. FUM of
R254.6 billion remained flat with the growth in NCCF being
more than offset by the impact of declining equity markets.

At R309 million, VNB grew by 22% largely as a result of sales
growth and a change in capital allocation across products
and segments to align with the new regulatory solvency
system. The VNB margin improved by 10 bps to 1.1%.

RFO of R1,703 million increased by 8% from the prior year
due to significantly improved Group Risk underwriting
experience, underpinned by lower Group Life Assurance
claims volumes and improved Group Income Protection
pricing. In addition, active management and a resolution of
risk exposures resulted in a net one off release of provisions
of approximately R85 million.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

We continue to invest in Old Mutual Superfund to improve customer experience and drive growth of the umbrella
offering. We have a good pipeline of deals we are working on. It is important to note there is a time lag between the
recognition of the recurring premium flow (in respect of future service contributions) and the single premium flow
in respect of the related asset transfer on these types of deals due to the section 14 transfer process. Management
actions continue to be taken to further improve Group Disability underwriting margins to expected long-term levels.
Earnings will continue to be impacted by market levels during 2019.

OLD MUTUAL INSURE REVIEW

CONTINUED TURNAROUND OF OLD MUTUAL INSURE

Old Mutual Insure reported a solid underwriting result for the year, through a deliberate focus on improved service to
brokers and disciplined underwriting. The absence of catastrophe events and improved weather conditions in South
Africa supported the result. In addition, claims cost control initiatives and the ongoing remediation of the large risk
pool have led to a reduction in attritional claims for intermediated businesses.

Organic growth continued to be muted by tough market conditions and slower than anticipated new business
volumes. Inorganic growth was targeted through a significant focus on building pipeline opportunities and specific
initiatives, including strategic partnerships with four underwriting manager agencies during 2018 to support our
diversification strategy. These partnerships are expected to contribute to growth in 2019.

We have made significant improvement in our digital service channels to continuously improve customer experience
during the claims process. The rollout of MyOMInsure, a digital platform for claims registration and scheduling
appointments with approved auto body repairers, is a key initiative in growing our digital business. We appointed
Garth Napier as Managing Director of Old Mutual Insure in October 2018. His focus will be on the reconstruction of the
portfolio and further improvement of the underwriting and claims processes.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross written premiums increased by 6% to R13,218 million
in challenging market conditions. The increase from the
prior year is a result of pricing increases and strategic
partnerships with underwriting manager agencies to
generate new business. Strong growth was delivered by
iWYZE, pursuing a profitable growth strategy that leverages
operational efficiencies, strategic partnerships and focused
marketing. CGIC reported good top line growth, despite the
low real annual GDP growth rate which is directly linked to
CGIC's GWP performance. This was partially offset by lower
growth in commercial and agriculture portfolios as a result
of specific remediation of the loss-making risk pool, tough
market conditions and the impact of weather conditions
delaying planting season for farmers.

RFO was R670 million, an increase of 28% compared to
2017, largely due to an improved underwriting margin,
as a result of improved claims process efficiencies, and
procurement optimisation, especially in the Personal lines
portfolio. Profit growth was also supported by the general
environment with a relatively benign claims environment
and with lower significant catastrophe losses. This was
partially offset by the cost of a financial liability relating to
strategic partnerships that was recognised for the first time
in 2018, and the increased cost of reinsurance following the
adverse large loss and catastrophe experience of 2017 in
South Africa.

The strong improvement in the net underwriting result in
2018 led to an improved net underwriting margin of 5.3%
which is at the upper end of the Group's target range of
between 4% and 6%. The insurance margin improved by
130 bps to 7.4% as a result of an increase of 60 bps in the
return on insurance funds due to an increase in interest
rates compared to the prior period.

We had exceptionally good claims experience in Personal
and Commercial lines in the first half of the year following
favourable weather conditions and no catastrophe claims.

Attritional losses and the volume of larger losses increased
during the second half of the year across all of our core
divisions in line with normal seasonality trends.

Personal lines reported an excellent underwriting profit for
the year of R320 million, an increase of 101%. This was a
result of a favourable claims experience in the market with
claims efficiencies across the division which led to lower
attritional losses. No significant catastrophe losses have
been reported in the period. Solid year to date results were
reported by iWYZE with a profit of R60 million, more than
100% increase from the R20 million in 2017, due to improved
claims management, a favourable claims environment and
benefits arising from a review of technical reserves.

The net underwriting result of the commercial lines portfolio
was negatively impacted by large fire claims reported
for the year, with a largely adverse experience in the last
quarter of the year. The agriculture portfolio was negatively
impacted by the adverse hail claims experience in the first
half of the year.

Both the Specialty division and CGIC took strain from
large claims reported during the period with losses mostly
incurred in CGIC's bonds portfolio, constituting only 2% of
the total CGIC book. The core trade credit business of CGIC,
however, delivered strong underwriting results in poor
economic conditions, well above results reported by peers
in the market. In the Specialty division, losses reported
in 2018 exceeded both the 13-year average as well as the
prior year.

Attritional losses across our core divisions reduced in 2018
when compared to 2017 and 2016. This was due to the
remediation performed on the large risk pool over a three
year period, improved weather conditions in South Africa
and claims process efficiencies implemented which has
started to have a noticeable positive impact on the overall
underwriting performance.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

Despite 2018 being a year characterised by a relatively benign claims environment, the economic climate remained
challenging for the short-term insurance industry. Continued low real annual GDP growth and volatility in the Rand
had a negative impact on policy unit growth as well as claims costs. The construction industry in particular has been
under pressure, with an increased number of businesses entering into business rescue arrangements.

We will continue to focus on first class service delivery, a modernised distribution strategy, product upgrades and the
continuous improvement or enhancement of our claims processes. We expect headwinds in 2019 if a normalised
claims environment returns, but remain confident in the delivery of 2019 targets.

REST OF AFRICA REVIEW

TURNAROUND EAST AFRICAN BUSINESS AND IMPROVE RETURNS
ACROSS THE REST OF AFRICA

During the first half of 2018 we completed a staff reorganisation to optimise staffing levels and eliminate duplication
across our East African businesses. This reorganisation was facilitated through the automation of several processes and
the merging of disparate IT systems within the business. The reorganisation cost approximately R70 million, which is
expected to drive ongoing savings despite the impact to profits in 2018. In our property business we have actively increased
occupancy levels across our portfolio of properties. Our Banking and Lending business has focused the majority of its
lending on lower risk loan portfolios and this had a positive impact on non-performing loans.

Southern Africa continues to be the key contributor to Rest of Africa results. The strong performance is despite the continued
recession in Namibia and the currency challenges faced in Zimbabwe. The continued US dollar shortages in Zimbabwe during
2018 has led to the increased use of electronic and plastic money through the Real Time Gross Settlement ('RTGS')
system. During February 2019, a trading mechanism for RTGS balance and bond notes with international currencies was
established, however before this, authorities maintained that the US dollars represented in the RTGS system were at a
1:1 exchange rate. We have estimated a RTGS: US dollar exchange rate of 3.3 to 1 by assessing various inputs that impact
inflation. The application of the change in functional currency has been applied prospectively in our financial results for
the 2018 reporting period. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated income statement of the Group, Zimbabwe results have been
translated at the average US dollar exchange rate for the period up to 30 September 2018 and at the estimated RTGS rate
for the remaining three months of the financial year. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position, 
Zimbabwe results have been translated at the RTGS rate.

In Nigeria, following the delayed Bancassurance license approval in May 2018, we now have a presence in 113 Ecobank
branches across the country. Our Property and Casualty business experienced significant oil and gas claims in the first half
of the year which adversely impacted underwriting results. Management actions have been taken in the second half of the
year to limit further exposure. We appointed a new Managing Director in West Africa in November 2018, who will focus on
developing an executable and credible business plan to support the capital that we deploy in the region.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Life and Savings RFO increased by 28% from the prior year
mainly driven by the reversal of a stamp duty provision raised
in the prior year and the securing of a large government group
life assurance (GLA) contract in Malawi. Zimbabwe and Malawi
delivered strong Life APE sales as a result of strategic focus on
growing retail sales through increased advisor productivity.
This was supported by improved expense performance in East
Afica. Asset Management RFO grew by 73% from the prior year
driven by higher fees on the back of growth in funds under
management in Zimbabwe and good inflows into money
market funds in Malawi. Banking and Lending RFO increased
by 8% due to good growth in loan books across our regions on
a lower risk portfolio driving higher non-interest income and
net interest income. Property and Casualty RFO decreased by
360% mainly due to significantly lower top line growth across
all regions, higher expenses and negative claims experience in
Zimbabwe, East and West Africa.

OUTLOOK FOR 2019

Elections are planned to take place in Namibia, Malawi, Botswana and Nigeria but we expect 2019 to be politically
stable. In Zimbabwe, monetary policy reforms are contributing to continued uncertainty whilst the peace deal signed
recently in South Sudan is expected to result in an improved economic environment. Despite challenging operating
conditions experienced in 2018, we believe the markets we operate in present attractive growth opportunities. Real
GDP growth is expected to be muted in our dominant Southern Africa markets as both Namibia and Zimbabwe face
economic headwinds. Strong GDP growth is expected in both our East and West African markets.

We have begun to see positive results from the continued turnaround of the East African businesses. We will continue
to drive profit growth predominantly through enhancing our customer value propositions in our Property and
Casualty business, expanding our Banking and Lending offerings and improving occupancy levels in the property
portfolio. In West Africa we will focus on the remediation of our business by right-sizing the cost base and growing
our business through strategic partnerships in these markets.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
The application of the change in functional currency has
been applied prospectively in our financial results for
the 2018 reporting period. As it relates to sales and profit
related KPIs, Zimbabwe results have been translated at
the average US dollar exchange rate for the period up to
30 September 2018 and at estimated RTGS rate for the
remaining three months of the financial year. As it relates to
balance sheet KPIs, Zimbabwe results have been translated
at the RTGS rate. The commentary below references amounts
before the functional currency change.

Gross flows improved by 10% to R19,021 million despite
the tough economic conditions in Namibia and the
currency crisis in Zimbabwe. There were good inflows into
money market funds and one-off flows secured in Malawi.
In Zimbabwe the increase in gross flows was due to higher
unit trust and asset management inflows from our existing
customer base and a one-off flow related to a property
mandate secured during the year. NCCF rose by more than
100% to R3.5 billion due to strong inflows into Money Market
Funds in Malawi and the non-repeat of large outflows of
R3.2 billion that occurred in the prior year due to a portfolio
rebalancing by SOEs in Namibia. In Zimbabwe, effective
management actions to improve retention of flows
combined with good claims experience contributed to the
improved NCCF.

Life APE sales decreased by 15% to R964 million primarily
driven by lower retail sales in Namibia where productivity
was impacted by the downturn in the economy and lower
credit life sales following regulatory changes. The lower APE
sales witnessed in Malawi were due to a material sale to the
Public Service Fund in 2017 of R227 million that was not
repeated in 2018. This adverse performance in Namibia and
Malawi was partially offset by higher retail sales driven by
good productivity in Zimbabwe.

Gross written premiums increased by 5% to R1,423 million,
driven by growth in Zimbabwe as a result of management
actions to acquire new business. Namibia experienced flat
growth due to tough economic conditions which led to
increased competitive pricing. This together with adverse
claims experience in Zimbabwe led to a decrease of 260 bps
in underwriting margin.

Loans and advances increased by 38% to R12,690 million
driven by strong growth in OMF Namibia as a result of access
to the government payroll which introduced a new market
segment and continued economic pressure on household
liquidity which has led to increased borrowing. The growth
in the CABS loan book is attributable to an increase in
new business and personal loans as the business seeks to
continue growing in lower risk markets. Despite the growth
in loans and advances in the tough economic climate, there
was an improvement in our non-performing loans.

RFO increased by 19% to R1,812 million largely due to
strong performance in Zimbabwe and Malawi. RFO for
Zimbabwe increased by 22% from the prior year due to
strong performance across all lines of businesses, except for
Property and Casualty due to higher claims and increased
operating expenses. Profits benefited from the quality of
the lending book in CABS and tight expense management.
Malawi contributed to RFO growth through improved life profits 
in group life assurance (GLA) driven by top line growth in the 
second half of year. Increased rental income due to improved occupancy 
rates and higher asset management fee income further contributed to 
profit growth. This was partially offset by lower profits in Namibia
as a result of weak revenue conditions in Life and Savings as
well as our Property and Casualty businesses.

VNB decreased by 45% to R184 million with a corresponding
decrease in VNB margin of 250 bps. This was mainly due to
a less profitable mix of new business sold during the year,
discount promotions on risk products and assumption
changes related to future terminations of the smoothed
bonus product in Namibia.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows decreased by 13% driven by a decline in asset
management flows and a slowdown in money market
inflows as yields became less attractive compared to other
cash deposit offerings. Life APE sales increased by 23%
to R123 million due to improved productivity in the retail
business and higher corporate business in Kenya. This was
partly offset by lower sales in Uganda and South Sudan from
lower productivity and a shrinking market as a result of the
civil conflict, respectively. NCCF decreased by 36% to R0.7
billion due to a significant decline in asset management
inflows despite lower withdrawals.

Gross written premiums decreased by 2% to R2,101 million.
This was due to increased competitor activity in Kenya and
Uganda that led to the loss of key accounts and tough
economic conditions. This lead to a 90 bps decrease in
underwriting margin.

Loans and advances increased by 30% to R2,704 million due
to a focused effort in Faulu to grow its lower risk loans through
payroll deductions which had a positive contribution to profit.
RFO of R11 million is significantly above prior year reflecting
the ongoing efforts of the East Africa turnaround strategy. This
improvement was despite the impact the staff reorganisation
of c. R70 million had on profit. Higher asset management
income earned on average FUM and improved property rental
income from higher occupancy rates in Kenya contributed
to improved RFO. This was partially offset by losses in our
Property and Casualty business due to constrained top line
growth and an adverse claims experience.

East Africa's negative VNB of R25 million reflects an
improvement of 34% compared to 2017. The increase is mainly
due to an increase in volumes of products sold with a better
margin mix. This has resulted in an improvement in the VNB
margin of 1 040 bps.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Gross flows increased by 13% to R317 million as a result of
a large one off flow related to the pension administration
business in Ghana in the second half of the year. Life APE
sales in Nigeria underperformed relative to the prior year
as a result of regulatory changes and lower credit life flows
as a result of the continued slowdown in the Banking
and Lending industry. The Life and Savings business
in Ghana faced challenges with the collections and
on boarding of Bancassurance customers.

Gross written premiums is 30% down due to a challenging
business environment. Lower business volumes in Nigeria
followed the caution in writing new business in the oil
and gas business as a result of poor industry wide claims
experience. This led to a significant decrease of 14 170 bps in
underwriting margin.

RFO decreased by 39% to a loss of R255 million from the
prior year mostly due to claims experience in the Property
and Casualty business as well as an increase in actuarial
reserving in the Life and Savings business.

Negative VNB of R47 million, a decrease of 47% from the
prior year is largely due to lower sales volumes in Nigeria
and Ghana. Lower sales in Nigeria is mainly a result of the
regulator's directive for improved pricing of risk products
in the corporate business. As a result the mix of new
business was weighted towards retail products which are
less profitable. This has resulted in a decrease in the VNB
margin of 920 bps.

REVIEWED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
In March 2016, Old Mutual plc announced that its board believed that the long term interests of Old Mutual plc
shareholders and other stakeholders would be best served by separating the four businesses then owned by the Old
Mutual plc Group from each other so that they could operate as fully independent businesses. These four businesses
were Old Mutual Emerging Markets, OM Asset Management plc (OMAM, now Brightsphere Investment Group),
Nedbank and Old Mutual Wealth (now Quilter plc). As at 31 December 2017, OMAM had already been separated from
the Old Mutual plc Group following a phased sell-down.

To effect the above strategy, referred to as Managed Separation, the following steps were executed during year
ended 31 December 2018:

-   The listing of Quilter plc on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the
    distribution of 86.6% of its total share capital to Old Mutual plc shareholders and the sale of up to 9.6% by way of
    a cash placing to institutional investors on 25 June 2018.

-   The formation and listing on the JSE (primary), LSE and the stock exchanges of Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe,
    of a new entity, being Old Mutual Limited on 26 June 2018. Immediately prior to the listing, Old Mutual Limited
    became the new holding company of Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries, which mainly comprised the remaining
    operating businesses namely Old Mutual Emerging Markets and Nedbank. The results and position of this new
    Group have been presented within this set of condensed consolidated financial statements (financial statements).
    More details on the basis of preparation and the comparative information presented in these financial statements
    has been presented in note A1.

-   The unbundling (in terms of South African law) of the issued share capital of Nedbank to shareholders of Old Mutual
    Limited, whilst retaining a minority interest of 19.9% in the shareholder funds on 15 October 2018. An odd lot offer
    was executed by Nedbank on 21 December 2018, which increased the Group's shareholding to 20.2%. Due to the
    close proximity to year end, the Group continued to equity account for its stake in Nedbank at 19.9%.

Further details on Managed Separation and the transactions that have occurred during the period are set out in note
A2. More information on the businesses classified as held for sale and distribution and as discontinued operations
is set out in note G5.

Independent auditors' review report on condensed
consolidated financial statements

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF OLD MUTUAL LIMITED
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Old Mutual Limited, contained in the accompanying
preliminary report set out on pages 57 to 112, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at
31 December 2018 and the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, condensed consolidated supplementary income statement, condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity
and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note A1 to
the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated financial statements. We conducted our review 
in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information 
performed by the independent auditor of the entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures,
primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical
procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

CONCLUSION
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements of Old Mutual Limited for the year ended 31 December 2018 are not prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in note A1 to
the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

(1) On 22 June 2018, Old Mutual plc reduced the nominal value of its ordinary share capital and cancelled its share premium accounts through the creation of          
    distributable reserves. As a result, R10,079 million and R19,557 million respectively was transferred to retained earnings. Refer to note A2 for more information.
(2) The available-for-sale reserve is no longer applicable from 1 January 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 9. Refer to note H for more information.             
(3) Included in the closing balance for other reserves is R442 million liability credit reserve on borrowed funds. The Group recognises fair value gains and losses   
    on the borrowed funds designated at fair value through profit or loss. The cumulative fair value gains and losses as a result of changes in the credit risk of the
    issued bonds are recognised in other comprehensive income and not in profit or loss. The balance of the total fair value gains and losses on these instruments
    is recognised in profit or loss.
(4) Transfers between reserves include R1,136 million transferred from the share-based payment reserve to retained earnings relating to Quilter as a result of the
    accelerated vesting of employee share schemes.
(5) As a result of the distribution and initial public offering of Old Mutual plc's entire shareholding in Quilter, merger reserves of R19,506 million were transferred to
    retained earnings.
(6) Distribution of the fair value of the investment in Nedbank not retained after unbundling. Refer to note A2 for more information.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2018

A:     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A1:    Basis of preparation

Old Mutual Limited (the Company) is a company incorporated in South Africa. On 25 June 2018, the Company became
the parent of Old Mutual plc through a share for share exchange, with the Company receiving the entire net asset value
of Old Mutual plc, the original parent company of the Old Mutual Group and its subsidiaries (mainly Old Mutual Emerging
Markets and Nedbank), in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares of the Company to the original shareholders of Old
Mutual plc. This was a reorganisation of the existing Group and, although there was a change in legal ownership, there was
no change in the economic substance of the reporting entity. Therefore the transaction was not a business combination as
defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and the condensed consolidated financial statements (financial statements) have
consequently been prepared as a continuation of the existing Group.

The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together 'the Group') and equity account the Group's interest in associates and joint ventures (other than those held by
investment-linked insurance funds which are accounted for as investments at fair value through profit or loss).

The financial statements comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2018,
condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed
consolidated supplementary income statement, condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2018 and explanatory notes. The financial statements
have been prepared under the supervision of C.G. Troskie CA(SA) (Chief Financial Officer) on the going concern basis, which
the directors believe is appropriate. The Directors of the Group take full responsibility for the preparation of this report. The
Group's independent auditors KPMG Inc. and Deloitte & Touche reviewed these financial statements and their unmodified
review conclusion is presented on page 56. The auditors' review report does not necessarily report on all of the information
contained in these reviewed preliminary annual results. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full
understanding of the nature of the auditors' engagement they should refer to the auditors' review report on page 56. Any
reference to future financial performance has not been reviewed by or reported on by the Group's auditors.

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for
preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008 of South Africa. The Listings Requirements
require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and
recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting
Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting
Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with
those applied in the preparation of the Group's 2017 consolidated financial statements, except for standards, amendments
to standards and interpretation adopted in the 2018 condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to note H for
more information.

Details for businesses classified as held for sale and distribution and as discontinued operations are set out in note G5.

Comparative information
Comparative information presented at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 within these financial statements has
been correctly extracted from the Group's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
(prior year financial statements), re-presented for businesses classified as discontinued operations during the year ended
31 December 2018, if appropriate, as described in note G5.

The prior year financial statements were prepared for the purposes of Group reporting in accordance with IFRS and
consolidate the financial information of Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries and equity accounts the interest in associated
undertakings and joint ventures (other than those held by investment-linked insurance funds and venture capital divisions
which are accounted for as investments at fair value through profit or loss), after converting it to rand. This is consistent
with the preparation of the Historical Financial Information of Old Mutual plc (HFI) as at and for the three years ended 31
December 2017 that was prepared solely for the inclusion in the Old Mutual Limited Prospectus and Pre Listing Statement
published on 20 April 2018.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of both the prior year financial statements and the HFI have been
applied consistently to all periods presented.

The information presented in the financial statements is equivalent to that presented in the HFI with the exception of the
condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity. In preparation of the Old Mutual Limited financial statements, in accordance
with IFRS, certain components of equity have been re-presented as at 1 January 2015. The Group believes that it is more
appropriate to reflect rand only components of equity at the historical rand rate as opposed to the exchange rate used at
1 January 2015, when converting Old Mutual plc balances from sterling to rand for the purposes of the HFI. The reserves
and related amounts impacted are reductions to the available for sale reserve (R503 million), property revaluation reserve
(R660 million) and share-based payment reserve (R1,001 million), with a corresponding increase of R2,164 million to retained
earnings. Overall, this re-presentation is a transfer between reserves and has no impact on the shareholders equity or non-
controlling interests of the Group.

Accounting policy elections
The following significant accounting policy elections have been made by the Group:

Financial instruments                                  The Group has elected to designate certain financial assets

Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions

The presentation currency of the Company and the Group is South African rand (ZAR). Transactions in foreign currencies
are converted into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at rates of
exchange ruling at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
stated at fair value are translated into the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values
were determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost
are converted into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the initial recognition of the asset
and liability and are not subsequently retranslated. Exchange gains and losses on the translation and settlement during
the period of foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss. Exchange differences for non-monetary
items are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of other comprehensive income when the changes in the fair value of
the non-monetary item are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, and in profit or loss
if the changes in fair value of the non-monetary item are recognised in profit or loss.

Changes in functional currency
The functional currency reflects the underlying transactions, events and conditions. As a result, a change in functional
currency is considered a rare event. Changes in functional currency are accounted for prospectively from the date of the
change. Assets and liabilities accounted for in the previous functional currency is translated into the new functional currency
at the spot exchange rate at the date of change. The impact of translating foreign currency balances is recognised in profit
or loss as a foreign exchange gain or loss. The translated amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities are considered as
the historical cost of these items.

Translation of foreign operations into the Group's presentation currency
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into the Group's
presentation currency, using the year-end exchange rates, and their income and expenses using the average exchange rates
for the year. Cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2015, being the effective date of the Group's conversion
to IFRS, were reset to zero. Other than in respect of cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2015, cumulative
unrealised gains or losses resulting from translation of functional currencies to the presentation currency are included as a
separate component of shareholders' equity. To the extent that these gains and losses are effectively hedged, the cumulative
effect of such gains and losses arising on the hedging instruments are also included in that component of shareholders'
equity. Upon the disposal of subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of exchange differences post 1 January 2015, deferred in
shareholders' equity, net of attributable amounts in relation to hedged net investments, is recognised in profit or loss.

Change in functional currency of Group entities in Zimbabwe
Entities in Zimbabwe have been operating in a multi-currency regime since the adoption of multiple currencies by
the Zimbabwean Government in 2009. The US dollar and South African rand were initially used the most, however,
over time the US dollar was designated as the functional and presentation currency for our businesses in Zimbabwe
entities. The continued dollar shortages experienced in Zimbabwe has led to the increased use of electronic and
plastic money through the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, giving rise to parallel market activities and
multiple pricing mechanisms where bond notes and RTGS balances have been trading at a discount to the official
US dollar exchange rate. The increased reliance on RTGS bank balances, which was introduced as a settlement
mechanism, effectively resulted in RTGS becoming a de facto currency.

On 1 October 2018, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) directed all banks to ring-fence Nostro foreign currency
accounts (FCAs) by separating them into two categories, namely Nostro FCAs and RTGS FCAs. Authorities maintained
that the US Dollar represented in the RTGS system was at a 1:1 exchange ratio, however, there was growing consensus
amongst market participants that the economic reality was different. In line with industry consensus on the matter,
this event and industry discussion that followed led to a change in functional currency to RTGS for our businesses
operating in Zimbabwe, with effect from 1 October 2018. The vast majority of premiums and fees from our customers
are received and settled in Bond Notes and RTGS.

On 20 February 2019 the reserve bank of Zimbabwe announced that the RTGS would be recognised as an official
currency and that an inter-bank foreign exchange market would be established to formalise trading in RTGS
balances with other currencies. For the purposes of 2018 reporting an RTGS US dollar exchange rate of 3.3 to 1 (RTGS
rate) has been estimated. The inputs considered in this estimate include the recent announcement to increase the
fuel price for those settling in RTGS, global relative fuel prices and the official inflation rate. Another observable input
taken into consideration was the premium at which the Old Mutual and PPC shares trade on the Zimbabwe stock
exchange versus The Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

The application of the change in functional currency has been applied prospectively in our financial results for the
period. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated income statement and cash flow statement of the Group. Results for our
businesses have been translated at the average US dollar exchange rate for the period up to 30 September 2018 and
at the estimated RTGS rate for the remaining three months of the financial year. For inclusion in the condensed consolidated 
statement of financial position, Zimbabwe results have been translated at the RTGS rate.

The table below summarises the exchange rates at which our businesses in Zimbabwe have been translated into
South African rand:

(2)   Calculated using the closing US dollar to rand exchange of R14.35 at 31 December 2018 divided by the RTGS rate of 3.3 to 1 US dollar.

Basis of preparation of Adjusted Headline Earnings and Adjusted Headline Earnings per share
Purpose of Adjusted Headline Earnings
Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is an alternative non-IFRS profit measure used alongside IFRS profit to assess performance
of the Group. It is calculated as headline earnings adjusted for items not reflective of the long-term economic performance
of the Group (note B4).

AHE is one of the key performance indicators by which operational performance is monitored and managed, and it is one
of a range of measures by which management performance and remuneration is assessed. In addition it is used in setting
the dividend to be paid to shareholders.

Due to the complexity introduced into IFRS profit by the transactions required to execute Managed Separation and the long-
term nature of the Group's operating businesses, management considers that AHE is an appropriate alternative basis by
which to assess the operating results of the Group and that it enhances the comparability and understanding of the financial
performance of the Group. AHE utilises headline earnings as defined by SAICA Circular 4/2018 as its base. Adjustments
applied to headline earnings in order to calculate AHE remove the impact of certain IFRS accounting treatments where
the asset treatment under IFRS is inconsistent with the measurement of the related policyholder liability, significant non-
recurring expenses or income specifically related to material acquisitions, disposals or fundamental restructuring (such as
Managed Separation), the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations and the results of Residual plc.

The Group Audit Committee regularly reviews the determination of AHE and the use of adjusting items to confirm that
it remains an appropriate basis on which to analyse the operating performance of the Group. The Committee assesses
refinements to the policy on a case-by-case basis, and seeks to minimise such changes in order to maintain consistency
over time.

Scope of businesses included in AHE
AHE includes the operating results of the Mass and Foundation Cluster, Personal Finance, Wealth and Investments, Old
Mutual Corporate, Old Mutual Insure, Rest of Africa and Other Group Activities segments. These are considered to be the
core continuing operations of the Group. Residual plc is considered to be non-core as it is not part of the Group's principal
operations due to the fact that it is in the process of winding down. Consequently it is removed from AHE. Refer to note B3
for more information.

The results of Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin American businesses, Old Mutual Bermuda and Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life
Insurance Limited are currently classified as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated income statement, and have
therefore been excluded in the determination of AHE to aid comparability between financial years. Refer to notes A2 and G5.

A2:     Significant corporate activity and business changes during the year
Transactions during the year required to implement Managed Separation

Reorganisation of the Group structure
The following transactions were effected during the year as part of the execution of Managed Separation:

-   On 6 March 2018, Old Mutual Limited was converted to a public company.

-   On 22 June 2018, Old Mutual plc reduced the nominal value of its ordinary share capital and cancelled its share
    premium account through the creation of distributable reserves in terms of a UK court sanctioned scheme. As a result,
    R10,079 million and R19,557 million respectively were transferred to retained earnings. On 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc
    reclassified certain of its existing ordinary shares into 'A-ordinary shares'. These A-ordinary shares were then cancelled
    and an equivalent number of new ordinary shares were issued to Old Mutual Limited, the new parent company of Old
    Mutual plc. On 25 June 2018, the ordinary shares that were not classified as A-ordinary shares were transferred to Old
    Mutual Limited. Following these transactions, Old Mutual plc became a wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual Limited.
    Consequently, Old Mutual plc is no longer listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Johannesburg Stock Exchange
    (JSE), Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) or Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE).

-   On 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc announced the closing of the initial public offering of 182.5 million shares, representing
    9.6% of the total issued share capital of Quilter at a price of 2,588 cents (145 pence) per share by way of primary listing
    of Quilter shares on the LSE and secondary listing on the JSE. Total net proceeds arising from this transaction, after
    underwriting and other transaction costs, were R4,206 million. Further, on 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc distributed
    R42,935 million, representing 86.6% of the total issued share capital of Quilter to the Old Mutual plc shareholders. The
    remaining 3.8% of the total issued share capital of Quilter is held by the Joint Share Ownership Plan (JSOP) Trustee on
    behalf of certain management and staff of Quilter.

-   A profit on the demerger of Quilter of R4,023 million has been recognised in profit or loss. This includes foreign currency
    translation gain recycled to profit or loss of R1,352 million. In addition, merger reserves of R19,506 million have been
    transferred to retained earnings.

-   Included in the initial public offering of 182.5 million shares, were 16.5 million shares that were subject to an over-allotment
    option. On 26 July 2018, 2.7 million of these shares were partially exercised by underwriters, raising cash proceeds of R66
    million (GBP3.8 million). On 21 August 2018, the remaining 13.8 million shares were sold, raising cash proceeds of R379 million
    (GBP20.5 million).

-   On 26 June 2018, Old Mutual Limited listed on the Main Board of the JSE with a standard listing on the LSE and
    secondary listings on the stock exchanges of Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

-   On 15 October 2018, the Group announced the completion of the unbundling of the majority of its shareholding in
    Nedbank Group Limited to its shareholders. Pursuant to the unbundling, each eligible shareholder received 3.21176
    Nedbank shares for every 100 Old Mutual Limited shares held on Friday 12 October 2018. As a consequence of the
    unbundling, the Group's stake in Nedbank's equity decreased from 54% (on an IFRS basis) to an equity accounted
    interest of 19.9% and a policyholder interest of 1.46% at fair value through profit or loss at 15 October 2018. In accordance
    with the criteria set out in IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', the Group no longer considered that it exercised
    control over the business from 15 October 2018. This resulted in Nedbank being deconsolidated from the Group financial
    statements and instead being equity accounted for as an associated undertaking. At the point of deconsolidation, the
    residual holding in Nedbank was revalued based on the market value prevailing at that time.

On 21 December 2018, an odd lot offer was executed by Nedbank, increasing the Group's shareholding to 20.2%. Due to the
close proximity to year end, the equity accounted earnings attributable to the Group's investment in Nedbank has been
included in the condensed consolidated income statement at an effective rate of 19.9%.

The total fair value of the deemed distribution of all Nedbank shares owned by the Group, net of transaction and underwriting
costs was R66,225 million. A profit of R19,152 million was realised as a result of the deemed distribution of Nedbank shares,
comprising the difference between the market value of all shares held by the Group, net of transaction costs (R66,225 million)
and the Group's share of the consolidated net asset value of Nedbank (R47,072 million) on 15 October 2018.

The fair value of the deemed distribution at 15 October 2018 comprised:

-   The fair value of the portion distributed to Old Mutual Limited shareholders of R38,867 million plus,

-   The fair value of the 19.90% retained interest of R24,376 million plus,

-   The fair value of the 1.46% policyholder interest of R1,762 million plus,

-   Transaction costs and the fair value of shares held by share trusts and investment funds of R1,220 million.

Following the Group reorganisation, Old Mutual Limited consists of the Group's operating segments (Mass and Foundation
Cluster, Personal Finance, Old Mutual Corporate, Wealth and Investments, Old Mutual Insure, Rest of Africa and Other Group
Activities), the Group's 20.2% holding in Nedbank and Residual plc.

Existing share-based payment arrangements

Following Managed Separation and the respective listings of Quilter and Old Mutual Limited, the ordinary shares held
by various employee share schemes of the Old Mutual plc Group have been replaced by the ordinary shares of Quilter,
Nedbank and Old Mutual Limited. The end result of the execution of the schemes was that for every three Old Mutual plc
shares held, employee shareholders received one ordinary share in Quilter and three ordinary shares in Old Mutual Limited.
Following the unbundling of Nedbank, each employee shareholder received 3.21176 Nedbank shares for every 100 Old
Mutual Limited shares held. This resulted in a modification of the underlying share awards as Quilter and Nedbank shares
became unrestricted in the hands of employees, subject to existing share-based payment arrangements of the Old Mutual
plc Group.

The distribution of Quilter and Nedbank shares to employee shareholders was a return of capital to shareholders and
therefore employees were no longer subject to any vesting conditions of the existing share-based payment arrangements.
As such it is viewed to be a partial settlement of the award which leads to an accelerated vesting of the IFRS 2 charge as it
relates to the Quilter and Nedbank portions of the original award.

The share for share exchange and the distribution of Quilter and Nedbank shares has led to an after tax accelerated vesting
charge of R354 million recognised in the condensed consolidated income statement. This charge has been removed in the
determination of AHE.

Disposals announced during the period but not yet completed

Disposal of the Latin American businesses

On 16 March 2018, the Group announced its agreement to sell the Latin American businesses, comprising OM Latin America
Holdco UK Limited and AIVA Holding Group S.A, to Lily Bermuda Capital Limited (SPV domiciled in Bermuda), owned by
CMIG International Holding Private Limited. The transaction is currently subject to usual regulatory approvals and customary
closing conditions. As at 31 December 2018, the sale of the Latin American businesses remains on track to be completed in
the first half of 2019. The use of proceeds from the sale, expected to be R4,412 million ($307.5 million), will be assessed as
part of the Group's Capital framework, taking into account our solvency capital position and projections at the time.

As a consequence of the agreed sale, the Latin American businesses have been classified as held for sale and consequently
as discontinued operations at 31 December 2018. Refer to note G5 for more information.

Other activities during the year

Lions Head Investments

On 23 May 2018, OMP Investment Company Proprietary Limited (OMP Investco), a subsidiary of Old Mutual Real Estate
Holding Company Proprietary Limited (OMREHC) purchased a controlling 60.81% stake in Lions Head Investments (LHI),
a property management company based in Bulgaria. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination in
accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. The purchase price paid for LHI amounted to R226 million (EUR15.5 million).
The net asset value for the stake purchased was R229 million (EUR15.7 million). Consequently a gain on bargain purchase of
R3 million (EUR0.2 million) has been recognised.

On 14 June 2018, OMP Investco, through LHI, also purchased 100% of the equity of Portland Trust Developments s.r.l (Portland
A&B/Oregon). The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business
Combinations'. The purchase price paid was R673 million (EUR45.8 million). The net asset value at the date of purchase was
R657 million (EUR44.7 million), resulting in goodwill of R16 million (EUR1.1 million) being recognised.

On 20 July 2018, OMP Investco, through LHI, also purchased 100% of the equity of Megapark OOD (Megapark). The transaction
has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. The purchase price
paid was R238 million (EUR15.1 million). The net asset value at the date of purchase was R176 million (EUR11.2 million), resulting in
goodwill of R62 million (EUR3.9 million) being recognised.

Total investment properties acquired as a result of these transactions amounted to R3,788 million (EUR252.4 million). These
investment properties form part of the Group's long term insurance policyholder investment portfolio, backing linked and
with-profit insurance and investment contracts.

A3:    Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The critical accounting estimates and judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and
the key sources of estimation uncertainty for the year ended 31 December 2018 were the same as those that applied to the
condensed consolidated financial statements of Old Mutual Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017, with the exception of new
critical accounting estimates detailed in note L arising from the changes in accounting policies.

In the current and prior years, the Group applied significant judgement in the classification of Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin
American businesses and Old Mutual Bermuda as discontinued operations and the Latin American businesses as assets and
liabilities held for sale and distribution.

These classifications did not have any valuation impact on the underlying assets and liabilities. Refer to note G5 for more
information.

B:     SEGMENT INFORMATION

B1:    Basis of segmentation

The execution of Managed Separation, as described in note A1 and note A2, constituted a reorganisation of the
previous Old Mutual plc Group, resulting in the formation of two new groups, Old Mutual Limited and Quilter. The executive
management team of Old Mutual Limited, with the support of the Board, was responsible for the assessment of performance
and the allocation of resources of the continuing business operations during the period under review. The reorganisation
resulted in a change in the composition of the Group's operating segments that is reported to the Chief Operating Decision
Maker (CODM), viewed to be the executive management team of Old Mutual Limited. As such, the new segment structure
has been reflected in the required disclosures in both the current year and comparative information.

The Group manages its business through the following operational segments, which are supported by central shareholder
activities and enabling functions.

-    Mass and Foundation Cluster: A retail segment that operates in Life and Savings, Banking and Lending. It provides
     simple financial services products to customers in the low-income and lower-middle income markets. These products are
     divided into four categories being (i) risk, including funeral cover, (ii) savings, (iii) lending and (iv) transactional products.

-    Personal Finance: A retail segment that operates primarily in Life and Savings. It provides holistic financial advice and
     long-term savings, investment, income and risk products and targets the middle-income market.

-    Wealth and Investments: Operates across Life and Savings and Asset Management through four distinct businesses:
     (i) Wealth, a retail segment targeting high income and high net worth individuals, that provides vertically integrated
     advice, investment solutions and funds, and other financial solutions, (ii) Asset Management comprising eight investment
     boutiques that provide asset management services to retirement and benefit funds and to the retail market in partnership
     with Wealth, (iii) Alternatives, an unlisted alternatives investment business, and (iv) Specialised Finance, a proprietary risk
     and investment capability which manages and supports the origination of assets.

-    Old Mutual Corporate: Operates in Life and Savings and primarily provides Group risk, investments, annuities and
     consulting services to employee-sponsored retirement and benefit funds.

-    Old Mutual Insure: Provides Property and Casualty insurance products through three operational businesses: (i) personal,

-    Rest of Africa: Operates in Life and Savings, Property and Casualty (including health insurance), Banking and Lending
     (including micro-lending) and Asset Management. The segment operates in 12 countries across three regions:
     Southern Africa, East Africa and West Africa.

-    Other Group Activities: Comprises the activities related to the management of the Group's capital structure. This
     includes the management of shareholder investment assets including the associated shareholder investment return and
     third-party borrowings including the associated finance costs. Also included are net assets and operations of Residual
     plc and investments in associated undertakings. Subsequent to the Nedbank unbundling, the Group retained a minority
     shareholding of 19.9%, managed as part of Other Group Activities.

Presentation and disclosure

Results from Operations measures the operational performance of the Group and together with items such as investment
return, finance costs and income from associated undertakings, the Group's profit measure, AHE is derived. AHE by definition
excludes discontinued operations and Residual plc, which do not form part of core continuing businesses of Group, and
certain of the discontinued operations are a function of the reorganisation and the application of predecessor accounting.

Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin American businesses, Kotak and Old Mutual Bermuda have been classified as discontinued
operations. In line with IFRS 8 par 28 (b), discontinued operations have been disclosed as a reconciling item between the
segment profit measure and total IFRS profit after tax of the Group.

The Group is in the process of a fundamental multi-year transformation of its finance function, transitioning from a legal
entity view to a segment approach to better reflect the balance sheet economics and levers to drive value.

B3:    Headline earnings adjusting items

Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is the Group's alternative profit measure used by management to assess the performance
of the Group. It is calculated as headline earnings in accordance with JSE Listing Requirements and SAICA circular 04/2018
adjusted for items not reflective of the long term economic performance of the Group. The adjustments from headline
earnings to AHE are explained below.

(a)    Investment return adjustment for Group equity and debt instruments held in policyholder funds

Represents the investment returns on policyholder investments in Group equity and debt instruments held by the Group's
policyholder funds. This include investments in the Company's ordinary shares and the subordinated debt and ordinary
shares issued by subsidiaries of the Group. These investment returns are eliminated within the condensed consolidated income
statement in arriving at profit before tax, but are added back in the calculation of AHE. This ensures consistency with the
measurement of the related policyholder liability.

(b)    Impact of restructuring

Represents the elimination of non-recurring expenses or income related to material acquisitions, disposals or a fundamental
restructuring of the Group (such as Managed Separation). This adjustment would therefore include items such as the costs
or income associated with completed acquisitions or disposals and the release of any acquisition date provisions. These
items are removed from AHE as they are not representative of the operating activity of the Group and by their nature they
are not expected to persist in the long term.

(c)    Discontinued operations

Represents the removal of the profit after tax associated with discontinued operations. These businesses are not considered
part of the Group's principal operations due to the fact they have been or are in the process of being sold or distributed and
therefore will not form part of the Group going forward. The profit attributable to these businesses is therefore removed
from AHE. For the year ended 31 December 2018 this adjustment includes the profit attributable to Quilter, Nedbank, the
Latin American businesses and Old Mutual Bermuda. For the year ended 31 December 2017, discontinued operations also
includes the profit related to Kotak.

(d)    Income from associated undertakings

Represents the reversal of any differences between the IFRS accounting treatment in respect of our shareholding in Nedbank
and the treatment applied in AHE. In AHE we account for the headline earnings related to 19.9% of Nedbank. This represents
our effective ownership held in the shareholder funds of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited post the
unbundling transaction which occurred on 15 October 2018. During December 2018 Nedbank completed an odd lot offer
which had the effect of increasing our effective ownership to 20.2%. This will have a marginal positive impact on earnings
reported in the 2019 financial year. In accordance with IFRS, the Nedbank shareholding of approximately 54% held until
the point of the unbundling transaction was classified as held for distribution and our related share of Nedbank's profits
presented as part of the discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated income statement until the point of unbundling. 
These earnings are therefore included in the adjustment labelled as discontinued operations. This adjustment ensures that these
earnings are not double counted in the reconciliation. Any difference between our share of Nedbank's headline earnings
reported as part of AHE and the share of associated undertakings profit after tax relating to Nedbank reported in our IFRS
income statement are also adjusted for in this line item.

(e)    Residual plc

Represents the elimination of the results of businesses or operations classified as non core. In the current and comparative
period this represents the net losses associated with the operations of Residual plc. Residual plc is not considered part of
the Group's principal operations due to the fact that it is in the process of winding down and therefore the associated costs
are removed from AHE. During the year ended 31 December 2018, the loss attributable to the Residual plc of R2,349 million
(2017: R4,918 million) mainly related to transaction costs associated with the finalisation of Managed Separation and costs
incurred in winding down the former Old Mutual plc head office operations.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders
of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding own shares held in
policyholder funds, Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts (ESOP) and Black Economic Empowerment trusts. These shares
are regarded as treasury shares.

(c)    Headline earnings per share

The Group is required to calculate headline earnings per share (HEPS) in accordance with the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) Listing Requirements, determined by reference to the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants'
circular 04/2018 'Headline Earnings'. The table below sets out a reconciliation of basic EPS and HEPS in accordance with that
circular. Disclosure of HEPS is not a requirement of IFRS, but it is a commonly used measure of earnings in South Africa. The
table below reconciles the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent to headline earnings and
summarises the calculation of basic HEPS:

holders on the branch registers of those countries (or, in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register)
are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.

The Directors have declared a final dividend of 72 cents per ordinary share. These dividends will be paid on 29 April 2019 to
shareholders on the South African register and Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe branch registers at the close of business on
29 April 2019 and to shareholders on the UK register at the close of business on 29 March 2019.

On 3 February 2017, all of the Group's outstanding perpetual preferred callable securities were redeemed. At this date a final

E:   FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Accounting policy

Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

IFRS 9: 'Financial Instruments' replaces the provisions of IAS 39: 'Financial instruments': Recognition and measurement'
that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial
assets and hedge accounting.

The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the
amounts recognised in the financial statements. The new accounting policies effective from 1 January 2018 are set
out below.

Initial recognition of financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:

-   Amortised cost;

-   Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) which may include debt or equity instruments; or

-   Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).

The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is based on whether the financial assets are equity instruments,
debt instruments held or derivative assets. The classification and measurement of debt instruments is dependent on
the business model in which the financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics.

The business model refers to how the Group is managing its financial instruments to generate cash flows. Business
model assessments are performed on shareholder and policyholder portfolios and consider investment mandates,
how the portfolios are being managed to generate cash flows and performance indicators. The Group first assess the
business model before considering whether an instrument meets the definition of the contractual cash flow test.
Only if the financial instruments are held in a business model to collect contractual cash flows or a business model
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, the cash flows
characteristics test is performed.

Equity instruments and derivative assets are mandatorily categorised as financial assets at FVTPL. Derivatives
embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are not accounted for
separately. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.

A debt instrument is classified as a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions (and
is not designated as at FVTPL):

-   it is held within a business model where the objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

-   its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
    on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets held in a 'hold to collect contractual cash flows business model' are managed to realise cash flows
by collecting contractual payments over the life of the instrument.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions (and is not designated as at
FVTPL):

-   it is held within a business model where the objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and
    selling financial assets; and

-   its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
    on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets held in this type of business model are managed to realise cash flows by both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling the financial instrument. Both these activities are fundamental to achieving the objective of
the business model.

On initial recognition of an equity instrument that is not held for trading, the instrument may be irrevocably
designated at FVOCI. In such an instance changes in the equity instrument's fair value are recorded in other
comprehensive income (OCI). This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

All debt instrument financial assets that were not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at
FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a debt instrument financial asset that otherwise
meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets are expensed in profit or loss for
financial assets initially classified at FVTPL. For financial assets not classified at FVTPL, transaction costs are added to
or deducted from the fair value at initial recognition.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets.

 Financial assets at FVTPL                          These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net fair value
                                                    gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are
                                                    recognised in profit or loss.

 Financial assets at amortised cost                 These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
                                                    the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
                                                    expected credit losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains
                                                    and losses and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
                                                    Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

 Debt investments at FVOCI                          These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest
                                                    income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign
                                                    exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in
                                                    profit or loss. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On
                                                    derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified
                                                    to profit or loss.

 Equity investments at FVOCI                        These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends
                                                    are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend
                                                    clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
                                                    Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never
                                                    reclassified to profit or loss.

Under IAS 39 the classification and measurement of financial assets were based on definitions set out in the
standard. By comparison the classification and measurement principles in IFRS 9 aim to result in accounting
treatment that mirrors how the financial assets are applied within the Group. Held to Maturity Financial Assets and
Available for Sale Financial Assets were not included in IFRS 9.

Initial recognition of financial liabilities

IFRS 9 largely retains the requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. On
initial recognition financial liabilities are measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of financial liabilities not
classified at FVTPL, transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial
liability. Transaction costs of financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
Fair value movements attributable to changes in the credit risk of a financial liability designated at FVTPL is recorded
in other comprehensive income and not recycled to profit or loss. The balance of the fair value movement is
recorded in profit or loss. Allocating fair value changes on these financial liabilities between profit or loss and other
comprehensive income was not required by IAS 39.

 Financial liabilities at amortised cost            These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost
                                                    using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign
                                                    currency exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
                                                    Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

 Financial liabilities at fair value through        These liabilities are subsequently measured at fair value. Net
 profit or loss                                     fair value gains and losses, including any interest expense are
                                                    recognised in profit or loss.

 Financial guarantee contracts                      Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the
                                                    higher of the expected credit loss allowance and the amount
                                                    initially recognised, less cumulative income recognised to date.
Expected credit losses

The expected credit loss (ECL) model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost (for example mandatory
reserve deposits with central banks, loans and advances, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and
debt securities held by the Group) and debt investments measured at FVOCI.

The ECL impairment loss allowance is an unbiased, probability-weighted amount determined by evaluating a range
of possible outcomes that reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or
effort of past events, current conditions and forecasts of forward-looking economic conditions.

The Group has elected to apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach in measuring expected credit losses for all trade
receivables, contract assets and lease receivables. In terms of the simplified approach the ECL provision is calculated
using lifetime expected credit losses. The Group made use of the provision matrix to calculate the lifetime expected
loss allowance.

The Group elected to make use of the low credit risk exemption and consequently financial assets that are deemed
of low credit risk are automatically allocated to stage 1 of the expected credit loss model. The consequence of this
simplification is that entities are not required to assess whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination
took place on these assets. At every reporting date the Group assesses whether the low credit risk exemption can
still be applied to the relevant financial instruments. A financial instrument is considered to qualify for the low credit
risk exemption if it has a credit rating equivalent to 'investment grade' quality assets.

ECLs are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the
Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted
at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

For presentation the ECL allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. ECLs are presented
separately in the condensed consolidated income statement.

In terms of IAS 39 impairment losses were calculated based on the incurred loss model. The incurred loss model considered
current and historical information to determine whether a loss has been incurred and to measure the impairment loss.
In comparison IFRS 9 places emphasis on the use of forward-looking information. The expected credit loss model should
result in impairment losses being recognised earlier when compared to the incurred loss model.

The analysis of financial assets and liabilities of the Group's continuing businesses into their categories as defined in
IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' is set out in the tables below. Assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial
assets and liabilities that are specifically excluded from the scope of IFRS 9, are reflected in the non-financial assets
and liabilities category. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 7.2.15 of IFRS 9 from restating
prior periods in respect of IFRS 9's classification and measurement (including impairment) requirements.

E1:    Categories of financial instruments

The analysis of financial assets and liabilities of the Group's continuing businesses into their categories as defined in IFRS 9
'Financial Instruments' is set out in the tables below. Assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial assets and
liabilities that are specifically excluded from the scope of IFRS 9, are reflected in the non-financial assets and liabilities
category. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 7.2.15 of IFRS 9 from restating prior periods in
respect of IFRS 9's classification and measurement (including impairment) requirements.

Information about the methods and assumptions used in determining fair value is included in note E2.

The following tables analyse financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instruments as
defined by IFRS 9 at 31 December 2018 and as defined by IAS 39 at 31 December 2017. Assets and liabilities outside the scope
of these standards are shown within non-financial assets liabilities.

E2:    Fair values of financial assets and liabilities

The description of the determination of fair value and the fair value hierarchies of financial assets and liabilities described in
this section applies to financial assets and liabilities for all the Group's businesses.

(a)    Determination of fair value

The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. In the event that the market for a financial asset or
liability is not active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, another valuation technique is used.

In general, the following inputs are taken into account when evaluating the fair value of financial instruments:

-     Assessing whether instruments are trading with sufficient frequency and volume, that they can be considered liquid.

-     The inclusion of a measure of the counterparties' non-performance risk in the fair-value measurement of loans and
      advances, which involves the modelling of dynamic credit spreads.

-     The inclusion of credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation adjustment in the fair-value measurement of derivative
      instruments.

-     The inclusion of own credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of financial liabilities.

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques applied when valuing financial instruments. The general
principles applied to those instruments measured at fair value are outlined below:

Reinsurers' share of policyholder liabilities

Reinsurers' share of policyholder liabilities are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions
held in respect of the related insurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts which cover financial risk are measured at fair value
of the underlying assets.

Loans and advances

Loans and advances include mortgage loans, other asset-based loans, including collateralised debt obligations, and other
secured and unsecured loans.

In the absence of an observable market for these instruments, the fair value is determined by using internally developed
models that are specific to the instrument and that incorporate all available observable inputs. These models involve
discounting the contractual cash flows by using a credit-adjusted zero-coupon rate.

Investments and securities

Investments and securities include government and government-guaranteed securities, listed and unlisted debt securities,
preference shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments (see below),
short-term funds and securities treated as investments, and certain other securities.

Pooled investments represent the Group's holdings of shares/units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual
funds and similar investment vehicles. Pooled investments are recognised at fair value. The fair values of pooled investments
are based on widely published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held
in the underlying pooled investment funds.

Other investments and securities that are recognised at fair value are measured at observable market prices where available.
In the absence of observable market prices, these investments and securities are fair valued utilising one or more of the
following techniques: discounted cash flows, the application of an EBITDA multiple or any other relevant technique.

Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures held by investment-linked insurance funds and
venture capital divisions

Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures are valued using appropriate valuation techniques. These
techniques may include price earnings multiples, discounted cash flows or the adjusted value of similar completed
transactions.

Derivative financial instruments

The fair value of derivatives is determined with reference to the exchange traded prices of the specific instruments. In
situations where the derivatives are traded over the counter the fair value of the instruments is determined by the utilisation
of option pricing models.

Investment contract liabilities

The fair value of the investment contract liabilities is determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying funds that
are held by the Group.

Third-party interests in consolidation of funds

Third-party interests in consolidation of funds are measured at the attributable net asset value of each fund.

Amounts owed to bank depositors

The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors correspond with the carrying amount shown in the condensed consolidated
statement of financial position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.

Borrowed funds

The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where
applicable, or by reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.

Other financial assets and liabilities

The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities (comprising cash and cash equivalents; cash with central banks; trade,
other receivables and other assets; and trade, other payables and other liabilities) reasonably approximate their carrying
amounts as included in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-priced to
current market rates frequently.

(b)    Fair value hierarchy

Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy.


 Description of hierarchy                                    Types of instruments classified in the respective levels

 Level 1 - quoted market prices: financial assets and        Listed equity securities, listed government securities and other
 liabilities with quoted prices for identical instruments    listed debt securities and similar instruments that are actively
 in active markets.                                          traded, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted
                                                             derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds, reinsurers'
                                                             share of policyholder liabilities and investment contract
                                                             liabilities directly linked to other Level 1 financial assets.

 Level 2 - valuation techniques using observable inputs:     Unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is
 financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for     based on models involving no significant unobservable data,
 similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices      with a majority determined with reference to observable prices.
 for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets
 and financial assets and liabilities valued using models    Certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt
 where all significant inputs are observable.                instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and
                                                             amounts owed to bank depositors.

 Level 3 - valuation techniques using significant            Unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable
 unobservable inputs: financial assets and liabilities       inputs, securities where the market is not considered
 valued using valuation techniques where one or more         sufficiently active, including certain inactive pooled investments,
 significant inputs are unobservable.                        and derivatives embedded in certain portfolios of insurance
                                                             contracts where the derivative is not closely related to the host
                                                             contract and the valuation contains significant unobservable
                                                             inputs.

The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude
and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid/offer spreads. In inactive markets, obtaining
assurance that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices
that are necessary to measure the fair value of the asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process.
All businesses have significant processes in place to perform reviews of the appropriateness of the valuation of Level 3
instruments.

The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable data and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is
high. However, certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more
significant inputs that are unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental. A financial asset or
liability in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or
liability's carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs.

In this context, 'unobservable' means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the
price at which an arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no market
data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value. Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair
value derived from a valuation technique with significant unobservable data may be attributable to observable inputs.
Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will generally be restricted to uncertainty about
the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.

(c)    Transfer between fair value hierarchies

The Group deems a transfer to have occurred between Level 1 and Level 2 when an active, traded primary market ceases to
exist for that financial instrument. A transfer between Level 2 and Level 3 occurs when the majority of the significant inputs
used to determine fair value of the instrument become unobservable.

During the year there were financial instruments for which the significant inputs into the valuation model became
unobservable or where the valuation basis has changed. This resulted in transfers from Level 2 to Level 3.

At 31 December 2018, Level 3 financial assets comprised unlisted private company shares, unlisted debt securities and unlisted pooled
investments mainly held by policyholder funds for which the bulk of the investment risk is borne by policyholders. At 31
December 2017, all level 3 assets held by the Quilter and Nedbank businesses were transferred into assets held for sale and
distribution and are therefore not included within any of the amounts disclosed in the table above.

The Group did not have any Level 3 financial liabilities at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.

(c)(i)   Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonable possible alternatives

Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the financial asset or liability
as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters using statistical techniques. When parameters are not
amenable to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.

When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown
reflect the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.

The valuations of the private equity investments are performed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology
appropriate to the specific investment and in line with industry guidelines. In determining the valuation of the investment
the principal assumption used is the valuation multiples applied to the main financial indicators (such as adjusted earnings).
The source of these multiples may include multiples for comparable listed companies which have been adjusted for
discounts for non-tradability and valuation multiples earned on transactions in comparable sectors.

The valuations of asset-backed securities are determined by discounted cash flow models that generate the expected value
of the asset, incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and
the historical performance of the underlying assets. The outputs from the models used are calibrated with reference to
similar securities for which external market information is available.

Structured notes and other derivatives are generally valued using option pricing models. For structured notes and other
derivatives, principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset
values. For such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a
proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available,
and examination of historical levels.

Details of the valuation techniques applied to the different categories of financial instruments can be found in note E2.

The following table summarises the significant inputs to value instruments categorised as Level 3 hierarchy in the Group's
continuing businesses and their sensitivity to changes in the inputs used.

(1) On 19 July 2018, Old Mutual plc repurchased and cancelled R281 million (GBP16 million) of the outstanding Tier 2 subordinated 2025 securities and R4,728 million
    (GBP269 million) of the outstanding Tier 2 subordinated 2021 securities through tender offers. Premiums of R246 million (GBP14 million) were incurred on these
    repurchases.

    On 15 November 2018, Old Mutual plc repurchased the entire outstanding R817 million (GBP45 million) nominal of the Tier 2 subordinated 2025 securities and the
    entire outstanding R1,306 million (GBP72 million) nominal of the Tier 2 subordinated 2021 securities, together with an early redemption payment, accrued interest
    and consent fees. These repurchases were following the approval, by the holders of the securities, of variations to the terms of the securities at a meeting of the
    holders on 12 November 2018. Total premiums of R218 million (GBP12 million) were incurred on these repurchases.

Breaches of covenant

During the 12 months ended 31 December 2018, the financial covenants on eight loans were breached. The funding was
raised to support operations in the Rest of Africa segment.

As at 31 December 2018, six of the eight loans were no longer in breach.

The Group is still in negotiation with the lenders of the remaining two loans totalling R96 million (US$ 7 million) to similarly
amend the breached covenants.

G:     OTHER NOTES

G1:    Commitments

Future potential commitments

Old Mutual Emerging Markets Limited (OMEM) guarantee

A sales agreement was signed between Old Mutual (South Africa) Holdings (Pty) Ltd (OMSAH) and Lily Bermuda Capital
Limited (SPV domiciled in Bermuda), owned by CMIG International Holding Pte. Limited (CMI) on 15 March 2018, for the
purchase of OM Latin America Holdco UK Limited and AIVA Holding Group S.A. (collectively known as 'the Latin American
businesses'). OMEM has provided a guarantee for creditworthiness of OMSAH to the buyer and has also received a reciprocal
guarantee from CMI. At 31 December 2018, the timing and amount of any payments (if any) cannot be reasonably estimated.

Enterprise development commitments

In accordance with the Framework Agreement entered into in relation to Managed Separation concluded with the Department of
Economic Development (the Framework Agreement), the Group has undertaken that, in addition to its existing enterprise
development programs, it shall, over a period of 3 years following the Managed Separation Implementation Date, allocate an
incremental amount of R500 million to a ring-fenced perpetual Enterprise Supplier Development Fund (the Fund). Funding
extended by the Fund is intended and anticipated to generate additional jobs in the Company Ecosystem. The Group's
participation in the Fund shall be managed and administered by a specially created function with oversight from the office
of the CEO, which function shall also be responsible for the measurement of compliance by the Group with the Amended
FSC and the Group's broader commitment to transformation in South Africa.

Although the Fund is developmental in nature, it is management's intention and belief that, in aggregate, the Group will
return a profit on the instruments used to meet the requirements of the Framework Agreement. Nevertheless, as with any
commitment to advance funding, the Group will be subject to credit and counterparty risk in relation to this arrangement.
This risk will be assessed as funds are advanced, expected credit losses will be calculated, and appropriate provisions for
impairment will be raised.

Old Mutual Finance (Pty) Ltd put option

The Old Mutual plc Group and the Business Doctor Consortium Limited and its associates ('Business Doctor') established
Old Mutual Finance (Pty) Ltd (Old Mutual Finance) as a 50/50 start-up strategic alliance in 2008. The Group increased its
shareholding in Old Mutual from 50% to 75% in 2014 by acquiring an additional 25% shareholding from Business Doctor for
R1.1 billion. The Group has a call option to acquire the remaining 25% shareholding in Old Mutual Finance held by Business
Doctor at market value under certain circumstances, inter alia in the event of a change of control within Business Doctor
and on the eighth and tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Old Mutual Finance shareholders' agreement (i.e. in
2022 and 2024 respectively). Business Doctor has a put option to sell its remaining 25% shareholding in Old Mutual Finance
to the Group at market value under certain circumstances, inter alia in the event of a change of control within the Old
Mutual plc Group and on the eighth and tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Old Mutual Finance shareholders'
agreement (i.e. in 2022 and 2024 respectively).

Following the listing of Old Mutual Limited on 26 June 2018, Business Doctor became entitled to exercise the option to put
the remaining shares to Old Mutual Limited. The Group received written confirmation on 22 July 2018 from Business Doctor
that the put option would not be exercised.

Commitments under derivative instruments

The Group enters into option contracts, financial features contracts, forward rate and interest rate swap agreements, and
other financial agreements in the normal course of business.

The Group has options to acquire further stakes in businesses dependant on various circumstances which are regarded
by the Group as collectively and individually immaterial.

Other commitments

Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited has entered into agreements where it has committed to provide
capital to funds and partnerships that it has invested in. The total undrawn commitment is R8,788 million at 31 December
2018 (2017: R7,792 million).

G2:    Contingent liabilities

The Group has provided certain guarantees for specific client obligations, in return for which the Group has received a fee.
The Group has evaluated the extent of the possibility of the guarantees being called on and has provided appropriately.

Contingent liabilities - legal proceedings

The Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks. As a result, the Group is involved
in disputes and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time but the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which it is party to have a
significant adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.

Contingent liabilities - tax

The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates (South Africa and historically the United
Kingdom) routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group. The Group is
committed to conducting its tax affairs in accordance with the tax legislation of the jurisdictions in which they operate. All
interpretations made by management are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction
and the relevant legislation.

There are occasions where the Group's interpretation of tax law may be challenged by the Revenue authorities. The financial
statements include provisions that reflect the Group's assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to
materialise as part of their review. The Board is satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to cater for the resolution
of tax uncertainties and that the resources required to fund such potential settlements are sufficient.

Due to the level of estimation required in determining tax provisions, amounts eventually payable may differ from the
provision recognised.

Consumer protection

The Group is committed to treating customers fairly and supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and it
is central to how our businesses operates. We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet
this commitment, but there is the risk of regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for
customer redress which can result in retrospective changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines. The Group monitors
the exposure to these actions and makes provision for the related costs as appropriate.

Implications of Managed Separation

The Group routinely monitors and reassesses contingent liabilities arising from matters such as litigation, and warranties and
indemnities relating to past acquisitions and disposals. The announcement of Managed Separation on 11 March
2016 does not affect the nature of such items, however, it is possible that the Group may seek to resolve certain matters as
part of the implementation of Managed Separation.

Outcome of Zimbabwean Commission Enquiry

On 31 December 2016, the Zimbabwean government concluded its inquiry into the loss in value for certain policyholders
and beneficiaries upon the conversion of pension and insurance benefits after the dollarisation of the economy in 2009. On
9 March 2018, the results of the Zimbabwean government's inquiry were made public.

The Group is committed to treating its customers fairly and is currently reviewing the report and preparing a preliminary
evaluation of the potential impact on Group operations. We are not currently able to establish what impact the commission's
findings will have on Old Mutual Zimbabwe.

Old Mutual Limited's intragroup guarantee of Travelers indemnification

In September 2001, Old Mutual plc (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual Limited) entered into an indemnity
agreement with Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company (F&G), United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, St. Paul
Fire and Marine Insurance Company and Travelers Companies Inc. (the Indemnity Agreement). In terms of this Indemnity
Agreement, Old Mutual plc agreed to indemnify Travelers Companies Inc. and certain of its group companies (the Travelers
Guarantors) against any and all claims that may be brought against the Travelers Guarantors under the historic guarantees
given by the Travelers Guarantors for various obligations under certain life insurance policies and annuities issued by F&G,
which obligations include a guarantee issued by the Travelers Guarantors, since released by F&G, the liability under which
is limited to $480 million.

In March 2018, Old Mutual Limited agreed to provide an intragroup guarantee to Old Mutual plc in the circumstances where
Old Mutual plc is unable to satisfy its obligations in respect of the Indemnity Agreement. The likelihood of any material
obligations arising under the Indemnity Agreement is considered to be remote given the release agreement entered into
between Old Mutual plc and F&G, as well as the current financial strength and regulatory capital holding of F&G, a licensed
US life insurer.

G3:    Related party transactions

Having previously been a subsidiary of the Group, Nedbank became an associated undertaking on 15 October 2018
(Note A2). Consequently transactions and balances with Nedbank continue to be regarded as related party transactions
and balances. As a result of Managed Separation, there have been significant changes to key management personnel as
defined by IAS 24 Related Party Transactions. There were no transactions with related parties during the year that had a
material effect on the results or financial position of the Group. Other than as set out above, the nature of the related party
transactions has not changed from the prior year.

G4:    Events after the reporting date

Promulgation of the Tax Laws Amendment Act in South Africa

During January 2019, the Tax Laws Amendment Act (the act) was promulgated in South Africa. The act allows for an income
tax deduction at 25% and 40% of the IFRS provision for expected credit losses. Entities have the option to apply to South
African Revenue Services (SARS) for a directive to increase the 40% allowance to a maximum of 85%.

The mentioned changes in tax law will substantially limit the doubtful debt income tax deduction for all taxpayers that are not
banks, resulting in higher income tax payments to SARS. The change in the tax law impacts our unsecured lending business
in Old Mutual Finance (Pty) Ltd. These changes are effective for the financial years ending on and after 31 December 2019.

If these changes were applied to the 2018 financial year and applying the default of 25% and 40% income tax deductions,
the Group estimates an increase in the deferred tax asset of approximately R1.0 billion with an equal cash outflow in tax
payable. Management is preparing an application to SARS for a more favourable directive.

G5:    Discontinued operations and disposal groups held for sale

Nedbank and Quilter
Nedbank and Quilter have continued to be presented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated income
statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended 31 December 2018. This is consistent with the presentation for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Following the distribution of the majority of the Group's stake Nedbank on 15 October 2018 and the listing and distribution
of Quilter on 25 June 2018 (note A2), these entities ceased to be subsidiaries of the Group. Consequently, the results of
Nedbank are consolidated from 1 January 2018 to 15 October 2018 and the results of Quilter are consolidated from 1 January
2018 to 25 June 2018.

The assets and liabilities of Nedbank and Quilter are no longer included in the condensed consolidated statement of
financial position at 31 December 2018.

In the condensed consolidated statement of financial position at December 2017, the assets and liabilities of both Nedbank
and Quilter were classified and presented as assets and liabilities held for sale and distribution.

Latin American businesses
As a consequence of the agreed sale of the Latin American businesses as set out in note A2, its size relative to the new
Group structure and its separate geographical location, the Latin American businesses have been presented as discontinued
operations in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive
income and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2018. Consistent with the
requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', the condensed consolidated income
statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been re-presented.

The Group's interest in the assets and liabilities of the Latin American businesses has been classified as held for sale in the
condensed consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2018. This judgement was done based on the facts
and circumstances which existed at that date when the Directors made a formal assessment of whether the businesses
should be classified as held for sale. Consistent with the requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations', comparative information in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position at 31
December 2017 have not been re-presented.

Old Mutual Bermuda
Old Mutual Bermuda is expected to wind down its operations during the course of 2019. During 2018, the operations of Old
Mutual Bermuda have actively commenced the wind down process in line with the Wind Down plan that was presented
to the Old Mutual Bermuda and Old Mutual plc Boards as well as to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) in December
2017. Given its separate geographical location, Old Mutual Bermuda has been classified and presented as a discontinued
operation in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income
and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for all reporting periods. Consistent with the requirements of IFRS 5
'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', comparative information in the condensed consolidated
income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been re-presented. In accordance with IFRS, Old Mutual Bermuda
has not been classified as held for sale.

Re-presentation of Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited (Kotak)
On 13 October 2017, the Old Mutual plc Group completed the sale of its 26% stake in Kotak to its joint venture partner
Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited. The investment was presented as an asset held for sale in the Old Mutual plc Group interim
accounts to 30 June 2017. However, given its size relative to the Old Mutual plc Group, it was assessed that the business did
not meet the definition of a component and therefore was not presented as a discontinued operation. Following the change
in Group structure in 2018, the treatment of Kotak has been re-assessed. Consequently, the condensed consolidated income
statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been re-presented to reflect Kotak as a discontinued operation.

Further information on discontinued operations is provided in note G5.1. Further information on assets and liabilities classified
as held for sale and distribution is provided in note G5.2.

G5.1   Discontinued operations

The tables below present the income statement from discontinued operations note G5.1(a), the statement of comprehensive
income from discontinued operations note G5.1(b) and net cash flows from discontinued operations note G5.1(c) for the year

H:     STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDS, AND INTERPRETATIONS
       ADOPTED IN THE 2018 CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

H1.1   Introduction

Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated annual financial statements are the same
as those applied in the Group' consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended 31 December 2017. The Group
adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations in the current financial year:

IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The Group applied the interpretation prospectively from 1 January 2018. When the Group receives or makes payment
in advance, a revenue received in advance liability or prepayment asset is recognised. In terms of the interpretation the
exchange rate at the recognition date of the revenue received in advance liability or prepayment asset is used to recognise
and measure the eventual asset, liability income or expense. The interpretation is not expected to have significant impact
on the financial results, financial position or cash flows of the Group for the current year.

Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-Based payment Transactions - Classification and Measurement

The Group applied the amendment prospectively from 1 January 2018. In certain instances the Group sells vested Old Mutual
Ltd shares to settle income tax obligations of the Group on behalf of employees. In terms of the amendment these share
awards are continued to be accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. As a result the amendment
is not expected to have any impact on the financial results, financial position or cash flows of the Group for the current year.

Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Properties - Transfers of Investment Properties

The Group applied the amendment prospectively from 1 January 2018. The amendment states that a transfer of property
into or from investment properties takes place when the change in use of the property occurs, compared to a mere change
in intention. The amendment is not expected to have significant impact on the financial results, financial position or cash
flows of the Group for the current year.

H1.2    Implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 and has taken an exemption not to restate comparative information with
respect to classification and measurement (including impairment) requirements. As a result the comparative information
disclosed for financial instruments is based on the accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements for the
financial year ended 31 December 2017.

The accounting policies applied in 2018 can be found in note E.

The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial
application:

-   The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held and whether or not the cash flows meet
    the characteristics of cash flows that are simply payments of principal and interest in the principal.

-   The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as measured
    at FVTPL.

-   The designation of certain investments in equity instruments not held for trading as at FVOCI.

-   If an investment in a debt security had low credit risk at the date of initial application of IFRS 9, then the Group has
    assumed that the credit risk on the asset had not increased significantly since its initial recognition.

H1.3    Implementation of IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15)

The Group has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective approach. In terms of this approach
the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard to contracts that was recognised in retained earnings at 1 January
2018. The comparative information is presented based on the accounting policies applied in preparing the financial
statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

H1.4   Impact of implementing IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 for the year ended 31 December 2018

The following table below sets out the key line items in the annual financial statements impacted by the implementation
of IFRS 9. The comparative numbers were prepared in terms of IAS 39.

The income tax consequences of recognising expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost and other
instruments and writing off balances are different between the jurisdictions where the Group conducts its business. In some
jurisdictions the income tax consequences are also different between different types of financial assets. The total transition
movement in the allowance for expected credit losses (R973 million) was recorded in retained earnings (R751 million),
other reserves (R222 million) and non-controlling interest (R190 million). The transition movement was recognised in other
reserves to utilise regulatory reserves previously created in the Rest of Africa business. At 1 January 2018 the balance of the
incurred loss model provision under IAS 39 was R2,918 million.

H1.6.2 Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

On 1 January 2018 Group assessed the business models apply to the financial assets held by the Group and classified its
financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories. The Group also considered the impact of implementation of
the expected credit loss model. The following tables and accompanying notes explain the original measurement categories
and carrying values under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories and carrying values under IFRS 9 for each class of
the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities as at 1 January 2018:

Apart from the implementation of the expected credit loss model, other significant changes in the classification and
measurement of financial assets and liabilities as illustrated above have been described below.

(a) Reclassification of equity instruments with a fair value of R430,569 million (at 31 December 2017) and debt instruments
    with a fair value of R198 million (at 31 December 2017) from financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss
    in terms of IAS 39, to financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IFRS 9.

In accordance with the Group's accounting policies equity instruments are classified as financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss. In terms of IAS 39 the debt instruments were designated as financial instruments at fair value through profit
or loss. In terms of IFRS 9, the Group considers that these debt instruments are held within a business model where the
financial performance of these instruments are measured and the instruments are managed on a fair value basis. As a
result the debt instruments are classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Since the instruments
were measured at fair value in terms of IAS 39, no measurement adjustment was recognised when the instruments were
reclassified.

(b) Reclassification of government securities with a fair value of R3,509 million (at 31 December 2017) from financial assets
    designated at FVTPL under IAS 39, to financial assets at amortised cost under IFRS 9.

The government securities were designated at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IAS 39. A review of the business
model regarding these instruments indicated that the instruments are held with the objective to collect contractual cash
flows over the term of the instrument. A review of the cash flows characteristics of the instruments indicated that the
cash flows are solely payments of capital and interest on the capital outstanding. Consequently the Group classified these
instruments as financial assets at amortised cost. At 1 January 2018, the Group recognised an allowance for expected credit
losses of R12 million with regard to these instruments. The expected credit loss was recognised in equity at 1 January 2018.

The fair value of these financial assets as at 31 December 2018 was R5,553 million. The various original effective interest rates
of these instruments range from 5% to 26% per annum and R263 million of interest income has been recognised during
the period.

(c) Reclassification of investments and securities with a fair value of R921 million (at 31 December 2017) from available-for-
    sale to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

The investment and securities comprise of government, government guaranteed securities and equity instruments. In
terms of IAS 39 these instruments were designated as available for sale financial instruments. In terms of IFRS 9, the Group
considers that the debt securities are held within a business model where the financial performance of these instruments are
measured and the instruments are managed on a fair value basis. As a result the government and government guaranteed
securities are classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Since the instruments were measured at
fair value in terms of IAS 39, no measurement adjustment was recognised when the instruments were reclassified in terms
of IFRS 9.

(d) Reclassification of borrowed funds (R1,018 million) at 31 December 2017) from financial liabilities at amortised under IAS
    39, to financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.

At 31 December 2017, the Group carried total borrowed funds with a carrying value of R18,866 million. Included in this
balance were borrowed funds classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost of R5,675 million. On 1 January 2018 the Group
reclassified R1,018 million of this balance to financial liabilities at fair value to avoid or significantly reduce an accounting
mismatch with derivative instruments (held to mitigate interest rate risk) classified as financial instruments at fair value
through profit or loss. To adjust the carrying value of the borrowed funds to fair value (R1,284 million at 31 December 2017) a
fair value loss of R266 million was recognised in retained earnings.

The portion of cumulative fair value losses related to changes in the credit risk of the total borrowed funds designated at
fair value through profit or loss was transferred from retained earnings to other reserves at 1 January 2018. The amount of
the transfer was R683 million.

H1.6.3 Impact of the new impairment model

The 'incurred loss model' under IAS 39 was replaced with the 'expected credit loss' (ECL) model under IFRS 9. Application
of the ECL model results in credit losses being recognised earlier than under the incurred loss model. The ECL model
applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost (for example mandatory reserve deposits with central banks, loans
and advances, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and debt securities held by the Group) and debt
investments measured at FVOCI. As a consequence of the new standard the Group has revised its impairment methodology
for each of these classes of assets.

The Group has determined that the application of IFRS 9's impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 resulted in an additional
impairment allowance for the continuing business as set out in 1.6.2. The following table sets out the implementation

H1.6.4 Hedge accounting

On the adoption of IFRS 9 the Group elected to not apply hedge accounting to any financial instruments in the continuing
businesses. The Group elected to continue with hedge accounting principles as set out in IAS 39 and will adopt the hedge
accounting principles set out in IFRS 9 when the IASB project on macro hedge accounting has been completed.

(a)    Initial financial planning fees

An initial financial planning fee is paid to brokers for providing initial financial planning to clients. Fees charged to clients
consist of initial fees and ongoing fees. In the past the initial fee received was recognised as a deferred revenue liability and
the initial financial planning fee paid as a deferred acquisition cost asset. These balances were amortised into the condensed 
consolidatedstatement of comprehensive income as separate items of income and expense over the expected contractual periods.

In terms of IFRS 15 revenue is recognised when the related performance obligation has been satisfied. The initial fee
received should be recognised as revenue when the services have been provided. The initial financial planning fee paid
should be expensed when incurred.

Deferred acquisition costs and deferred revenue liabilities at 31 December 2017 have been adjusted with a corresponding
impact to retained earnings. This lead to a reduction of deferred acquisition costs of R848 million and a reduction in
deferred revenue liability of R876 million at 1 January 2018. The related impact to deferred tax has been a reduction in the
deferred tax asset of R245 million and a reduction in the deferred tax liability of R237 million.

I:     FUTURE STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDS, AND INTERPRETATIONS
       NOT EARLY-ADOPTED IN THE 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations, have been published that are not mandatory for 2018 reporting
periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.

IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 'Leases' and its interpretations for reporting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2019. The Group will implement the new standard from the effective date by applying the modified
retrospective approach. The cumulative effect of initial application will be recognised in retained earnings at 1 January 2019
and comparative information will not be restated.

At inception of a contract the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease
if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Lease accounting is only applied to lease components within a contract.

IFRS 16 introduces a 'right-of-use' model whereby the lessee recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease obligation to make
lease payments for leases in the scope of the standard. In the past the Group, as lessee, accounted for leases as either
operating lease or finance leases and such distinction is not continued under IFRS 16 for lessees. The right-of-use asset is
initially recognised at the present value of the lease liability. Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset will depend
on the measurement basis applied for similar owned assets. When carried at cost or revalued amounts, the carrying value
will be amortised into profit or loss over the lease term. The financial liability is recognised at the present value of future lease
payments and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. Interest expense accrued on the lease liability is recognised in
profit or loss.

Accounting for leases in the financial statements for lessors remained largely unchanged from the accounting applied
under IAS 17. The Group, as a lessor, continues to classify and account for leases as either operating leases or finance leases.
Additional disclosures will be provided the annual financial statements for the financial period ending 31 December 2019.

All of the Group's businesses will be impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16. Based on the work done to date the Group expects
an increase in assets and corresponding increase in liabilities of approximately R1.0 billion as result of the implementation
of IFRS 16.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 (however the IASB has made a tentative
decision to defer the effective date by one year, subject to due process). The IASB issued IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' in
May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts'. The Group will apply the new standard from the effective date.
The new rules will affect the financial statements and key performance indicators of all entities in the Group that issue
insurance contracts (such as term and life insurance, life annuities, disability insurance, and property and casualty insurance)
or investment contracts with discretionary participation features (such as with-profit annuities and investments). The most
significant impacted subsidiary will be the Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited, however all other
Group entities with life and short-term insurance licences will also be impacted.

The Group has instituted an implementation programme under the sponsorship of the Chief Financial Officer, who chairs
a steering committee consisting of senior finance, actuarial and information technology executives from impacted business
areas. Each major IFRS 17 focus area (i.e. Group, Rest of Africa and OM Insure) is also governed by a delivery committee,
which consists of senior finance and actuarial managers who make decisions on scope, design and enablement for their
relevant focus areas. All decisions relating to the interpretation of the standard (i.e. policies and methodologies) are made by
a Technical Review Committee (TRC), which consists of actuarial and finance SME's across Group, the Segments and Rest of
Africa. Ratification of major decisions are done by the steering committee. Programme resources include a mix of dedicated
and shared internal technical experts, as well as external consultants where appropriate.

During 2017 and 2018, the Group completed the initial impact assessments, including several pilot projects on selected
products aimed at assessing the financial impacts of the standard. Significant progress has been made on the development
of accounting and actuarial policies and methodologies, with formal sign off from the TRC on each version of a paper, as
well as outcomes of investigations. This also includes a comprehensive product classification model, which includes the
Group product scope and IFRS 17 classification and measurement approach per product. The Transition approach and
process was finalised in H1 2018 and transition calculations on 2018 balances are well on track to be competed in Q4
2019, after which calculations on the 2019 balances will commence. Actuarial modelling development, which is the most
significant enablement requirement on the Programme in addition to Transition and Technology, commenced in H2 2018
and is currently largely on track against the plan.

The Programme is now in the process of defining detailed requirements for the finance and actuarial system and process
build. In parallel, a robust financial data model and Actuarial Results Repository prototype is being developed to demonstrate
the capability that is required within OML. No technology decisions have been made at this time, as the focus remains on
finalisation of detailed compliance, data and business requirements until Q4 2019. The majority of focus to date has been
on progressing work for Group, OMLACSA and OMLACNAM. The Rest of Africa and OM Insure projects are in the process of
being mobilised and scoping for these projects will be agreed during Q2 2019.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

The Group will apply the interpretation retrospectively for financial periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
The interpretation provides guidance on the accounting treatment of uncertain income tax positions. In terms of the
interpretation each tax entity should determine whether the uncertainties will be consider in isolation or cumulatively.
In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases,
unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, an entity should assume that a taxation authority will examine amounts it
has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations. In determining
taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, an entity must consider the probability
that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group is assessing the impact of the interpretation.

Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Definition of a Business

The amendments must be applied to transactions with effective dates that are on or after 1 January 2020. The amendments
clarify that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input
and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. The amendment states that
a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. The inputs and processes
applied to those inputs must have 'the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs' rather than 'the ability to create
outputs'. The Group is not required to review transactions completed in prior periods.

Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

The amendments apply to plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements occurring on or after 1 January 2019. When the
plan amendment, curtailment or settlement takes place the entity is required to determine current service cost for the
remainder of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, using the actuarial assumptions used to
remeasure the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that
event. In addition, the entity is required to determine interest for the remainder of the period after the plan amendment,
curtailment or settlement using the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and
the plan assets after that event; and the discount rate used to remeasure that net defined benefit liability (asset).

Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Long-term Interests

The amendments will be applied retrospectively from 1 January 2019 and will be implemented in the 2019 financial period.
The amendments clarify that IFRS 9 is applied to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that is not accounted for
in terms of the equity method and form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture. As a result the expected
credit loss model in IFRS 9 is applied to financial assets at amortised cost included in the long-term interests. The Group is
assessing the impact of the amendment.

Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

The amendments will be applied retrospectively from 1 January 2019 and will be implemented in the 2019 financial period.
A debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, provided
that the contractual cash flows are 'solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding' (the
SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held within the appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments
to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that causes the
early termination of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early
termination of the contract. The Group is assessing the impact of the amendment.

To the Directors of Old Mutual Limited

Introduction
We have completed our assurance engagement to report on the compilation of the non-IFRS financial information of Old
Mutual Limited (""the Company"") and its subsidiaries (collectively ""the Group"") by the directors of the Company (""Directors"").

The pro forma non-IFRS financial information comprises the following:

- adjusted financial statement caption, for the year ended 31 December 2018:
  ?  Adjusted weighted average number of ordinary shares (millions) (AWANOS);
  ?  Adjusted Headline Earnings per share (cents) (AHPS); and
  ?  Adjusted IFRS Equity.

- adjusted ratios for the year ended 31 December 2018:
  ?  Return on Net Asset Value (RoNAV); and

(collectively the ""Non-IFRS Financial Information"").

The applicable criteria on the basis of which the Directors have compiled the Non-IFRS Financial Information, comprising
of each of the adjusted financial statement captions and the adjusted ratio, is specified in the JSE Limited (""JSE"") Listings
Requirements (""JSE Listings Requirements""), and as described in the Reviewed Preliminary Annual Results for the year
ended 31 December 2018 and the related SENS announcement (""Preliminary Results Announcements"").

The Non-IFRS Financial Information has been compiled by the Directors to illustrate the performance of the Group and
adjust for any IFRS accounting treatments that are not reflective at the long term economic performance of the Group.

As part of this process the reviewed financial statement captions for the year ended 31 December 2018 (""Reviewed
Financial Information"") have been extracted by the Directors from the Reviewed Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, on which an unmodified independent auditors' review report was issued
on 10 March 2019.

Directors' responsibility for the Non-IFRS Financial Information
The Directors are responsible for compiling the Non-IFRS Financial Information on the basis of the Applicable Criteria
specified in the JSE Listings Requirements, and as described in the Preliminary Results Announcements (""the Applicable
Criteria"").

Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct for Registered
Auditors issued by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles
of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The IRBA Code is
consistent with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts
A and B).

Deloitte & Touche and KPMG Inc. apply the International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform
Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements and accordingly
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Independent Reporting Accountants' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion about whether the Non-IFRS Financial Information has been compiled, in all
material respects, by the Directors on the basis specified in the JSE Listings Requirements as described in the Preliminary
Results Announcement.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3420,
Assurance Engagements to Report on the Compilation of Pro Forma Financial Information Included in a Prospectus, issued
by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires that the reporting accountants'
plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Directors have compiled, in all material
respects, the Non-IFRS Financial Information on the basis specified in the JSE Listings Requirements and as described in
the Preliminary Results Announcements.

For purposes of this engagement, we are not responsible for updating or reissuing any reports or opinions on any historical
financial information used in compiling the Non-IFRS Financial Information.

The purpose of the Non-IFRS Financial Information included in the Preliminary Results Announcements is to illustrate the
performance of the Group and adjust for any IFRS accounting treatments that are not reflective of the long term economic
performance of the Group.

A reasonable assurance engagement to report on whether the Non-IFRS Financial Information has been compiled, in all
material respects, on the basis of the Applicable Criteria involves performing procedures to assess whether the Applicable
Criteria used by the Directors in the compilation of the Non-IFRS Financial Information provides a reasonable basis for
presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the events and to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about
whether:

- The pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to the Applicable Criteria; and

- The Non-IFRS Financial Information reflects the proper application of the pro forma adjustments to the unadjusted
  Reviewed Financial Information of the Group.

Our procedures selected depend on our judgement, having regard to our understanding of the nature of the Group or the
event of which the pro forma adjustments in respect of the Non-IFRS Financial Information has been compiled, and other
relevant engagement circumstances.

Our engagement also involves evaluating the overall presentation of the Non-IFRS Financial Information.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Non-IFRS Financial Information has been compiled, in all material respects, on the basis of the Applicable
Criteria specified in the JSE Listings Requirements and as described in the Preliminary Results Announcement.

Purpose of this report
This report has been prepared for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the JSE Listings Requirements, and for no
other purpose.

combinations within relevant industries, as well as the impact of tax and
other legislation and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which Old

In compliance with rule 3.59 of the JSE Listings Requirements, Old Mutual
announces the resignation of Ingrid Johnson as the non-executive director of the
Company, with effect from 30 November 2018.


Trevor Manuel, Chairman of Old Mutual commented:
Ingrid agreed to take on the role of Interim Finance Director in the run up to
the listing of Old Mutual whilst we proceeded with the recruitment process for
Casper Troskie, the current Chief Financial Officer. This was in addition to
her primary role as Group Finance Director of Old Mutual plc. Upon material
completion of the managed separation and the listing of Old Mutual, Ingrid became
a non-executive director.


Following on from the successful transition of CFO accountabilities and Old
Mutual’s listing, the Board has agreed that it is now appropriate for Ingrid to
step down as a non-executive director. The Board wishes to acknowledge Ingrid’s
tireless and crucial contribution to the Old Mutual and Nedbank over 25 years,
and most recently to Old Mutual’s listing preparation. We wish her continued
success in her future endeavours.

                             CHANGE IN DIRECTORATE

In compliance with rule 3.59 of the JSE Listings Requirements, Old Mutual
announces the resignation of Vassi Naidoo as the non-executive director of the
Company, with effect from 31 December 2018.

Shareholders are referred to the announcement by Old Mutual on 26 September 2018
regarding the unbundling by Old Mutual of a significant portion of Old Mutual’s
shareholding in Nedbank Group shares (‘the Unbundling’).   Old Mutual implemented
the Unbundling on 15 October 2018, through the distribution of approximately
31,73% of the issued shares of Nedbank Group to OML shareholders, whilst retaining
a strategic minority stake of 19.9% of the issued share capital in Nedbank Group
in its shareholder funds to underpin the continuing relationship and commercial
benefits between the two organisations.


Trevor Manuel, Chairman of Old Mutual commented:
Vassi played an important role in guarding both the Old Mutual plc, Nedbank Group
Limited and Old Mutual’s Boards through the complexity of the successful Managed
Separation process.   He continuously drove for clarity and transparency in the
management of sometimes competing stakeholder interests.

With the completion of the unbundling of the majority of Old Mutual’s stake in
Nedbank, the Board has agreed that it is appropriate for Vassi to step down from
his non-executive directorship of Old Mutual.

  FURTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED IN RESPECT OF THE HOLDINGS OF
 CERTAIN NON-SOUTH AFRICAN SHAREHOLDERS, FOLLOWING THE UNBUNDLING OF THE MAJORITY OF
                               NEDBANK SHARES HELD BY OLD MUTUAL LIMITED.

Nedbank Group Limited (""Nedbank"") have published on their website further information to provide assistance to non-
South African shareholders who received shares following the unbundling of the majority of Old Mutual’s shareholding in
Nedbank. We set out this information below, for the benefit of certain overseas Old Mutual shareholders who are now
also Nedbank shareholders, and who may be unfamiliar with the South African requirements for the holding of shares in
Nedbank. Nedbank shares are listed on the JSE in South Africa and the NSE in Namibia.


""Note to Holders of Old Mutual Limited (""OML"") shares on the United Kingdom Register who obtained Nedbank
Group Limited (""NGL"") shares pursuant to the unbundling by OML of a majority of its NGL share.


Allocation of entitlements
Eligible OML shareholders who held OML shares on the United Kingdom Register (UK shareholders) as at the Record
date for the Unbundling, received NGL entitlements in the SA Nominee called Pacific Custodians Nominees (RF) Pty Ltd
(‘PCN’) on Monday 15 October 2018.


The entitlements to the unbundled NGL shares are held in uncertificated form by the SA Nominee. NGL shares may only
be traded in uncertificated form on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and only through South African brokers or through
a custody account with a South African Central Securities Depository Participant (‘CSDP’).


Equiniti Limited (OML’s UK registrar) in the United Kingdom will be sending confirmations of holdings in NGL to affected
UK shareholders by post to their registered address on 26 October 2018. The confirmations will contain the shareholder
reference number and the number of NGL shares that they have received in the Unbundling.


The SA Nominee is a Strate approved nominee owned by Link Investor Services Pty Ltd (‘LIS’). As LIS is a CSDP and
an accountable institution in terms of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 38 of 2001 (‘FICA’) it is required to conduct
Know Your Client (‘KYC’) procedures on all clients prior to the NGL shares being sold or transferred.


UK shareholders who wish to sell their NGL shares or who wish to transfer their NGL shares to their CSDP in South
Africa are required to provide their FICA documentation to LIS, thereafter they will be able to issue an instruction to sell
or transfer shares. UK Shareholders can contact LIS during office hours between 08:00am to 16:30pm (South African
time), Monday to Friday on +27 (0)86 140 0110/ +27 (0)11 029 0253 or enquiries may be sent to
UKinvestors@linkmarketservices.co.za.

Shareholders who manage their investment through a nominee or stockbroker, where the registered holder is that
nominee or stockbroker, should contact them for their entitlement notices as the underlying beneficiary and instruct them
to request a transfer of their beneficial entitlement to their CSDP which could be PCN in South Africa or to sell their
beneficial entitlements through LIS.

LIS’s standard dealing fees will apply in respect of share sales. Shareholders can obtain the fee structure by contacting
LIS.


The frequently asked questions below are provided to assist UK shareholders who acquired NGL shares pursuant to the
Unbundling of NGL by OML.

Frequently asked questions

Will UK shareholders receive share certificates for the unbundled NGL shares?
A share certificate will not be issued as the entitlements to the unbundled NGL shares are already held by PCN in
dematerialised (uncertificated) form. NGL shares may only be traded in uncertificated form on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange.


How do UK shareholders sell their unbundled NGL shares in South Africa?
In order to sell the unbundled NGL shares held by PCN, UK shareholders can email the required FICA documentation
to UKinvestors@linkmarketservices.co.za. Once LIS receives the required FICA documentation, shareholders will be
able to sell telephonically and the proceeds will be paid into their UK bank account.

What FICA documentation is required in order to sell or transfer the unbundled NGL shares?
If you are an individual:
•        A copy of your identity or passport document
•        A recent copy of your bank statement reflecting your bank account information (not older than 3
         months)
[Note: If you intend moving your shares to another CSDP in South Africa, you are not required to provide confirmation of
your bank account information]

If the shares are registered in the name of a company:
•        A certified copy of the company certificate of incorporation
•        A certified copy of a board minutes/resolution detailing the person/s authorised ""authorised signatory/ies"" to act
         on behalf of the company
•        Specimen signatures of the authorised signatory/ies on a company letterhead
•        Certified copies of the identity or passport document of the authorised signatories and Directors
•        A recent copy of your bank statement reflecting your bank account information (not older than 3 months)
[Note: If you intend moving your shares to another CSDP in South Africa, you are not required to provide confirmation of
your bank account information]

If the shares are registered in the name of any other legal entity:
•        A certified copy of the founding document
•        A certified copy of a board minutes/resolution detailing the person/s authorised ""authorised signatory/ies"" to act
         on behalf of the legal entity
•        A list of authorised signatories together with specimen signatures on the entity letterhead
•        A certified copy of the partnership agreement or other founding documentation and written confirmation of the
         residential address of persons authorised to act on behalf of the legal entity

What happens if UK shareholders do not want to sell their unbundled NGL shares after Unbundling?
UK shareholders have the following options:
•         Leave NGL shares in PCN, no fees are applicable for holding shares in PCN;
or
•         Transfer NGL shares from PCN to any South African Broker or another CSDP in South Africa by submitting the
          required FICA documentation and a signed withdrawal form to UKinvestors@linkmarketservices.co.za. (Note:
          transferring shares from PCN to another SA broker or CSDP in SA will attract an administration fee of R 100
          Excl. Vat)

Are there any immediate plans for a UK listing of NGL to allow for trading of unbundled NGL shares by UK
shareholders after Unbundling?
Nedbank have no immediate plans to list on the London Stock Exchange post Unbundling. Ahead of the Unbundling, a
decision was taken that the unbundled NGL shares in respect of the UK Register will settle directly into the nominee
called Pacific Custodians Nominee (RF) Proprietary Limited (PCN). UK shareholders are able to sell or trade the NGL
shares held with PCN after submitting the required FICA documentation to Link Investor Services.""

This announcement does not constitute an offer or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase,
subscribe for, sell or issue, or a solicitation of any offer to purchase, subscribe for, sell or issue, any
securities (whether pursuant to this announcement or otherwise) in any jurisdiction, including an offer

Introduction

Old Mutual shareholders (""Shareholders"") are referred to the completion announcement published on
the Stock Exchange News Services of the JSE Limited (""JSE""), the London Stock Exchange, the Malawi
Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock Exchange and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (collectively “News
Services”) dated 15 October 2018 respectively wherein it was announced that Old Mutual had
successfully unbundled the majority of its shareholding in the issued share capital of Nedbank Group
Limited (“Nedbank”) to its Shareholders (""Unbundling"").

Shareholders are also referred to the detailed terms of the Unbundling, as set out in the announcement
published on the News Services dated 26 September 2018 (“Unbundling Announcement”). Under
the terms of the Unbundling, eligible Shareholders (which term excludes certain restricted foreign
Shareholders affected by the laws of their relevant jurisdiction) received 3.21176 ordinary shares in
Nedbank (listed on the JSE and the Namibian Stock Exchange) (“Unbundled Nedbank Shares”), for
every 100 Old Mutual shares held.

As per the Unbundling Announcement, the Unbundled Nedbank Shares could be delivered to
Shareholders in the United States (“US Old Mutual Shareholders”) provided they were qualified
institutional buyers (""QIBs"") as defined in Rule 144A under the US Securities Act in reliance on
exemptions from registration under the US Securities Act of 1933. Each US Old Mutual Shareholder
that was eligible to receive Unbundled Nedbank Shares in terms of the Unbundling was required to
execute and submit an investor letter in a prescribed form by 5:00 pm SA time on Friday, 12 October
2018 to Link Market Services Proprietary Limited (“Link”), Old Mutual’s registrar. Following the close of
business on Friday, 12 October 2018, Link notified Old Mutual that US Old Mutual Shareholders entitled
to receive 5,494,762 Unbundled Nedbank Shares had not submitted such investor letters and are
therefore restricted from receiving the relevant Unbundled Nedbank Shares (“Restricted US Old
Mutual Shareholders”). In accordance with the terms of the Unbundling set out in the Unbundling
Announcement, such Unbundled Nedbank Shares will be aggregated and disposed in an orderly
manner in the market on behalf of and for the benefit of Restricted US Old Mutual Shareholders as soon
as is reasonably practicable after the implementation of the Unbundling at the best price that can
reasonably be obtained at the time of the sale and the proceeds (determined on the basis set out in the
Unbundling Announcement) paid to the relevant Restricted US Old Mutual Shareholders. Due to the
number of such Unbundled Nedbank Shares to be sold by Old Mutual on behalf of Restricted US Old
Mutual Shareholders, Old Mutual has resolved to proceed with the sale by way of an accelerated
bookbuild offering (“Placing”).

The Placing
In terms of the Placing, up to 5,494,762 Unbundled Nedbank Shares (“Placing Shares”) will become
available for sale to select institutional investors. The books of the Placing will open with immediate
effect. The timing of closing of the books will be at the absolute discretion of the Manager (as defined
below). Pricing and allocations of the Placing will be determined as soon as practicable following the
closing of the book. The sale is subject to demand, price and market conditions.

The Placing process will be subject to normal share trading practices, the relevant rules, regulations
and procedures of the JSE, the applicable law and the settlement authority of Strate Proprietary Limited.
Merrill Lynch International (“BofA Merrill Lynch” or “Manager”) is acting as the sole global coordinator
and bookrunner in relation to the Placing. Old Mutual is conducting the Placing on an undocumented
basis – no prospectus, offering circular, pre-listing statement or other offering document has been or
will be published in connection with the Placing. Potential investors in the Placing should take into
account all publicly available information in relation to Nedbank before making an investment decision.
If the Placing does not result in the full intended sale volume of 5,494,762 Placing Shares, Old Mutual
intends to effect the full sell down of such shortfall in an orderly manner in the future, as market
conditions allow.

The remaining ordinary shares in Nedbank held by Old Mutual will be subject to a lock-up period from
the date of this announcement until the date which is 90 days after the closing date of the Placing, which
is expected to be on Monday, 16 January 2019, save for certain exceptions and waiver by BofA Merrill
Lynch (consent to such waiver not to be unreasonably withheld).

COMPLETION OF THE UNBUNDLING BY OLD MUTUAL OF THE MAJORITY OF ITS
SHAREHOLDING IN NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED, THE FINAL STEP IN THE MANAGED
SEPARATION OF THE OLD MUTUAL PLC GROUP


NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA OR JAPAN OR ANY JURISDICTION
WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT

This announcement does not constitute an offer or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase,
subscribe for, sell or issue, or a solicitation of any offer to purchase, subscribe for, sell or issue, any
securities (whether pursuant to this announcement or otherwise) in any jurisdiction, including an offer
to the public or section of the public in any jurisdiction. This announcement does not comprise a
prospectus or a prospectus equivalent announcement.

Completion of the unbundling of Nedbank Group Limited and the managed separation of Old
Mutual plc

Old Mutual shareholders (""Shareholders"") are referred to the announcements published on the Stock
Exchange News Services of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) (“SENS”), the London Stock Exchange, the Malawi
Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock Exchange and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange dated 26
September 2018 and 11 October 2018 respectively (“Announcements”), wherein it was announced
that Old Mutual will unbundle the majority of its shareholding in the issued share capital of Nedbank
Group Limited (“Nedbank”) to its Shareholders on Monday, 15 October 2018 (""Unbundling"").

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual has successfully completed the Unbundling as stipulated in
the Announcements. This marks the completion of the final step in the managed separation of the Old
Mutual plc group, as initially announced by Old Mutual plc in March 2016 (“Managed Separation”).
Following the Unbundling Old Mutual has retained (in its shareholder funds) a minority stake of 19.9%
of the issued share capital of Nedbank, held directly by Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South
Africa) Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual. This stake in Nedbank underpins
Old Mutual’s long term strategic relationship with Nedbank and the mutually beneficial arm's length
commercial arrangements between Old Mutual and Nedbank.

Pursuant to the Unbundling, each eligible Shareholder has received 3.21176 ordinary shares in
Nedbank (listed on the JSE and the Namibian Stock Exchange) (“Unbundled Nedbank Shares”), for
every 100 Old Mutual shares held on the relevant securities register of Old Mutual as at 5.00 p.m. (SA
time) / 4.00 p.m. (UK time) on Friday, 12 October 2018.
Old Mutual believes that the Managed Separation has facilitated significant long-term value unlock for
its Shareholders. The Managed Separation has allowed each business - Old Mutual, Quilter plc
(formerly, Old Mutual Wealth), BrightSphere Investment Group (formerly, Old Mutual Asset
Management) and Nedbank to operate independently within their respective domestic markets and
focus on their individual businesses, free from the costs and constraints of a larger group structure.
Each of these businesses now has easier access to capital markets to fund growth opportunities and
can be valued more appropriately.

Cash Proceeds of Fractional Entitlements

As outlined in the Announcements, fractional entitlements to Unbundled Nedbank Shares will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number and the aggregated fractions of the Unbundled Nedbank
Shares to which a Shareholder is entitled will be sold in the market as soon as practicable after the
Unbundling. Shareholders will accordingly receive monetary compensation in respect of their fractional
entitlements to Unbundled Nedbank Shares (“Cash Proceeds”), which has been determined in
accordance with the Listings Requirements of the JSE (“Listing Requirements”).

Shareholders on Old Mutual’s Namibian register, Malawian register, UK branch register and the
Zimbabwean register will be paid the local currency cash equivalents of the Cash Proceeds. The Cash
Proceeds will be converted to local currency at the effective rates disclosed in the Announcement dated
11 October 2018.

FTSE/JSE Africa Index changes

It was announced by the JSE on SENS on 5 October 2018 that, subject to the completion of the
Unbundling, Nedbank will remain in the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index (“JSE Top 40”) with an increased
investbility weighting of 74.20018%, previously 43.24603%. It was further stated that Nedbank will
remain in the FTSE/JSE Shareholder Weighted All Share Index (“SWIX Index”) with an increased
investibility weighting of 74.20018%, previously 43.24603%. A capital repayment will be applied to Old
Mutual to reflect the value of the Unbundling. These changes were implemented with effect from 10
October 2018. No other changes will be effected as a result of the Unbundling.

Furthermore, on 5 September 2018 the JSE announced, as part of its quarterly review, the constituent
free float and share issue changes applied with effect from 25 September 2018. Old Mutual will remain
in the SWIX Index with an increased investibility weighting of 71.98654%, previously 61.51652%.

Nedbank odd-lot offer

Shareholders are further referred to the announcement released by Nedbank on SENS on Monday, 15
October 2018 (“Nedbank Announcement”) wherein Nedbank confirmed its intention to implement an
odd-lot offer (“Odd-lot Offer”) following the Nedbank Unbundling in accordance with the timetable
contained in the said announcement, subject to all requisite approvals and in accordance with Listings
Requirements, to all eligible Nedbank shareholders holding less than 100 Nedbank ordinary shares
(“Odd-lot Holders”).

Old Mutual would like to draw Shareholders’ attention to paragraph 4 of the Nedbank Announcement,
outlining the Odd-lot Offer mechanics. Odd-Lot Holders that wish to retain their Nedbank ordinary
shares must specifically make an election to do so. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election
will automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their
Nedbank ordinary shares to Nedbank and will receive the cash consideration as set out in the Nedbank
Announcement.

NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA OR JAPAN OR ANY JURISDICTION
WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

This announcement does not constitute an offer or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase,
subscribe for, sell or issue, or a solicitation of any offer to purchase, subscribe for, sell or issue, any
securities (whether pursuant to this announcement or otherwise) in any jurisdiction, including an offer
to the public or section of the public in any jurisdiction. This announcement does not comprise a
prospectus or a prospectus equivalent announcement.

Background
Old Mutual shareholders (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement published on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s Stock Exchange News Service, the London Stock Exchange’s
Regulatory News Service and the news services of the Malawi Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock
Exchange and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange dated 26 September 2018 (“Announcement”), wherein
it was announced that Old Mutual will unbundle (the “Unbundling”) the majority of its shareholding in
the issued share capital of Nedbank Group Limited (“Nedbank”) on Monday, 15 October 2018
(“Unbundled Nedbank Shares”). It is noted that the timing for the implementation of the Unbundling is
in line with the anticipated timeline previously communicated by Old Mutual plc to its shareholders on
20 April 2018. Capitalised terms used but not defined have the meaning given to them in the
Announcement.

In terms of the Unbundling, each qualifying Shareholder will receive 3.21176 Unbundled Nedbank
Shares (listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange), for every 100
Old Mutual shares held on the relevant securities register of Old Mutual as at 5.00 p.m. (SA time) / 4.00
p.m. (UK time) on Friday, 12 October 2018 (“Record Time”). The distribution of Unbundled Nedbank
Shares to Shareholders in the above ratio may result in fractional entitlements for the recipients.

Cash Proceeds of Fractional Entitlements
In accordance with the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“Listings Requirements”) and as
outlined in paragraph 3.2 of Part II of the Announcement, fractional entitlements to Unbundled Nedbank
Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the aggregated fractions of the
Unbundled Nedbank Shares to which a Shareholder is entitled will not be transferred to them, but will
instead be sold in the market as soon as practicable after the Unbundling.

Shareholders will accordingly receive monetary compensation in respect of their fractional entitlements
to Unbundled Nedbank Shares. In accordance with the Listings Requirements, this amount has been
determined with reference to the volume weighted average price in Rand of a share in Nedbank traded
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 10 October 2018, ZAR 249.51027 (being the
first day on which Old Mutual shares trade ‘ex’ the entitlement to receive the Unbundled Nedbank
Shares), reduced by 10% (“Cash Proceeds”). On this basis, Shareholders are advised that the Cash
Proceeds due to Shareholders in respect of any fractional entitlements is ZAR 224.55924 (ZAR
249.51027 x 0.9) per Unbundled Nedbank Share.

The Cash Proceeds will be paid (i) by Old Mutual to the relevant registered Shareholders that hold their
Old Mutual shares in certificated form and (ii) by a nominee or CSDP to the relevant Shareholders that
hold their Old Mutual shares in uncertificated form within a nominee account or within a CSDP.

Shareholders on Old Mutual’s Namibian register, Malawian register, UK register and the Zimbabwean
register will be paid the local currency cash equivalents of the Cash Proceeds. The Cash Proceeds will
be converted to local currency at the following rates:

    -   Namibia: 1.00000 Namibian dollars per Rand
    -   Malawi: 49.71197 Malawian kwacha per Rand
    -   United Kingdom: 19.33618 Rand per Pound sterling
    -   Zimbabwe: 14.64960 Rand per US dollar

Examples of fractional entitlement:

    -   Example 1: This example assumes that a Shareholder holds 100 Old Mutual shares at the
        close of business at the Record Time. The rounding convention described above is then applied
        and the Shareholder will receive 3 Unbundled Nedbank Shares in respect of the 100 Old Mutual
        shares held by them as at the Record Time and a cash payment for the fractional entitlement
        of 0.21176 x ZAR 224.55924 = ZAR47.55266

    -   Example 2: This example assumes that a Shareholder holds 1,000 Old Mutual shares at the
        close of business at the Record Time. The rounding convention described above is then applied
        and the Shareholder will receive 32 Unbundled Nedbank Shares in respect of the 1,000 Old
        Mutual shares held by them as at the Record Time and a cash payment for the fractional
        entitlement of 0.1176 x ZAR224.55924 = ZAR26.40817


Taxation
Shareholders are further referred to paragraph 4 of Part III of the Announcement, outlining the tax
treatment in respect of the Unbundling. Some additional information in relation to South African and
United Kingdom taxation is set out below. More information in relation to the tax treatment, including in
respect of Shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions other than South Africa and the United Kingdom,
is contained in paragraph 4 of Part III of the Announcement.

South African Taxation
The apportionment ratio for South African resident Shareholders is based on the closing share price of
ZAR21.55 per Old Mutual share and the closing share price of ZAR248.59 per Unbundled Nedbank
Share, on Wednesday, 10 October 2018. In accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 4.1 of
Part III of the Announcement, the Apportionment Ratio is 27.03353%, to be applied to the base cost (if
the Old Mutual shares are held as capital assets) or expenditure (if the Old Mutual shares are held as
trading stock) of the Old Mutual shares that would be allocated to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares for
South African taxation purposes. Therefore the Old Mutual shares will carry the base cost
apportionment of the remaining 72.96647%.

United Kingdom Taxation
As referred to in paragraph 4 of Part III of the Announcement, Old Mutual requested HMRC’s views on
the treatment of the Nedbank Unbundling for United Kingdom tax purposes. The summary in paragraph
4 of Part III of the Announcement reflected the initial indication received from HMRC.

Following further correspondence, HMRC have now confirmed that the receipt of Unbundled Nedbank
Shares and any Cash Proceeds pursuant to the Unbundling should constitute a capital distribution for
United Kingdom tax purposes, with the value of the capital distribution being the aggregate of the market
value (at the time of the Unbundling) of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares plus the amount of any Cash
Proceeds received. Accordingly, Shareholders who are resident in the United Kingdom should be
treated as making a part disposal of their Old Mutual shares which may, depending on the Shareholder’s
individual circumstances (including the availability of exemptions, reliefs or allowable losses), give rise
to a liability to United Kingdom capital gains tax or corporation tax on chargeable gains (as applicable).
In calculating the chargeable gain (or allowable loss) on the part disposal, a proportion of the
Shareholder’s allowable cost in his Old Mutual shares will be taken into account, equal to the proportion
which the value of the capital distribution represents of the aggregate of (i) the market value of the
Shareholder’s Old Mutual shares immediately after the Unbundling plus (ii) the value of the capital
distribution.

However, if the value of the capital distribution is small in comparison with the value of the Shareholder’s
Old Mutual shares, the Shareholder should not be treated as making a part disposal and, instead, an
amount equal to the value of the capital distribution will be deducted from the Shareholder’s base cost
in his Old Mutual shares. Under current HMRC practice, where the value of the capital distribution
received by a Shareholder is £3,000 or less, such value will generally be treated as small for these
purposes.

Save where expressly indicated, the commentary above applies only to Shareholders resident and, in
the case of an individual, domiciled or deemed domiciled for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and
to whom “split year” treatment does not apply, who hold Old Mutual shares as an investment and who
are the absolute beneficial owners thereof. Certain categories of Shareholders, including those carrying
on certain financial activities, those subject to specific tax regimes and those for whom the Old Mutual
shares are employment-related securities may be subject to special rules and the commentary above
does not apply to such Shareholders. Shareholders are recommended to consult with their own
professional advisers to consider the implications for them in light of their own circumstances.


Internal re-organisation by Old Mutual of its shareholding in Nedbank in anticipation of the
Unbundling
Following the Unbundling, the Old Mutual group will retain (in its shareholder funds) a minority stake of
19.9% in the issued ordinary share capital of Nedbank. It is intended that this minority shareholding will
be aggregated and held by Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited (""OMLACSA""),
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual, (in its shareholder funds) as the direct holder thereof.
Accordingly, in anticipation of the Unbundling and to achieve the above shareholding structure following
the Unbundling, certain internal transfers of Nedbank shares will be undertaken by indirect wholly-
owned subsidiaries of Old Mutual. Where such transfers comprise 5% or more of the issued ordinary
share capital of Nedbank, Old Mutual shall advise Nedbank thereof. Accordingly, the necessary
disclosures will be made in compliance with the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008 (as amended) in due
course.

Notice to US investors
Shareholders with a registered address in the United States of America are reminded that Unbundled
Nedbank Shares will only be delivered to Shareholders who are qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”)
and who have returned executed investor letters to Old Mutual, with a copy to the relevant CSDP,
broker, custodian or nominee in the case of Shareholders that hold their Old Mutual shares in
uncertificated form, and to the SA Registrar in the case of Shareholders that hold their Old Mutual
shares in certificated form, by the Record Time. Shareholders who are QIBs are further referred to
paragraph 2.6 of Part III of the Announcement, outlining the full details in relation to the process and
requirements for QIBs for the purpose of the Unbundling.

PART I EXPLANATORY NOTE FROM THE OLD MUTUAL BOARD

The Old Mutual Board is pleased to announce that Old Mutual will unbundle the majority of its
shareholding in the issued share capital of Nedbank on Monday, 15 October 2018, in line with the
anticipated timeline previously communicated by Old Mutual plc to its shareholders on 20 April 2018. In
consultation with Nedbank and following engagement with our advisors, we believe that now is the
appropriate time to complete this distribution. This announcement sets out the necessary information for
Old Mutual Shareholders regarding the Nedbank Unbundling and the key dates for noting.

Overview of Nedbank Unbundling

Rationale for distribution

The Nedbank Unbundling is the final step of the Managed Separation, which was materially completed
during the six months ended 30 June 2018. The Old Mutual Board believes that the Nedbank Unbundling
continues to be in the best interests of Old Mutual Shareholders as it:

-       allows investors to participate in the substantially different investment cases of Old Mutual and
        Nedbank;
                                                                                                            

-       provides a substantial return of capital to Old Mutual Shareholders; and

-       supports the efficient allocation of capital and underpins mutually beneficial arm's length
        commercial arrangements through the retention of a minority stake of 19.9% in Nedbank in the
        Group's shareholder funds.

Each qualifying Old Mutual Shareholder will receive Nedbank Shares (which are listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange) in the ratio illustrated below:



                              For every 100                         3.21176
                               Old Mutual             =>            Nedbank
                                 Shares                              Shares



Shares held in Old Mutual will be unaffected. Other than as detailed below, if you are an Old Mutual
Shareholder as at the Record Time, Nedbank Shares will be distributed to you in addition to the Old
Mutual Shares held by you as at the Record Time.

The distribution of Nedbank Shares to Old Mutual Shareholders could result in fractional entitlements for
recipients. For example, if you hold 100 Old Mutual Shares, you will receive 3 Nedbank Shares and a
fractional entitlement to 0.21176 of a Nedbank Share. If you hold 1,000 Old Mutual Shares, then you will
receive 32 Nedbank Shares and a fractional entitlement to 0.1176 of a Nedbank Share. You will receive
cash in respect of this fractional entitlement. Refer to paragraph 3.2 of Part II below for more detail on the
treatment of such fractional entitlements.

Certain restricted Old Mutual Shareholders will have their entitlements to Unbundled Nedbank Shares
sold for cash and the proceeds distributed to them. Refer to paragraph 2 of Part III of this announcement
for more information.

The Nedbank Unbundling will take place on Monday, 15 October 2018. Refer to paragraph 3.3 of Part II
below for the detailed expected timeline.

Based on the Nedbank Share price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on the Last Practicable Date,
the total distribution to Old Mutual Shareholders is approximately R43.2 billion.

The Nedbank Unbundling was approved by Old Mutual plc shareholders as part of the scheme of
arrangement in terms of which the Managed Separation was approved. Approvals for the Nedbank
Unbundling were also received from all applicable regulators and stock exchanges as part of the
Managed Separation regulatory engagement process.

Impact of the Nedbank Unbundling on key financial metrics

The financial information presented below is the responsibility of the directors of Old Mutual and has been
based on the most recently published Interim Results of Old Mutual for the six months ended 30 June
2018. The impact of the Nedbank Unbundling has been calculated using the financial information and
accounting policies as disclosed in the Interim Results of Old Mutual for the six months ended 30 June
2018 and the Nedbank Share price on the Last Practicable Date. Shareholders are advised that the
financial information included in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's
auditors.

The financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of the Nedbank Unbundling on certain
key financial metrics of the Group, and is therefore included for illustrative purposes only and due to the
nature thereof does not reflect the actual financial position or results of Old Mutual. No account has been
taken of the trading results or other changes in the financial position since 30 June 2018 except for the
adjustments in respect of the Nedbank Unbundling.

Notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information

1. There is no impact to the AHE and RoNAV outcomes and the Group Solvency ratio as these measures
have previously been disclosed in Old Mutual's 2018 Interim Results on the basis that the Nedbank
Unbundling had already occurred. For the six months ended 30 June 2018, these disclosures are
available in Old Mutual's 2018 Interim Results. For the 2017, 2016 and 2015 financial years, these
disclosures were included in the pre-listing statement in respect of Old Mutual which is available on Old
Mutual's website at www.oldmutual.com.

2. The illustrative impact to IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent for the six
months ended 30 June 2018 of R22,155 million comprises the following components:

-        A profit of R24,439 million on the deemed distribution of all Nedbank Shares owned by Old
         Mutual. The profit is calculated as the difference between the market value and the consolidated
         net asset value of Nedbank Shares on the Distribution Date.

-        A decrease of R2,284 million in IFRS profit after tax for the 6 months ended 30 June 2018. A
         lower portion of profit after tax will be included in Old Mutual's results, reflecting this change in
         ownership going forward. The IFRS profit after tax for the 6 months ended 30 June 2018 includes
         income from the current holding in Nedbank on a consolidated basis. Post the Nedbank
         Unbundling, the retained stake of 19.9% in Nedbank will be accounted for as an investment in an
         associate per IFRS requirements. The decrease of R2,284 million reflects the pro forma impact
         as if the Nedbank Unbundling had occurred on 1 January 2018.

3. The illustrative impact to Total Equity of R61,749 million as at 30 June 2018 comprises the following
        components:

-        Derecognition of the net asset value of Nedbank on a consolidated basis resulting in a decrease
         of R88,850 million.

-        An increase in Total Equity of R27,101 million representative of the retained stake of 19.9% in
         Nedbank deemed to be acquired at fair value in accordance with IFRS requirements. The fair
         value applied is expected to be the market value of the Nedbank Shares on the Distribution Date.
         For illustrative purposes, we have applied the market value of the Nedbank Shares as at the Last
         Practicable Date.

Old Mutual after the Nedbank Unbundling

The Group currently holds approximately 52% of the issued share capital of Nedbank in its shareholder
funds. After the Nedbank Unbundling, the Group will retain a minority interest of 19.9% of the issued
share capital of Nedbank in the shareholder funds of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa)
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual.
                                                                                                          

The existing arm's length commercial arrangements between Old Mutual and Nedbank will not be
affected by the Nedbank Unbundling. These arrangements are contained in the 'relationship agreement'
entered into between Old Mutual and Nedbank, which will govern the terms of their relationship upon
completion of the Managed Separation and replaces the historic relationship agreement between Old
Mutual plc and Nedbank, a copy of which is available on both the Old Mutual website at
www.oldmutual.com and the Nedbank website at www.nedbankgroup.co.za.

Nedbank odd-lot offer

Old Mutual Shareholders are referred to the announcement published by Nedbank on SENS on
Wednesday, 26 September 2018 simultaneously with the release of this announcement by Old Mutual.
Nedbank has indicated its intention to consider implementing an odd-lot offer following the Nedbank
Unbundling and as soon as practicably possible, subject to market conditions and all requisite approvals
and in accordance with JSE Listings Requirements, to all eligible Nedbank shareholders holding less than
100 Nedbank Shares, in order to enable these Nedbank shareholders to more efficiently dispose of their
odd lot holdings should they so wish and to manage the expanded nature of the Nedbank SA Register
and the Nedbank Namibian Register following the implementation of the Nedbank Unbundling.

Old Mutual Shareholders holding less than 100 Nedbank Shares are advised that, in the context of an
odd-lot offer, they will be required to make a positive election should they prefer to retain their Nedbank
Shares.

The Nedbank announcement is available on Nedbank's website at www.nedbankgroup.co.za.

PART II THE UNBUNDLING BY OLD MUTUAL OF NEDBANK SHARES

1.    Background

1.1         On 11 March 2016, Old Mutual plc announced that its board of directors believed that the
            long-term interests of Old Mutual plc shareholders and other stakeholders would be best
            served by separating the four businesses then owned by the Old Mutual plc group from each
            other so that they could operate as fully independent businesses. This strategic initiative was
            described as the Managed Separation of the Old Mutual plc group. The Managed
            Separation was materially completed in June 2018, following the demerger and listing of
            Quilter plc on the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the
            listing of the Old Mutual Shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Malawi Stock
            Exchange, the Namibian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Zimbabwe
            Stock Exchange.

1.2         The final step in the Managed Separation, being the distribution of a significant portion of the
            Group's shareholding in Nedbank to Old Mutual Shareholders on the Register at that time
            (i.e. the Nedbank Unbundling), was envisaged to take place in the final quarter of 2018. As
            announced by Old Mutual plc in November 2017, the Group will retain a minority stake of
            19.9% of the issued share capital of Nedbank in its shareholder funds after the
            implementation of the Nedbank Unbundling.

1.3         Old Mutual Shareholders are referred to the Old Mutual plc scheme circular dated 20 April
            2018 and are advised that the conditions to the Nedbank Unbundling, as set out in the
            scheme circular, have been satisfied. A copy of the scheme circular may be accessed on
            Old Mutual's website at www.oldmutual.com for information purposes only. The scheme
            circular, however, does not form a part of this announcement and its provisions are not
            incorporated by reference.

1.4         The Old Mutual Board has determined that the Nedbank Unbundling will be implemented on
            Monday, 15 October 2018, being the Distribution Date.

2.    Nedbank

2.1         The Old Mutual plc group acquired a majority interest in Nedbank, which was at the time
            known as Nedcor Limited, in 1986. Nedbank is a diversified financial services provider
            offering a wide range of wholesale and retail banking services, as well as insurance, asset
            management and wealth management solutions. It delivers its products and services through
                                                                                                      

             four main business clusters: (i) Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking, (ii) Nedbank
             Retail and Business Banking, (iii) Nedbank Wealth, and (iv) Nedbank Rest of Africa.

2.2          Nedbank ranks within the top-5 banks by capital on the African continent and Ecobank
             Transnational Incorporated (""Ecobank""), in which Nedbank holds a 21.2% shareholding,
             ranks within the top-10 banks by assets on the African continent. Nedbank is South Africa's
             third-largest bank by market capitalisation and fourth-largest by total assets and headline
             earnings. It is a leading corporate bank and a market leader in commercial property and
             renewable energy finance and has a strong position in household motor finance, household
             deposits and card acquiring. It operates a unique asset management model as part of an
             integrated wealth management business. Through its pan-African banking alliance with
             Ecobank, Nedbank provides its customers access to Africa's largest banking network.

2.3          For further information on Nedbank, Old Mutual Shareholders are referred to Nedbank's
             public disclosures. Nedbank’s public disclosures are not part of this announcement and are
             not incorporated by reference herein.

3.      The Nedbank Unbundling

3.1          Ratio of entitlement

3.1.1              The Old Mutual Board has resolved to implement the Nedbank Unbundling by way of
                   a distribution in specie of Nedbank Shares in terms of section 46(1)(a)(i) of the
                   Companies Act and out of Old Mutual's contributed tax capital (as such term is
                   construed under the South African Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962). Old Mutual will
                   distribute 158,726,732 Nedbank Shares (i.e. the Unbundled Nedbank Shares),
                   (comprising 31.73% of the issued Nedbank Shares as at the Last Practicable Date) to
                   Old Mutual Shareholders on the Register at the Record Time, being 5:00 p.m. (SA
                   time) / 4:00 p.m. (UK time) on Friday, 12 October 2018.

3.1.2              Subject to the restrictions set out below, Old Mutual Shareholders reflected on the
                   Register at the Record Time will receive:

                   3.21176 Nedbank Shares

                   for every 100 Old Mutual Shares held.

3.1.3              Old Mutual Shareholders who sell or otherwise transfer their Old Mutual Shares prior
                   to the relevant LDT will not receive any Nedbank Shares.

3.2          Fractional entitlements, Cash Proceeds and Applicable Rate

3.2.1              As required by the JSE Listings Requirements, fractional entitlements to Unbundled
                   Nedbank Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the
                   aggregated fractions of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares to which an Old Mutual
                   Shareholder would otherwise be entitled will not be transferred to them, but will
                   instead be sold in the market as soon as practicable after the Nedbank Unbundling.

3.2.2              Old Mutual Shareholders will accordingly receive monetary compensation in respect of
                   their fractional entitlements to Nedbank Shares. In accordance with JSE Listings
                   Requirements, this amount will be determined with reference to the volume weighted
                   average price in Rand of a Nedbank Share traded on the Johannesburg Stock

          securities exchange or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system in the
          United States. Neither Old Mutual nor Nedbank intends to take any action to
          facilitate a market in the Unbundled Nedbank Shares in the United States.

          endorsed the merit of, the Nedbank Unbundling or the accuracy or the

            Participants to be entitled to trade in respect of the Unbundled Nedbank
            Shares to which they are beneficially entitled, each Malawian Nominee

            Nominee Participants or by the SA Nominee for and on behalf of the

            relevant information transferred, the transfer and settlement of such
            beneficial title to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares can then be effected in
            the manner described below.

3.3.1.4.6   Subject to the checks described in paragraph 3.3.1.4.5 being completed,
            the transfer and settlement of such beneficial title to the Unbundled

            the Malawian Nominee, the SA Nominee or the Corpserve Nominee (as

            voting instruction form from the Malawian Nominee, the SA Nominee or
            the Corpserve Nominee (as applicable). Any dividends paid by Nedbank
            will be paid by the Malawian Nominee, the SA Nominee or the Corpserve
            Nominee (as applicable) into the nominated bank account of each

                        exchange rate on the day of payment. All such arrangements, amongst
                        others, will be facilitated by and performed in accordance with the terms
                        of the mandates to which (i) Malawian Nominee Participants and the

                     valid instruction in accordance with the SA Nominee Terms and Conditions. The
                     SA Nominee incurs no liability for acting on any instruction, direction or other

                expense or damage incurred by the Malawian Nominee or its agents arising as

                fabricated, inaccurate, invalid or unauthorised documentation, except as a result

3.5           Nominee arrangements put in place by Old Mutual Shareholders

              Where Old Mutual Shareholders hold their Old Mutual Shares through a nominee, custody or
              trust arrangement (other than through the OMBN Nominee, the OMSAN Nominee, the
              OMNAN Nominee or a Zimbabwean Nominee) such that the nominee, custodian or trustee is
              the registered holder of the Old Mutual Shares on the relevant Register as at the Record
              Time, it is the responsibility of such Old Mutual Shareholders holding their Old Mutual
              Shares in this manner to confirm whether their nominee, custodian or trustee is eligible to
              receive Unbundled Nedbank Shares on their behalf, vote at general meetings of Nedbank
              and receive payments by Nedbank (among other things), pursuant to the arrangements
              described above. Old Mutual Shareholders holding their Old Mutual Shares through a
              nominee, custodian or trust arrangement should contact their nominee, custodian or trustee
              for further information in this regard.

4.      Taxation

        The following summary describes certain tax consequences in connection with the Nedbank
        Unbundling in South Africa, Malawi, Namibia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the US and Zimbabwe
        only. This summary is based on the tax law and practice in force in the relevant jurisdiction as at the
        Last Practicable Date only, which are subject to change occasioned by future legislative
        amendments and court decisions, including changes that could have a retrospective effect. In the
        case of persons who are non-residents of South Africa for income tax purposes, this summary
        should be read in conjunction with the provisions of any applicable double tax agreement between
        South Africa and their country of residence.

        This summary is general and non-exhaustive commentary to certain tax consequences of the
        Nedbank Unbundling and is intended to be used only as a general guide and does not constitute
        legal or tax advice. If you are in any doubt as to your tax position, you should consult an
        independent professional adviser immediately.

4.1           South African Taxation

4.1.1                This section 4.1 summarises the South African income tax treatment for an Old Mutual
                     Shareholder that is a South African resident company, a non-South African resident
                     company with a permanent establishment in South Africa or a South African resident
                     retail shareholder that holds Old Mutual Shares as capital assets or as trading stock.
                     For the purposes of this section 4.1, the term Old Mutual Shareholder must be
                     construed accordingly.

4.1.2                The Old Mutual Board has specifically resolved to distribute the Unbundled Nedbank
                     Shares as a return of capital (paid out of ""contributed tax capital"" (""CTC"")). The
                     distribution of the Nedbank Shares on the Nedbank Unbundling should therefore qualify
                     as an “unbundling transaction” for purposes of section 46(1) of the South African Income
                     Tax Act, 58 of 1962 (as amended) (""Income Tax Act"") and should not be treated as a
                     taxable event for Old Mutual Shareholders who are resident in South Africa.
                     Consequently, the receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares by South African tax
                     resident Old Mutual Shareholders should qualify for tax relief and should not constitute
                     a “return of capital” or a “dividend” for South African tax purposes only. Dividends tax
                     should therefore not apply. Consequently, the receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank
                     Shares by Old Mutual Shareholders who are non-resident of South Africa should still,
                     however, be treated as a ""return of capital"" under general South African tax principles.
                                                                                              

4.1.3   Old Mutual Shareholders should be required to allocate a portion of the expenditure
        attributable to the Old Mutual Shares held by them to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares
        received pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling. The expenditure with respect to Old
        Mutual Shareholders’ Old Mutual Shares must be apportioned in accordance with an
        apportionment ratio described in more detail in paragraph 4.1.4 below.

4.1.4   The proportionate amount of the expenditure to be allocated to the Unbundled
        Nedbank Shares must be determined in accordance with the ratio that the market
        value of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares, as at the end of the day of that distribution,
        bears to the sum of the market value, as at that date, of the Old Mutual Shares and of
        the Unbundled Nedbank Shares (the “Apportionment Ratio”). The Apportionment
        Ratio is based on the closing share price per Old Mutual Share and the closing share
        price per Unbundled Nedbank Share on LDT+1 (as defined in the JSE Listings
        Requirements), being Wednesday, 10 October 2018.

4.1.5   In instances where Old Mutual Shareholders hold their Old Mutual Shares as trading
        stock, the expenditure used should be the amount originally taken into account by the Old
        Mutual Shareholder in respect of those Old Mutual Shares held prior to the Nedbank
        Unbundling as contemplated in section 11(a), section 22(1) and section 22(2) of the
        Income Tax Act. The expenditure to be allocated to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares
        should be determined by applying the Apportionment Ratio. Old Mutual Shareholders
        should be deemed to have incurred the expenditure allocated to the Unbundled
        Nedbank Shares on the date on which the expenditure was incurred in respect of the
        Old Mutual Shares.

4.1.6   Old Mutual Shareholders holding their Old Mutual Shares as capital assets should be
        deemed to have acquired a proportional number of Unbundled Nedbank Shares as
        capital assets. The expenditure incurred in respect of the Old Mutual Shares in terms
        of paragraph 20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act and the market value of
        those Old Mutual Shares should similarly be apportioned between the Unbundled
        Nedbank Shares and the Old Mutual Shares by applying the Apportionment Ratio.
        The portion of the expenditure allocated to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares should
        reduce the base cost of the Old Mutual Shares held. Old Mutual Shareholders should
        be deemed to have incurred the expenditure allocated to the Unbundled Nedbank
        Shares on the same date on which the expenditure was incurred in respect of the Old
        Mutual Shares.

4.1.7   As an illustrative example, assume that an Old Mutual Shareholder currently holds
        100 Old Mutual Shares and receives 3.21176 Unbundled Nedbank Shares pursuant
        to the Nedbank Unbundling. The Old Mutual Shareholder's expenditure for his
        100 Old Mutual Shares is assumed to be R2,000.00. The market value per Old
        Mutual Share post the Nedbank Unbundling is assumed to be R22.22 per share
        (using the Old Mutual Share price of R30.96 as at the Last Practicable Date as a
        proxy) and that the market value of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares post the
        Nedbank Unbundling is R272.24 per share (using the Nedbank Share price at the
        Last Practicable Date as a proxy). The Apportionment Ratio would then be
        calculated as follows:

              Apportionment Ratio = (A / (A + B))

              Where:

              A = the market value of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares at the close of the
              day after the Nedbank Unbundling (R874.37, being 3.21176 x R272.24 per
              share);

              B = the market value of the Old Mutual Shares at the close of the day after the
              Nedbank Unbundling (R2,222.00, being 100 x R22.22 per share);

              = (R874.37 / (R874.37 + R2,222.00));

              = 28.24%
                                                                                                       

4.1.7.1               The deemed expenditure to be attributed to the Unbundled Nedbank Shares
                      (3.21176 Unbundled Nedbank Shares) would be calculated as 28.24% x
                      R2,000, being R564.77, equating to deemed expenditure of R175.84 per
                      Nedbank Share.

4.1.7.2               The deemed expenditure to be attributed in turn to the Old Mutual Shares
                      (100 Old Mutual Shares) would be R2,000.00 - R564.77, being R1435.23,
                      equating to deemed expenditure of R14.35 per Old Mutual Share.

4.1.8           No securities transfer tax should be payable by the Old Mutual Shareholders in
                respect of the receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares, given that the distribution
                qualifies as an “unbundling transaction” for purposes of section 46(1) of the Income
                Tax Act and is consequently exempt.

4.1.9           Note, however, that for purposes of Old Mutual Shareholders who are non-resident of
                South Africa, where the Unbundled Nedbank Shares are transferred through the
                agency of or from a member (i.e. a Johannesburg Stock Exchange stockbroker) or
                when the transfer of shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is effected by a
                participant (i.e. a person that holds in custody and administers a listed share), the
                member or participant should be liable for the securities transfer tax. That member or
                participant may, however, recover the securities transfer tax payable from the Old Mutual
                Shareholders who are not resident in South Africa in respect of whose Old Mutual
                Shares the security transfer tax is payable.

4.1.10          For the purposes of the calculation of the securities transfer tax, the taxable amount
                shall be the following:

4.1.10.1              where shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are transferred through
                      the agency of or from a member (i.e. a Johannesburg Stock Exchange
                      stockbroker), the securities transfer tax must be calculated on the purchase
                      consideration; or

4.1.10.2              where the transfer of shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is
                      effected by a participant, the securities transfer tax must be calculated with
                      reference to the declared consideration. If no consideration is declared or if the
                      declared consideration is less than the lowest Johannesburg Stock Exchange
                      traded price on the date of the transaction, the securities transfer tax must be
                      calculated with reference to the closing price on that date.

4.2        Malawian Taxation

4.2.1           This section 4.2 summarises the Malawi income tax treatment for an Old Mutual
                Shareholder that is a Malawi resident company or a non-Malawi resident company with
                a Malawi permanent establishment that holds its Old Mutual Shares as capital assets
                and not as trading stock.

4.2.2           As the Unbundled Nedbank Shares will be distributed by Old Mutual from its CTC,
                the Nedbank Unbundling should, for Malawian tax purposes, not be treated as an in
                specie dividend distribution and will accordingly not be subject to withholding tax in
                Malawi.

4.2.3           However, in Malawi, any receipt of cash or asset is taxable as ""income"" in the hands of a
                Malawian resident. Therefore the receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares will be
                regarded as “income” in the hands of Malawian tax resident Old Mutual Shareholders.

4.2.4           Where income received is regarded as capital in nature, the taxpayer will need to identify
                a ""tax basis"" which may be offset against that taxable income. Malawian tax resident Old
                Mutual Shareholders will therefore establish a tax basis for the Unbundled Nedbank
                Shares received.

4.2.5           As regards tax on capital gains, this is calculated as the difference between the ""amount
                realised"" and the tax basis of the asset. Where there are no sale proceeds, the open
                                                                                                           

                 market value of the asset disposed of is the ""amount realised"", while the tax basis will be
                 the cost of the shares, adjusted for inflation/consumer price indices applicable from the
                 date of acquisition to the date of disposal.

4.2.6            Since the Malawian tax resident Old Mutual Shareholders will not incur any costs or
                 make any contributions for the receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares, there will likely
                 be no tax basis for the Unbundled Nedbank Shares received, and hence the full open
                 market value of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares received will be taxable.

4.2.7            That market value will also form the tax basis of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares
                 received, for purposes of determining any capital gain or loss arising on the ultimate
                 disposal of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares in future by the Malawi tax resident Old
                 Mutual Shareholders.

4.3         Namibian Taxation

4.3.1            This section 4.3 summarises the Namibia income tax treatment for an Old Mutual
                 Shareholder that is a Namibia resident company or a non-Namibia resident company
                 with a Namibia permanent establishment and that holds its Old Mutual Shares as capital
                 assets, not as trading stock (for purposes of this section 4.3 only, a ""Namibian
                 Shareholder"").

4.3.2            The Nedbank Unbundling should, for Namibian income tax purposes, be treated as an
                 in specie distribution of Unbundled Nedbank Shares by Old Mutual. Such distribution
                 should not be taxable in the hands of the Namibian Shareholders.

4.4         United Kingdom Taxation

4.4.1            Save where expressly indicated, the comments below apply only to Old Mutual
                 Shareholders resident and, in the case of an individual, domiciled or deemed domiciled
                 for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and to whom ""split year"" treatment does not apply,
                 who hold Old Mutual Shares as an investment and who are the absolute beneficial
                 owners thereof. Certain categories of Old Mutual Shareholders, including those
                 carrying on certain financial activities, those subject to specific tax regimes or benefiting
                 from certain reliefs or exemptions, those connected with Old Mutual or the Group and
                 those for whom the Old Mutual Shares are employment-related securities may be
                 subject to special rules and this summary does not apply to such Old Mutual
                 Shareholders.

4.4.2            Receipt of Unbundled Nedbank Shares and Cash Proceeds:

4.4.2.1                The receipt of Unbundled Nedbank Shares and any Cash Proceeds pursuant to
                       the Nedbank Unbundling will be a taxable event for Old Mutual Shareholders
                       who are resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes. As
                       there is some technical uncertainty, Old Mutual has requested HMRC's views on
                       whether the Nedbank Unbundling will be treated as income or as a capital
                       distribution (part disposal) for United Kingdom tax purposes.

4.4.2.2                Based on an initial indication received by Old Mutual from HMRC, Old Mutual
                       Shareholders who are resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax
                       purposes should be subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of the Nedbank
                       Unbundling in the same way as a dividend, with the consequences described
                       below. This is subject to ongoing discussion with HMRC, and Old Mutual will
                       provide an update in the event of any material change. Old Mutual Shareholders
                       are recommended to consult with their own professional advisers to consider the
                       implications for them in light of their own circumstances.

4.4.2.3                Individual Old Mutual Shareholders

4.4.2.3.1                     On the basis of the initial indication received from HMRC, a United
                              Kingdom resident individual Old Mutual Shareholder should not be
                              subject to income tax in respect of the Nedbank Unbundling if the total
                                                                                                       

                             amount of dividend income received by the individual in the tax year does
                             not exceed a dividend allowance of £2,000, which will be taxed at a nil
                             rate (the ""Dividend Allowance""). The amount of the dividend income
                             received by the individual in the tax year in which the Nedbank
                             Unbundling occurs should include an amount equal to the market value
                             (at the time of the Nedbank Unbundling) of the Unbundled Nedbank
                             Shares and any Cash Proceeds received by the individual on the
                             Nedbank Unbundling.

4.4.2.3.2                    In determining the income tax rate or rates applicable to a United
                             Kingdom resident individual Old Mutual Shareholder’s taxable income,
                             dividend income is treated as the highest part of such individual Old
                             Mutual Shareholder’s income. Dividend income that falls within the
                             Dividend Allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as
                             applicable) which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income
                             in excess of the Dividend Allowance. To the extent that a United Kingdom
                             resident individual Old Mutual Shareholder’s dividend income (which
                             should include an amount equal to the market value (at the time of the
                             Nedbank Unbundling) of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares and any Cash
                             Proceeds received pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling) for the tax year
                             exceeds the Dividend Allowance and, when treated as the top slice of
                             such individual shareholder’s income, falls above such individual
                             shareholder’s personal allowance but below the basic rate limit, such an
                             individual shareholder will be subject to tax on that dividend income at the
                             dividend basic rate of 7.5%. To the extent that such dividend income falls
                             above the basic rate limit but below the higher rate limit, such an
                             individual Old Mutual Shareholder will be subject to tax on that dividend
                             income at the dividend upper rate of 32.5%. To the extent that such
                             dividend income falls above the higher rate limit, such an individual
                             shareholder will be subject to tax on that dividend income at the dividend
                             additional rate of 38.1%.

4.4.2.4                Corporate Old Mutual Shareholders

                       On the basis of the initial indication received from HMRC, Old Mutual
                       Shareholders who are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax
                       should be subject to corporation tax on the market value (at the time of the
                       Nedbank Unbundling) of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares and the amount of
                       any Cash Proceeds distributed to them pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling,
                       unless (subject to special rules for such shareholders that are small companies)
                       the distribution falls within an exempt class and certain other conditions are met.
                       Each Old Mutual Shareholder’s position will depend on its own individual
                       circumstances, although it would generally be expected that the Nedbank
                       Unbundling should fall within an exempt class.

4.4.3            Base Cost in Unbundled Nedbank Shares:

                 Old Mutual Shareholders who are resident in the United Kingdom or otherwise subject
                 to United Kingdom corporation tax or capital gains tax should obtain an initial base
                 cost in their Unbundled Nedbank Shares equal to the market value of their Unbundled
                 Nedbank Shares at the time of the Nedbank Unbundling.

4.4.4            Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax:

                 No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable by Old
                 Mutual Shareholders in respect of their receipt of Unbundled Nedbank Shares pursuant
                 to the Nedbank Unbundling.

4.5         Zimbabwean Taxation

4.5.1            This section 4.5 summarises the Zimbabwe income tax treatment for an Old Mutual
                 Shareholder that is a Zimbabwe resident company or a non-Zimbabwe resident
                                                                                                        

             company with a permanent establishment in Zimbabwe or an individual Old Mutual
             Shareholder that holds Old Mutual Shares as capital assets, not as trading stock. For
             the purposes of this section, the term “Old Mutual Shareholders” must be construed
             accordingly.

4.5.2        As the Unbundled Nedbank Shares will be distributed by Old Mutual from its CTC, the
             Nedbank Unbundling will therefore likely be regarded as a return of capital contribution
             or initial investment in the Zimbabwean tax-resident Old Mutual Shareholders' hands.
             Such receipts are likely to be regarded as capital receipts and not dividends.

4.5.3        The source of the capital receipts (being shares in a non-Zimbabwean company) is
             offshore and not in Zimbabwe and thus no tax should arise in Zimbabwe.

4.5.4        No Zimbabwean taxation should arise on receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares
             by non-residents, even if they have a permanent establishment in Zimbabwe.

4.5.5        No Zimbabwean stamp duty should be payable by Zimbabwean tax-resident Old Mutual
             Shareholders in respect of their receipt of Unbundled Nedbank Shares.

4.6     Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations

4.6.1        This section 4.6 summarises certain United States federal income tax consequences
             relevant to Old Mutual Shareholders receiving Unbundled Nedbank Shares (or Cash
             Proceeds) pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling that are US Holders (as defined
             below) that hold their Old Mutual Shares as capital assets. The discussion does not
             cover all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the
             actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on the receipt of
             Unbundled Nedbank Shares (or Cash Proceeds) by particular investors (including
             consequences under the alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax) and
             does not address state, local, non-United States or other tax laws. This summary also
             does not address tax considerations applicable to investors that own (directly, indirectly
             or by attribution) 5% or more of the shares (by vote or value) of Old Mutual, nor does this
             summary discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of
             investors subject to special treatment under United States federal income tax laws (such
             as financial institutions, insurance companies, entities and arrangements treated as
             partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes or holders of interests in
             such entities, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-
             exempt organisations, dealers in securities or currencies, holders who acquired their Old
             Mutual Shares upon the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
             compensation, holders that have held their Old Mutual Shares as part of straddles,
             hedging transactions or conversion transactions for United States federal income tax
             purposes, persons that have ceased to be United States citizens or lawful permanent
             residents of the United States, investors holding the Old Mutual Shares in connection
             with a trade or business conducted outside the United States, or investors whose
             functional currency is not the US dollar).

4.6.2        As used in this section, the term ""US Holder"" means a beneficial owner of Old Mutual
             Shares that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen
             or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised in or under the
             laws of the United States or any State thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject
             to United States federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court
             within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of
             the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial
             decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for
             United States federal income tax purposes.

4.6.3        The United States federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement
             treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes that holds Old
             Mutual Shares will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
             partnership. US Holders that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for
             United States federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning
             the United States federal income tax consequences to them and their partners in
             respect of the Nedbank Unbundling.
                                                                                                   

4.6.4    Except as otherwise noted, this summary assumes that Old Mutual is not currently and
         was never a passive foreign investment company (""PFIC"") for United States federal
         income tax purposes. If Old Mutual is or has been a PFIC in any taxable year during
         which a US Holder held its Old Mutual Shares, materially adverse consequences could
         result for such US Holder (see paragraph 4.6.6 below). If Old Mutual is treated as a
         PFIC with respect to a US Holder for the year in which the Nedbank Unbundling occurs,
         material adverse tax consequences could arise for such US Holder. US Holders
         should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of the PFIC regime
         to the Nedbank Unbundling.

4.6.5    This section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Revenue Code""), its legislative history,
         existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions,
         as well as on the income tax treaty between the United States and South Africa (the
         ""Treaty""), all as of the Last Practicable Date and all of which are subject to change at
         any time, possibly with retrospective effect.

4.6.6    The receipt of Unbundled Nedbank Shares (or Cash Proceeds) pursuant to the
         Nedbank Unbundling is expected to be a taxable distribution by Old Mutual to
         US Holders, with the amount realised in the distribution by a US Holder equal to the fair
         market value of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares (or Cash Proceeds) distributed to it.
         The distribution generally would be treated as a dividend to the extent of Old Mutual’s
         current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal
         income tax purposes). The amount of the distribution in excess of Old Mutual’s current
         and accumulated earnings and profits generally would be treated as a non-taxable return
         of capital to the extent of the US Holder’s basis in their Old Mutual Shares and
         thereafter as capital gain. However, Old Mutual does not maintain calculations of its
         earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. US Holders should
         therefore assume that the entire amount deemed realised pursuant to the Nedbank
         Unbundling would be reported as ordinary dividend income. The distribution would not
         be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporations. The
         distribution generally would be taxable to a non-corporate US Holder at the reduced
         rate normally applicable to long-term capital gains, provided Old Mutual qualifies for the
         benefits of the Treaty, and certain other requirements are met.

4.6.7    A US Holder would have a tax basis in the Unbundled Nedbank Shares received equal to
         their fair market value, determined in US dollars and the US Holder’s holding period for
         the Unbundled Nedbank Shares would begin on the day of receipt of such Unbundled
         Nedbank Shares.

4.6.8    A non-United States corporation will be a PFIC in any taxable year in which, after
         taking into account the income and assets of the corporation and certain subsidiaries
         pursuant to applicable ""look-through rules"", either (i) at least 75% of its gross income is
         “passive income” or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of its assets is attributable to
         assets which produce passive income or are held for the production of passive
         income. For this purpose, ""passive income"" generally includes interest, dividends,
         royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions. Exceptions are
         provided for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business and income
         derived in the active conduct of a banking business. A substantial portion of the income
         and assets of Old Mutual and its subsidiaries, including Nedbank and its subsidiaries,
         is attributable to passive assets held in connection with insurance and banking
         businesses conducted by certain of Old Mutual’s subsidiaries and Nedbank’s
         subsidiaries. Accordingly, the eligibility of these businesses for such exceptions is central
         to the determination of the PFIC status of Old Mutual.

4.6.9    Special rules under the PFIC regime generally allow banks to treat their banking
         business income as non-passive in certain circumstances. To qualify for these rules, a
         bank must satisfy certain requirements regarding its licensing and activities. Old Mutual
         believes that its and Nedbank’s banking subsidiaries should currently meet these
         requirements.

4.6.10   It is unclear how to apply the PFIC rules and the active insurance exception to non-
         United States insurance companies, such as Old Mutual’s insurance subsidiaries and


       
                                                                                                            
                      Nedbank’s insurance subsidiaries, offering products that, while conforming to the
                      regulatory requirements applicable to insurance companies in their respective
                      jurisdictions, do not conform to those applicable to United States insurance companies.
                      Old Mutual believes that its insurance subsidiaries each met the requirements of the
                      active insurance exception for 2016 and 2017. However, the United States Congress
                      recently enacted legislation modifying certain aspects of the active insurance
                      exception rules applicable to taxable years beginning after 31 December 2017. As a
                      consequence, some of Old Mutual’s insurance subsidiaries may not meet the
                      requirements of the active insurance exception in 2018 or future years.

4.6.11                Based on its interpretation of the applicable law, the composition of its income, the
                      valuation of its assets and the activities conducted by it and its subsidiaries, Old
                      Mutual does not believe that it was a PFIC in the taxable year ended 31 December
                      2017 and does not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year. No assurance is
                      given that Old Mutual was not a PFIC in any prior year. In addition, because these
                      determinations are factual in nature and subject to change, there can be no assurance
                      that the income and activities of the insurance subsidiaries and banking subsidiaries of
                      Old Mutual and Nedbank have qualified in the past, currently qualify, or will qualify in
                      the future, for the active insurance exception and/or the active banking exception, or that
                      Old Mutual will not be a PFIC for the current year or in the future.

4.6.12                Distributions paid pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling by a United States paying agent
                      or other United States intermediary will be reported to the US Internal Revenue
                      Service and to the US Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup
                      withholding may apply to these distributions if the US Holder fails to provide an
                      accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to
                      comply with applicable certification requirements. Certain US Holders are not subject to
                      backup withholding. US Holders should consult their tax advisers about these rules and
                      any other reporting obligations that may apply to the receipt of Unbundled Nedbank
                      Shares (or Cash Proceeds), including requirements related to the holding of certain
                      “specified foreign financial assets”.

4.7            Sweden Taxation

4.7.1                 This section 4.7 summarises certain Swedish income tax considerations in relation to
                      the Nedbank Unbundling for an Old Mutual Shareholder that is resident in Sweden for
                      tax purposes.

4.7.2                 Special tax consequences that are not described below may apply for certain categories
                      of taxpayers, including investment companies, mutual funds, life insurance companies
                      and shares held by a partnership or as current assets in a business operation. Further,
                      specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, an Old Mutual
                      Shareholder realises a capital loss on the shares and to any currency exchange gains or
                      losses. Credit of foreign taxes is not addressed in these paragraphs.

4.7.3                 The Nedbank Unbundling should, for Swedish income tax purposes, be treated as
                      distribution in kind of Unbundled Nedbank Shares (or Cash Proceeds) by Old Mutual.
                      Such distribution should normally be taxable in the hands of Swedish tax resident Old
                      Mutual Shareholders as a regular dividend.

4.7.4                 Dividends are normally taxed at a rate of 30% for individuals (capital income) and 22% for
                      legal entities (business income). The rate applicable to business income may be reduced to
                      21.4% in 2019 and further reduced to 20.6% in 2021. The acquisition cost for the
                      Unbundled Nedbank Shares received by way of distribution in kind should be equal to
                      the amount taxed as income on receipt of the Unbundled Nedbank Shares.

         Old Mutual Shareholders are reminded that the foregoing taxation summary is a general and non-
         exhaustive commentary to certain tax consequences of the Nedbank Unbundling and that it does
         not constitute legal or tax advice. If you are in any doubt as to your tax position, you should consult
         an independent professional adviser.

Rationale for the Consent Solicitation and the Proposals
In March 2016, the Old Mutual Group announced the managed separation of its four underlying businesses
from each other, being Old Mutual Emerging Markets, Nedbank, Old Mutual Wealth and OM Asset
Management (the “Managed Separation”). The Company notes the material completion of the Managed
Separation of the Old Mutual Group and the completion of previous tender offers in respect of the Securities
made by the Company that were announced on 25 October 2017 and 9 July 2018. Following the material
completion of the Managed Separation, Old Mutual Limited is now the holding company of Old Mutual plc
and Old Mutual plc has requested that each of Moody’s and Fitch withdraw their ratings of each Series of
Securities and Old Mutual plc. On 21 July 2018, Fitch withdrew its ratings of each Series of Securities and
Old Mutual plc.

In light of the previous tender offers resulting in the retirement of a significant portion of the Securities and
the changes to the Company due to the Managed Separation that have taken place since the Securities were
issued, the purpose of the Consent Solicitation and the Proposals is to utilise available liquidity to continue
to manage the Company’s debt maturity profile by further reducing outstanding indebtedness and associated
interest costs by retiring the relevant Series in full should the relevant Proposal be implemented. In such
case, the Consent Solicitation and the Proposals will also provide liquidity to Securityholders.

Details of the Proposals
The Company is inviting Securityholders of each Series to approve, by an Extraordinary Resolution pursuant
to the relevant Conditions and the relevant Meeting Provisions of such Series, amendments (in respect of
each Series, a “Proposal”) to the Conditions and the Trust Deed of such Series to insert a new Condition
7(n) (in respect of the 2021 Securities) and Condition 7(k ) (in respect of the 2025 Securities) as follows:

           “7[(n)][(k )]            Early Redemption by the Issuer (“Issuer Early Redemption”)

                        The Issuer shall, on the Settlement Date, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes at the
                        Early Redemption Amount together with interest accrued to, but excluding, the Settlement
                        Date.

                        For the purposes of this Condition 7[(n)][(k )]:


1
    Please ref er to the section “Further Information and Terms and Conditions – The Proposal” in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum f or detail of how
    the Early Redemption Amount is determined with ref erence to the Early Redemption Spread.
2
    For illustrativ e purposes only , a hy pothetical Early Redemption Amount is set out in the table abov e in respect of each Series which has been calculated
    on the basis of a Settlement Date f or such Series of 1 Nov ember 2018, the Early Redemption Spread f or such Series and (i) in the case of the 2021
    Securities, a hy pothetical Ref erence Gilt Rate of 0.8930 per cent. or (ii) in the case of the 2025 Securities, a hy pothetical Ref erence Gilt Rate of 1.3400
    per cent. By way of ref erence, as at 11:00 am (London time) on 25 September 2018, the Ref erence Gilt Rate f or the 1.50 per cent. UK Treasury Gilt
    due 22 January 2021 (ISIN: GB00BY Y 5F581) was 0.8930 per cent. and the Ref erence Gilt Rate f or the 2.00 per cent. UK Treasury Gilt due 7
    September 2025 (ISIN: GB00BTHH2R79) was 1.3400 per cent. Security holders should note that, if the Extraordinary Resolution in respect of either
    or both of the Series is passed, the actual Early Redemption Amount in respect of the relev ant Series will be determined in the manner described in
    the Consent Solicitation Memorandum and could dif f er signif icantly from the hypothetical Early Redemption Amount f or such Series set out in the table
    abov e.
3
    If the Proposal f or either Series is implemented, the total consideration (expressed as an amount per £1,000 in nominal amount of the relev ant
    Securities) pay able to any holder of such Series f rom whom a v alid Solicitation Instruction in f av our of the relev ant Extraordinary Resolution is received
    by the Tabulation Agent by the Consent Deadline, subject as set out in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum, will be calculated as the sum of (I) the
    applicable Early Redemption Amount and (II) the product of £1,000 and the Consent Fee. For illustrativ e purposes only , a hy pothetical total
    consideration amount is set out in the table abov e which has been calculated on the basis of the hy pothetical Early Redemption Amount f or such
    Series set out in the table abov e. Security holders should note that the actual total consideration in respect of the relev ant Series will be determined in
    the manner described in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum and could dif f er signif icantly from the hy pothetical total consideration amounts set out
    in the table abov e.
4
    Expressed as a percentage of the nominal amount of the relev ant Securities.
                       “Consent Fee” has the meaning given to such term in the Consent Solicitation

                                 the Notes on the Settlement Date is equal to the sum of the Reference Gilt Rate plus
                                 the relevant Early Redemption Spread, minus (ii) £1,000 multiplied by the Consent
                                 Fee;

                       “Early Redemption Spread” has the meaning given to such term in the Consent Solicitation

4.00 p.m. (London time) on 22 October 2018 (the “Consent Deadline”). The Deadline for receipt by the
Tabulation Agent of valid Solicitation Instructions in favour of the relevant Extraordinary Resolution for
Securityholders to be eligible for the Consent Fee is the Consent Deadline.

Solicitation Instructions in favour of an Extraordinary Resolution will, subject to the provisions of the relevant
Trust Deed, be irrevocable except in the limited circumstances described in the Consent Solicitation
Memorandum.

Consent Fee
The Company will pay to each Securityholder from whom a valid Solicitation Instruction in favour of the
relevant Extraordinary Resolution is received by the Tabulation Agent by the Consent Deadline, an amount
equal to 3 per cent. of the nominal amount of the relevant Securities that are the subject of such Solicitation
Instruction (the “Consent Fee”), subject to (i) such Solicitation Instruction not being validly revoked (in the
limited circumstances in which such revocation is permitted), (ii) the relevant Extraordinary Resolution being

duly passed and the relevant Supplemental Trust Deed being executed and delivered by the Company and
the Trustee and (iii) the Company not having previously terminated the Consent Solicitation in respect of the
relevant Series in accordance with the provisions for such termination set out in the Consent Solicitation
Memorandum. Where payable, the Company will pay the Consent Fee in respect of the Securities that are
the subject of such Solicitation Instructions no later than the Settlement Date.
By submitting a Solicitation Instruction, a Securityholder will instruct the Principal Paying Agent to
appoint one or more representatives of the Tabulation Agent as their proxy to attend the relevant
Meeting (and any adjourned such Meeting) and vote in the manner specified or identified in such
Solicitation Instruction in respect of the relevant Extraordinary Resolution. It will not be possible to
submit a Solicitation Instruction without at the same time giving such instructions to the Principal
Paying Agent.

To be eligible to receive the Consent Fee, each Securityholder who submits a Solicitation Instruction in favour
of the Extraordinary Resolution must further not attend, or seek to attend, the relevant Meeting in person or
make any other arrangements to be represented at such Meeting (other than by way of their Solicitation
Instruction(s)). Securityholders may choose to attend and vote at the relevant Meeting in person or to make
other arrangements to be represented or to vote at such Meeting in accordance with the provisions for
meetings of Securityholders set out in the Meeting Provisions without submitting a Solicitation Instruction in
favour of the relevant Extraordinary Resolution. However, such Securityholders will not be eligible to receive
the Consent Fee, even if at the Meeting such Securityholder votes in favour of the relevant Extraordinary
Resolution or if other arrangements are made by the Consent Deadline.

Issuer Early Redemption
If, in respect of either Series, the relevant Extraordinary Resolution is passed and the relevant Supplemental
Trust Deed is executed and delivered, the total amount that will be paid to a Securityholder of such Series
on the relevant Settlement Date for the Securities of such Series held by such Securityholder redeemed
pursuant to the relevant Issuer Early Redemption will be the cash amount (rounded to the nearest £0.01,
with half a pence rounded upwards) equal to the sum of:

(a)     the product of (i) the aggregate nominal amount of the Securities of such Series held by the relevant
        Securityholder redeemed pursuant to the relevant Issuer Early Redemption divided by £1,000 and
        (ii) the relevant Early Redemption Amount;

(b)     the Accrued Interest Payment on such Securities; and
(c)     if a valid Solicitation Instruction from such Securityholder in favour of the relevant Extraordinary
        Resolution was received by the Tabulation Agent by the Consent Deadline, and if the conditions to
        payment of the Consent Fee are satisfied, the Consent Fee in relation to such Securities.

The aggregate amounts of each Early Redemption Amount, each Accrued Interest Payment and Consent
Fee (where appropriate) for Securities in each Clearing System will be paid, in immediately available funds,
by no later than the relevant Settlement Date to such Clearing System for payment to the cash accounts of
the relevant Securityholders in such Clearing System, as further described in the Consent Solicitation
Memorandum.
The Meetings

Notices convening the Meetings, to be held at the offices of Linklaters LLP, One Silk Street, London EC2Y
8HQ on 25 October 2018, have been given to Securityholders in accordance with the relevant Trust Deed
on or around the date of the Consent Solicitation Memorandum.

The Meeting in relation to the 2021 Securities is to be held at 10.00 a.m. (London time) on 25 October 2018.
The Meeting in relation to the 2025 Securities is to be held at 10.15 a.m. (London time) on 25 October 2018.

At each Meeting, holders of the relevant Series will be invited to consider and, if thought fit, pass the relevant
extraordinary resolution (each, an “Extraordinary Resolution”) to approve the implementation of the
relevant Proposal.

The quorum required for each Meeting is one or more persons present holding Securities of the relevant
Series or voting certificates or being proxies or representatives and holding or representing in the aggregat e
not less than two-thirds of the nominal amount of the relevant Series for the time being outstanding. In the
event the necessary quorum is not obtained at a Meeting, such Meeting shall stand adjourned for a period
being not less than 13 clear days nor more than 42 clear days. At any adjourned Meeting, one or more
persons present in person holding Securities of the relevant Series or voting certificates or being proxies or
representatives and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than one-third of the nominal amount
of the relevant Series for the time being outstanding will form a quorum.
To be passed, each Extraordinary Resolution requires a majority consisting of not less than three-fourths of
the votes cast at the relevant Meeting. If passed, such Extraordinary Resolution shall be binding on all holders
of the relevant Series, whether present or not at the relevant Meeting and whether or not voting.
The implementation of an Extraordinary Resolution, if passed, is conditional on the Company not having
previously terminated the Consent Solicitation in respect of the relevant Series in accordance with the
provisions for such termination set out in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum and subject to the Company
and the Trustee executing and delivering the relevant Supplemental Trust Deed.

Securityholders should refer to the relevant Notice for full details of the procedures in relation to the relevant
Meeting.

Shareholders are referred to Old Mutual’s Interim Results announcement dated 31
August 2018, wherein the company declared an interim dividend of 45 cents per
share and a special dividend of 100 cents per share, which will be paid on 16
October 2018.


Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be
paid in the local currency equivalents of the interim and special dividends. In
Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe these payments will be made through dividend access
trust or similar arrangements established in each country.


The local currency equivalents of the Interim and Special dividend have now been
established as follows:


Malawi               69.05           Malawi kwacha per share
Namibia              145             Namibian cents per share

Zimbabwe             9.49            US cents per share



These local currency equivalents have been calculated using the following
exchange rates:


Malawi              47.6190       Malawian kwacha per Rand
Namibia             1.0000        Namibian dollars per Rand

Peter Moyo, Old Mutual Limited Chief Executive, said:
'With our debut results as Old Mutual Limited, I am pleased to report that we are on track to deliver on the
commitments we have made to investors. We delivered solid financial results in a tough environment and
have made good progress against most of our 8 battlegrounds driven through deliberate management
action. There is renewed momentum and excitement in the Group following our listing and this is captured in
our new vibrant branding launched recently. Whilst we continue to see economic headwinds in the near term,
our Group is resilient and we are on track with our financial targets.'

Strong financial results(1):
- Results from operations (RFO) of R4,848 million, up 7% (HY 2017: R4,530 million
- Adjusted headline earnings (AHE) of R5,393 million, marginally up on prior year (HY 2017: R5,359 million
- AHE per share of 112.3 cents per share, in line with prior year
- IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent of R10,648 million up 42% (HY 2017: R7,503
  million) mainly due to the accounting effects of the sale and distribution of Quilter shares
- Declaring first interim dividend of 45 cents per share, representing 40% of AHE, in line with our
  dividend policy
- Declaring special dividend of 100 cents per share
- Funds under management (FUM) up 2% to R1.097 billion
- Net client cash flow (NCCF) of R9.4 billion, an increase of R7.8 billion (HY 2017: R1.6 billion)
- RoNAV of 17.5%, down from 19.4% reflecting lower investment returns.
- Group solvency ratio of 164%, reflecting capital resilience of the Group

Strategic delivery:

- Good progress against the majority of our 8 battlegrounds with positive progress in the turnaround of Old
  Mutual Insure as well as strong sales in Corporate and Mass and Foundation Cluster
- Successful listing of Old Mutual Limited on five stock exchanges on 26 June 2018, delivering the material
  completion of Managed Separation
- Further steps have been taken to simplify the Group's balance sheet with the execution of a debt tender
  offer in July which reduced the nominal value of our international debt in Residual plc by R5 billion
- We achieved approximately R270 million of recurring cost savings in the first half of 2018, incurring one off
  costs of R70 million. We remain on track to achieve our cost efficiency target of R1 billion of run rate
  savings by the end of 2019.
- Due to complete the Nedbank unbundling as planned in Q4 2018. This will mark the completion of the
  Managed Separation announced in March 2016
- The distribution of Quilter delivered the majority of Quilter shares to Old Mutual plc shareholders and the
  successful sale of a portion of Quilter shares realised R4.2 billion of cash on the Residual plc balance
  sheet.

OVERVIEW

On 26 June 2018, Old Mutual Limited listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), with secondary
listings also taking place on the same day in the United Kingdom, Namibia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. This
momentous occasion marked the material completion of Managed Separation and the start of a new
journey for Old Mutual Limited. We are making strides towards shaping our balance sheet through the
acceleration of converting net asset value to cash in Residual plc and we are on track to complete the
unbundling of 32% of Nedbank during the fourth quarter.

Operating environment
The first six months of 2018 were characterised by volatility in global equity, currency and bond markets due
to escalating global trade tensions and the revived United States (US) economy. US Federal Reserve rate
hikes and sporadic geopolitical issues adversely affected emerging markets. These global dynamics, in
addition to weak local economic data, negatively affected the South African economic landscape, with
GDP contracting by 2.2% in the first quarter.

Persistently high unemployment rates, a Valued Added Tax (VAT) rate increase, and fuel hikes have
contributed to lower real disposable incomes for local consumers. This adversely affected our customer
acquisition and persistency, especially in the middle income market. The economic outlook has however
improved relative to a year ago, when political uncertainty prevailed and credit downgrades led to an even
weaker operating environment. The election of Cyril Ramaphosa as President of South Africa, a return to
fiscal consolidation in the 2018 budget, and improvements in governance and accountability taking place
at State Owned Entities (SOEs) have resulted in an increase in business and consumer confidence, although
weighed-down by concerns around land expropriation without compensation.

The South African equity market declined with the JSE SWIX down 6.3% since the start of the year, but 8.4% up
on H1 2017 driven by improved investor sentiment in the second half of 2017. The rand weakened to R13.73
against the US dollar at the end of June 2018, a decline of 10.8% since the end of December 2017. This
reflected US dollar strength and the emerging market sell-off. The average exchange rate however
strengthened by 7% when compared to the prior year. This has had an adverse impact on the reported
profits from the Rest of Africa, particularly Zimbabwe.

Inflation continued to remain within the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) target range at a 12-month
average of 4.5% in June 2018, lower than the average of 5.1% in the prior year. The inflation outlook is benign
and expected to be closer to the upper end of the target range in the short to medium term due to upward
pressures from effects such as rising utility, transport costs and oil prices.

In Zimbabwe, the economy continues to recover from weak investor confidence, policy instability and a
liquidity crisis. Political uncertainty remains a concern and contributed to the volatility experienced in the
Zimbabwean Stock Exchange which has affected our investment returns. Zimbabwe's National Election took
place on 30 July 2018 with Emmerson Mnangagwa being elected as President by a narrow margin. It is too
early to tell whether the new government can implement the structural and political reforms that are
required to improve the economic and social conditions of the country.
Kenya's economy reflects a more stable political landscape though our investment returns are still negatively
affected by the volatility experienced towards the end of 2017.
Nigeria and Ghana benefited from rising oil prices, which led to a moderate economic recovery in the West
African region.

Financial performance
We delivered a solid set of overall financial results during this half year despite tough market conditions. Our
top line growth was strong with excellent Net Client Cash Flow (NCCF) of R9.4 billion mainly reflecting good
flows and significantly improved retention. Funds Under Management (FUM) of R1.1 trillion grew 2% from the
end of December 2017, reflecting the impact of the strong NCCF, largely offset by lower asset values.

Results from Operations (RFO) of R4,848 million increased by 7% over the period reflecting good operational
performance. We delivered Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) of R5,393 million, a marginal increase of 1%
above the prior period. On a per share basis AHE was 112.3 cents, flat relative to the prior period as a result
of a small quantum of shares issued during the period that increased the weighted average number of
shares.

Return on Net Asset Value (RoNAV) of 17.5% was down from 19.4% reflecting an increase in average
Adjusted IFRS equity.

The Group SAM solvency ratio decreased marginally to 164% (FY 2017: 167%), largely as a result of the special
dividend declared.

Our battleground scorecard
We remain committed to delivering value in the medium term through our strategic priorities which are
defined through our eight battlegrounds.

Nedbank unbundling
We remain on track to complete the final step of Managed Separation through the distribution of 32% of
Nedbank to our shareholders. We plan to do this in the fourth quarter of 2018. For every one hundred Old Mutual Limited
shares at the point of distribution, shareholders will receive approximately three Nedbank shares. Further
details will be communicated in due course. After the completion of the Nedbank unbunding we will own
19.9% of Nedbank in our shareholder funds. We view this as a long term investment and this ownership
underpins significant commercial benefits we derive from the continuation of this relationship.

Dividend
We have declared an interim dividend of 45 cents per share. In accordance with our stated dividend
policy, consideration has been given to the Group's underlying local cash generation, fungibility of earnings,
targeted liquidity and solvency levels, business strategic requirements and market conditions. The interim
dividend represents 40% of Adjusted Headline Earnings per share, in line with our dividend target.

We are also pleased to declare a special dividend of 100 cents per share. Following a review of all capital
available at 30 June 2018, and taking into account capital and liquidity projections to the end of the
financial year we have identified excess capital available to pay a special dividend. In setting the quantum
of the special dividend we have balanced the need to be efficient at the operating subsidiary level against
remaining within the desired range for our Group Solvency ratio.

These dividends will be paid on 16 October 2018. Further details of the timetable for the exchange rate
conversion for dividends payable in currencies other than rand will be communicated in due course.

Outlook
In July, the SARB revised their 2018 GDP forecast for South Africa down to 1.2% from 1.7%, a reflection of a
deteriorating outlook in SA. Recent announcements of foreign investments into SA as well as progress in
improving the management of SOEs show potential for an economic turnaround, however this is likely to only
take place in the medium to long term.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast 3.4% growth for sub-Saharan Africa, with a revised forecast
for Zimbabwe at 2.4% (up from less than 1%), and more than 2% growth in the East and West African
countries we operate in. This presents the opportunity for our operations in those regions to grow their
consumer base and product lines.

Global growth is still expected to rise, assuming trade tensions and market risks do not result in a downturn
that will affect global and local markets.

In spite of the deteriorating SA growth outlook, the above macroeconomic risks and strong competitive
pressures, we remain confident in delivering solid 2018 results mostly aligned with our previously
communicated medium term targets. AHE will continue to be influenced by investment returns in South
Africa and Zimbabwe.

We delivered a solid set of financial results during this half year despite tough economic and consumer
conditions. Our top line growth was strong with Life APE sales up by 13% and NCCF of R9.4 billion (HY 2017: R1.6
billion) mainly reflecting good gross flows from Wealth and Investments and Old Mutual Corporate and improved
investment performance in Wealth and Investments resulting in significant improvement in the retention of client
money. FUM of R1.1 trillion grew 2% from the end of December 2017, reflecting the impact of the strong
NCCF, offset by lower investment returns.

RFO of R4,848 million increased by 7% over the period reflecting good operational performance, particularly
in Mass and Foundation Cluster, Old Mutual Insure and Rest of Africa. This was partially offset by worse
mortality and morbidity experience in Personal Finance.

We delivered AHE of R5,393 million, a marginal increase of 1% above the prior period. The growth in RFO and
higher associate earnings in respect of the 19.9% stake in Nedbank were offset by lower investment returns in
South Africa and Zimbabwe. On a per share basis AHE was 112.3 cents, flat compared to the prior period as
a result of a small quantum of shares issued during the period impacting the weighted average number of
shares (WANS).

RoNAV of 17.5% was down from 19.4% reflecting an increase in Average adjusted IFRS Equity following the
strong investment performance experience in H2 2017 and positive investment returns in H1 2018 on this
higher equity base.

We declared an interim dividend of 45 cents per share and a special dividend of 100 cents per share,
resulting in a total of R7.1 billion being paid to our shareholders. The declaration of the special dividend has
resulted in a deduction from our own funds, in line with SAM requirements to deduct the foreseeable
dividend. This has resulted in a decrease in our Group solvency ratio to 164% from 167%.

Accounting implications of Managed Separation
Managed Separation resulted in the listings of Old Mutual Limited and Quilter. The majority of the shares in
Quilter (86.6%) were distributed to existing Old Mutual plc shareholders alongside the sale of 9.6% to new
shareholders. The listing of Old Mutual Limited was effected via a UK court scheme of arrangement which
inserted Old Mutual Limited as the new holding company of the residual Old Mutual plc Group, after the
Quilter distribution, by way of a share for share exchange.

From an accounting perspective the transaction was treated as a reorganisation of an existing group. The
insertion of a holding company between shareholders and an existing group does not result in any change in
the economic substance of the reported group. As such, the financial statements of Old Mutual Limited
have been prepared on a predecessor basis. Consequently, the current period results up to listing and the
comparatives presented for Old Mutual Limited reflect the values from the consolidated financial statements
of the previous Old Mutual plc Group with the exception of the equity structure that has been adjusted to
reflect that of the new entity, being Old Mutual Limited. Refer to Note A1 in the interim financial statements
for additional information.

Other accounting impacts of Managed Separation include the recognition of a profit of R2,852 million in the
consolidated results as a result of the distribution and sale of Quilter shares. Included within this profit is a loss
on the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves of R394 million. The share for share exchange and
the distribution of Quilter further led to an IFRS 2 accelerated vesting charge of R282 million recognised in the
IFRS consolidated income statement. This is as a result of the modification of the underlying share awards
subject to the existing share-based payment arrangements of Old Mutual plc Group.

RFO is the primary measure of the business performance of each of the operating segments. Activities
related to the Group's capital structure and central costs form part of the Other Group Activities segment, to
the extent that they are not managed as part of operating segments.

Central Expenses
Central expenses of R89 million (H1 2017: R176 million) decreased by 49%. As part of an increased effort to
more accurately measure the economic contribution of each segment, project costs that were previously
accounted for centrally have been allocated to segments in H1 2018. The allocation of project costs to
segments to the extent that it did not relate to group activities is based on planned spend. Year to date
project spend is lower than planned spend resulting in an over recovery in central expenses. This was offset
by an increase in costs to establish reporting functions for Old Mutual Limited as a stand alone listed entity.

Shareholder investment return for H1 2018 was R1,177 million, a decline of R692 million, or 37%, from R1,869
million for H1 2017. The decrease is due to subdued equity returns in South Africa, impacting the protected
equity holding and a normalisation of equity returns in Zimbabwe following strong equity performance in H1
2017.

Finance costs
Finance costs on long term debt that supports the capital structure of the Group increased to R337 million
(H1 2017: R286 million) following the issuance of subordinated debt instruments to the nominal value of R500
million by Old Mutual Insure in November 2017. Overall higher interest rates experienced in South Africa over
the last twelve months also contributed to the increase in finance cost, given OMLACSA has both fixed rate
and floating rate bonds in issue.

Income from associates

Subsequent to the Nedbank unbundling, the Group will retain a minority shareholding of 19.9%, which will be
managed as part of Other Group Activities and it has been included on this basis in AHE. Income from
associates, as reflected in AHE, increased by 33% to R1,398 million (H1 2017: R1,049 million) as Ecobank
Transnational Incorporated (ETI) returned to profitability which had a significant impact to Nedbank's
headline earnings. Our investment in China is also managed as part of the Group's investment in associates.

(1) IFRS does not allow the recognition of investment returns on Group debt and equity instruments held by life policyholder funds, however,
    these returns are recognised in the valuation of the related policyholder liabilities. This creates a mismatch in IFRS, which is eliminated in
    AHE. The movement is a function of the fair value movement for the period.
(2) Represents the elimination of non-recurring expenses or income related to material acquisitions, disposals or a fundamental restructuring
    of the Group. These items are removed from AHE as they do not represent operating activities of the Group. Amounts in the current
    period largely reflect the accelerated vesting of the IFRS 2 charge as a result of the share for share exchange and the Quilter
    distribution. Current and comparative period include Managed Separation costs.
(3) Comparatives as disclosed in the SENS announcement on 7 August 2018, have been represented to reclassify the results of Old Mutual
    Bermuda from Residual plc to discontinued operations.
(4) AHE includes associate income in respect of 19.9% shareholding in Nedbank in order to reflect earnings from the continuing operations
    of the Group. This is removed as part of this reconciliation as the full earnings related to Nedbank are included in discontinued
    operations.

Discontinued operations

Nedbank
Nedbank reported a strong performance in a domestic macroeconomic environment that remained
challenging and volatile. HE increased 27.0% to R6,696 million, boosted by associate income from ETI
returning to profitability, while the managed operations (excluding ETI earnings) produced headline earnings
growth of 2.0% to R6,562 million, with slow revenue growth and slightly higher impairments offset by good
cost management.

Nedbank is classified as held for distribution and presented as part of the discontinued operations,
notwithstanding the Group's stated plan to hold a minority shareholding of 19.9% in the issued share capital
of Nedbank in its shareholder funds after the Nedbank unbundling. Post the Nedbank unbundling, we will
cease the consolidation of Nedbank into our financial results and will commence equity accounting, which
will result in the initial recognition of the minority shareholding in Nedbank at fair value, in accordance with
IFRS.

Latin America
Profits of our businesses in Latin America remained flat period over period. We saw continued good profits
from Colombia demonstrated by an improvement in the asset management result and various initiatives to
enhance sales in the AIVA business, including the consolidation of broker commitments and special offers
and incentive programmes. Future growth prospects for the AIVA business remain challenging due to future
loss of income from the distribution of products to Quilter following a change in product specifications.

The sale of our businesses in Latin America are subject to required regulatory approvals in the relevant
jurisdictions. All required applications have been made and the approval process is underway. As at 30 June
2018 the sale of businesses in Latin America remains on track to be completed in the first half of 2019.

Quilter
As a result of applying predecessor accounting our results for H1 2018 includes profit generated by Quilter up
to its listing on 25 June 2018. Quilter's contribution to the Group's profit from discontinued operations was
R743 million (H1 2017: R443 million). Refer to Note G1 in the financial statements for additional information on
discontinued operations.

Old Mutual Bermuda
By the end of H1 2018 approximately 98% of the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulations benefit (GMAB)
reinsurance obligations matured. The remaining reinsurance obligations will mature during H2 2018 and the
ultimate closure of the business is expected by 31 December 2018. Old Mutual Bermuda made no contribution
to the Group's profit or loss in H1 2018 as the market risks on the reinsurance obligations were managed by the
hedging programme and a liquidation provision was established at December 2017 to capitalise all anticipated
future operational losses.

Residual plc
The loss attributable to Residual plc reduced by 40% to R901 million. Lower finance costs due to the
repurchase of subordinated debt securities in 2017, and lower costs incurred to resolve pre-existing Old
Mutual plc risks contributed to the decrease in losses from the prior period. This was partially offset by other
income related to the release of a deferred tax provision and higher advisory costs due to heightened
activity leading up to the listing of both Old Mutual Limited and Quilter in H1 2018.

IFRS profit after tax
Profit after tax increased by 42% largely due to the distribution and the sale of Quilter shares which resulted in
the recognition of a profit of R2,852 million in the consolidated results. Included within this profit is a loss on the
recycling of foreign currency translation reserves of R394 million. An impairment to UAP in H1 2017 was not
repeated in H1 2018, which further contributed to the increase period over period.

(1) Fungibility restriction represents the free surplus generated in Zimbabwe which cannot be remitted.

Free Surplus Generated from Operations was R3.5 billion, an increase of R0.2 billion, from R3.3 billion in H1
2017 representing 64% of the Group's AHE, compared to 62% in H1 2017. AHE increased marginally period
over period, as such the increase was mainly driven by the non-fungible free surplus being a lower proportion
of total surplus. This was partially offset by a change in capital requirements following a methodology
change following the implementation of SAM. The methodology change included a review of the approach
used to allocate required capital to different products within and across segments. As we continue to
refine our capital allocation methodology it may result in further impacts on free surplus generation.

Zimbabwe delivered a positive, yet reduced, free surplus of R0.4 billion in H1 2018 (H1 2017: R0.9 billion). The
free surplus generated in Zimbabwe does not contribute to the Group metric due to fungibility constraints.
The abnormally high investment returns during the 2017 financial year have not been repeated to date, with
equity market performance in Zimbabwe remaining volatile. In H1 2018 Zimbabwe's AHE made up a lower
proportion of total Group AHE and the fungibility restriction has therefore had a less dilutive impact on total
free surplus generation.

Residual plc

Old Mutual Bermuda
Old Mutual Bermuda has now largely run off and 98% of the reinsurance obligations have matured as at 30
June 2018. The surplus capital in Old Mutual Bermuda of R1 billion at 30 June 2018 has reduced by R1.1
billion from December 2017 largely due to a capital repatriation of R1,078 million ($90 million) made in March 2018 following
approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). A further capital repatriation of R660 million ($49 million) was
approved by the BMA in July 2018. The remainder of the surplus capital is anticipated following the ultimate
closure of the business and may be released to Old Mutual Group (UK) Limited and in turn Old Mutual plc
over time, subject to regulatory approval.

Old Mutual plc
Following the listing of Old Mutual Limited, Old Mutual plc is now a wholly owned, non-operating subsidiary of
Group. The decrease in net asset value of 31% to R10.2 billion at 30 June 2018 (R15.1 billion at 31 December
2017) is largely due to the net settlement of certain intercompany loans between Old Mutual plc and Quilter
ahead of the listing of Quilter and costs incurred in the wind down of the head office. This decrease was
offset by an increase in cash and near cash instruments reflecting the cash proceeds received by Old
Mutual plc following the sale offer of Quilter shares.

On 19 July 2018, Old Mutual plc further reduced international debt by R5.2 billion through a tender offer of
Tier 2 debt instruments. The formal credit ratings on Old Mutual plc were also withdrawn shortly after the date
of the Tender Offer Memorandum.

Old Mutual plc will continue to incur corporate costs in 2018 until the head office wind down is completed.
These costs remain in line with previous guidance and our current best estimate of the realisable economic value of
Residual plc is in line with the approximately R7,170 million (GBP400 million) previously indicated when the Second UK court
scheme of arrangement became effective on 26 June 2018. The repurchase of the Tier 2 debt instruments
resulted in a benefit to the economic value of approximately R264 million (GBP15 million) but this is was largely offset by the
transfer of Old Mutual (Netherlands) B.V. with a net asset value of R290 million (GBP16 million) to Old Mutual Limited on 29 June 2018.

Old Mutual Limited will remain subject, inter alia, to the undertaking to the UK Court as described in the
announcement dated 20 June 2018 in respect of Old Mutual plc. The UK court scheme allows for reviews of
the surplus assets on a quarterly basis commencing 1 October 2018. Any potential transfer by Old Mutual plc
will need to take into account the developments and future assessments by the Board of Old Mutual plc, at
such a point in time, of liabilities and contingent liabilities and in line with its fiduciary duties. The final
development of economic value and surplus assets is subject to changes in estimates and uncertainty.

RoNAV
RoNAV decreased by 1.9% to 17.5% (H1 2017: 19.4%). RoNAV in South Africa increased by 0.4% to 18.5% (H1
2017: 18.1%). The increase was primarily due to higher operating results and underlying profit growth in
Nedbank as ETI returned to profitability. This contributed to an increase in AHE of 12% versus an increase in
average Adjusted IFRS Equity of 9%. The increase in equity was mainly due to higher accumulation of profits
than in comparative periods and the impact of the translation of foreign operations with the rand
weakening against foreign currencies, partially offset by the impact of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments effective
1 January 2018.

RoNAV in Rest of Africa decreased by 12.2% to 13.2% (H1 2017: 25.4%). Strong operational performance that
led to an increase in RFO of R110 million or 30%, was offset by a decrease in shareholder investment returns of
R656 million or 52%, due to normalisation of equity returns in Zimbabwe following strong equity performance
in 2017. This contributed to a decrease in AHE of 37% versus an increase in average Adjusted IFRS Equity of
13%. The significant increase in Average adjusted IFRS Equity is largely driven by strong investment returns in
H2 2017 that contributed to a higher opening equity base in H1 2018 and was further enhanced by the
weakening of the rand against the US dollar and Kenyan shilling in H1 2018.

Invested Shareholder Assets
Invested shareholder assets increased by 12% to R40.3 billion (FY 2017: R36.1 billion). The asset base in South Africa
saw a R2.3 billion or 10% increase period over period, following the investment of profits generated during H1 2018.

An increase of R1.9 billion or 14% in Rest of Africa is driven by positive investment returns, albeit lower than in H1
2017, off a high asset base created by strong investment returns in Zimbabwe in H2 2017. The weakening of the
rand against the US dollar and Kenyan shilling in H1 2018 further contributed to the increase of our asset base in
East Africa.

For the listed equities backing our capital in South Africa we aim to limit capital losses through the use of hedges.
We aim to reduce the cost of our hedges by sacrificing a portion of our return upside. Downside protection is
structured to limit capital losses to between 5% and 15% on an annual basis. The market did not reach the strike
levels on any of our hedges during the period.

Gearing
Gearing ratios are marginally down following the issuance of subordinated debt instruments to the nominal
value of R500 million by Old Mutual Insure in November 2017, offset by an increase in equity attributable to
operating segments. The increase in equity was due to higher accumulation of profits, driven by strong
operational results in South Africa. Positive investment returns, albeit lower than in H1 2017, and the
weakening of the rand against the US dollar and Kenyan shilling resulted in an increase in equity in Rest of
Africa. Interest cover decreased to 22 times (H1 2017: 26 times) reflecting an increase in finance costs of 18%
due to higher interest rates and the fresh issuance in H2 2017, whilst growth in AHE remained relatively flat
period over period.

The Return on embedded value remained strong at 11.7%, despite a decrease of 2.4% from 14.1% for FY 2017.
MCEV operating earnings (post-tax) increased by 4.2% to R3,874 million (H1 2017: R3,717 million), mainly due to the
increase in new business and dividend withholding tax excluded from MCEV earnings in H1 2018. This is a function
of externalised dividends no longer flowing through Old Mutual (Netherlands) B.V. following the Managed
Separation.

Experience variances decreased earnings by R216 million, driven by poor persistency, and materially lower
positive claims variances in Mass and Foundation Cluster and Personal Finance compared to H1 2017. The macro
environment continued to put strain on persistency experience. Overall claims experience remained satisfactory
relative to long-term assumptions, despite unfavourable experience in Personal Finance and poor group disability
experience in Old Mutual Corporate persisting despite management actions. Recurring expenses remained
lower than assumed, supported by ongoing tight expense management across the business. Investment returns
were significantly lower than in H1 2017, particularly equity returns and resulted in negative variances.

(1) The standard formula under SAM is used for OMLACSA.
(2) Nedbank is included on a Basel III basis in Group solvency. This is different to the treatment in the OMLACSA calculation where the
    holding is included in the Own Funds at the market value of the shares, with an equity stress applied to calculate the SCR.
(3) To the extent that some of the surplus is deemed fungible it will contribute positively to the overall Group surplus.
(4) This category includes the balance of the Group, including holding companies, Old Mutual Insure, asset managers and Rest of Africa,
(5) Represents the elimination of intercompany assets between entities e.g. the investment of a holding company in a subsidiary and
    diversification of risks within entities subject to accounting consolidation, most importantly between OMLACSA and Old Mutual Insure.
(6) Includes fungibility restrictions where the own funds for certain entities are restricted to the solvency capital requirement of that entity
    (calculated on a SAM basis). The most material non-fungible surplus relates to Zimbabwe and Residual plc.

The Insurance Act came into effect on 1 July 2018. The Group is in the process of applying for regulatory
approval of methodologies applied in the calculation of solvency ratios presented. The OMLACSA solvency
ratio decreased marginally when compared to FY 2017. Emerging profits were more than offset by a
provision for dividends expected to be paid in H2 2018. A portion of the special dividend will be funded by
OMLACSA and this results in lower own funds.


The Group solvency ratio decreased marginally by 3% to 164% in H1 2018 (H1 2017: 167%) largely as a result of
the inclusion of foreseeable dividends in own funds. The foreseeable dividend includes the special dividend
and the ratio before allowing for the special dividend, would have increased to 169%.

Risk Management

We continue to monitor and manage the risks our Group face. Our assessment of the key risks are set out
below.

Macro-Economic and Socio-Political Risk
The South African Reserve Bank has recently revised the gross domestic product growth forecast for 2018,
from 1.7% to 1.2%. South Africa's unemployment rate has increased to 27.2% in the second quarter. The first
half of 2018 also saw a Value Added Tax (VAT) increase and fuel hikes. These all contribute to increased
financial pressure on consumers, the result of which impacts our business risk in the form of reduced demand
for our products and services and increases in lapses and credit default risk. In addition to the lower growth
outlook, policy statements from Government on land expropriation without compensation may negatively
affect investment sentiment.

The Zimbabwe economy remains weak and uncertain, and although our business has proved to be resilient,
our ability to remit earnings out of Zimbabwe is constrained due to the foreign currency shortage, which also
creates currency translation uncertainty.

Market, Liquidity and Credit risks are actively managed and monitored by both management and specialist
line 2 assurance functions.

Technology and Systems Risk
The organisation has a high dependency on IT as a true enabler for innovation and therefore future growth
and sustainability. The stability and maintenance of the current IT infrastructure is largely being addressed
through the SA Transformation program. Although positive progress has been made, the scale and
complexity contributes to increased execution risk, and creates opportunity cost to other development.
There are nevertheless promising signs of innovation in different areas of the business, complemented by the
enterprise-wide digital transformation and focus.

Cyber Risk
There is evidence of increased frequency and sophistication of attacks on financial service organisations.
Cyber-attacks could result in operational losses, business interruptions, loss of critical company or customer
data and consequently reputational damage. The organisation has updated its Information Security
Strategy, aimed at achieving a higher level of resilience, and actions to achieve this are being implemented.

Conduct Risk
Due to our large tied adviser forces in the SA Life Retail businesses, the organisation has a high degree of
exposure to advice risk.    Consistency and robustness of advice processes is a key focus area of the
management within the businesses.

Life Insurance Risk
There is a risk that adverse mortality rates experienced in 2017 and in 2018 to date is resistant to
management actions being taken. An extensive experience investigation has been undertaken to assess
whether the negative experience is due to normal volatility or an underlying deterioration, and actions are in
progress to improve the underwriting result.

Governance and Control of Subsidiaries
Governance and control in some of our subsidiary businesses in East and West Africa has fallen short of
Group requirements. We have made management changes and taken actions to strengthen controls over
core processes to reduce the risk of operational losses.

Interim and special dividend declarations

The Board of directors has approved and declared an interim dividend of 45 cents per ordinary share and a 
special dividend of 100 cents per ordinary share.

The interim dividend targeting 40% of interim Adjusted Headline Earnings is in line with Old Mutual Limited's dividend policy. 
The interim dividend will be paid out of distributable reserves and is payable on 16 October 2018 to all ordinary shareholders recorded 
on the record date. The dividend of 45 cents per ordinary share will be subject to a local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in 
a net interim dividend, to those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 36 cents per ordinary share. International 
shareholders who are not exempt or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation agreement will be subject to dividend 
withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

The special dividend of 100 cents per ordinary share is in line with our capital management policy of returning excess capital to shareholders 
and will be paid from distributable reserves on 16 October 2018 to all ordinary shareholders recorded on the record date, subject to the requisite 
South African Reserve Bank approval required for special dividends. The special dividend of 100 cents per ordinary share will be subject to a local 
dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net special dividend, to those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 80 cents 
per ordinary share. International shareholders who are not exempt or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation agreement will 
be subject to dividend withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

Shareholders on the London, Malawian, Namibian and Zimbabwean registers will be paid in the local currency equivalents of the interim and special dividends. 
In Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe these payments will be made through dividend access trust or similar arrangements established in each country.

Old Mutual Limited's income tax number is 9267358233. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share register at the date of declaration is 4,942,048,355.

Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"")

KPIs are not defined by the relevant IFRS financial reporting framework, but we use them to provide greater
insight to the financial performance, financial positions and cash flows of the Group and the way it is
managed.
The table below sets out the definitions of KPIs used by the Group.

KPIs                             Definition
Results from Operations          The primary measure of the business performance of the operating segments.
                                 Calculated as Adjusted Headline Earnings before shareholder tax and non-
                                 controlling interest, excluding net investment return on shareholder assets and
                                 finance costs and income from associates.

Adjusted Headline Earnings       The Group profit measure that adjusts headline earnings, as defined by SAICA
                                 Circular 2/2015, for the impact of material transactions, non-core operations
                                 and any IFRS accounting treatments that don't fairly reflect the economic
                                 performance of the business.

Return on Net Asset Value        Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by average Adjusted IFRS Equity. Adjusted
                                 IFRS Equity is calculated as equity attributable to operating segments before
                                 adjustments related to consolidation of funds. It excludes equity related to
                                 Residual plc and discontinued operations and is further adjusted to recognise
                                 the equity attributable to the retained 19.9% interest in Nedbank.

Free Surplus Generated from      Free Surplus Generated from Operations represents the net cash generated
Operations                       from the operations that contribute to AHE after allowing for normal course
                                 investment in the business and the impact of any fungibility constraints.
    
Gross flows                      The gross cash flows received from customers during the period by Group
                                 businesses engaged in Life and Savings and Asset Management.

Life APE sales                   A standardised measure of the volume of new life insurance business written. It
                                 is calculated as the sum of new business recurring premiums (annualised) and
                                 10% of the new single premiums written in an annual reporting period.

NCCF                             The difference between gross flows and cash returned to customers (e.g.
                                 claims, surrenders, maturities) during the period.

FUM                              The total market value of funds managed by the Group, at the point at which
                                 funds flow into the Group.

VNB                              The discounted value of expected future profits arising from new life insurance
                                 business sold in the reporting period.

VNB margin                       VNB divided by PVNBP, where PVNBP is the discounted value of expected
                                 future life insurance premiums from new recurring premium business, plus 100%
                                 of new single premiums. The VNB margin reflects how much future profit is
                                 expected from each future life insurance premium and therefore measures the
                                 profitability of new business sold.

GWP                              The value of premiums that a property and casualty insurer is entitled to
                                 receive from its insurance business in a period, before adjustments for
                                 reinsurance premiums. It is a measure of sales performance in Group businesses
                                 engaged in Property and Casualty.

Underwriting margin              Underwriting result as a percentage of net premiums earned. It is calculated
                                 for the Property and Casualty businesses across the Group.

Loans and advances               The balance of gross loans and advances for Group businesses engaged in
                                 Banking and Lending. The amounts are gross of impairments on all performing,
                                 arrears and default loans.

Net lending margin               Net interest income plus non-interest revenue minus credit losses, as a
                                 percentage of average loans and advances over the period.

Mass and Foundation Cluster review

Defend South African market share in mass and corporate markets
Consumer confidence was high early in the year following political developments but has subsequently
pulled back. This has contributed to negative pressure on disposable income following high unemployment
rates, VAT and fuel increases. We have maintained strong sales despite increased competitor activity.

Enhanced sales force productivity has translated into strong life and loan sales growth. Life sales improved in
H1 2018 compared to the prior year but are expected to moderate in H2 2018 should challenging market
conditions persist. Money Account remains one of the most competitive transactional solutions in the South
African market, with the number of active accounts increasing by 34% in H1 2018. Funeral claims process
improvements resulted in better customer experience with circa 99% of funeral claims that are paid into
Money Accounts within 4 hours and any other account within 8 hours.

(1) The   % change has been calculated with reference to FY 2017.

Life APE sales of R2,142 million showed strong growth of 21%. This was due to our continued drive to grow
adviser headcount and productivity as well as positive customer experience related to the funeral claims
process. The retail branch network contributed 30% of Life APE sales, consistent with H1 2017, and continues
to deliver better persistency and productivity experience than other channels. Gross flows increased by 14%
to R6,532 million off the back of growth in the life insurance book and customer take-up of annual premium
increases, combined with good growth in Money Account take up and usage. This contributed to a R0.2
billion increase in NCCF to R3.1 billion.

Loans and Advances increased by 11% to R13,432 million since 31 December 2017, due to improved
productivity as a result of process enhancements around customer take-on. Customer risk assessment has
been enhanced with improved offers to low risk customers and more stringent requirements for high risk
customers. The increase is muted by the transitional adjustment required as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9
- Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018.

RFO of R1,534 million increased by 17% despite the increase in allocation of central expenses previously
carried at a group level. Life profits increased by 15% due to growth in the life insurance book, higher life APE
sales and customer take up of annual premium increases combined with good cost management. Non-life
profits were up 26% due to a decrease in amortisation of acquired intangibles compared to H1 2017. It was
further enhanced by an improved credit loss ratio of 5.4%, which was 90 bps better than H1 2017. The
adoption of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, effective 1 January 2018, requires higher provisions on new loans
and advances and is expected to create profit strain if the increase in disbursements persists.

The higher new business volumes contributed to the VNB of R655 million which increased by 12% and also
improved the VNB margin of 10.5% by 30 bps, partially offset by lower margin as a result of promotions run to
improve sales.

The net lending margin of 14.4% was 90 bps down due to the effect of a one off positive impact related to
alignment of provisioning models to payment behaviour in the prior year. Excluding this one off item, the H1
2018 margin increased marginally on prior year primarily due to a continued positive collections experience.

Personal Finance review

Defend and grow in the South African personal finance market
Intense competition continues to be a characteristic of this market. A tough economic environment
continued to place strain on consumer disposable income due to persistently high unemployment rates, VAT
and fuel increases which had an adverse effect on customer acquisition especially in the middle income
market.

A number of initiatives have been launched to drive sales in this tough economic environment including the
re-pricing of guaranteed annuity products and tactical improvements to the pricing of disability and severe
illness in the second quarter which supported income and protection sales in H1 2018.

The launch of the Old Mutual Rewards loyalty programme in July 2018 is one of the strategic initiatives to
strengthen our penetration in the middle income market. Also, 22seven launched ""Goals"" in H1 2018 to allow
customers to personalise their savings objectives. We won the Financial Intermediaries Association Risk
Provider of the year award.

Despite headwinds in the macro-economic environment and higher than normal mortality and morbidity
rates in H1 2018, we are taking actions to improve the profitability of the risk book although the effects of
these actions are likely only to be seen in 2019.

(1) The   % change has been calculated with reference to FY 2017.

Gross flows increased by 4% to R12,970 million mainly due to higher single premium sales across life and non-
life savings products. Higher death and disability claims and higher disinvestments led to negative NCCF of
R1.8 billion, a decrease of R0.5 billion from H1 2017. Outflows in NCCF and the decline in the South African
equity markets in H1 2018 contributed to a decrease of 3% resulting in FUM of R188.5 billion at 30 June 2018.

Life APE sales reduced by 2% to R1,221 million largely due to lower recurring premium sales on savings and
risk products reflecting pricing competitiveness in the market. Satisfactory growth in single premium sales for
savings and income products and protection sales improved in the second quarter driven by tactical pricing
initiatives.

RFO of R918 million decreased by 34% when compared to H1 2017. The decrease was a function of higher
than expected death and disability claims, with a number of large death claims which fell below the
reinsurance threshold. A number of management actions are underway and we continue to monitor and
assess underlying mortality trends. Lower investment variances due to lower market returns and a higher
allocation of central expenses further contributed to the decrease.

VNB increased by 15% to R100 million mainly due to lower distribution costs allocated to life products
following a methodology change in H2 2017. Consequently, the VNB margin increased by 20bps to 1.3%,
mainly due to the lower distribution cost allocation offset by the impact of lower sales volume and margin
mix.

Wealth and Investments review

Improve the competitiveness of Wealth and Investments
Markets were largely negative for the first quarter of the year. Strong momentum in NCCF with high quality
flows was driven by an improved Wealth proposition and sustained investment performance. Strong NCCF
demonstrates traction in gaining market share and ongoing improvement in our product offerings. Higher
origination activity in Specialised Finance and our participation in South Africa's renewable energy sector via
investment through Alternatives are encouraging indicators of building a diversified Wealth and Investment
business.

Investment performance momentum continued with retail funds performing well with 67% of core funds
above median over three and five years. Multi-asset funds have continued to perform particularly well over
2018 with 7 out of 8 core retail and institutional offerings in the top quartile. Our flagship Retail Balanced and
Flexible Fund is now top quartile over one and five years, while 3 out of 4 core retail Multi-asset funds have 4-
star Morningstar ratings. Old Mutual Investment Group has been named the Best Managed Company in the
Financial Services Sector and won the headline award for Best Managed Company of the year at the Top
500 Awards 2018.

Gross flows of R45,114 million increased by 6% following proposition improvements which resulted in higher
flows, as well as large flows secured in Old Mutual International. Growth in flows, good retention in the
institutional asset management business resulting from improved investment performance and the non-
occurrence of large client outflows in H1 2017 has resulted in a significant increase of R9.1 billion in NCCF.
AUM was marginally positive from FY 2017, with the positive impact of strong NCCF offset by weak market
performance in H1 2018.

Total revenue increased by 4% to R2,374 million primarily due to higher asset-based institutional fee income,
offset by margin pressure in our Wealth and Specialised Finance businesses. The non-annuity revenue in our
Alternatives and Specialised Finance businesses showed a strong result, with the renewable energy
investment being one of the contributors, whilst reflecting the benefits of our responsible business efforts. The 
H1 2017 revenue has been restated to report revenue gross of external asset management fees to be on a
comparable basis with H1 2018.

RFO was R783 million, an increase of 23% from H1 2017. The increase is largely attributable to acquisition
related intangibles being fully amortised in 2017. Growth in non-annuity revenue of 68% due to higher
origination income in Specialised Finance and a one off fair value gain in an Alternatives fund contributed to
profit delivery.

Old Mutual Corporate review

Defend South African market share in mass and corporate markets
We made good strides in defending our market share, particularly in the competitive market for multi-
employer retirement funds (umbrella funds). Umbrella life APE sales almost doubled compared to H1 2017 as
a result of a large single premium deal. The management actions undertaken to restore the group risk
underwriting experience continue to gain good traction. These management actions included income
protection re-pricing and launch of the new Well4Work range, a range of four flexible group income

protection benefits that will allow clients to tailor the desired balance between benefits and price. As
expected, there were a number of group risk schemes that terminated following decisions to not match
uneconomically low competitor rates. We remain focused on improving underwriting margins to expected
long-term levels.

Old Mutual Corporate won awards in three categories at the Imbasa Yegolide Awards earlier this year. The
awards recognise service providers in the employee benefits industry who meet the needs and expectations
of retirement fund members by delivering excellent service.

(1) The % change has been calculated with reference to FY 2017.

Strong Life APE sales of R1,451 million, an increase of 25%, was mainly due to higher single premium pre-
retirement savings sales into SuperFund and Old Mutual Multi-Managers. Recurring premium sales are lower
than in H1 2017 largely due to lower group risk sales that were impacted by premium rate increases to
improve profitability.

Gross flows increased by 30% to R21,723 million mainly due to improved life sales. This, in addition to improved
termination experience contributed to a strong NCCF uplift of R1.1 billion to R0.8 billion. FUM of R258.2 billion
increased by 1% with the growth in NCCF mostly offset by downward pressure from equity markets.

RFO of R854 million delivered good growth of 7% mainly due to better group life assurance underwriting
experience underpinned by lower average claims sizes. This was partially offset by higher allocation of
central expenses.

At R168 million, VNB grew by 29% largely as a result of higher sales volumes and capital optimisation
initiatives. The VNB margin was maintained at 1.2% due to margin pressure on the mix of business sold,
despite an increase in sales volumes.

Old Mutual Insure review

Continued turnaround of Old Mutual Insure
Our capability and skills have been strengthened over the last few years by bringing in experts in specific
fields which facilitated disciplined and tightened underwriting criteria. The general environment improved
with low market wide losses due to a benign claims environment. No catastrophe claims reported to date
however from past experience, catastrophe losses have a higher probability of occurrence in the second
half of the year due to weather patterns.

Organic growth has been muted particularly in our commercial, personal and agriculture portfolios in part by
ongoing remediation, tough market conditions and slower than anticipated new business volumes.
Optimising the interplay between facultative reinsurance, deductible structures and treaty applicability
continues to contribute to more consistent underwriting results in volatile and commoditized sectors. iWYZE
delivered strong growth as a result of pursuing a profitable growth strategy that leverages operational
efficiencies, strategic partnerships and focused marketing. Initiatives to increase gross written premiums are
starting to gain traction.

A number of claims initiatives have been launched to improve customer experience and operational
efficiencies. We continue to focus on the restoration of profitability through ongoing reviews and portfolio
reconstruction, focused deployment of underwriting capacity, enhancing claims processes and optimising
procurement.

The gross written premiums reported for the first half of the year were R6,293 million, an increase of 3%. The
constrained growth in 2018 is due to remediation and tighter underwriting criteria in line with management
actions, as well as slower than anticipated new business volumes impacted by current market conditions.

RFO was R370 million, an increase of 85% compared to H1 2017, largely due to a benign claims environment
with no catastrophe losses (relative to fires in Eastern and Western Cape in H1 2017). Improved contribution
from the commercial and personal intermediated business, iWYZE growth and disciplined underwriting
contributed to the increase in RFO, partially offset by lower profits in CGIC.

The strong net underwriting result led to an improved net underwriting margin of 6.4% which is above the
medium term target range. Insurance margin improved by 390 bps to 8.7% as a result of underwriting
performance and positive reform on free float capital flows.

Rest of Africa review

Turnaround East African business and improve returns across the Rest of Africa
We have made continued progress on the turnaround In East Africa. During H1 2018 we completed a staff
reorganisation to optimise staffing levels and eliminate duplication. This has resulted in a reduction of staff
levels and is expected to drive savings going forward. The cost of this reorganisation was approximately R70
million and has impacted reported profits and underwriting margins in H1 2018 for the region.

SADC remains the largest contributor to Rest of Africa results and continues to deliver good performance
despite tough trading conditions. In Zimbabwe, CABS delivered pleasing results supported by management
actions to improve margins and grow the loan book. In Malawi, management actions in anticipation of the
pension reforms have yielded significant growth in the pension business.

In West Africa the bancassurance licence was obtained in May 2018 and subsequently sales agents have
been mobilised across 62 Ecobank branches with good production already recorded. The Nigeria life
business also received approval for its critical illness product, which was launched during Q2 2018. Our
property and casualty business in Nigeria experienced significant claims from the oil and gas industry which
adversely impacted underwriting results. Management is reviewing reinsurance levels to address exposure to
this class of business.

(1)The % change has been calculated with reference to FY 2017.

Gross flows decreased by 4% mainly due to a large one off inflow in East Africa in H1 2017 which offset good
growth in life and non-life sales in SADC and East Africa. These flows, together with the appreciation in equity
market values in Zimbabwe and the effects of foreign exchange movements contributed to a 12% growth in
FUM to R116 billion. NCCF decreased by 56% to R0.7 billion, mainly driven by large outflows in Namibia due to
a portfolio rebalancing by the Namibian government following regulatory changes.
Life APE sales were up marginally by 2% to R555 million due to higher life sales in Malawi driven by pension
reform, the growing corporate book in Botswana, growth in retail sales in Zimbabwe and Malawi. This was
offset by lower sales in West Africa due to lower credit life sales and regulatory changes in Nigeria and lower 
corporate sales in Ghana.

Gross written premiums decreased by 7% to R1,783 million. In East Africa the decline is driven by increased
competition and remediation of the book through the non-renewal of loss making accounts.

Loans and advances rose to R14,206 million, up 26% mainly driven by growth in the CABS book. Net lending
margin decreased marginally by 10bps mainly driven by lower margin business written in H1 2018.

RFO increased by 30% to R478 million, supported by a 24% increase in RFO for SADC due to good growth in
the loan book at CABS and positive investment returns in Namibia and Zimbabwe. Strong underwriting results
in Malawi's group life business further contributed to profit growth. RFO for East Africa decreased 
largely as a result of the costs incurred to execute the staff reorganisation and the impact of civil strife in South Sudan.

Excluding the impact of the staff reorganisation in East Africa, there is an improvement in the underlying
underwriting margin as a result of management actions taken to improve claims and remediation of the
book. This is partially offset by poor claims experience in the Nigeria business as the industry is facing
significant claims in the oil and gas industry.

VNB decreased by 20% to R102 million mainly due to a less profitable mix of business and methodology
changes to align with the SAM capital framework. The VNB margin subsequently reduced by 100 bps.

Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
For the six months ended 30 June 2018

Background information

In March 2016, Old Mutual plc announced that its board believed that the long term interests of Old Mutual plc shareholders and other
stakeholders would be best served by separating the four businesses then owned by the Old Mutual plc Group from each other so that they
could operate as fully independent businesses. These four businesses were Old Mutual Emerging Markets, OM Asset Management plc
(OMAM, now Brightsphere Investment Group), Nedbank and Old Mutual Wealth (now Quilter plc). As at 31 December 2017, OMAM had
already been separated from the Old Mutual plc Group following a phased sell-down.

To effect the above strategy, referred to as Managed Separation, the following steps were executed during the six months ended 30 June 2018:

- The listing of Quilter plc on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the distribution of 86.6% of its total
  share capital to Old Mutual plc shareholders and the sale of up to 9.6% by way of a cash placing to institutional investors.
  
- The formation and listing on the JSE (primary), LSE and the stock exchanges of Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe, of a new entity, being Old
  Mutual Limited. Immediately prior to the listing, Old Mutual Limited became the new holding company of Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries,
  which mainly comprised the remaining operating businesses namely Old Mutual Emerging Markets and Nedbank. The results and position of
  this new Group have been presented within this set of unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (interim financial
  statements). More details on the basis of preparation and the comparative information presented in these interim financial statements have been
  presented in note A1.

The final step of Managed Separation will be achieved through the unbundling (in terms of South African law) of up to 32% of the issued
share capital of Nedbank to shareholders of Old Mutual Limited, whilst retaining a minority interest of 19.9% in the shareholder funds.
Further details on Managed Separation and the transactions that have occurred during the period are set out in note A2. More information
on the businesses classified as held for sale and distribution and as discontinued operations is set out in note G1.

(1) On 22 June 2018, Old Mutual plc reduced the nominal value of its ordinary share capital and cancelled its share premium accounts through the creation of distributable reserves. As a result,
    R10,079 million and R19,557 million respectively were transferred to retained earnings. Refer to note A2 for more information.
(2) The available-for-sale reserve is no longer applicable from 1 January 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 9. Refer to note G5 for more information.
(3) Included in the closing balance for other reserves is R394 million liability credit reserve on borrowed funds. The Group recognises fair value gains and losses on the borrowed funds designated
    at fair value through profit or loss. The cumulative fair value gains and losses as a result of changes in the credit risk of the issued bonds are recognised in other comprehensive income and not
    in profit or loss. The balance of the total fair value gains and losses on these instruments is recognised in profit or loss.
(4) Transfers between reserves include R1,660 million transferred from the share-based payment reserve to retained earnings relating to Quilter (R1,136 million) and Old Mutual plc (R524 million)
    as a result of the accelerated vesting of employee share schemes.
(5) As a result of the distribution and initial public offering of Old Mutual plc's entire shareholding in Quilter, merger reserves of R19,506 million were transferred to retained earnings.
(6) Other movements in share capital and share premium are the issue of shares in Old Mutual plc to satisfy the exercise of share options (pre-exchange). Other movements in retained earnings
    represent movement in treasury shares.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
For the six months ended 30 June 2018

A: Significant accounting policies

A1: Basis of preparation

Statement of compliance
Old Mutual Limited (the Company) is a company incorporated in South Africa. On 25 June 2018, the Company became the parent of Old
Mutual plc through a share for share exchange, with the Company receiving the entire net asset value of Old Mutual plc, the original parent
company of Old Mutual Limited and its subsidiaries, in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares of the Company to the original
shareholders of Old Mutual plc. This was a reorganisation of the existing Group and, although there was a change in legal ownership, there
was no change in the economic substance of the reporting entity. Therefore the transaction was not a business combination as defined by
IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (interim financial statements) have
consequently been prepared on a predecessor basis as a continuation of the existing Group.

The interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2018 consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together the Group) and equity account the Group's interest in associates and joint ventures (other than those held by investment-linked
insurance funds which are accounted for as investments at fair value through profit or loss).

The interim financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position at 30 June 2018, consolidated income statement,
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, supplementary income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2018 and selected explanatory notes. The interim financial
statements have been prepared under the supervision of C.G. Troskie CA(SA) (Chief Financial Officer) on the going concern basis, which
the Directors believe is appropriate. The Directors of the Group take full responsibility for the preparation of interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act (Act No 71 of 2008)
of South Africa. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these interim financial statements are in terms of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the IASB and are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Group's 2017
consolidated financial statements, except for changes arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 15 'Revenue
from Contracts with Customers', as set out in note G5 to the interim financial statements.

These interim financial statements do not include all the notes typically included in the annual financial statements and should therefore be
read in conjunction with the Group's audited consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended 31 December 2017. The interim
financial statements are presented in South African rand, which is the Group's presentation currency.

Details for businesses classified as held for sale and distribution and as discontinued operations are set out in note G1.

Comparative information
Comparative information presented at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 within these interim financial statements, has been
correctly extracted from the Group's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 (financial statements) , 
re-presented for businesses classified as discontinued operations during the six months ended 30 June 2018, if appropriate, as
described in note G1. Comparative information presented for the six months ended 30 June 2017 within these interim financial statements
is that of Old Mutual plc converted to South African rand and re-presented for businesses classified as discontinued operations during the
six months ended 30 June 2018. Comparative information for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is unaudited.

The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, were prepared for the purposes of Group reporting in accordance with
IFRS and consolidate the financial information of Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries and equity accounts the interest in associated
undertakings and joint ventures (other than those held by investment-linked insurance funds and venture capital divisions which are
accounted for as investments at fair value through profit or loss), after converting it to rand. This is consistent with the preparation of the
Historical Financial Information of Old Mutual plc (HFI) as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2017 that was prepared solely for
the inclusion in the Old Mutual Limited Prospectus and Pre Listing Statement published on 20 April 2018.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of both the financial statements and the HFI, have been applied consistently to all
periods presented.

The information presented in the financial statements is equivalent to that presented in the HFI with the exception of the consolidated
statement of changes in equity. In preparation of the Old Mutual Limited financial statements, in accordance with IFRS, certain components 
of equity have been re-presented as at 1 January 2015. The Group believes that it is more appropriate to reflect rand only components of 
equity at the historical rand rate as opposed to the exchange rate used at 1 January 2015, when converting Old Mutual plc balances from sterling 
to rand for the purposes of the HFI. The reserves and related amounts impacted are reductions to the available for sale reserve (R503 million), 
property revaluation reserve (R660 million) and share-based payment reserve (R1,001 million), with a corresponding increase of R2,164 million to 
retained earnings. Overall, this re-presentation is a transfer between reserves and has no impact on the shareholders equity or non-controlling interests of the Group.

Translation of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into the Group's presentation
currency, using the exchange rates at 30 June 2018, and their income and expenses using the average exchange rates for the period.
Cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2015, being the effective date of the Group's conversion to IFRS, were reset to
zero. Other than in respect of cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2015, cumulative unrealised gains or losses resulting
from translation of functional currencies to the presentation currency are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity. To the
extent that these gains and losses are effectively hedged, the cumulative effect of such gains and losses arising on the hedging
instruments are also included in that component of shareholders' equity. Upon the disposal of subsidiaries the cumulative amount of
exchange differences post 1 January 2015, deferred in shareholders' equity, net of attributable amounts in relation to hedged net
investments, is recognised in profit or loss.

The exchange rates used to translate the operating results, assets and liabilities of key foreign business segments to rand are:

Basis of preparation of Adjusted Headline Earnings

Purpose of Adjusted Headline Earnings
Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is an alternative non IFRS profit measure used alongside IFRS profit to assess performance of the
Group. It is calculated as headline earnings (note C1(c)) adjusted for items not reflective of the long term economic performance of the
Group (note B3).

AHE is one of the key performance indicators by which operational performance is monitored and managed, and it is one of a range of
measures by which management performance and remuneration is assessed. In addition it is used in setting the dividend to be paid to
shareholders.

Due to the complexity introduced into IFRS profit by the transactions required to execute Managed Separation and the long term nature of
the Group's operating businesses, management believes that AHE is an appropriate alternative basis by which to assess the operating
results of the Group and that it enhances the comparability and understanding of the financial performance of the Group. AHE utilises
headline earnings as defined by SAICA Circular 4/2018 as its base. Adjustments applied to headline earnings in order to calculate AHE
remove the impact of certain IFRS accounting treatments where the asset treatment under IFRS is inconsistent with the measurement of
the related policyholder liability, significant non-recurring expenses or income specifically related to material acquisitions, disposals or
fundamental restructuring (such as Managed Separation), the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations and the results of
residual plc, which is winding down and therefore its results will not form part of the long term performance of the Group.

The Group Audit Committee regularly reviews the determination of AHE and the use of adjusting items to confirm that it remains an
appropriate basis on which to analyse the operating performance of the Group. The Committee assesses refinements to the policy on a
case by case basis, and seeks to minimise such changes in order to maintain consistency over time.

Scope of businesses included in AHE
AHE includes the operating results of the Mass and Foundation Cluster, Personal Finance, Wealth and Investments, Old Mutual Corporate,
Old Mutual Insure, Rest of Africa and Other Group Activities segments. These are considered to be the core continuing operations of the
Group. Residual plc is considered to be non core as it is not part of the Group's principal operations due to the fact that it is in the process
of winding down. Consequently it is removed from AHE Refer to note B1 for more information.

The results of Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin American businesses, Old Mutual Bermuda and Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited,
are currently classified as discontinued operations in the IFRS consolidated income statement, and have therefore been excluded in the
determination of AHE to aid comparability between financial years. Refer to note B1 and note G1 for more information.

AHE per share
Adjusted Headline Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as AHE divided by adjusted weighted average number of shares (AHE WANS)
(note C1(c)). The calculation of AHE WANS includes own shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds, and BEE
trusts. The IFRS weighted average numbers of ordinary shares used to calculate basic earnings per share (WANS) is lower than the AHE
WANS applied in the calculating AHE earnings per share (AHE WANS). This is because the AHE WANS is diluted to reflect the Group's
BEE and policyholder fund shares as being in the hands of third parties, and is consistent with the treatment of the related revenue in AHE.
Refer to note C1(a) for more information.

A2: Significant corporate activity and business changes during the year

Transactions during the period required to implement the managed separation strategy

Reorganisation of the group structure
The following transactions were effected during the period as part of the execution of Managed Separation:

- On 6 March 2018, Old Mutual Limited was converted to a public company.

- On 22 June 2018, Old Mutual plc reduced the nominal value of its ordinary share capital and cancelled its share premium account
  through the creation of distributable reserves in terms of a UK court sanctioned scheme. As a result, R10,079 million and R19,557 million
  respectively were transferred to retained earnings. On 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc reclassified certain of its existing ordinary shares
  into 'A-ordinary shares'. These A-ordinary shares were then cancelled and an equivalent number of new ordinary shares were issued to
  Old Mutual Limited, the new parent company of Old Mutual plc. On 25 June 2018, the ordinary shares that were not classified as A-
  ordinary shares were transferred to Old Mutual Limited. Following these transactions, Old Mutual plc became a wholly owned subsidiary
  of Old Mutual Limited. Consequently, Old Mutual plc is no longer listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Johannesburg Stock
  Exchange (JSE), Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) or Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE).

- On 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc announced the closing of the initial public offering of 182.5 million shares, representing 9.6% of the
  total issued share capital of Quilter at a price of 2,588 cents (145 pence) per share by way of primary listing of Quilter shares on the LSE
  and secondary listing on the JSE. Total net proceeds arising from this transaction, after underwriting and other transaction costs, were
  R4,206 million. Further, on 25 June 2018, Old Mutual plc distributed R42,935 million, representing 86.6% of the total issued share capital
  of Quilter to the Old Mutual plc shareholders. The remaining 3.8% of the total issued share capital of Quilter is held by the Joint Share
  Ownership Plan (JSOP) Trustee on behalf of certain management and staff of Quilter.

  A profit on the demerger of Quilter of R2,852 million has been recognised in profit or loss. This includes foreign currency translation
  losses recycled to profit or loss of R394 million. In addition, merger reserves of R19,506 million have been transferred to retained
  earnings.

  Included in the initial public offering of 182.5 million shares, were 16.5 million shares that were subject to an over-allotment option. At 30
  June 2018, the market value of these shares was R435 million (GBP24 million). On 26 July 2018, 2.7 million of these shares were partially
  exercised by underwriters, raising cash proceeds of R66 million (GBP3.8 million). On 21 August 2018, the remaining 13.8 million shares
  were sold, raising cash proceeds of R379 million (GBP20.5 million).

- On 26 June 2018, Old Mutual Limited listed on the Main Board of the JSE with a standard listing on the LSE and secondary listings on
  the stock exchanges of Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

Following the Group reorganisation, Old Mutual Limited consists of the Group's operating segments (Mass and Foundation Cluster,
Personal Finance, Old Mutual Corporate, Wealth and Investments, Old Mutual Insure, Rest of Africa and Other Group Activities) , the
Group's holding in Nedbank and Residual plc.

Existing share based payment arrangements
Following Managed Separation and the respective listings of Quilter and Old Mutual Limited, the ordinary shares held by various employee
share schemes of the Old Mutual plc Group have been replaced by the ordinary shares of Quilter and Old Mutual Limited. The end result of
the execution of the schemes was that for every three Old Mutual plc shares held, employee shareholders received one ordinary share in
Quilter and three ordinary shares in Old Mutual Limited. This resulted in a modification of the underlying share award as Quilter shares
became unrestricted in the hands of employees, subject to existing share-based payment arrangements of the Old Mutual plc Group.

The distribution of Quilter shares to employee shareholders was a return of capital to shareholders and therefore employees were no
longer subject to any vesting conditions of the existing share-based payment arrangements. As such it is viewed to be a partial settlement
of the award which leads to an accelerated vesting of the IFRS 2 charge as it relates to the Quilter portion of the original award.

The share for share exchange and the distribution of Quilter shares has led to an accelerated vesting charge of R282 million recognised in
the IFRS consolidated income statement. This charge has been removed in the determination of AHE.

A3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In the preparation of these interim financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and judgements that affect items reported
in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and related supporting notes.

The critical accounting estimates and judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources
of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements of Old Mutual Limited for the year
ended 31 December 2017, with the exception of new critical accounting estimates detailed in note G5 arising from the changes in
accounting policies.

In the current and prior periods, the Group applied significant judgement in the classification of Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin American
business and Old Mutual Bermuda as discontinued operations and Nedbank, Quilter and the Latin American businesses as assets and
liabilities held for sale and distribution. These classifications did not have any valuation impact on the underlying assets and liabilities.
Refer to note G1 for more information.

B: Segment information

B1: Basis of segmentation

The execution of the Managed Separation strategy, as described in note A1 and note A2, constituted a reorganisation of the previous Old Mutual
plc Group resulting in the formation of two new groups Old Mutual Limited and Quilter. The executive management team of Old Mutual Limited
with the support of the Board, was responsible for assessment of performance and the allocation of resources of the continuing business
operations during period under review. The reorganisation resulted in a change in the composition of the Group's operating segments that is
reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), viewed to be the executive management team of Old Mutual Limited. As such the
new segment structure has been reflected in the required disclosures in both the current year and comparative information.

The Group manages its business through the following operational segments, which are supported by central shareholder activities and
enabling functions.

- Mass and Foundation Cluster: A retail segment that operates in Life and Savings, Banking and Lending. It provides simple financial
  services products to customers in the low income and lower middle income markets. These products are divided into four categories being (i)
  risk, including funeral cover, (ii) savings, (iii) lending and (iv) transactional products.

- Personal Finance: A retail segment that operates primarily in Life and Savings. It provides holistic financial advice and long-term savings,
  investment, income and risk products and targets the middle income market.
  
- Wealth and Investments: Operates across Life and Savings and Asset Management through 4 distinct businesses: (i) Wealth, a retail
  segment targeting high income and high net worth individuals, that provides vertically integrated advice, investment solutions and funds, and
  other financial solutions, (ii) Asset Management comprising 8 investment boutiques that provide asset management services to retirement
  and benefit funds and to the retail market in partnership with Wealth (iii) Alternatives, an unlisted alternatives investment business, and (iv)
  Specialised Finance, a proprietary risk and investment capability which manages and supports the origination of assets.
  
- Old Mutual Corporate: Operates in Life and Savings and primarily provides group risk, investments, annuities and consulting services to
  employee-sponsored retirement and benefit funds.
  
- Old Mutual Insure: Provides Property & casualty insurance products through three operational businesses: (i) personal, (ii) commercial, and
  (iii) corporate.
  
- Rest of Africa: Operates in Life and Savings, Property & casualty (including health insurance), Banking and Lending (including micro-lending)
  and Asset Management. The segment operates in twelve countries across three regions: SADC, East Africa and West Africa.
  
- Other Group Activities: Comprises the activities related to the management of the Group's capital structure. This includes the management
  of shareholder investment assets including the associated shareholder investment return and third-party borrowings including the associated
  finance costs. Also included are net assets and operations of Residual plc and investments in associated undertakings. Subsequent to the
  Nedbank unbundling, the Group intends to retain a minority shareholding of 19.9%, and this will be managed as part of Other Group Activities.

Presentation and Disclosure
Results from Operations measures the operational performance of the Group and together with items such as investment return, finance
costs and income from associated undertakings, the Group's profit measure, AHE is derived. AHE by definition excludes discontinued
operations and Residual plc, which do not form part of core continuing businesses of Group, and certain of the discontinued operations are
a function of the reorganisation and the application of predecessor accounting.

Nedbank, Quilter, the Latin American businesses, Kotak and Old Mutual Bermuda have been classified as discontinued operations. In line
with IFRS 8 par 28 (b), discontinued operations have been disclosed as a reconciling item between the segment profit measure and total
IFRS profit after tax of the Group.

Balance sheet measures provided to the CODM on a regular basis comprise of Return on Net Asset Value and Invested Shareholder
Assets at a Group and regional level. Balance sheet measures at a segment level have not been provided to the CODM in the period under
review. The Group is in the process of a fundamental multi-year transformation of its finance function, transitioning from a legal entity view
to a segment approach to better reflect the balance sheet economics and levers to drive value.

B3: Headline earnings adjusting items

Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is the Group's alternative profit measure used by management to assess the performance of the Group.
It is calculated as headline earnings in accordance with JSE listing requirements adjusted for items not reflective of the long term economic
performance of the Group. The adjustments from headline earnings to AHE are explained below.

(a) Investment return adjustment for Group equity and debt instruments held in policyholder funds
Represents the investment returns on policyholder investments in Group equity and debt instruments held by the Group's policyholder
funds. This include investments in the Company's ordinary shares and the subordinated debt and ordinary shares issued by subsidiaries of
the Group. These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax, but are added
back in the calculation of AHE. This ensures consistency with the measurement of the related policyholder liability. During the six months
ended 30 June 2018, the investment return adjustment decreased AHE by R620 million (six months ended 30 June 2017: R106 million decrease; 
year ended 31 December 2017: R1,355 million increase).

(b) Impact of restructuring
Represents the elimination of non-recurring expenses or income related to material acquisitions, disposals or a fundamental restructuring
of the Group (such as Managed Separation). This adjustment would therefore include items such as the costs or income associated with
completed acquisitions or disposals and the release of any acquisition date provisions. These items are removed from AHE as they are not
representative of the operating activity of the Group and by their nature they are not expected to persist in the long term.

(c) Discontinued operations
Represents the removal of the net profit associated with discontinued operations. These business are not considered part of the Group's
principal operations due to the fact they have been or are in the process of being sold or distributed and therefore will not form part of the
Group going forward. The profit attributable to these business is therefore removed from AHE. For the six months ended 30 June 2018 this
adjustment includes the profit attributable to Quilter, Nedbank, the Latin American businesses and Old Mutual Bermuda. For the six months
ended 30 June 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2017, discontinued operations also includes the profit related to Kotak.

(d) Income from associated undertakings
Represents the reversal of the associate income in respect of the 19.9% shareholding in Nedbank, which is reported as part of AHE. In
accordance with IFRS, the Nedbank shareholding of approximately 54% is classified as held for distribution and presented as part of the
discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement and is therefore included in the adjustment labelled as discontinued
operations. This adjustment ensures that these earnings are not double counted in the reconciliation.

(e) Residual plc
Represents the elimination of the net losses associated with the operations of the Residual plc. Residual plc is not considered part of the
Group's principal operations due to the fact that it is in the process of winding down and therefore the associated costs are removed from
AHE. During the six months ended 30 June 2018, the loss attributable to the Residual plc of R901 million (June 2017: R1,507 million)
mainly related to transaction costs associated with the finalisation of Managed Separation and costs incurred in winding down the former
Old Mutual plc head office operations.

(a) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding own shares held in policyholder and consolidated
investment funds, Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts (ESOP), Black Economic Empowerment trusts and other related undertakings.
These shares are regarded as treasury shares.

(c) Headline earnings per share
The Group is required to calculate headline earnings per share (HEPS) in accordance with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)
Listing Requirements, determined by reference to the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants' circular 04/2018 'Headline
Earnings'. The table below sets out a reconciliation of basic EPS and HEPS in accordance with that circular. Disclosure of HEPS is not a
requirement of IFRS, but it is a commonly used measure of earnings in South Africa. The table below reconciles the profit for the financial
year attributable to equity holders of the parent to headline earnings and summarises the calculation of basic HEPS:

E: Financial assets and liabilities

E1: Categories of financial instruments

The analysis of financial assets and liabilities of the Group's continuing businesses into their categories as defined in IFRS 9 'Financial
Instruments' is set out in the tables below. Assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial assets and liabilities that are
specifically excluded from the scope of IFRS 9, are reflected in the non-financial assets and liabilities category. The Group has taken
advantage of the exemption in paragraph 7.2.15 of IFRS 9 from restating prior periods in respect of IFRS 9's classification and
measurement (including impairment) requirements.

All gains and losses on measuring the financial assets and liabilities at each reporting date are included in the determination of profit or
loss for the period.

Information about the methods and assumptions used in determining fair value is included in note E2.

E2: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities

The description of the determination of fair value and the fair value hierarchies of financial assets and liabilities described in this section
applies to financial assets and liabilities for all the businesses.

(a) Determination of fair value
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. In the event that the market for a financial asset or liability is not
active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, another valuation technique is used.

In general, the following inputs are taken into account when evaluating the fair value of financial instruments:

-  Assessing whether instruments are trading with sufficient frequency and volume, that they can be considered liquid

-  The inclusion of a measure of the counterparties' non-performance risk in the fair-value measurement of loans and advances, which involves the
   modelling of dynamic credit spreads

-  The inclusion of credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debit valuation adjustment (DVA) in the fair-value measurement of derivative instruments

-  The inclusion of own credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of financial liabilities.

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques applied when valuing financial instruments. The general principles
applied to those instruments measured at fair value are outlined below:

Reinsurers' share of policyholder liabilities
Reinsurers' share of policyholder liabilities are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions held in
respect of the related insurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts which cover financial risk are measured at fair value of the underlying
assets.

Loans and advances
Loans and advances include mortgage loans, other asset-based loans, including collateralised debt obligations, and other secured and
unsecured loans.

In the absence of an observable market for these instruments, the fair value is determined by using internally developed models that are
specific to the instrument and that incorporate all available observable inputs. These models involve discounting the contractual cash flows
by using a credit-adjusted zero-coupon rate.

Investments and securities
Investments and securities include government and government-guaranteed securities, listed and unlisted debt securities, preference
shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments (see below), short-term funds and
securities treated as investments and certain other securities.

Pooled investments represent the Group's holdings of shares/units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual funds and
similar investment vehicles. Pooled investments are recognised at fair value. The fair values of pooled investments are based on widely
published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held in the underlying pooled investment
funds.

Other investments and securities that are measured at fair value are measured at observable market prices where available. In the
absence of observable market prices, these investments and securities are fair valued utilising one or more of the following techniques:
discounted cash flows, the application of an EBITDA multiple or any other relevant technique.

Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures held by investment-linked insurance funds and venture capital divisions
Investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures are valued using appropriate valuation techniques. These techniques may
include price earnings multiples, discounted cash flows or the adjusted value of similar completed transactions.

Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of derivatives is determined with reference to the exchange traded prices of the specific instruments. In situations where the
derivatives are traded over the counter the fair value of the instruments is determined by the utilisation of option pricing models.

Investment contract liabilities
The fair value of investment contract liabilities is determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying funds that are held by the
Group.

Third-party interests in consolidation of funds
Third-party interests in consolidation of funds are measured at the attributable net asset value of each fund.

Amounts owed to bank depositors
The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors correspond with the carrying amount shown in the consolidated statement of financial
position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.

Borrowed funds
The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where applicable, or by
reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.

Other financial assets and liabilities
The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities (comprising cash and cash equivalents; cash with central banks; trade, other
receivables and other assets; and trade, other payables and other liabilities) reasonably approximate their carrying amounts as included in
the consolidated statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.

(b) Fair value hierarchy
Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy.


 Description of hierarchy                                                  Types of instruments classified in the respective levels
 Level 1 - quoted market prices: financial assets and liabilities with     Listed equity securities, listed government securities and other
 quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.                listed debt securities and similar instruments that are actively
                                                                           traded, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted
                                                                           derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds, reinsurance
                                                                           share of policyholder liabilities and investment contract liabilities
                                                                           directly linked to other Level 1 financial assets.
 Level 2 - valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial         Unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is based on
 assets and liabilities with quoted prices for similar instruments in      models involving no significant unobservable data, with a majority
 active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments      determined with reference to observable prices.
 in inactive markets and financial assets and liabilities valued using
 models where all significant inputs are observable.                       Certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt
                                                                           instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and
                                                                           amounts owed to bank depositors.

 Level 3 - valuation techniques using significant unobservable             Unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable inputs,
 inputs: financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation           securities where the market is not considered sufficiently active,
 techniques where one or more significant inputs are                       including certain inactive pooled investments, and derivatives
 unobservable.                                                             embedded in certain portfolios of insurance contracts where the
                                                                           derivative is not closely related to the host contract and the
                                                                           valuation contains significant unobservable inputs.

The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of
trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid/offer spreads. In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction price
provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to measure the fair value of the
asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process. All businesses have significant processes in place to perform
reviews of the appropriateness of the valuation of Level 3 instruments.

The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable data and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high. However,
certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant inputs that are
unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental. A financial asset or liability in its entirety is classified as
valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or liability's carrying amount is driven by unobservable
inputs.

In this context, 'unobservable' means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the price at which an
arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base
a determination of fair value. Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair value derived from a valuation technique with significant
unobservable data may be attributable to observable inputs. Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will
generally be restricted to uncertainty about the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.

(c) Transfer between fair value hierarchies
The Group deems a transfer to have occurred between Level 1 and Level 2 when an active, traded primary market ceases to exist for that
financial instrument. A transfer between Level 2 and Level 3 occurs when the majority of the significant inputs used to determine fair value
of the instrument become unobservable.

At 30 June 2018, Level 3 assets comprised unlisted private company shares, unlisted debt securities and unlisted pooled investments
mainly held by policyholder funds for which the bulk of the investment risk is borne by policyholders. At 31 December 2017, all level 3
assets held by the Quilter and Nedbank businesses were transferred into assets held for sale and distribution and are therefore not
included within any of the amounts disclosed in the table above.

Transfers into Level 3 principally comprise private equity investments that it is now considered more appropriate to disclose as Level 3
rather than as their previous designation of Level 2. This is due to the nature and degree of the unobservable inputs contained in the
valuation models.

The amount of R5,768 million shown as transferred to held for sale and distribution relates to assets held by the Latin American
businesses, which was classified as held for sale and distribution with effect from 30 June 2018. Refer to note G1 for more information.

(c)(i) Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonable possible alternatives

Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the financial asset or liability as a result of
varying the levels of the unobservable parameters using statistical techniques. When parameters are not amenable to statistical analysis,
quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.

When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown reflect the
most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.

The valuations of the private equity investments are performed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology appropriate to
the specific investment and in line with industry guidelines. In determining the valuation of the investment the principal assumption used is
the valuation multiple applied to the main financial indicators (such as adjusted earnings). The source of this multiple may include multiples
for comparable listed companies which have been adjusted for discounts for non-tradability and valuation multiples earned on transactions
in comparable sectors.

The valuations of asset-backed securities are determined by discounted cash flow models that generate the expected value of the asset,
incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and the historical performance
of the underlying assets. The outputs from the models used are calibrated with reference to similar securities for which external market
information is available.

Structured notes and other derivatives are generally valued using option pricing models. For structured notes and other derivatives,
principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset values. These principal
assumptions used in the valuation of structured credit notes include credit volatilities and correlations. For such unobservable assumptions,
estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from
comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, and examination of historical levels.

The table below summarises the significant inputs to value instruments categorised as Level 3 hierarchy in the Group's continuing
businesses and their sensitivity to changes in the inputs used.

(f) Breaches of covenant
During the six months ended 30 June 2018, the financial covenants on eight loans with aggregate funding of R656 million were breached.
The funding was raised to support operations in the Rest of Africa segment.

At 30 June 2018, two of the loans, totalling R169 million, were in compliance with the covenant requirements. The Group obtained official
waivers amounting to R266 million from three of the lenders. These waivers were obtained with requirements to get back to within
covenant requirements by December 2018. The Group is following remediation plans to ensure that business will be in compliance with the
respective covenants by December 2018.

Furthermore, an agreement has been reached in July with one of the lenders to adjust the breached covenant on a R129 million loan to a
level where the Group is in compliance. The Group is still in negotiation with the lenders of the remaining two loans of R92 million to
similarly amend the breached covenant.

The breaches of the covenants by the individual businesses has not had an impact on the ability of the Group to obtain additional funding.

G1: Discontinued operations and disposal groups held for sale

Nedbank and Quilter
Nedbank and Quilter have continued to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This is consistent
with the presentation for the year ended 31 December 2017. Following the listing and distribution of Quilter on 25 June 2018 (see note A2),
it ceased to be a subsidiary of the Group. Consequently, its results are only consolidated from 1 January 2018 to 25 June 2018.

In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', comparative information in
the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 have been re-presented to reflect Nedbank and Quilter as discontinued operations.

The assets and liabilities of Nedbank continue to be classified as assets and liabilities held for sale and distribution in the consolidated
statement of financial position at 30 June 2018. This judgement was made based on the facts and circumstances which existed at 31
December 2017 when the Directors made a formal assessment of whether the businesses should be classified as held for distribution. At
that time it was determined that although a number of minor internal reorganisations remained to be implemented, the business in its
current state could have been distributed within a period of twelve months based on interactions with South African regulators, positive
interactions with the relevant tax authorities and interactions with the South African government. Once the Old Mutual Limited share
register has had a period to settle, the Group will unbundle to its shareholders a significant portion of its shareholding in Nedbank, whilst
retaining a strategic minority interest. This transaction is anticipated to be completed before 31 December 2018. Consequently, the
Directors still consider it is highly probable that the Nedbank business will be distributed within a period of twelve months from initial
classification, which was 31 December 2017. This is consistent with the published unbundling plan. Following the planned distribution, the
Group will revalue its residual associate interest at the market value prevailing at the time and will commence equity accounting its interest
as a continuing operation from that date.

In the consolidated statement of financial position at December 2017, the assets and liabilities of both Nedbank and Quilter were classified
and presented as assets and liabilities held for sale and distribution. Following the listing and distribution of Quilter on 25 June 2018 (see
note A2), it ceased to be a subsidiary of the Group. Consequently, its assets and liabilities are no longer included in the consolidated
statement of financial position at 30 June 2018.

Latin American businesses
As a consequence of the agreed sale of the Latin American businesses as set out in note A2, its size relative to the new Group structure
and its separate geographical location, the Latin American businesses have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended
30 June 2018. Consistent with the requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', the
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six
months ended 30 June 2018 and year to 31 December 2017 have been re-presented.

The Group's interest in the assets and liabilities of the Latin American businesses have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated
statement of financial position at 30 June 2018. This judgement was done based on the facts and circumstances which existed at 30 June
2018 when the Directors made a formal assessment of whether the businesses should be classified as held for sale. Consistent with the
requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', comparative information in the consolidated
statement of financial position at 31 December 2017 have not been re-presented.

Old Mutual Bermuda
Old Mutual Bermuda is expected to wind-down its operations, including shutting down the New York office and either terminating or giving
notice to all employees by the end of 31 December 2018. During the six months ended 30 June 2018, the Bermuda operation has actively
commenced the wind down process in line with the Wind-Down plan that was presented to the Old Mutual Bermuda and Old Mutual plc
Boards as well as to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) in December 2017. Given its separate geographical location, Old Mutual
Bermuda has therefore been classified and presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for all reporting periods. Consistent with the requirements of
IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', comparative information in the consolidated income statement,
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2017 and
the year ended 31 December 2017 have been re-presented. In accordance with IFRS, Old Mutual Bermuda has not been classified as held
for sale.

Re-presentation of Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited (Kotak)
On 13 October 2017, the Old Mutual plc Group completed the sale of its 26% stake in Kotak to its joint venture partner Kotak Mahindra
Bank Limited. The investment was presented as an asset held for sale in the Old Mutual plc Group interim accounts to 30 June 2017.
However, given its size relative to the Old Mutual plc Group, it was assessed that the business did not meet the definition of a component
and therefore was not presented as a discontinued operation. Following the change in Group structure in 2018, as described in notes A1
and A2, the treatment of Kotak has been re-assessed. Consequently, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of
comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows the six months ended 30 June 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2017
have been re-presented to reflect Kotak as a discontinued operation.

Further information on discontinued operations is provided in note G1.1. Further information on assets and liabilities classified as held for
sale and distribution is provided in note G1.2.

G1.3: Impairment testing relating to the assets held for sale and distribution

At 30 June 2018, no impairment losses have been recognised for Nedbank and the Latin American business, which have been classified
and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement and as held for distribution in the consolidated statement
of financial position in terms of the requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations'. Impairment
losses are determined as the deficit between fair value less cost to distribute and sell respectively of each business and the carrying value
of each business at 31 December 2017.

The fair value less cost to distribute of Nedbank was determined by reference to its quoted market price as at 30 June 2018. At 30 June
2018, the fair value less cost to distribute exceeded the carrying value of Nedbank. The Group therefore concluded that goodwill and other
intangible assets related to the Nedbank are not impaired.

The agreed selling price of the Latin American businesses is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. As such, the fair value less costs
to sell exceeded the carrying value of the Latin American businesses at 30 June 2018 and therefore no impairment losses of goodwill and
other intangible assets have been recognised.

In addition, no other impairments for property, plant and equipment, investment properties or other intangible assets have been recognised
as a result of classifying these businesses as held for sale and distribution.

G2: Related parties

There were no transactions with related parties during the six months ended 30 June 2018 which had a material effect on the results or
financial position of the Group. The nature of the related party transactions of the Group has not changed from those described in the
audited general purpose consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.

G3: Contingent liabilities and commitments

The Group has provided certain guarantees for specific client obligations, in return for which the Group has received a fee. The Group has
evaluated the extent of the possibility of the guarantees being called on and has provided appropriately.

Contingent liabilities - tax
The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates (South Africa and historically the United Kingdom)
routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group. The Group is committed to conducting its
tax affairs in accordance with the tax legislation of the jurisdictions in which they operate. All interpretations made by management are
made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction and the relevant legislation.

There are occasions where the Group's interpretation of tax law may be challenged by the Revenue authorities. The financial statements
include provisions that reflect the Group's assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to materialise as part of their
review. The Board is satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to cater for the resolution of tax uncertainties and that the
resources required to fund such potential settlements are sufficient.

Due to the level of estimation required in determining tax provisions amounts eventually payable may differ from the provision recognised.

Consumer protection
The Group is committed to treating customers fairly and supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and it is central to how our
businesses operates. We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet this commitment, but there is the risk of
regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for customer redress which can result in retrospective
changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines. The Group monitors the exposure to these actions and makes provision for the related
costs as appropriate.

Implications of the Managed Separation strategy
The Group routinely monitors and reassesses contingent liabilities arising from matters such as litigation, and warranties and indemnities
relating to past acquisitions and disposals. The announcement of the Managed Separation strategy on 11 March 2016 does not affect the
nature of such items, however it is possible that the Group may seek to resolve certain matters as part of the implementation of the
managed separation strategy.

Outcome of Zimbabwean Commission Enquiry
On 31 December 2016, the Zimbabwean Government concluded its inquiry into the loss in value for certain policyholders and beneficiaries
upon the conversion of pension and insurance benefits after the dollarisation of the economy in 2009. On 9 March 2018, the results of the
Zimbabwean Government's inquiry were made public.

The Group is committed to treating its customers fairly and is currently reviewing the report and preparing a preliminary evaluation of the
potential impact on Group operations. We are not currently able to establish what impact the commission's findings will have on Old Mutual
Zimbabwe.

US legacy items
On 13 March 2018, Old Mutual plc announced that The Travelers Companies, Inc. and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company
(Travelers) had lodged a claim in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in relation to pre-existing plc Head
Office legacy items relating to previously disposed of US assets. The Group believed at that time the claim was without merit. Old Mutual
plc further announced on 9 April 2018 that Travelers had withdrawn all of the remedies they were claiming and that Old Mutual Limited, has
agreed, inter alia, to provide an intragroup guarantee to Old Mutual plc in the circumstances where Old Mutual plc is unable to satisfy the
highly remote obligations in respect of the legacy items which were the subject of the claim.

Potential Future Commitments

Old Mutual Emerging Markets Limited (OMEM) guarantee
A sales agreement was signed between Old Mutual (South Africa) Holdings (Pty) Ltd (OMSAH) and Lily Bermuda Capital Limited (SPV
domiciled in Bermuda), owned by CMIG International Holding Pte. Limited (CMI) on 15 March 2018, for the purchase of OM Latin America
Holdco UK Limited and AIVA Holding Group S.A. (collectively known as 'the Latin American businesses'). The long stop date for the
fulfilment of the conditions precedent in the sales agreements, is 15 March 2019, unless the parties agree otherwise. OMEM has provided
a guarantee for credit worthiness of OMSAH to the buyer and has also received a reciprocal guarantee from CMI. At 30 June 2018, the
timing and amount of any payments (if any) cannot be reasonably estimated.

UAP put option
At 31 December 2017, the Group owned 60.7% of UAP Holdings Limited (UAP). The two significant minority anchor shareholders in UAP
have the right to collectively put up to an aggregate 6% shareholding in UAP to the Group at the occurrence of a 'Put Event'. The put option
period commenced at 1 October 2015 and ends on the earlier of an Old Mutual Limited listing or 3 years from the date of completion of the
initial purchase of UAP (being June 2018). The put option exercise price is equal to the initial price (paid by Old Mutual plc in acquiring its
current holding), increased by the Government of Kenya Treasury one year bond rates and reduced by dividends declared by UAP.

At 31 December 2017, the Group recognised the obligation to purchase the additional 6% at R359 million with a corresponding reduction in
reserves. Following the listing of Old Mutual Limited on 26 June 2018, the minority anchor shareholders collectively put a 6% ownership
interest in UAP to the Group. As at 30 June 2018, the settlement agreement had been drafted and presented to the anchor shareholders.
The settlement amount equates to R437 million, reflecting the contractual discount unwind and the movement in the Kenyan Shilling to the
rand over the period. At 30 June 2018, the acquisition of the interest held by the minority anchor shareholders has been accounted for as a
transaction between shareholders as there has been no change in control. On settlement, a pro-rata portion of the non-controlling interest
will be derecognised and transferred to the equity holders of the Group.

Old Mutual (Pty) Ltd Finance put option
The Old Mutual plc Group and the Business Doctor Consortium Limited and its associates ('Business Doctor') established Old Mutual
Finance (Pty) Ltd (Old Mutual Finance) as a 50/50 start-up strategic alliance in 2008. The Group increased its shareholding in Old Mutual
from 50% to 75% in 2014 by acquiring an additional 25% shareholding from Business Doctor for R1.1 billion. The Group has a call option
to acquire the remaining 25% shareholding in Old Mutual Finance held by Business Doctor at market value under certain circumstances,
inter alia in the event of a change of control within Business Doctor and on the eighth and tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Old
Mutual Finance shareholders' agreement (i.e. in 2022 and 2024 respectively). Business Doctor has a put option to sell its remaining 25%
shareholding in Old Mutual Finance to the Group at market value under certain circumstances, inter alia in the event of a change of control
within the Old Mutual plc Group and on the eighth and tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Old Mutual Finance shareholders'
agreement (i.e. in 2022 and 2024 respectively).

Following the listing of Old Mutual Limited on 26 June 2018, Business Doctor became entitled to exercise the option to put the remaining
shares to Old Mutual Limited. The Group received written confirmation on 22 July 2018 from Business Doctor that the put option would not
be exercised.

G4: Events after the reporting date

Tender offer for Old Mutual plc's outstanding subordinated notes
On 19 July 2018, Old Mutual plc repurchased R281 million (GBP16 million) of its outstanding R7,944 million (GBP450 million) 7.875%
subordinated debt securities, of which R1,105 million (GBP61 million) was outstanding on 30 June 2018 (Tier 2 subordinated 2025 securities)
and R4,745 million (GBP269 million) of its outstanding R8,827 million (GBP500 million) 8% subordinated debt securities, of which R6,181 million
(GBP341 million) was outstanding on 30 June 2018 (Tier 2 subordinated 2021 securities) through tender offers. All repurchased securities
were cancelled on 19 July 2018. Following cancellation of these securities, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding of the R7,944
million (GBP450 million) securities was R793 million (GBP45 million) and the aggregate principal amount outstanding of R8,827 million (GBP500
million) securities was R1,273 million (GBP72 million).

Repatriation of capital from Old Mutual Bermuda
On 5 July 2018, the Bermuda Monetary Authority approved the repatriation of capital to the value of R668 million ($49 million) from Old
Mutual Bermuda to Old Mutual plc.

G5: Standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted in the 2018 unaudited condensed
interim consolidated financial statements

5.1 Introduction
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the
same as those applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' from 1 January 2018. The
following other new standards are effective from 1 January 2018 but they do not have a material effect on the Group's financial statements:

- Amendment to IFRS 2 'Share based payments', regarding the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions;

- Amendment to IAS 40 'Investment Property', regarding the transfer of property to, or from, investment property;

- Annual improvements 2014-2016 made to IAS 28 'Investments in associates and joint ventures' and IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of IFRS'; and

- Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.

The impact of transitioning to IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 at 1 January 2018 has been presented separately for continuing and discontinued operations for
the six months ended 30 June 2018. Refer to note A2 and note G1 for more information.

As explained in 5.3.5 and 5.4.1 below for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, prior year financial statements have not been restated. This is in compliance with
the transitional provisions. The reclassifications, the adjustments arising from the new impairment rules of IFRS 9 and the adjustments relating to a
change in revenue recognition from contracts with customers of IFRS 15, are therefore not reflected in the consolidated statement of financial
position as at 31 December 2017, but are recognised in the opening consolidated statement of financial position at 1 January 2018.

The table below shows the adjustments recognised for each individual line item on the consolidated statement of financial position. As prior year
figures have not been restated, an opening consolidated statement of financial position at 1 January 2017 or a consolidated income statement and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the six months ended 30 June 2017 have not been presented. Consequently, there has been
no impact on the basic and diluted earnings per share of prior periods.

5.2 Impact on the consolidated statement of financial position

The impact on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position is summarised below:

  entities that are not banks regarding the allowance for expected credit losses in terms of IFRS 9. A significant change in this income tax
  deduction could result in significant deferred tax assets being recognised by Old Mutual Finance (Pty) Ltd, due to a delay in obtaining the income
  tax deduction and lead to an increase in the income tax payments made to SARS in respect of future years. Since a change in the existing
  income tax legislation and allowed practices has not yet been effected, the Group applied judgment by recognising a deferred tax asset of R82
  million on the transition impact to the expected credit loss model, based on the current income tax treatment in retained earnings. The Group
  and industry participants are in discussions with National Treasury regarding the matter.

- There is uncertainty with regards to the deductibility of the allowance for expected credit losses in Kenya for income tax purposes. The Group
  applied judgment and did not recognise any deferred tax on the transition impact to the expected credit loss model for loans and advances
  provided to customers by Faulu, the Group's micro-lender in Kenya. When more clarity has been obtained from revenue authorities an
  appropriate adjustment will be made.

- The total transition movement in the allowance for expected credit losses (R938 million) was recorded in retained earnings (R716 million) and
  other reserves (R222 million). The transition movement was recognised in other reserves to utilise regulatory reserves previously created in the
  Rest of Africa business.

5.3.2. Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 'Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement' that relate to the recognition, classification
and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January
2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The new
accounting policies are set out below.

Initial recognition of financial assets
Under IFRS 9, on initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:

- Amortised cost;

- Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) which may include debt or equity instruments; or

- Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).

IFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories for financial assets of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.

The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is based on whether the financial assets are equity instruments, debt instruments held or
derivative assets. Equity instruments and derivative assets are mandatorily categorised as financial assets at FVTPL. The classification
and measurement of debt instruments is dependent on the business model in which the financial asset is managed and its contractual cash
flow characteristics. Derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are not accounted
for separately. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.

A debt instrument is classified as a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions (and is not designated as at FVTPL):

- it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
  outstanding.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions (and is not designated as at FVTPL):

- it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
  outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity instrument that is not held for trading, the instrument may be irrevocably designated at FVOCI. In such
an instance changes in the equity instrument's fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). This election is made on an
investment-by-investment basis.

All debt instrument financial assets that were not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. On initial
recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a debt instrument financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured
at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise
arise.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets are expensed in profit or loss for financial assets initially
classified at FVTPL. For financial assets not classified at FVTPL, transaction costs are added to or deducted from the fair value at initial
recognition.

Initial recognition of financial liabilities
IFRS 9 largely retains the requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. On initial recognition
financial liabilities are measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of financial liabilities not classified at FVTPL, transaction costs that
are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Transaction costs of financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are
expensed in profit or loss.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets
The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets.

Financial assets at FVTPL                    These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest
                                             or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortised cost           These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
                                             The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and
                                             losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is
                                             recognised in profit or loss.

Debt investments at FVOCI                    These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the
                                             effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in
                                             profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses
                                             accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

Equity investments at FVOCI                  These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in
                                             profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
                                             Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
IFRS 9 largely retains the requirements in IAS 39 for the measurement of financial liabilities with one exception. Fair value movements
attributable to changes in the credit risk of a financial liability designated at FVTPL is recorded in other comprehensive income and not
recycled to profit or loss. The balance of the fair value movement is recorded in profit or loss.

IFRS 9 transition impact assessment
On 1 January 2018 (the date of initial application of IFRS 9), the Group's management has assessed which business models apply to the
financial assets held by the group and classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories. In addition management
considered the impact of implementation of the expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at amortised cost as well as any
'fair value option' designation adjustments. The tables below and accompanying notes explain the original measurement categories under
IAS 39 and the new measurement categories and carrying values under IFRS 9 for each class of the group's financial assets and financial
liabilities as at 1 January 2018:

Apart from the implementation of the expected credit loss model, other significant changes in the classification and measurement of
financial assets and liabilities as illustrated above have been described below.

(a)   Reclassification of equity instruments with a fair value of R430,570 million (at 31 December 2017) and debt instruments with a fair value of
      R198 million (at 31 December 2017) from financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IAS 39, to financial assets
      mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IFRS 9.

      In accordance with the Group's accounting policies equity instruments are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. In
      terms of IAS 39 the debt instruments were designated as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. In terms of IFRS 9, the
      Group considers that these debt instruments are held within a business model where the financial performance of these instruments are
      measured and the instruments are managed on a fair value basis. As a result the debt instruments are classified as financial instruments at
      fair value through profit or loss. Since the instruments were measured at fair value in terms of IAS 39, no measurement adjustment was
      recognised when the instruments were reclassified.

(b)   Reclassification of government securities with a fair value of R3,509 million (at 31 December 2017) from financial assets designated at FVTPL
      under IAS 39, to financial assets at amortised cost under IFRS 9.

      The government securities were designated at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IAS 39. A review of the business model regarding
      these instruments indicated that the instruments are held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows over the term of the instrument. A
      review of the cash flows characteristics of the instruments indicated that the cash flows are solely payments of capital and interest on the
      capital outstanding. Consequently the Group classified these instruments as financial assets at amortised cost. At 1 January 2018 the Group
      recognised an allowance for expected credit losses of R10 million with regards to these instruments. The expected credit loss was recognised
      in equity at 1 January 2018.

      The fair value of these financial assets as at 30 June 2018 was R5,553 million. The various original effective interest rates of these
      instruments range from 5% to 26% per annum and R263 million of interest income has been recognised during the period.

(c)   Reclassification of investments and securities with a fair value of R921 million (at 31 December 2017) from available-for-sale to financial
      assets at fair value through profit or loss.

      The investment and securities comprise of government, government guaranteed securities and equity instruments. In terms of IAS 39 these
      instruments were designated as available for sale financial instruments. In terms of IFRS 9, the Group considers that the debt securities are
      held within a business model where the financial performance of these instruments are measured and the instruments are managed on a fair
      value basis. As a result the government and government guaranteed securities are classified as financial instruments at fair value through
      profit or loss. Since the instruments were measured at fair value in terms of IAS 39, no measurement adjustment was recognised when the
      instruments were reclassified in terms of IFRS 9.

(d)   Reclassification of borrowed funds (R1,018 million) at 31 December 2017) from financial liabilities at amortised under IAS 39, to financial
      liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.

      At 31 December 2017 the Group carried total borrowed funds with a carrying value of R18,866 million. Included in this balance were borrowed
      funds classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost of R5,675 million. On 1 January 2018 the Group reclassified R1,018 million of this
      balance to financial liabilities at fair value to avoid or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch with derivative instruments (held to mitigate
      interest rate risk) classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. To adjust the carrying value of the borrowed funds to fair
      value (R1,284 million at 31 December 2017) a fair value loss of R266 million was recognised in retained earnings.

      The portion of cumulative fair value losses related to changes in the credit risk of the total borrowed funds designated at fair value through
      profit or loss was transferred from retained earnings to other reserves at 1 January 2018. The amount of the transfer was R683 million.

5.3.3. Impairment of financial assets

5.3.3.1 Overview

IFRS 9 replaces the 'incurred loss' model in IAS 39 with an 'expected credit loss' (ECL) model and results in credit losses being recognised
earlier than under IAS 39. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost (for example mandatory
reserve deposits with central banks, reinsurers' share of policyholder liabilities, loans and advances, trade and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, and corporate debt securities held by the Group) and corporate debt investments measured at FVOCI, but not to
investments in equity instruments. As a consequence of the new standard, the Group has revised its impairment methodology under IFRS
9 for each of these classes of assets. The impact of the change in impairment methodology on the Group's total equity is disclosed in 5.3.1.

The ECL impairment loss allowance is an unbiased, probability-weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes
that reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort of past events, current conditions and
forecasts of forward-looking economic conditions. The ECL model is dependent on the availability of relevant and accurate data to
determine whether a significant increase in credit risk occurred since initial recognition, the probability of default (PD), the loss given default
(LGD) and the possible exposure at default (EAD). Of equal importance is sound correlation between these parameters and forward-
looking economic conditions.

ECL reflects an entity's own expectations of credit losses. However, when considering all reasonable and supportable information that is
available without undue cost or effort in estimating ECL, an entity should also consider observable market information about the credit risk
of the particular financial instrument or similar financial instruments.

In the absence of sufficient depth of data, management apply expert judgment within a governance framework to determine the required
parameters. The expert judgement process is based on available internal and external information. Due to differences in availability of data
and maturity of credit risk management across the Group, different approaches are used to determine the key parameters.

Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to macro-economic conditions expected in the future. Forward looking information
used in the ECL calculation should reflect the nature and characteristics of the credit risk exposures. All reasonable and supportable
information that is available should be used when incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL allowance. Forward looking
assessments can be performed on an individual or collective basis. Forward-looking factors should be aligned with risk factors used in risk
assessments, stress testing, budgeting as well as strategy and pricing decisions. Relevant factors include factors intrinsic to the entity and
its business or derived from external conditions.

Estimates regarding credit risk parameters and the impact of forward-looking information used in the calculation of the ECL loss amount
should be reviewed at each reporting date and updated if necessary.

The ECL loss amount depends on the specific stage where the financial instrument has been allocated to within the ECL model:

- Stage 1: At initial recognition a financial instrument is allocated into stage 1, except for purchased or originated credit impaired financial
  instruments.

- Stage 2: A financial instrument is allocated to stage 2 if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial
  instrument.

- Stage 3: A financial instrument is allocated to stage 3 if the financial instrument is in default or is considered to be credit impaired.

Under IFRS 9, impairment loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases:

- 12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and
  
- Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

Group's assessment
The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured as 12-month
ECLs:

- Financial assets that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and

- Financial assets where credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased
  significantly since initial recognition.

The Group has elected to apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach in measuring expected credit losses. This uses a provision matrix when
determining the lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs,
the Group considers quantitative and qualitative information, based on the Group's historical experience, credit assessment and including
forward-looking information. The Group's assessment of a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition consists of a primary and
secondary risk driver as follows:

- The primary risk driver aligns to the quantitative credit risk assessments performed, such as the credit score, credit rating, probability of default or
  arrears aging of a financial instrument.

- The secondary risk assessment considers a broad range of qualitative risk factors based on a forward looking view such as economic and
  sector outlooks. The secondary risk assessment can be performed on a portfolio basis as opposed to a quantitative assessment at a financial
  instrument level.

These primary and secondary risk drivers are included by the Group as part of the ongoing credit risk management.

When making a quantitative assessment, the Group uses the change in the probability of default occurring over the expected life of the
financial instrument. This requires a measurement of the probability of default at initial recognition and at the reporting date.

A rebuttable assumption is that the credit risk since initial recognition has increased significantly if a financial instrument is 30 days past
due on any payments or is one payment in arrears. It is not anticipated that this assumption will be rebutted.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
The ECL calculation of a financial instrument takes into account both the contractual and available behavioural repayment patterns over
the relevant estimation period.

A financial asset is in default when the financial asset is credit-impaired or if the Basel definition of default is met. Where applicable, the
rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90 days past due, is applied.

Write-off policy
The Group writes off a financial instrument at amortised cost when the entity has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the financial
instrument. Determining when to write-off financial assets is a matter of judgment and incorporates both quantitative and qualitative
information. Different operational write off policies exist for the different businesses and jurisdictions with regards to credit impaired or in-
default financial assets at amortised cost. The following are examples of what could result in the write-off of a financial asset at amortised
cost:

- legal prescription

- settlement campaigns, collection efforts and legal processes do not result in the settlement of balances outstanding;
  
- receipt of payments from insurers; or

- financial assets have been in arrears for a significant amount of time with no qualifying payments being received in recent months.

The gross amount of loans and advances written-off during the six months ended 30 June 2018 was R165 million.

5.3.3.2 Measurement of expected credit losses (ECL)

ECLs are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance
with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial
asset.

For presentation the ECL allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. ECLs are presented separately in the
consolidated income statement.

5.3.3.3 Impact of the new impairment model

For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment losses are generally expected to increase and fluctuate. The Group
has determined that the application of IFRS 9's impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 results in an additional impairment allowance
for the continuing business as set out in 5.3.2. The table below sets out the transition adjustment between the IAS 39 impairment provision
recognised at 31 December 2017 and the IFRS 9 impairment provision at 1 January 2018 for those instruments most impacted by the new
impairment model:

The allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances increased by R141 million from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018.

5.3.3.4 Significant judgments and estimates

In determining the ECL allowances for loans and advances the following significant judgments and estimates were considered. The
availability of information and the sophistication of credit risk management systems and protocols will influence the judgments made and
estimates considered.

- The Group applies judgment in determining whether a significant increase in credit risk took place since initial recognition of financial assets at
  amortised cost. Judgment was applied in identifying the qualitative and quantitative triggers and thresholds used to identify significant increases
  in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial assets. Depending on the availability of reasonable and supportable information without
  undue cost or effort, significant increases in credit risk is identified through increases in behaviour risk, arrears aging and portfolio assessments.
  The Group makes use of the rebuttable presumption that a significant increase in credit risk has taken place when a financial asset is 30 days
  past due or one payment in arrears. The assessments are carried out on regular basis as part of the credit risk management activities of the
  Group.

- The Group applies judgment in identifying default and credit-impaired financial assets. The Group considers the arrears category where the
  balance have been allocated to or whether the balance is in legal review, debt review or under administration. In less sophisticated systems
  balances are considered to be in default when the balances have been past due for 90 days or more or have been identified to be in default after
  applying expert judgment. Financial asset are credit impaired when one or more events with a detrimental impact on the expected cash flows
  have taken place.

- The calculation of the ECL balance is primarily influenced by the stage allocation of the balance and the risk parameters. The Group makes use
  of estimates of PDs, LGDs and EADs to calculate the ECL balance for financial assets at amortised cost. Depending on the relevant information
  available PDs are based on a behavioural scoring model and historic default rate curves or are determined through internally developed
  statistical models. LGDs are derived from a default recovery time series model that takes recency of payments into account or through internally
  developed statistical models. EADs are determined with reference to expected amortisation schedules and taking into account credit conversion
  factors as applicable for undrawn or revolving facilities.

- The ability to include forward-looking information in the measurement of ECL balances is dependent on the existence of reliable and quantifiable
  correlation between forward-looking factors and changes in the ECL balance. When such correlations do not exist and where applicable,
  management applies expert judgment to determine an overlay provision to incorporate best estimates of the impact of forward-looking
  information. Any overlay provision is based on available information and qualitative risk factors within a governed process. The incorporation of
  forward-looking information into the ECL balances is an area where further development is expected as industry practice emerge.

5.3.4 Hedge accounting

On the adoption of IFRS 9 the Group elected to not apply hedge accounting to any financial instruments in the continuing businesses. The
Group elected to continue with hedge accounting principles as set out in IAS 39 and will adopt the hedge accounting principles set out in
IFRS 9 when the IASB project on marco-hedge accounting has been completed.

5.3.5 Transitional impact

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been not been applied retrospectively and as such:

- The Group has taken an exemption not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and measurement
  (including impairment) requirements. As a result the comparative information disclosed for financial instruments is based on the accounting
  policies applied in preparing the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
  
- Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained
  earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 but
  rather that of IAS 39.

The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application.

- The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held and whether or not the cash flows meet the characteristics of cash
  flows that are simply payments of principal and interest in the principal.

- The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as measured at FVTPL.
  The designation of certain investments in equity instruments not held for trading as at FVOCI.

- If an investment in a debt security had low credit risk at the date of initial application of IFRS 9, then the Group has assumed that the credit risk
  on the asset had not increased significantly since its initial recognition.

5.4. IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' - Continuing businesses

5.4.1 Overview including impact on the Group's total equity

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18
'Revenue', IAS 11 'Construction Contracts' and related interpretations.

The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' from 1 January 2018 which has resulted in changes to
accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements. In accordance with the transition provisions in
IFRS 15, the Group has used the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying the standard at the date of initial application,
being 1 January 2018. Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to prior year figures which were previously reported under IAS 18 and
related interpretations.

Adjustments made to the amounts recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position at the date of initial application (1 January
2018) are set out in 5.2. The table below summarises the impact, net of tax, of transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings and for continuing
operations at 1 January 2018:

(a) Initial financial planning fees

An initial financial planning fee is paid to brokers for providing initial financial planning to clients. Fees charged to clients consist of initial
fees and ongoing fees. In the past the initial fee received was recognised as a deferred revenue liability and the initial financial planning fee
paid as a deferred acquisition cost asset. These balances were amortised into the statement of comprehensive income as separate items
of income and expense over the expected contractual periods.

In terms of IFRS 15 revenue is recognised when the related performance obligation has been satisfied. The initial fee received should be
recognised as revenue when the services have been provided. The initial financial planning fee paid should be expensed when incurred.

Deferred acquisition costs and deferred revenue liabilities at 31 December 2017 have been adjusted with a corresponding impact to
retained earnings. This lead to a reduction of deferred acquisition costs of R848 million and a reduction in deferred revenue liability of R875
million at 1 January 2018. The related impact to deferred tax has been a reduction in the deferred tax asset of R245 million and a reduction
in the deferred tax liability of R237 million.

The implementation of IFRS 9 at Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), an associate of Nedbank, resulted in reduction in equity of
R780 million (after tax). The after tax impact of the implementation of IFRS 15 was a reduction of R254 million to equity and is further
discussed in note 5.5.3.

5.5.2.2 Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

The table below and the accompanying notes below explain the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement
categories under IFRS 9 for each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 1 January 2018 for the businesses held for sale and
distribution. The table only includes changes which have resulted in a significant impact in the measurement of the instrument as a
consequence of either a change in classification or a change in the impairment provision recognised. The line items disclosed in the table
are summarised into the assets held for distribution and sale and liabilities held for distribution on sale in note 5.2. The following are the
main changes impacting the classification and measurement of financial instruments for Nedbank:

Altogether R887 million of gross loans and advances and associated impairments of R474 million were reclassified from amortised cost in
FVTPL, because these loans include features other than 'payments solely of principal and interest'. The loans with features other than
'payments solely of principal and interest' were reclassified in investment securities and remeasured to fair value on transition, which was
R152 million lower than the amortised cost. A total of R2 billion of loans and advances at amortised cost was included in a portfolio that has
a sales business objective (at 1 January 2018). These loans have been reclassified in FVTPL on adoption of IFRS 9, together with the
associated impairments of R71 million. On reclassification the fair value was R44 million higher than the amortised cost. In summary, on-
balance-sheet impairments decreased by R545 million on transition (R474 million due to features other than 'payments solely of principal
and interest' and R71 million due to the business model). Consequently, net loans and advances decreased by R369 million and
investment securities increased by R261 million, with the difference of R108 million being a fair-value remeasurement.

On adoption of IFRS 9 the Group reviewed a number of accounting policies, including those on the effective-interest-rate and the
derecognition of loans and advances on modification thereof. As a result of the review, the Group changed the recognition of certain
initiation fees from upfront recognition in net interest revenue to amortisation, using the effective-interest-rate method. On adoption of IFRS
9 and IFRS 15 management estimated the cumulative impact of the change in effective interest rate to be R658 million (before tax) and
R474 million (after tax).

5.5.2.3 Impact of the new impairment model

The impact of the expected credit loss model on businesses held for sale and for distribution is largely attributable to Nedbank. Nedbank's
IFRS 9 implementation accounts for supervisory guidance provided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision guidance document
issued on credit risk and accounting for ECL, which outlines the basic principles of supervisory requirements for sound credit risk practices
associated with the implementation and ongoing application of ECL accounting models, and the supervisory evaluation of credit risk, as
well as by the corresponding SARB Guidance Note 3/2016.

It is important to note that the methods, assumptions and accounting policies applied in applying the ECL model in Nedbank will differ from
the methods, assumptions and accounting policies applied in the lending businesses reported under continuing businesses. The
differences in methods, assumptions and accounting policies must be viewed against the backdrop of different products, systems and
availability of information across the continuing businesses and the businesses held for sale and distribution.

The total transition adjustment for ECL was R 2,135 million (after tax) on 1 January 2018 and can be analysed as follows:

Note 1: At 1 January 2018 Nedbank reclassified loans and advances with accompanying IAS 39 impairment provision of R475 million to
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The adjusted IAS 39 impairment provision at 1 January 2018 was R11,527 million (31
December 2017: R12,002 million).

Loans and advances
The largest contributor to the transition adjustment of R2,752 million was Retail and Business Banking with a transition adjustment of
R2,370 million. The adjustment was due to measuring ECL for balances allocated to stage 1 of the ECL model at 12-month expected credit
losses, revised behavioural lifetime estimates for products and refined modelling for performing loans.

Forward-looking information
The IFRS 9 macro-economic forecasts are reviewed quarterly, aligned with SARB's Monetary Policy Committee meetings. Additional ad
hoc reviews will be performed in the event of significant change in the economic climate. The macroeconomic forecast includes four
scenarios: a base case, a mild-stress case, a high-stress case, and a positive case. Each scenario is assigned an appropriate probability,
based on its likelihood of occurring relative to the base scenario. The key macroeconomic variables included in the forecast are: GDP
growth, the prime rate forecast, the household debt-to-income ratio and credit growth.

The impact of macroeconomic factors is included on a probability-weighted basis by firstly determining whether the credit risk of the loan
has increased significantly since origination and secondly, once it has been determined whether 12-month ECL (stage 1) or lifetime ECL
(stage 2) applies, by adjusting the ECL for the macroeconomic forecast on a probability-weighted basis.

Income and deferred tax
Historically, Nedbank has deducted allowances on credit loss impairment provisions in accordance with the SARS ruling applicable to
banks in order to determine cash tax payable. In terms of revised income tax legislation Nedbank will be able to claim a tax deduction
equal to 25% of the stage 1 ECL allowance, 40% of the stage 2 ECL allowance and 85% of the stage 3 ECL allowance. It is important to
note that there is no reduction for a present-value factor in the new legislation. This results in an overall reduction of current tax payable in
2018 of R450 million. The total current and deferred tax adjustment for ECL is R855 million, with R405 million recognised as a deferred tax
asset. The deferred tax asset represents the difference between the accounting ECL allowance and the deduction allowed under the
revised tax regime multiplied by the current corporate tax rate.

Write-off
IFRS 9 provides more detailed guidance on the point at which loans and advances should be written off. In terms of IFRS 9, loans and
advances are written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the asset partially or in its entirety. This
assessment is judgemental and includes both qualitative and quantitative information, including trends based on historical recoveries. The
implementation of IFRS 9 has resulted in an opening adjustment to balance sheet impairments to take into account the net impact of
removing the benefit of post write-off recoveries and amending the point of write-off.

Comparative information
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, Nedbank has elected not to restate comparative figures. Information in this report for
the year ended 31 December 2017 relating to Nedbank is presented on the basis calculated in terms of IAS 39.

5.5.3 IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'

Nedbank performed an assessment to determine the impact of the new standard on the Group's client loyalty programmes. Nedbank has
concluded that the loyalty points awarded to clients are consideration payable in terms of IFRS 15 guidance. IFRS 15 requires revenue to
be decreased by the amount expected to be payable to clients, which is recognised as a liability until payment is affected. The liability for
the amount expected to be paid to clients under the loyalty programmes increased by R347 million and R254 million (on an after-tax basis)
on transition. Under IFRS 15, as clients earn loyalty points, the fee and commission income earned from card transactions is reduced by
the expected cost of the loyalty points against a loyalty points liability. On redemption of the loyalty points the actual costs incurred are
offset against the liability. Under IFRS 15 costs of Nedbank's rewards programme were previously recognised as an expense whereas they
are now recognised as a reduction in net interest revenue.

G6: Future standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations not early-adopted in the 2018
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations, have been published that are not mandatory for 2018 reporting periods and have
not been early adopted by the Group.

IFRS 16 'Leases'

IFRS 16 'Leases' was issued in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases and its related interpretations for reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2019. All of the Group's businesses will be impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16.

The Group as lessee: IFRS 16 introduces a 'right of use' model whereby the lessee recognises a right-of-use asset and an associated
financial obligation to make lease payments for all leases with a term of more than 12 months. The asset will be amortised over the lease
term and the financial liability measured at amortised cost with interest recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.

The Group as lessor: IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues
to classify and account for its leases as operating leases or finance leases.

The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and which transitional approach it will follow.

IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'

The IASB issued IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' in May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.

The new IFRS 17 standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The new rules will affect the financial
statements and key performance indicators of all entities in the Group that issue insurance contracts or investment contracts with
discretionary participation features.

The Group has commenced assessing the impact of IFRS 17.

NEDBANK GROUP – UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR
THE 6 MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

Nedbank Group Limited (“Nedbank Group“), the majority-owned South African banking subsidiary of Old Mutual
Limited, released a trading statement today, 7 August 2018.

The following is the opening comments from Mike Brown, Chief Executive of the Nedbank Group’s announcement.


“NEDBANK GROUP – UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR
THE 6 MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

Strong performance in a difficult environment

Nedbank Group delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2018, assisted by our share of associate income
from ETI as it returned to profitability, while our managed operations delivered positive, but slower, earnings
growth in line with our expectations. Headline earnings of R6,7bn increased 27,0% and ROE (excluding goodwill)
improved to 18,4%. Slow revenue growth and a gradual increase in impairments were offset by good cost
management. We maintained a strong balance sheet, as evident in our IFRS 9 fully phased-in CET1 ratio of
12,4% and the interim dividend per share increasing by 13,9%. Total assets exceeded R1 trillion for the first time.

Nedbank continues to make good progress in delivering market-leading client value propositions and digital
innovations. This focus has enabled us to increase our total client base to over eight million for the first time, grow
revenues and unlock operating efficiencies. In the second half of 2018 we look forward to the launch of more
exciting innovations for clients. Our strategic enablers, including ongoing technology investments, our people, our
culture and our brand, are creating a more client-focused, agile, competitive and digital Nedbank.

Given the strong growth in diluted headline earnings per share in the first half of 2018, together with expectations
of a slowly improving economic outlook and ongoing delivery on our strategy, our guidance for growth in diluted
headline earnings per share for 2018 remains unchanged, being in line with our medium-to-long-term target of
greater than or equal to GDP plus CPI plus 5%.

Mike Brown
Chief Executive”

OLD MUTUAL SUBSIDIARY OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF TENDER
OFFERS

Old Mutual notes that its subsidiary, Old Mutual plc, has announced the results of the tender offers (the “Offers”)
in respect of its £500,000,000 8 per cent. Subordinated Notes due 3 June 2021 (of which £340,884,000 is currently
outstanding) (ISIN: XS0632932538) (the “2021 Securities”) and its £450,000,000 7.875 per cent. Subordinated
Notes due 3 November 2025 (of which £60,842,000 is currently outstanding) (ISIN: XS1312138750) (the “2025
Securities” and, together with the 2021 Securities, the “Securities”) today, 18 July 2018.

The tender offers expired at 4:00 p.m., London time, on 17 July 2018.

Old Mutual plc has decided to accept for purchase all Securities validly tendered pursuant to the Offers. Settlement
of the Offers is expected to take place on 19 July 2018, following which the nominal amount of the principal
outstanding of the 2021 Securities shall be £72,102,000 and the nominal amount of the principal outstanding of
the 2025 Securities shall be £44,889,000. Old Mutual plc will deploy approximately £334 million of its available
liquidity in settlement of the Offers.

The premiums paid to incentivise take-up of the Offers will result in a charge to Old Mutual’s consolidated profit
and loss, and a corresponding decrease in its consolidated net asset value, of approximately £14 million (ZAR
248 million, based on a closing ZAR/GBP exchange rate on 17 July 2018 of 17.39). However, there will be no
impact on Old Mutual’s consolidated results from operations, adjusted headline earnings and return on net asset
value, because these key performance indicators exclude the results and net assets of the Residual Old Mutual
plc entities as non-core operations.

The body of Old Mutual plc’s announcement relating to the results of the Offers (as published on the London Stock
Exchange website) is set out below.

Rationale for the Offers

The purpose of the Offers is to utilise available liquidity to manage the Company’s debt maturity profile by reducing
outstanding indebtedness and to reduce interest costs.

The 2021 Securities and 2025 Securities are each rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Services Limited (“Moody’s”)
and BB by Fitch Ratings Limited (“Fitch”). The Issuer intends to request that each of Moody’s and Fitch withdraw
their ratings on each Series of Securities and on the Issuer itself shortly after the date of the Tender Offer
Memorandum. The Offers provide liquidity to Securityholders in the context of such withdrawal.

Details of the Offers

or arranging to have delivered on their behalf, a valid Tender Instruction that is received by the Tender Agent by

2021 Securities

The Company will pay, on the Settlement Date, a cash purchase price (the “2021 Purchase Price”) equal to 116
per cent. of the nominal amount of the 2021 Securities validly tendered and accepted by it for purchase pursuant
to the 2021 Offer and the relevant Accrued Interest Payment.
If the Company decides to accept any 2021 Securities validly tendered for purchase pursuant to the 2021 Offer,
the Company proposes to accept for purchase all 2021 Securities validly tendered for purchase pursuant to the
2021 Offer.

2025 Securities

The Company will pay, on the Settlement Date, a cash purchase price (the “2025 Purchase Price” and, together
with the 2021 Purchase Price, the “Purchase Prices”, and each a “Purchase Price”) equal to 121 per cent. of
the nominal amount of the 2025 Securities validly tendered and accepted by it for purchase pursuant to the 2025
Offer and the relevant Accrued Interest Payment.
If the Company decides to accept any 2025 Securities validly tendered for purchase pursuant to the 2025 Offer,
the Company proposes to accept for purchase all 2025 Securities validly tendered for purchase pursuant to the
2025 Offer.

Announcements

the Offers and, if so accepted, the 2021 Securities Acceptance Amount and the 2025 Securities Acceptance
Amount, as soon as reasonably practicable on the Business Day immediately following the Tender Expiration

the effective date of the Demerger Reduction of Capital, will be permitted to deal with any surplus assets as it
sees fit.

ADMISSION OF OLD MUTUAL AND APPOINTMENT OF ADVISORS

Admission of Old Mutual

Old Mutual is pleased to announce that admission of, and commencement of unconditional
dealings in, the ordinary shares of Old Mutual to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited
(JSE), the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the Namibian Stock Exchange, the Zimbabwe Stock
Exchange and the Malawi Stock Exchange took place at 9.00 a.m. SAST today.


Following the Second Scheme becoming effective on 25 June 2018, Old Mutual is now the

will be delisted from the JSE, the Namibian Stock Exchange, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
and the Malawi Stock Exchange on 29 June 2018.


Peter Moyo, Chief Executive Officer of Old Mutual, said: “What’s most exciting about our
listing as an independent, standalone entity is that it enables us to further unlock shareholder
value and create a business with a strong strategic focus on sub-Saharan Africa.""


“Our investment case is strong and compelling. Our business remains highly cash generative
and is well-positioned in the right markets to drive added value from our franchises. We are
privileged to have a business with a robust capital and liquidity position, which will provide
the right catalyst to become a leading Pan-African financial services business.""


“Exciting opportunities lie ahead for us as Old Mutual Limited and we look forward to
delivering sustainable profit growth and returns for our shareholders, and making meaningful
contributions to the societies in which we operate. By driving long-term economic growth in
Africa, we can positively impact the lives of all our customers and communities on the
continent,” concluded Moyo.

    •   Nedbank: Nedbank ranks as a top-5 bank by capital on the African continent and
        Ecobank, in which Nedbank maintains a 21.2% shareholding, ranks within the top-10
        banks by assets on the African continent.

    •   Quilter: Quilter (formerly Old Mutual Wealth) is a leader in the UK and in selected
        offshore markets in wealth management, providing advice-led investment solutions
        and investment platforms to over 900,000 customers, principally in the affluent market

any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-
looking statements contained in this announcement or any other forward-looking statements
that they may make.

OML has published its pre-listing statement (“PLS”) in connection with the proposed
admission of ordinary shares in OML to a primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (“JSE”). It is expected that the listing will take place on 26 June 2018
following receipt of the requisite approvals, including approval by Old Mutual plc
shareholders.

It is expected that OML will also have a standard listing in the United Kingdom and will
trade on the London Stock Exchange’s (“LSE”) main market for listed securities, and
secondary listings on the Malawi Stock Exchange (“MSE”), the Namibian Stock
Exchange (“NSX”) and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (“ZSE”).

In March 2016, Old Mutual plc announced that the long-term interests of its
shareholders and other stakeholders would be best served by separating the four
businesses then owned by the Old Mutual plc Group from each other so that they
could operate as fully independent businesses. This was described as a “Managed
Separation”. As part of Managed Separation, OML, the sub-Saharan African
insurance, savings and asset management business, will become an independently-
listed, standalone Group, and publication of the PLS is an important step in this
process.

Peter Moyo, OML CEO, says, “We are on track with our listing as part of the managed
separation process and the publication of the PLS is a key milestone in this process.
The listing of OML on the JSE will signal the return of Old Mutual to Africa where it is
well positioned to offer the best solutions to our customers within our key client
segments.“
OML's ordinary shares have been registered with ISIN number ZAE000255360. It is
expected that its ordinary shares will be traded on the JSE in the ""Life Insurance"" sector
under the abbreviated name ""OMUTUAL"" and share code ""OMU"", the LSE under the
share code “OMU”, the MSE under the abbreviated name ""OMUTUAL"" and share
code ""OMU"", the NSX under the abbreviated name ""OMUTUAL"" and share code
""OMM"" and the ZSE in the ""Life Insurance"" sector under the abbreviated name ""O
MUTUAL"" and share code ""OMU"".

The PLS has been approved by, among others, the JSE, the UK Listing Authority, the
MSE, the NSX and the ZSE. The PLS contains important information on OML and will be
available, subject to applicable securities laws, on Old Mutual plc’s website at
www.oldmutualplc.com and OML’s website at www.oldmutual.com or in hard copy
by request.

The PLS has also been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be
available for inspection at www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/NSM.

OML and Nedbank Group Limited (“Nedbank”) have also signed their new
relationship agreement (“Relationship Agreement”) to govern the terms of the
relationship upon completion of Managed Separation and replace the historic
relationship agreement between Old Mutual plc and Nedbank. The Relationship
Agreement can be accessed on online at www.oldmutualplc.com and on
Nedbank’s website at www.nedbankgroup.co.za and in physical form at OML’s
offices at Mutualpark, Jan Smuts Drive, Pinelands, 7405 and Nedbank’s head office at
135 Rivonia Road, Sandown, 2196, South Africa.

       become a premium financial services group in sub-Saharan Africa and offers
       a broad spectrum of financial solutions to retail and corporate customers
       across key market segments in 17 countries.

   •   Nedbank: Nedbank ranks as a top-5 bank by capital on the African continent
       and Ecobank, in which Nedbank maintains a 21.2% shareholding, ranks within
       the top-10 banks by assets on the African continent.

   •   Quilter: Quilter (formerly Old Mutual Wealth) is a leader in the UK and in
       selected offshore markets in wealth management, providing advice-led
       investment solutions and investment platforms to over 900,000 customers,
       principally in the affluent market segment.

profit before tax of £2.0 billion. For further information on Old Mutual plc and the
