Anglo American Platinum closes ACP Phase B resulting in temporary build up in work-in-
progress inventory

Anglo American Platinum has made the pre-emptive decision to close the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
Phase B unit, following a series of water leaks, to ensure an ongoing safe operating environment, protect
employees and protect the integrity of the plant and surrounding processing assets.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum states:

“As indicated in our Q3 production report on 22 October, the ACP Phase B unit has been fragile and has
unfortunately recently experienced a number of further instances of water leaks. Whilst the ACP
management team has done extraordinary work to keep the unit operating safely over the past several
months, we have taken this pre-emptive decision to now close the ACP Phase B unit to ensure we protect
our employees, operating environment and the integrity of our assets. Whilst this early closure will result
in a temporary build up in work-in-progress inventory, we continue to make good progress with the rebuild
of the main ACP Phase A unit, which we expect to complete towards the end of this year.”

Increased monitoring, controls and systems were implemented to continually assess the ACP Phase B
unit and further water leaks were discovered. The ACP Phase B unit underwent a planned and measured
shutdown. Whilst the ACP management team has been able to complete repairs to previous water leaks,
after a comprehensive assessment, and with further water leaks discovered, the ACP Phase B unit now
requires more extensive repair work. As a result, the ACP Phase B unit has been closed for a full rebuild
in 2021.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company has refined 2.4 million PGM ounces. As production continues at
c.94% of normal production levels, the closure of ACP Phase B unit until ACP Phase A unit is
recommissioned will result in an increase in work-in-progress inventory, whose release will commence
once the ACP is operational. The Company has made significant progress with the Phase A unit and
remains on track to commission it before the end of this year, ahead of the original schedule of Q2 2021.

As a result of the closure of the ACP Phase B unit, the Company has lowered its refined production and
sales guidance for 2020 to c.2.5 million PGM ounces (previously 3.1-3.3 million PGM ounces). There is
no change to other guidance, including M&C production which remains at between 3.6 – 3.8 million PGM
ounces. The Company has contingency plans in place and will be engaging with customers to minimise
any disruption to contractual obligations.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company remains in a net cash position of c.R28 billion (unaudited) and has
R25 billion of committed facilities available.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum’s PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company’s smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum Limited is a member of the Anglo American plc Group and is a leading primary
producer of platinum group metals. The company is listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange
(JSE). Its mining, smelting and refining operations are based in South Africa, as well as its two joint
venture operations. Elsewhere in the world, the Group owns Unki Platinum Mine in Zimbabwe. Anglo
American Platinum is committed to the highest standards of safety and continues to make a meaningful
and sustainable difference in the development of the communities around its operations.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


OVERVIEW


- Safety performance did not meet expectations and tragically we had one work-related fatality at Amandelbult
    and one at the Modikwa joint-operation during Q3 2020.
- Covid-19 continued to impact the business, however own-managed operations reached 94% of normal
    capacity by the end of the quarter.
- Own managed mines PGM production increased by 1% to 652,000 ounces despite the continued impact
    of Covid-19. Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo delivered strong performances.
- Joint operations PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 23% to 190,600
    ounces largely due to the impact of Covid-19 and the safety stoppage at Modikwa.
- Refined PGM production - owned decreased by 14% to 1,020,700 ounces. The lower output was principally
    due to interruptions at the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP), offset marginally by increased throughput.
-   PGM sales volumes from production decreased 16% to 884,900 ounces due to lower refined production,
    and the rebuild of refined inventory.


Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, said:


“The third quarter has been challenging with two work-related fatalities at Amandelbult and the Modikwa joint-
operation. It is extremely disappointing that we have failed to ensure that every employee goes home safely to
their families every day. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of Mr Dennis Hlengani
Mdaka and Mr Lindile Manzingi. Our focus remains on safe and responsible production and the adherence to
Covid-19 measures, including extensive screening and testing protocols, at our operations.

“From a production perspective, we have managed to reach 94% of normal capacity by the end of the quarter
from our own-managed mines, with Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo delivering strong performances. Refined
production continues to be interrupted by water leaks at the Anglo Converter Plant’s Phase B unit. We have put
increased monitoring in place at the Phase B unit to ensure an ongoing safe operating environment for our
employees and will continue to take all appropriate measures to keep people safe while we wait for the main
Phase A unit to restart. We have made significant progress with the Phase A unit and remain on track to
commission it before the end of the year.”

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER

SAFETY & HEALTH

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities, however, regrettably had two loss of
life incidents during Q3 2020. On 13 September Mr Dennis Hlengani Mdaka passed away after a ventilation
related incident at the Modikwa joint operation. On 16 September Mr Lindile Manzingi from Amandelbult
succumbed to his injuries after a fall of ground incident at Dishaba Mine on 2 September. We again send our
sincere condolences to their family, friends and colleagues.


The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed operations for the quarter
worsened in the quarter at 2.85 compared to 2.60 in the prior period.


Learnings have been incorporated into our operational practice including intensifying critical control compliance
and assurance, particularly around fatal risk-related events. We continue our deliberate focus on operational
routines compliance, as well as strict verification through scheduled, frequent and increased leadership presence
at operations. Finally, we have an increased focus on planning to manage behavioural aspects proactively and
understand employee state of mind, particularly during the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic.


Covid-19 remains a significant challenge, however, Anglo American Platinum has fully embedded protocols to
ensure risks to the health of our employees are managed, as well as keeping vulnerable employees away from
potential harm. In addition to our world-class workplace Covid-19 protocols, we continue our extensive and
rigorous screening and testing process at our operations to help keep our employees, their families and our local


                                                                    2
communities safe and healthy. We believe that the combination of screening and testing helps us to ensure that
positive cases are detected earlier in the life cycle of the virus, allowing us to isolate and treat people in the earlier
stages of the disease and prevent the spread of infection.




PGM PRODUCTION


Total PGM production of 1,112,900 ounces decreased 2% against prior year largely due to lower production
predominantly from the joint operations of Modikwa and Kroondal, as well as lower production from Amandelbult.
This was largely offset by strong production performance from Unki, Mogalakwena and Mototolo who increased
production 12%, 9% and 6% respectively. Platinum production was down 2% to 516,400 ounces and palladium
production was flat at 352,200 ounces.


The impact of COVID-19 on the business continued in Q3 2020 and PGM ounces lost for the quarter amounted
to 119,000 ounces, bringing the year to date total to 712,000 ounces. The most notable impact in Q3 was at our
joint operations, where 55,000 ounces (mined and purchase of concentrate) were lost. A further 52,000 ounces
were lost from our third party metal providers and to a lesser extent at Amandelbult where we lost 5,000 PGM
ounces. Mototolo lost 6,800 PGM ounces due to COVID-19 for the quarter but exceeded the prior quarter output.


Due to the overall strong M&C production performance in Q3 2020, we have increased our full year M&C
production guidance to between 3.6 – 3.8 million PGM ounces (previously 3.1 – 3.6 million PGM ounces).


PGM production from own managed mines


Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 1% to 652,000 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 1% to 295,100 ounces and palladium production increased 6% to 238,600 ounces). The strong
performances at Mogalakwena, Unki and Mototolo was partly offset by lower volume from Amandelbult. The
Company reached 94% of its normal operating levels at its own mined operations at the end of the quarter.


Mogalakwena PGM production increased 9% to 315,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 7% to
132,000 ounces and palladium production increased by 12%, to 146,000). The PGM production increase is due
to higher throughput and improvements in concentrator recovery, but partly offset by a decrease in the 4E built-
up head grade. The mine continued to operate at normal production capacity during the quarter.


Amandelbult PGM production decreased 12% to 204,800 ounces (platinum production decreased by 13% to
102,800 ounces and palladium production decreased by 11%, to 48,300 ounces). The lower production against
Q2 2019 was primarily due to infrastructure closures at the end of 2019 at Tumela Upper (9,800 PGM ounces),
surface material/opencast production coming to end of life (21,200 PGM ounces) and COVID-19 restrictions
(5,000 PGM ounces). This was partly offset by increased production from Dishaba Upper (7,200 PGM ounces).
Amandelbult operated at 90% of normal operating levels at the end of the quarter.




                                                            3
Mototolo PGM production increased by 6% to 72,200 ounces (platinum production increased by 6% to 33,300
ounces and palladium increased by 7% to 20,700 ounces). This performance was despite suffering 6,800 PGM
ounce losses as a result of COVID-19 during the quarter, as the prior period was impacted by geological features
which resulted in a grade decline.


Unki PGM production increased 12% to 60,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 14% to 27,000 ounces
and palladium production increased by 10% to 23,600 ounces).

PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint operations PGM production in total decreased by 23% to 190,600 ounces (platinum production decreased
by 22% to 85,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by 24% to 56,400 ounces).

Modikwa PGM production decreased by 27% to 61,400 ounces (platinum production decreased by 25% to 24,000
ounces and palladium decreased by 27% to 23,200 ounces). This was largely due to Covid-19 restrictions, as
well as due to the tragic loss of life incident and associated safety stoppages.


Kroondal PGM production decreased by 21% to 129,200 ounces (platinum and palladium production decreased
by 21% to 61,400 ounces and 33,200 ounces respectively), largely due to Covid-19 restrictions.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties


Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, increased 8% to 270,200 ounces (platinum POC
increased by 13% to 136,000 ounces and palladium POC increased by 10% to 57,200 ounces). Increases in
volumes were from Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine and Platinum Mile while lower production was received
from other providers.


Refined PGM production


Refined PGM production owned, decreased by 14% to 1,020,700 ounces (refined platinum production decreased
by 13% to 503,800 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 2% to 354,100 ounces). The decrease
in the quarter was largely driven by Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit interruptions.


As previously highlighted, the ACP Phase B unit, which was recommissioned following the incident at the ACP
Phase A unit, has been operating past its useful life and therefore challenged with reliability issues. Increased
monitoring has been put in place at the ACP Phase B unit to allow for proactive risk control, ensuring an ongoing
safe operating environment for our employees and to maintain the integrity of our assets. Due these proactive
measures, water leak repairs, essential maintenance, testing and monitoring was conducted at the ACP Phase
B, production was disrupted for 20 days during the quarter.


Refined production in the final quarter is highly dependent on the ongoing stability of Phase B, until a controlled
switch-over to Phase A can be completed. As a result, we remain cautious on refined production in Q4 2020 and



                                                         4
have revised full-year refined PGM production guidance to the lower end of our previous guidance to between
3.1 – 3.3 million PGM ounces.


The ACP stoppages have resulted in a slight increase in work-in-progress (WIP) inventory between Q2 2020 and
Q3 2020. The build in WIP inventory is not lost production - only the timing of the release of WIP inventory to
refined inventory is impacted.


If the ACP Phase B unit creates a material risk to employees or assets by continuing to operate, the Company
will proactively conduct a safe shut-down, taking Phase B offline until the recommissioning of Phase A. The
rebuild of ACP Phase A remains on schedule with completion estimated towards the end of Q4 2020.


The Company is focused on embedding strong asset reliability, which is of key strategic importance to enable
Anglo American Platinum to position itself for the next stage of safe and sustainable value creation.


PGM sales volumes


PGM sales volume from production decreased by 16% to 884,900 ounces, in line with lower refined production
(platinum and palladium sales volume both decreased by 17% to 448,500 ounces and 261,700 ounces
respectively), as well as the rebuild of some refined inventory.

PGM sales volume from trading increased 210% to 341,000 (platinum trading volumes increased by 499% to
105,000 ounces and palladium trading volumes increased by 170% to 214,600 ounces).

PGM sales volumes for the year will remain highly dependent on the level of refined production in Q4 2020.

Unaudited financial position and committed facilities

At the end of the interim reporting period to 30 June 2020, the Company was in a net cash position of
R11.3 billion, including the customer prepayment. As at 30 September, the Company remains in a net cash
position of R20.6 billion. Anglo American Platinum also has R20.2 billion of committed facilities available.

2020 full-year guidance


We revise our full-year production and refined production guidance in line with performance year-to-date, and
expectations in the final quarter as follows:

Repurchase of Anglo Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the Alchemy Community Share Scheme,23 Sep 2020,"Repurchase of Anglo Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the Alchemy Community Share Scheme

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED

(“the Company"" or ""Anglo American Platinum"")


Repurchase of Anglo American Platinum Shares held by the Lefa La Rona Trust in terms of the
Alchemy Community Share Scheme

Introduction

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on 25 August 2020 where the company
announced the successful settlement of the notional vendor finance (NVF) by its community share scheme
(Alchemy Scheme), resulting in the Lefa Le Rona Trust (LLRT), which is the umbrella trust on behalf of the
regional development trusts (DTs), now holding unencumbered shares in Anglo American Platinum . The
settlement of the NVF and transfer of value comes one year prior to the maturity of the Alchemy Scheme
funding period (December 2021), due to Anglo American Platinum’s strong share price performance.

The transaction structure provided for early settlement of the NVF when Anglo American Platinum’s volume
weighted average price (VWAP) reached a trigger price. This trigger event occurred on 27 July 2020 and
consequently the company has repurchased 4,889,680 shares from LLRT on 22 September 2020 at par
value of 10 cents per share (“the Repurchase”).

The Repurchase was done in terms of the authority granted by shareholders for the community share
scheme at the Company’s General meeting held on 14 December 2011.

 Total shares in issue after the share repurchase     265,292,206



*Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, will retain 500,000 of the
repurchased shares in treasury to satisfy obligations under the share incentive schemes with the remaining
4,389,680 repurchased shares being delisted and cancelled. The Company has applied for the delisting of
these shares from the JSE with effect from Tuesday 29 September 2020. After the repurchase the Company
will have 509,691 shares held in treasury.

Source of funds

The Repurchase was funded from the company’s available cash resources.

Impact of the Repurchase on the financial information of the Company

The acquisition will have no financial effect on the Company or its shareholders, other than in respect of
the repurchase costs that are normally incurred in transactions of this nature. The repurchase results in an
immaterial cash flow impact for the Company and does not have an impact on the Company’s earnings per
share and headline earnings per share.

Anglo American Platinum to transfer R2 billion of value in settlement of successful
community share scheme

Anglo American Platinum announces the successful settlement of the notional vendor finance (NVF) by
its community share scheme (Alchemy), resulting in the Lefa Le Rona Trust (LLRT), which is the umbrella
trust on behalf of the regional development trusts (DTs), now holding unencumbered shares in Anglo
American Platinum with a value of c.R2 billion at vesting. The settlement of the NVF and transfer of value
to communities comes one year prior to the maturity of the Alchemy Scheme period (December 2011 to
December 2021), due to Anglo American Platinum’s recent strong share price performance.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum says:

“I am delighted to announce that our community share scheme Alchemy, set up in 2011, has delivered
on its objective of creating sustainable shared value to our host communities and specific communities
from where our employees originate in the Eastern Cape, North West and Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries. The settlement will result in R2 billion of value transferring to these
communities via regional development trusts. These trusts will focus on advancing broad-based
community development including infrastructure, education and health developments, as well as
improving livelihoods. Anglo American Platinum is playing a responsible role by catalysing development
in our communities. Through our established governance structures, we will work with the DTs to ensure
the careful deployment of this capital so that it can further advance our efforts to deliver shared value and
build thriving communities.”

Background

In December 2011, Anglo American Platinum established a community empowerment and development
scheme named Alchemy. The transaction was structured to provide equity ownership of Anglo American
Platinum to the host communities around the mines and specific labour-sourcing communities, through
development trusts. The LLRT is the umbrella trust through which the regional DTs hold their interest in
the Company.

Transaction structure

At the time of the inception of Alchemy, the Company issued c.6.3 million shares at par value of 10 cents
per share, which are held by LLRT, representing 2.33% of the total issued share capital.

Of the total dividends paid to the LLRT relating to their shareholding of 2.33%, 60% was used to service
the NVF and the balance of 40% is retained by the LLRT. The dividends received by the LLRT to date
amounted to c.R300 million which has been deployed to further the development objectives of the DTs.

The subscription for the shares was funded through the NVF mechanism, facilitated by the Company.
The transaction structure provided for early settlement of the NVF when Anglo American Platinum’s
volume weighted average price (VWAP) reached a trigger price.
The trigger event occurred on 27 July 2020 and will result in the Company repurchasing 4,889,680 shares
from LLRT (not from the market) on 22 September 2020 at par value of 10 cents per share, to settle the
NVF. The vesting results in an immaterial cash flow impact for the Company.

The LLRT will have 1,400,685 unencumbered Anglo American Platinum shares held by LLRT (with a
vesting value of c.R2 billion at the date of the trigger event).

The shares held by LLRT are subject to restrictions until the end of the Alchemy Scheme period in
December 2021 – i.e. shares cannot be transferred, sold or encumbered.

Post the Alchemy Scheme period in December 2021, 40% of the shares can be distributed to the DTs
based on their proportional interest held and are entitled to monetise this investment. The remaining 60%
of shares held by LLRT are subject to a twenty year lock-in period, to the end of December 2041.

Governance

The DTs are managed by Trustees, including transparently selected community trustees, independent
trustees and company selected trustees. The DTs have been designed in consultation with locally-based
working groups, and structures and governance are carefully customised to serve local community
dynamics and development requirements.

Notes to editors:

The Lefa La Rona Trust (LLRT) was established in 2011 as a community empowerment vehicle to
ensure sustainable community development in the areas where Anglo American Platinum operates and
specific communities from where our employees originate (Eastern Cape, North West and SADC
countries). The Trust serves as a conduit to four independent community development trusts (DTs) and
a non-profit company (NPC) called Zenzele Itereleng, which serves Anglo American Platinum’s labour-
sourcing communities.

The Dikuna Tsa Sechaba DT serves Amandelbult and its surrounds, the Rustenburg DT serves
Rustenburg and its surrounds, the Bohwa Bja Rena DT serves Twickenham Project and its surrounds,
and the Ditholwana Tsa Rena DT serves Mogalakwena Complex and its surrounds.

Through these Public Benefit Organisation structures, funds generated from dividends on the LLRT
shares flow directly to locally relevant and ‘impact-by-design’ community development. These Boards of
Trustees with community-elected trustees have strong governance, senior operations managers and
experienced project development & implementation units in place.
This enables communities through these DTs to undertake initiatives and projects of their own, to help
confront their communities’ challenges and to create a sustainable future for themselves, beyond the life
of the mines in their vicinity. The development priorities include livelihood, education, health and poverty
relief.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented:

“On behalf of everyone at Anglo American Platinum, I would like to pay our respects to the victims of
the Covid-19 virus. We extend our deepest condolences to their family, friends and colleagues.

Our business has faced some significant headwinds in the first six months of 2020, with the impact of
Covid-19 on our operations and the temporary shutdown of the ACP following a force majeure incident.
Despite these challenges, we continued our commitment to safety, with zero fatalities at own-managed
operations for 620 consecutive days. We remain dedicated to the health and wellbeing of our employees
and local communities, investing R251 million in additional Covid-19 measures, including R55 million
on community initiatives which have benefitted over one million people.

Our financial results for the six months illustrate the resilience of the business. We ended the period
under review with an increase in EBITDA to R13.1 billion, a net cash position of R11.3 billion, and an
increase in return on capital employed to 48%. As always, we remain committed to disciplined capital
allocation, prioritising the need to maintain asset integrity, ensure a strong balance sheet. The Board
has declared an interim dividend of R10.23 per share.

We expect to see a stronger production performance in H2 2020, but caution that significant headwinds
still exist.”

ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED
PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDING 30 JUNE 2020


OVERVIEW - PRODUCTION

- Resilient business – managing through the headwinds of national lockdowns during Covid-19 pandemic

- Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q2 2020, continuing the fatal-free period 
  at managed operations

- Strict implementation of Covid-19 prevention measures - including social distancing, hygiene measures,
  screening and testing, and provision of PPE – resulting in no operation needing to close due to spread of
  Covid-19 amongst employees

- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) decreased 41% against prior year (Q2
  2019) to 665,100 ounces, largely due to the impact of shutdowns implemented in South Africa and Zimbabwe
  in response to curbing the outbreak of COVID-19. This led to a loss of c.521,600 PGM ounces in the quarter

- Own managed mines PGM production decreased by 40% to 379,400 ounces largely due to the COVID-19
  shutdowns and subsequent ramp-up leading to a loss of 286,500 ounces, however impact was partially
  mitigated as open-pit and mechanised operations were able to safely ramp-up production faster (98%
  production level at the end of June)

- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 55% to 101,600 ounces
  largely due to the Covid-19 shutdowns, and the result of declaring force majeure leading to Kroondal material
  being processed by third parties

- Refined PGM production excluding tolling decreased by 67% to 407,000 ounces, primarily due to the
  temporary closure of the Anglo Converter Plant B unit (ACP) for repairs which was offline for 54 days in Q2

- PGM sales volumes (excluding tolling and 4E POC sales that are now tolled) decreased 55% to 548,000
  ounces due to lower refined production, partially supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory

REVIEW OF THE QUARTER


SAFETY

Anglo American Platinum remains committed to the elimination of fatalities and reports zero fatalities in the period
at managed operations. The Company continues its fatal-free period as a result of the commitment made to
maintaining safety standards through shut down and start-up processes. The Total Recordable Case Frequency
Rate (“TRCFR”) per million hours at managed operations for the quarter improved 27% to 1.93 compared to 2.63
in the prior period.


PGM PRODUCTION
Total PGM production of 665,100 ounces decreased 41% (against prior period Q2 2019), with platinum
production down 41% to 307,500 ounces and palladium production down 34% to 228,500 ounces. The impact of
the shutdowns implemented by the Governments of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Zimbabwe in
response to curbing the outbreak of Covid-19 led to a loss of 521,600 PGM ounces in the quarter. In collaboration
with government, labour unions and employees, stringent measures were put in place to protect employees,
including social distancing, hygiene measures, screening and testing, and provision of PPE – resulting in no
operation needing to close due to spread of Covid-19 amongst employees.



PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines decreased 40% to 379,400 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 43% to 166,100 ounces and palladium production decreased 30% to 158,600 ounces), largely due
to the Covid-19 shutdowns which led to a loss of 286,500 PGM ounces in the quarter. The impact of the Covid-
19 shutdowns was partially mitigated due to high proportion of open-pit and mechanised operations which could
ramp-up at a faster pace than the conventional underground operations. Open-pit and mechanised operations
were able to get to 98% levels of production by the end of June 2020.



Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 8% to 277,600 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 8%, to 117,300 ounces and 128,900 ounces respectively). Mogalakwena surface operations were
granted the right to restart shortly after lockdown began and therefore the North concentrator continued operating


                                                                                             2
by drawing down on ore stockpiles. Thereafter, a gradual increase in operational activity was granted and by the
end of June, Mogalakwena mine was operating at 100% production levels and is expected to do so for the
remainder of the year.



Amandelbult PGM production decreased 78% to 50,100 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 78%, to 25,300 ounces and 11,700 ounces respectively), largely due to the Covid-19 shutdowns
which led to a loss of 174,000 PGM ounces in the quarter, as well as the closure of parts of Tumela Upper section
in December 2019 as they reached the end of life of mine (contributing 30,100 PGM ounces in the prior period).
At the end of June, Amandelbult mine reached 50% of targeted production levels and is expected to ramp up to
85% production levels by the end of the year, due to strict compliance to Covid-19 protocols and protecting
vulnerable employees who are not permitted to work on mine-site.


Mototolo PGM production decreased by 59% to 20,400 ounces (platinum production decreased by 59% to 9,500
ounces and palladium decreased by 58% to 5,800 ounces). At the end of June, Mototolo mine was operating at
a production level of around 90% and is expected to reach 100% production levels going forward.


Unki PGM production decreased 40% to 31,300 ounces (platinum production decreased by 40% to 13,900
ounces and palladium production decreased by 42% to 12,100 ounces). At the end of June, Unki mine was
operating at normal production levels of 100% and is expected to continue at this level to the end of the year.


PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)


Joint venture PGM production, decreased by 55% to 101,600 ounces (platinum production decreased by 56% to
45,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by 54% to 29,600 ounces). This was largely due to the
impact of Covid-19 shutdowns causing a loss of 126,000PGM ounces in the quarter, as well as the diversion of
material from Kroondal during the period of force majeure, which was processed by a third party.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties


Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, decreased by 28% to 184,100 ounces (platinum POC
decreased by 23% to 96,000 ounces and palladium POC decreased by 26% to 40,200 ounces), due to the impact
of Covid-19 shutdowns causing a loss of 109,100 PGM ounces during the quarter, as well as the diversion of
Platinum Mile concentrate during the period of force majeure, which was processed by a third party.


Refined PGM production

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, decreased by 67% to 407,000 ounces
(refined platinum production decreased 71% to 160,600 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by
64% to 147,400 ounces). Refined production was impacted by the temporary closure of the Anglo Converter
Plant (ACP) on 6 March 2020 and a subsequent closure during the first two weeks of June to repair a water leak
which was detected on 3 June.




                                                        3
ACP Repairs

A force majeure incident at the ACP (Anglo Converter Plant) on 10 February led to the closure of both ACP phase
A and phase B units from 6 March, with ACP phase B returning to steady state on 12 May. Following a subsequent
closure during the first two weeks of June, the ACP phase B has since ramped-up and is operating at full capacity.
The rebuild of ACP Phase A are ahead of schedule with completion estimated at the end of Q4 2020.


PGM sales volumes

PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, decreased 55% to 548,000
ounces, with platinum sales volumes down 65% to 195,700 ounces and palladium sales volumes down 64% to
160,900 ounces due to the decrease in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory.
Trading Sales volumes increased by 80% to 210,500 PGM ounces to ensure supply to customers.



2020 full-year guidance


We retain our full-year production and refined production guidance, as updated in the Q1 2020 production report
released on 23 April 2020. PGM production will be between 3.1– 3.6 million ounces, including platinum production
of between 1.45–1.65 million ounces and palladium production of 1.0–1.15 million ounces. Refined PGM
production will also be between 3.1–3.6 million ounces, including refined platinum production of between
1.45–1.65 million ounces and refined palladium production of 1.0–1.15 million ounces.


We acknowledge that significant headwinds exist in the second half of the year, including completing the rebuild
of the ACP Phase A, further Eskom power-outages, as well as the potential impact the Covid-19 pandemic could
have on our performance. Our priorities remain to ensure the safety of our employees and the integrity of our
assets and caution that these headwinds could impact our ability to meet full year guidance.

Anglo American Platinum update on ACP Phase B repair

Anglo American Platinum announced on 3 June 2020 that a water leak had been detected in the high-
pressure cooling section of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. All employees were safely
evacuated as a precaution. The Company took the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit
to secure a safe operating environment, protect employees and protect the integrity of the plant.

The detailed technical investigation into the cause of the water leak shows localised damage to a single
cooler tube that is now being replaced and confirms that this leak is unconnected to the repair work
recently completed on the ACP Phase B unit. Other maintenance is being carried out and additional
controls put in place whilst the ACP Phase B unit is off-line in order to provide greater operational stability.
The repair work is expected to be completed next week, and recommissioning will then start once a
detailed risk-based assurance process has confirmed it is safe to do so.

A prudent approach will be taken to safely ramp up the ACP Phase B unit. Increased monitoring will likely
result in intermittent stoppages to inspect the plant until the repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are completed.
The repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are progressing well and are now expected to complete towards the
end of 2020 due to the successful accelerated procurement of key long-lead time items.

Anglo American Platinum will continue to receive concentrate from third parties and joint ventures under
the purchase of concentrate and toll agreements and will continue to deliver metal to customers.

The stoppage of the ACP Phase B for repairs of this water leak is not expected to have any impact on
full year refined production guidance, which remains at between 3.1 – 3.6 million PGM ounces.

Company has taken the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit to ensure an ongoing safe

Anglo American Platinum ramps up ACP plant to restart refined PGM production

Anglo American Platinum has safely and successfully completed the repair of the Anglo Converter Plant
(ACP) Phase B unit. The ACP and full downstream processing operations are completing a safe ramp-
up and expect to be fully operational from 12 May 2020. Force majeure to suppliers of concentrate will
be lifted on that date.

CEO of Anglo American Platinum, Natascha Viljoen, stated:

“I am pleased to report that we have safely and successfully completed the repair of the ACP Phase B
unit ahead of schedule, enabling the restart of refined production of our platinum group metals and our
base metals. We were vigilant in adhering to strict health and safety protocols to keep the repair team
safe during the lockdown, whilst ensuring that we were able to implement social distancing and hygiene
requirements which form our new way of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have carried out substantial testing to ensure the stability of the ACP Phase B unit, and as we
complete the ramp-up, we are engaging with suppliers of concentrate to lift force majeure imminently. All
temporary commercial arrangements applicable during the force majeure period will revert to normal
commercial terms.”

The estimated final cost of repairs for ACP Phase B is c.R150 million, in line with the lower end of guidance
provided. Repair work on the ACP Phase A unit continues and is progressing in line with the project plan.
All orders for long lead items have been placed and the dismantling work started on site.

Due to the time taken to refine the respective platinum group and base metals, the force majeure notice
remains in effect for our refined metal customers. Force majeure arrangements with these customers will
be lifted in the future and in line with the provisions of our agreements.

Given the collective uncertainty around the start-up of ACP, the ramp-up of mining operations and the
potential impact of COVID-19, Anglo American Platinum retains its current guidance and will provide an
update as appropriate when we have further information and clarity on production.


A safe and successful repair under lockdown

In accordance with lockdown regulations, the repair team was able to continue with repairs throughout
the extended lockdown period in South Africa. All materials required for repairs were ordered and
available on site ahead of the lockdown, and there were no supply chain disruptions that impacted the
ability to complete the repairs. Safety protocols were implemented on site in line with Government
approvals and regulations. A construction work risk review was completed to determine work phasing,
method of execution, key resource identification and increased health protocols.

The ACP construction repair team was split into two teams that self-isolated for the duration of the repair
work, and COVID-19 specific health protocols were put in place for cleaning, screening and transport to
site. A new shift pattern was introduced that fostered social distancing. Increased site hygiene measures
for sanitisation, together with site safety and health supervision were implemented to ensure safety and
quality of construction. We have reported zero injuries, zero health issues or positive COVID-19 cases
and did not experience any health and safety or construction issues during the repair and ramp up.

The Company’s ability to continue these essential repairs during lockdown has been critical to the
resumption of the processing pipeline. As a result of the incidents at the ACP, and the need to shut
operations to secure a safe operational environment for employees, the Company could not process any
metal to final product during this period. With mining activity resuming to varying degrees under the
current Level 4 lockdown restrictions, the Company is now able to begin processing concentrate and
releasing metal from the pipeline.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDING 31 MARCH 2020 & UPDATE TO
RESPONSE ON COVID-19


OVERVIEW - PRODUCTION
- Commitment to elimination of fatalities – no fatalities occurred in Q1 2020, continuing the record fatal free
    period at managed operations
- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) decreased 7% against prior year (Q1
    2019) to 954,800 ounces, largely due to the impact of shutdowns implemented by the Government of the
    Republic of South Africa (RSA) in response to curbing the outbreak of COVID-19. This led to a loss of 61,000
    PGM ounces in the quarter
- Own managed mines PGM production decreased by 7% to 560,100 ounces due to the COVID-19
    shutdowns and some impact from Eskom power outages earlier in the quarter
- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 10% to 188,800 ounces
    largely due to the COVID-19 shutdowns
- Refined PGM production including tolling decreased by 15% to 743,900 ounces. This was due to the
    temporary closure of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) and the declaration of force majeure to secure a safe
    operating environment
- PGM sales volumes (excluding tolling and 4E POC sales that are now tolled) decreased 13% to 681,300
    ounces due to lower refined production, partially supplemented by a drawdown in refined palladium inventory

OVERVIEW – UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO COVID-19
-   Safe shutdowns implemented across all operations, with limited surface operations at Mogalakwena, later
    extended to limited mining operations at Mogalakwena and the start-up of Polokwane Smelter in April
-   ACP Phase B repairs continued throughout the lockdown period, making good progress and on schedule
-   Employees continue to be paid during the lockdown including full fixed pay, as well as pension and
    medical benefits and housing allowances where applicable
-   Local host communities continue to be supported through a comprehensive response plan focusing on
    providing food and water provisions, and training and supply of equipment to clinics and hospitals
-     Supporting small business – supplier response plan in place to deliver range of support for suppliers
-     Strong financial position – in a net cash position of R11.8 billion at 31 March 2020 (unaudited) with
      committed facilities of R20.5 billion
-     Cash conservation measures identified – cost and capex savings of over R4.0 billion identified for 2020

down 7% to 440,900 ounces and palladium production down 7% to 303,100 ounces. The impact of the shutdowns
implemented by the Government of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) in response to curbing the outbreak of
COVID-19 led to a loss of 61,000 PGM ounces in the quarter. Eskom load-shedding also impacted production,
largely at Amandelbult, resulting in a loss of 8,300 PGM ounces.


PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines decreased 7% to 560,100 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 6% to 257,500 ounces and palladium production decreased 7% to 204,500 ounces), largely due
to the COVID-19 shutdowns.




                                                                              2
Mogalakwena PGM production decreased 8% to 282,300 ounces (platinum decreased by 7% to 121,900 ounces
and palladium production decreased by 9% to 128,700 ounces), primarily due to maintenance on the North
concentrator mill which impacted tonnes milled, as well as the impact from COVID-19 shutdowns.


Amandelbult PGM production decreased 13% to 167,700 ounces (platinum and palladium production both
decreased by 13%, to 85,500 ounces and 39,100 ounces respectively), due to Eskom load shedding power
outages in January and February, as well as the COVID-19 shutdowns.


Mototolo PGM production increased by 6% to 61,200 ounces (platinum production increased by 5% to 28,300
ounces and palladium increased by 5% to 17,200 ounces), due to higher throughput and grade, despite the
impact of COVID-19 shutdowns.


Unki PGM production increased 13% to 49,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 13% to 21,800 ounces
and palladium production increased by 15% to 19,600 ounces), due to improved concentrator throughput and
recovery supported by mining volume increases.


PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, decreased by 10% to 188,800 ounces (platinum production decreased by 11% to
83,800 ounces and palladium production decreased by 9% to 56,800 ounces). This was largely due to the impact
of COVID-19 shutdowns.


In addition, due to the temporary closure of the ACP resulting in the declaration of force majeure to purchase of
concentrate suppliers, it was agreed that 50% of the concentrate produced by Kroondal (a pool and share
agreement) will be sold to, and processed by Sibanye-Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period. As
a result, Sibanye-Stillwater purchased and will market and sell material, equivalent to 12,000 PGM ounces in Q1.


Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate (POC) from third parties, decreased by 5% to 205,900 ounces (platinum POC
decreased by 3% to 99,600 ounces and palladium POC decreased by 6% to 41,800 ounces), due to the impact
of COVID-19 shutdowns, and the agreement that purchase of concentrate from Platinum Mile would be made by
Sibanye-Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period.


Refined PGM production

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, decreased by 22% to 612,200 ounces
(refined platinum production decreased 34% to 240,300 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by
26% to 197,100 ounces). Refined production was largely impacted by the temporary closure of the ACP on 6
March 2020, to repair the Phase B unit, which led to a temporary increase in work-in-progress inventory.


ACP Repair




                                                        3
The ACP was temporarily closed on 6 March 2020 to secure a safe operating environment. Repairs started on
Phase B unit, with most of the replacement equipment (i.e. waffle coolers) obtained from the undamaged waffle
coolers in the Phase A unit or spares available in inventory. All procurement of additional equipment was from
within South Africa, so no supply chain disruptions have been experienced.


The original estimated time for repairs was 80 days, with a completion date of around 25 May 2020. The ACP
Phase B repairs were able to continue during the lockdown period in South Africa and are progressing well and
on schedule. Repairs will be followed by significant testing to ensure stability and a safe operating environment
before re-commissioning of the ACP.


PGM sales volumes

PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, decreased 13% to 681,300
ounces, with platinum sales volumes down 33% to 239,900 ounces and palladium sales volumes down 14% to
222,500 ounces due to the decrease in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined palladium
inventory.




UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO COVID-19


Overview

On 23 March 2020 President Cyril Ramaphosa of the Republic of South Africa declared a national lockdown for
21 days effective from midnight of 26 March 2020. On 9 April 2020, Pres. Ramaphosa extended the lockdown
period in South Africa for an additional two-weeks, ending at midnight on 30 April 2020.


On the 28 March 2020, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe declared a national lockdown for 21 days
effective from midnight of the 30 March 2020 until midnight of the 19 April 2020. On 19 April 2020, Pres.
Mnangagwa extended the lockdown for an additional two weeks, ending on 3 May 2020.


Anglo American Platinum’s priority remains ensuring the safety and health of our employees and surrounding
communities. The Company completed safe shutdown, placing all assets on care and maintenance, which was
successfully completed without any incidents by midnight on Thursday 26th March, except for Mogalakwena
surface material which was treated through the concentrators on a scaled back basis. Operations which were
classified as essential mining operations were safely re-started in April at limited operating capacity, in line with
government guidelines.


Supporting employees, communities and small businesses

Anglo American Platinum is thankful to be in a position where all employees are paid their full fixed pay, pension
and medical benefits, as well as housing allowances where applicable, for the full duration of the extended
lockdown period. This includes all employees who have not been able to work as a result of the lockdown period.




                                                         4
The Board and Executive Committee of Anglo American Platinum notes and fully supports the call by President
Cyril Ramaphosa to contribute to supporting the national fight against the spread of COVID-19. The non-
executive directors have elected to contribute 30% of their fees for three months to charitable organisations that
are aiding the pandemic relief effort. The CEO and Finance Director will also donate 30% of their salaries for
three months to charities associated with Anglo American Platinum’s relief efforts in its host communities. The
Executive team have elected to contribute to the employee matching scheme supported by the Anglo American
Foundation, and many employees have been forthcoming in making contributions to charities of their choice.


During the lockdown period, essential services relating to care and maintenance needed to be carried out,
including pumping, critical maintenance, supervision, engineering, medical services, ventilation, transport and
security has been resourced with critical services employees. The necessary permits and delegations of authority
were all completed and issued to allow passage to the operations. There have been no material issues since the
lockdown commenced and attendance of essential services employees remains high and they are receiving an
extra allowance during the lockdown period in recognition of their commitment.


The medical and occupational health response to the pandemic continues. Essential services workers are
receiving the necessary medical screening, health information, being socially distanced and provided with the
required personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent infection. To date no COVID-19 cases have been
reported.


The Company continues to provide a wide range of essential services in its host communities in South Africa and
Zimbabwe, to provide additional support to help alleviate the health and economic effects of COVID-19. In
partnership with Gift of the Givers, the University of Pretoria and other stakeholders, the Company is expanding
water supply to communities that do not have access to water; supporting local clinics and hospitals with training,
PPE and other equipment to assist them to respond effectively to the pandemic; undertaking awareness
campaigns; and delivering food parcels to vulnerable families.


Anglo American Platinum has developed a supplier response plan which delivers a range of support including
reviewing payment terms, committing as far as possible to early settlement of invoices for small businesses and
assisting in directing small business owners for help from Government and other NGO assistance programs.


Limited production during the lockdown period


During the lockdown period, limited production at select operations was able to commence, but only after
extensive engagement with Unions and employees was conducted, to ensure that all aspects of health and safety
risks were considered. During March, limited surface operations commenced at the Mogalakwena North
Concentrator. This was later extended to limited mining operations at Mogalakwena and the re-heating and start-
up of the Polokwane smelter in April 2020, and in Zimbabwe, Unki mine was able to recommence limited
operations.

                                                        5
   At Mogalakwena mine, surface processing operations were allowed to continue during the shutdown in South
   Africa and surface ore stockpiles were fed to the North concentrator. With the successful start-up of North
   concentrator, South concentrator went through a safe start-up on 2 April at 75% capacity. Based on its status
   as an essential mining operation, limited mining operations started on 8 April which continued for the duration
   of the lockdown period.




2. Unki complex

    Unki operations were placed on care and maintenance when the lockdown period commenced in Zimbabwe
    on 30 March. Approval was granted by the Government of Zimbabwe for the operations to resume with a
    requirement to comply with the strict measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The mining operations
    reopened on 7 April following implementation of these measures, with the Concentrator scheduled to start
    at the beginning of May whilst the Smelter remains on care and maintenance.


3. Polokwane smelter

    Polokwane smelter was placed on care and maintenance when the lockdown period commenced. A safe
    start-up plan, integrating social distancing and safe procedures was established and Polokwane smelter
    was ramped-up on 14 April 2020. Polokwane smelter is running at full capacity to smelt the material from
    Mogalakwena mine.


4. Other operations

   Our own operations that did not operate or start-up during the lockdown period include:
        -     Amandelbult mine
        -     Mototolo mine
        -     Joint venture operation – Modikwa mine
        -     Joint venture operation – Kroondal mine
        -     Mortimer smelter
        -     Waterval smelter
        -     ACP (although repairs continue) and the magnetic concentrator plant (MCP)
        -     Base metal and precious metal refineries

    Some third-party purchase of concentrate production was started at a limited capacity during the lockdown
    period.


M&C Production impact from the lockdown period


The PGM production impact for Q1 2020 from the COVID-19 related shutdowns amounted to 61,000 PGM
ounces. The Company estimates that the full impact of the shutdown in South Africa and Zimbabwe to the end
of the extended lockdown period to 30 April 2020 will be approximately 331,000 PGM ounces.

Unaudited financial position and committed facilities


At the end of the 2019 reporting period (31 December 2019), Anglo American Platinum was in a net cash position
of R17.3 billion, including the customer prepayment of R9.4 billion. On 9 March 2020, the Company paid the year
end base dividend and special dividend totalling R11.1 billion.


As at 31 March 2020 the Company remains in a net cash position of R11.8 billion (unaudited), including the
customer prepayment and early settlement of the deferred consideration for the sale of the Company’s 33%
share of the Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine to Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited. Anglo American Platinum
also has R20.5 billion of committed facilities available.


Despite the strong financial position, the Company is undertaking a cash conservation programme, with
measures amounting to annual cost and capex savings for 2020 of over R4.0 billion including:
-     Cost cutting measures implemented to eliminate all non-essential costs
-     Non-essential capital expenditure delays
-     For employees not at work, the reduction in payment of overtime and production bonuses resulting in labour
      cost reductions



Capital expenditure savings


In line with cash conservation measures, the Company has been able to look at the deferral of non-essential
capital for 2020. The approach pursued was to deliver capex reductions that supported the updated production
profile whilst ensuring the long-term asset integrity and maximising immediate reduction in planned spend.



                                                            7
Further reductions arose from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns on project equipment
delivery schedules and the lead time to project site start up with the implementation of social distancing and
hygiene protocols for construction.


The SIB reductions largely relate to non-production support equipment replacement, general infrastructure
upgrades, non-plant asset replacement and deferment of rebuilds, which will not impact the integrity of the assets
or business continuity. These are partially offset by the additional SIB capital required to repair Phase B and
Phase A units of the ACP, which amount to R200m and R500m respectively in 2020. This guidance does not
include any potential insurance proceeds receivable. Project capital has also been reduced largely by delaying
the start of certain breakthrough and digitalisation projects which can be deferred without adverse impact on the
business.

Full-year guidance


Referencing the SENS announcement made on 19 March 2020, with regards to the update on the impact of the
temporary closure of the ACP, the Company provided updated M&C production and refined production guidance.


As a result of the precautions and shutdown in South Africa and Zimbabwe to curb the spread of COVID-19, the
production outlook is difficult to quantify. There are several variables that could impact production including:
-      The ability to complete safe start-up at our own managed mines, joint ventures operations and third parties
       we purchase concentrate from
-      Ongoing social distance and de-densification measures to keep employees safe from COVID-19 and the
       potential impact this has on production
-      Further Government policy leading to shutdowns or extensions thereof that could impact production
-      Possibility of infections at operations, despite significant efforts to implement safety and hygiene measures
-      Ensuring all stakeholders agree with the approach to establish safe working practices

Considering this, we have revised our FY2020 M&C production and refined production guidance on our best
estimates of the outlook for the year, cautioning that production guidance will remain fluid, and further downside
risk is possible.

At our new revised M&C production level, all material should be refined in 2020.

Anglo American Platinum updates response to South Africa’s COVID-19 measures

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the SENS announcement released on 24 March 2020,
which notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 23 March in relation
to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, to take effect at midnight on Thursday 26 March, in order to help curb
the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.

Anglo American Platinum remains unconditional about safety and the health and wellbeing of employees
and contractors remains our core priority. The Company has started the controlled ramp down of its
underground mining operations at Amandelbult, the Modikwa JV and the Kroondal JV, as well as the
Mortimer smelter and Waterval smelter (which receives concentrate from those operations), in order to
place them safely into care and maintenance for the period of the lockdown.

In line with South African government regulations, Anglo American Platinum has assessed the ability to
continue some operations on a reduced basis. Subject to further planning, mining operations at the open-
pit Mogalakwena mine, and at the mechanised Mototolo mine may continue on a reduced basis.
Polokwane smelter will also operate to smelt this material into furnace matte. Following a thorough risk
assessment to determine the safety of employees and contractors on site, additional safety, health and
hygiene provisions have been put in place to protect the wellness of employees that will continue to work
during the temporary shut-down period.

Critical care and maintenance work will continue at all operations and will include the ongoing repair of
the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit, to ensure the integrity of the assets, and prepare for a
safe operational ramp-up. All required parts and equipment for the Phase B repair are on site and the
estimated time for repair work remains 80 days, ending around 25 May 2020.

A number of specified essential services will also continue, including security; mine maintenance; tailings
facility safety management; water treatment; community water supply; accommodation provision; health,
safety and emergency response; and critical head office services.

Anglo American Platinum remains aware of the significant impact of the shutdown on its employees and
has reached agreement to pay all employees basic salaries, housing allowance and continue with
Company contributions to medical and pension funds throughout the 21-day lockdown period. In addition,
the Company acknowledges the vital role our operations play in the local communities in which they
operate, and we remain committed to providing services including the supply of potable water, healthcare,
emergency response assistance and maintenance of civil infrastructure throughout the lockdown period.
We will continue to see how we can further support our communities at this difficult time.

Anglo American Platinum has a clear responsibility to protect the integrity of our business and operations
and will ensure a controlled and measured shutdown of the operations going into care and maintenance.
It is critical that we are prepared for a safe start up once the lockdown restrictions are eased and return
operations to normal levels as swiftly as possible to support economic recovery in South Africa.

Anglo American Platinum update on the temporary shutdown of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
and impact of force majeure

Anglo American Platinum issued a SENS announcement on 6 March 2020 regarding the temporary
closure of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) and the declaration of force majeure to secure a safe
operating environment. Anglo American Platinum has since started the repair process and has been in
discussions with third parties from which it purchases concentrate and for which it toll-treats 4E material
and agreed in principle revised terms for the duration of the force majeure period. Anglo American
Platinum does not foresee any customer agreements being terminated as a result of this disruption.

The force majeure period is defined as starting on 6 March 2020 and remains ongoing for the time it takes
to repair ACP Phase B which is expected to be approximately 80 days, ending around 25 May 2020.

ACP repair process and capital expenditure update

The total repair time, including the time to procure all necessary spares and equipment, is estimated at
80 days. The repair team is on site executing the work, and a full investigation is under way to understand
the cause and nature of the water ingress into the furnace. The majority of the replacement equipment
(i.e. waffle coolers) can either be obtained from the undamaged waffle coolers in the Phase A unit or
spares available in inventory. All procurement of additional equipment is from within South Africa, so no
supply chain disruptions are anticipated.

A project team is also in place to execute the repairs to Phase A, and orders for the long lead items have
been placed. It is still estimated that repairs will be complete by Q2 2021.

The estimated capital expenditure for replacement equipment and repair of ACP Phase B is R150 to
R200 million, which will be incurred in 2020, while the estimated capital expenditure to rebuild Phase A
will be R500 to R600 million, of which R100 million is expected to be incurred in 2021. These are
incremental capital expenditure amounts to full year guidance previously provided but exclude any
potential insurance proceeds.

As a result of the activities under way at the ACP, the Company is reviewing its capital plans for 2020
and will provide a further update of the full year capex guidance in due course.

Force majeure agreement with Sibanye-Stillwater

Anglo American Platinum has agreed in principle revised processing agreements with Sibanye-Stillwater
at the different operations including:

1. Toll-treatment of 4E material from Rustenburg:

    PGM concentrate from Rustenburg that is processed at Anglo American Platinum’s processing
    facilities will continue to be smelted by Anglo American Platinum and will continue to receive a
    smelting fee. For the period of the force majeure, smelter matte will be returned to Sibanye-Stillwater
    for further treatment and refining.

2. Kroondal pool and share agreement (PSA classified as 50% purchase of concentrate and 50% JV
   mined production)

    The Kroondal joint venture operations operate under a PSA agreement, whereby Anglo American
    Platinum purchases 100% of the concentrate, with 50% accounted as own-mine production and 50%
    as purchase of concentrate from the Kroondal PSA.

    50% of the concentrate produced by the Kroondal PSA will be sold to and processed by Sibanye-
    Stillwater for the duration of the force majeure period under the same terms as the pre-existing
    purchase of concentrate terms with Anglo American Platinum. Sibanye-Stillwater will market and sell
    the material.

    The remaining 50% of concentrate produced will continue to be purchased by Anglo American
    Platinum and smelted at one of the Company’s smelter complexes. Together with Sibanye-Stillwater,
    we have established revised payment terms which allow for delays in payment during the force
    majeure period.

3. Platinum Mile (classified as third party purchase of concentrate)

    Platinum Mile concentrate will be sold to and processed by Sibanye-Stillwater, who will take
    ownership of the material for the duration of the force majeure period under the same terms as the
    pre-existing purchase of concentrate agreement with Anglo American Platinum. Sibanye-Stillwater
    will market and sell the material. In 2019, Platinum Mile produced 23,600 PGM ounces.

These revised terms will only be applicable during the force majeure period, which is the period it takes
to repair ACP Phase B.

Force majeure to purchase of concentrate suppliers

Anglo American Platinum purchases concentrate from Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (“RBPlats”), the
independently managed Modikwa joint-venture (“Modikwa JV”), Siyanda Resources (“Siyanda”) and
small volumes from other third parties. The Company can confirm that it has engaged with all parties and
agreed in principle temporarily revised terms which will allow concentrate to continue to be delivered to
the Company’s smelters during the force majeure period. Anglo American Platinum will continue to smelt
concentrate received at all its four smelter complexes. Together with our partners RBPlats, the Modikwa
JV and Siyanda, we have established temporarily revised payment terms which allow for delays in
payment during the force majeure period.

Force majeure to customers

Anglo American Platinum continues to work with its customers, within the provisions of the force majeure
clauses in their agreements, to minimise the impacts of the disruption. The force majeure protections are
such that the Company does not foresee any agreements being terminated as a result of this disruption,
including the customer prepayment which remains in place.

 (5E + gold)



As a result of the changes in the agreements with third parties, in particular the sale of concentrate from
Platinum Mile and 50% of the Kroondal PSA to Sibanye-Stillwater, and not due to production reductions,
we revise our production guidance (metal in concentrate basis) to be at the lower end of previously
provided guidance of between 4.2 - 4.6 million PGM ounces, and we maintain our revised refined
production of 3.3 - 3.8 million PGM ounces.

Unit cost of production guidance remains between R10,600 - R11,000 per PGM ounce.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum’s PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company’s smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum announces temporary shutdown of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
and declares force majeure

Anglo American Platinum announces the temporary shutdown of the entire Anglo Converter Plant (ACP),
part of the chain of processing facilities, and the need to declare force majeure.

The Company's ACP phase A converter plant, at Waterval smelter in Rustenburg, was damaged following
an explosion within the converter on 10 February 2020. Nobody was injured in the incident and work has
started to repair phase A, which is expected to be completed by Q2 2021.

As per normal business procedure, the phase B unit was commissioned to take over from the phase A
plant and was in the process of ramping up to steady state, when water was detected in the furnace.
Notwithstanding extensive testing being conducted to determine the source of the water, and a number
of circuits being isolated, water continued to be observed in the furnace. This poses a high risk of
explosion and the Company has determined that it has no other option but to temporarily shut down the
phase B unit, to ensure the safety of all employees, and avoid a catastrophic event. It is anticipated that
the repair works to fix the phase B unit will take approximately 80 days.

As a result of the temporary closure of the entire ACP, Anglo American Platinum has had to declare force
majeure to customers, suppliers of third-party purchase of concentrate and suppliers of tolling material,
as we are unable to complete the processing of material during the converter repair. Production from own
mines will continue, and the concentrate from the mines will continue to be smelted at one of the four
smelter complexes. However, production from own mines, as well as third party material will not be able
to be converted to refined production while the ACP is undergoing repairs.

Initial estimates of the impact on AAP refined production are shown in the guidance below:

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum's PGM production process, treating furnace
matte from the company's smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the furnace matte
from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting converter matte is then slow-
cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP, material moves to the Magnetic
Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled and the PGM fraction is separated
magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery
(PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium,
ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American Platinum announces appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO

The Board of Anglo American Platinum Limited (""Anglo American Platinum"") announces the
appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO, with effect from 16 April 2020, following Chris Griffith's
decision to step down after more than seven years to pursue other career opportunities.

Norman Mbazima, Chairman of Anglo American Platinum, said: ""I am delighted to welcome
Natascha Viljoen as CEO of Anglo American Platinum. Natascha is a seasoned senior executive,
bringing 28 years of operational experience from across our mining industry, spanning many
different countries, metals and minerals including, of course, the PGMs. She knows us and our
business well, having worked with our executive team over the last five years in leading the
changes required to transform the performance of - and commercial value from - our processing
operations.""

Ms Viljoen is currently Group Head of Processing for Anglo American, a role she has held since
2014. In that role, she has led a trusted global team that has unlocked value across Anglo
American's processing operations safely and with a long term perspective, recognising their
critical commercial place in the mining value chain.

Prior to joining Anglo American, Natascha was Executive Vice President of Processing at Lonmin
while also leading the company's sustainability, employee health, environmental and stakeholder
relations work at various times. Natascha began her career as an engineer at Iscor and, amongst
other roles, took on leadership positions at AngloGold and was General Manager of BHP's
Klipspruit Colliery before joining Lonmin in 2008.

Under Natascha's leadership, her team has successfully leveraged and accelerated technology
development and deployment to unlock the full potential of mineral endowments through
processing, delivering significant financial value and competitive advantage. She and her team
are recognised for their work in developing Coarse Particle Recovery technology which enables
the separation of metals from rock using a fraction of the energy and water of traditional methods,
while increasing throughput and productivity.

Natascha Viljoen said: ""I feel really excited to take on my new role at Anglo American Platinum
and I am fortunate to inherit a business in such a strong position. Chris Griffith has reshaped our
PGMs portfolio to be fit for the future and I believe we now have an opportunity to re-imagine how
we operate - in our mines and our host communities. It is also our responsibility to build upon
the wide variety of applications for our platinum group metals that already play a critical role in
so many areas of modern life, from clean transport and energy, to health and jewellery, of course.

""Safety is paramount, always, while building a purpose-led high performance culture with
stakeholders front of mind is critical to the future of our business. We will work to ensure that
what we do and the benefits we bring for all our stakeholders are sustainable in every sense.""
Natascha Viljoen will join Anglo American Platinum on 1 April 2020 and the Group Management
Committee of Anglo American plc on 16 April 2020.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Anglo American Platinum, commented:
“For the first time in Anglo American Platinum’s history, we have had no
workplace fatalities at our managed operations in the year. The Company also
demonstrated leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance
in 2019. Anglo American Platinum has delivered another strong set of
operational and financial results. Overall, PGM production was up 1%, with
record production once again achieved at Mogalakwena and Unki mines. EBITDA
doubled to R30.0 billion and ROCE increased to 58%. Net cash is at R17.3
billion, an improvement of R14.4 billion from end 2018. As a result of the
strong cash generation, a final dividend for H2 2019 of R11.2 billion or
R41.60/share was declared, made up of R16.60 base dividend and R25.00 special
dividend. This brings the aggregate 2019 dividend to R14.2 billion or
R52.60/share. We continue to progress the next phase of our strategy,
focusing on optimising value at our operations through world-best operating
practices, modernisation and by investing in breakthrough projects to reach
new benchmark (known as P101) levels of productivity and the implementation
of FutureSmart MiningTM technologies, digitalisation and sustainability. We
continue to assess the project studies for expansion at Mogalakwena and
Mototolo/Der Brochen as well as investing in market development to stimulate
incremental demand for our platinum group metals.”

EARLY SETTLEMENT OF DEFERRED CONSIDERATION FOR 33% INTEREST IN BRPM JV BY
ROYAL BAFOKENG PLATINUM

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the SENS announcement of the completion of the
disposal of its 33% interest in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine joint venture (""BRPM JV"") on 12
December 2018, (the ""Transaction"").

The total purchase consideration at the time of announcement was R2.178 billion, (the total consideration
of R1.863 billion plus the repayment of the Company's contributions into the BRPM JV until completion of
the Transaction). The upfront purchase consideration was settled by a cash payment by Royal Bafokeng
Resources Proprietary Limited (""RBR"") of R555 million (approximately US$40 million).

The remaining deferred consideration, including accumulated interest, of R1.851 billion (c.$125 million)
has been settled in full by RBR on 30 January 2020.

All existing commercial arrangements remain in place notwithstanding the settlement of the deferred
consideration. The Company retains its right to purchase 50% of the BRPM JV's concentrate for the life
of mine and RBR retains the right to sell its 50% of the concentrate to Anglo American Platinum.

Shareholders are also referred to the Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited announcement relating to the
settlement of the deferred consideration dated 3 February 2020.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Anglo American Platinum will release results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"")
on the Stock Exchange News Service on 17 February 2020.

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period
are likely to increase by between 131% and 151% respectively compared to the prior year. Headline
earnings are likely to be between R17.545 billion and R19.055 billion (R7.588 billion in 2018) and HEPS
will increase to between 6,689 cents and 7,265 cents per share (2,893 cents in 2018).

Basic earnings and earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period are likely to increase by between 157% and
177% respectively compared to the prior year. Basic earnings are likely to be between R17.545 billion and
R18.900 billion (R6.817 billion in 2018) and EPS is expected to be between 6,689 cents and 7,205 cents
per share (2,599 cents 2018).

The expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings is primarily driven by a 38% increase in
the rand basket price and continued steady operational performance, notwithstanding the loss in
production (38,000 PGM ounces) and deferred refined production (89,000 PGM ounces to be refined in
2020) due to Eskom power outages.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has been reviewed, but not yet reported
on, by the Company's external auditors.

PGM PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2019


OVERVIEW

- Commitment to elimination of fatalities - no fatalities occurred in Q4 2019, resulting in a fatal free year at
   managed operations

- Total PGM production (expressed as 5E+Au metal in concentrate) increased 9% against prior year (Q4
   2018) to 1,152,700 ounces, (excluding Sibanye-Stillwater 4E material), despite the impact of Eskom power
   outages, which led to a loss of c.20,000 PGM ounces

- Own managed mines PGM production increased by 21% to 675,200 ounces due to increased production
   from all own managed mines

- Joint venture PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate, excluding Mototolo) decreased by 11%
   to 231,200 ounces due to the impact of power outages, safety stoppages and low equipment availability

- Refined PGM production including tolling decreased by 2% to 1,492,100 ounces as improved processing
   operational performance was offset by the impact of Eskom power outages and the associated Rustenburg
   Processing facilities power failure in December. This led to a build-up of c.89,000 PGM ounces in work-in-
   progress inventory which be will refined in 2020

- PGM sales volumes excluding tolling were up 11% to 1,414,100 ounces as refined production increased
   and a drawdown in refined inventory supplemented sales

    Total M
    -        Include Mototolo production as own mined production on a 100% basis;
    -        Include Union production as purchase of concentrate from third parties; and
    -        Include Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) production as purchase of concentrate from third
             parties.

Total PGM production of 1,152,700 ounces increased 9%, with platinum production up 10% to 531,700 ounces
and palladium production up 10% to 360,400 ounces. Eskom power outages led to a loss of production in the
quarter of c.20,000 ounces across all operations in Q4 2019.

PGM production from own managed mines

Total PGM production from own managed mines increased 21% to 675,200 ounces (platinum production
increased by 22% to 310,000 ounces and palladium production increased 20% to 241,000 ounces), due to higher
production from all operations, despite the impact of Eskom power outages leading to a loss of 16,800 PGM
ounces of production.


Mogalakwena PGM production increased 24% to 317,500 ounces (platinum increased by 25% to 135,800 ounces
and palladium production increased by 23% to 146,000 ounces), due to an increase in built-up head grade. High
grade ore stockpiles were drawn down to supplement mined production as low equipment availability, due to
maintenance on the rope shovel, impacted production.


Amandelbult PGM production increased 25% to 238,700 ounces (platinum production increased by 24% to
120,100 ounces and palladium increased by 25% to 56,000 ounces), as the benefit from increased development
at Dishaba lower mine has allowed increased productivity and production.


Unki PGM production increased 5% to 52,000 ounces (platinum production increased by 6% to 23,300 ounces
and palladium production increased by 2% to 20,000 ounces), due to improved concentrator throughput and mill
run-time, partially offset by lower grade.


On a 100% basis, Mototolo PGM production increased by 9% to 66,900 ounces (platinum production increased
by 10% to 30,900 ounces and palladium by 8% to 19,000 ounces), due to higher mining rates and throughput
efficiency improvement at the concentrator.

PGM production from joint ventures (50% own mined production and 50% purchase of concentrate)

Joint venture PGM production, excluding Mototolo, decreased by 11% to 231,200 ounces (platinum production
decreased by 10% to 103,600 ounces and palladium production decreased by 11% to 68,000 ounces), including
losses from Eskom power outages of 3,200 PGM ounces. PGM production at Kroondal was down 8% due to the
power outages and PGM production at Modikwa decreased by 16% due to low equipment availability and section
54 safety stoppages.

Purchases of PGM concentrate from third parties

Purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties, excluding 4E tolled material, increased by 1% to 246,300 ounces
due to higher volume from Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) and Siyanda Resources (Union).

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined PGM production, excluding tolling and 4E production now tolled, increased by 2% to 1,308,800 ounces
(refined platinum production was flat at 624,900 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 6% to
394,400 ounces), despite the impact of Eskom power outages, as well as the associated Rustenburg Processing
facilities power outage event in December 2019.
PGM sales volumes, excluding the impact of 4E toll treated material and trading, were up 11% to 1,414,100
ounces, with platinum sales volumes up 5% to 662,000 ounces and palladium sales volumes up 11% to 432,700
ounces due to an increase in refined production, supplemented by a drawdown in refined inventory.

Eskom power outages impact on 2019 production

In the first half of the year, own-managed mines lost production due to power outages that required the mines to
shut down, resulting in a loss of 18,000 PGM ounces. In the second half of the year (Q4 2019), own-managed
mines lost 16,800 PGM ounces, and joint ventures lost 3,200 PGM ounces. This resulted in a loss of production
(which cannot be recovered) of 38,000 PGM ounces for 2019.


Power outages resulted in an impact to refined production of 74,700 PGM ounces in Q1 2019, and a further
70,200 PGM ounces in Q4 2019. A load-shedding related event, resulting in a total power outage at the
Rustenburg Processing facilities in December 2019, led to a further impact on refined production of 71,100 PGM
ounces, resulting in a total impact on refined production of 216,000 PGM ounces for the year. The strong
operational performance of the processing assets led to 127,000 PGM ounces being caught up in 2019, with
89,000 PGM ounces built up in work-in-progress inventory which will be refined in 2020.

Anglo American Platinum updates guidance in line with the Anglo American plc Investor Update

Anglo American Platinum refers shareholders to the Anglo American plc briefing for investors and
analysts which includes updated production guidance for the financial years to 2022:


Platinum production (M&C):
2019F: In line with guidance of 2.0 – 2.1 Moz
2020F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (unchanged)
2021F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (unchanged)
2022F: 2.0 - 2.2 Moz (new guidance)


Palladium production (M&C):
2019F: In line with guidance of 1.3 – 1.4 Moz
2020F: c. 1.4 Moz (previously 1.3 – 1.4 Moz)
2021F: c. 1.4 Moz (previously 1.3 – 1.4 Moz)
2022F: 1.4 -1.5 Moz (new guidance)

Anglo American Platinum’s unit cost guidance for 2019 of between R21,000 to R22,000 per platinum
ounce produced (M&C) will likely exceed the upper end of guidance to between R22,000 and R22,300
per platinum ounce produced (M&C), which could be further impacted by current power outages as
Eskom implements load shedding.

The presentation will start at 12:00 UK time / 14:00 SA time today (10 December 2019) and is available
on the Anglo American plc website at https://www.angloamerican.com/investors/investor-
presentations/2019.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current
beliefs and expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this
