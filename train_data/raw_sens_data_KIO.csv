Kumba’s commitment to safety, health and sustainability creates shared value for its stakeholders

Following the annual publication of its sustainability report, Kumba is today presenting its sustainability performance
for the first time. Themba Mkhwanazi, Kumba’s Chief Executive, said: ""Sustainability is at the heart of who we are at
Kumba and core to what we do. We recognise that a sustainability mindset, including our non-negotiable commitment
to safety and health, makes us better at our business of producing high quality iron ore. It makes us more resilient,
agile and efficient. There are many highlights, but I am proud that for the fourth year in a row, we have achieved zero
fatalities and have had no major environmental incidents.

""We continue to embed sustainable mining practices into our operations through our Sustainable Mining Plan which
is aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We launched the plan in 2018 and it is built on three
key pillars, aligned with E, S and G:

    -   E: Healthy environment – recognising that biodiversity, energy and water all lie within our stewardship;
    -   S: Thriving communities – building communities with better health, education and levels of employment; and
    -   G: Trusted corporate leader - developing trust, providing ethical value chains and improved accountability.

""Our commitment to sustainability is underpinned by our board structure and governance framework, where
sustainability is represented by a number of internal and external engagement forums, including our Social, Ethics
and Transformation Committee. Furthermore, our executive’s long-term incentives map directly to Kumba
sustainability performance through six metrics namely:

    -   total recordable case frequency rate;
    -   level 3 to 5 environmental incidents;
    -   PM10 dust control;
    -   financial provision provided for rehabilitation and mine closure;
    -   attributable free cash flow; and
    -   attributable return on capital employed

""Kumba has adopted the Anglo American Social Way, a best practice integrated social performance management
system which defines our social performance standard s and governing framework. This guides our approach to
community engagement and development as well as cultural heritage, all of which are essential to our social license
to operate and innovate. The Social Way was leveraged to develop Kumba’s Covid-19 WeCare Community response
plans, providing much needed support for our host communities. This year, for example, we spent R2.4 billion with
more than 300 businesses in our host communities, directly and positively impacting the lives of well over 16 000
people.""

Climate change is one of the biggest environmental challenges facing the world. Kumba’s environmental management
efforts are focused on moving the business towards operating carbon neutral and less water intensive mines.

    -   Kumba has a critical role to play in the transition to a low carbon world, both by becoming carbon neutral at
        our operations and by providing high-quality iron ore that allows customers to reduce their carbon emissions
        in the process of steel production.
    -   We are targeting a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 30% improvement in energy intensity
        against our 2016 baseline by 2030. Together with the broader Anglo American group, we are developing
        solar renewable energy generation and investigating green hydrogen as a renewable energy source for
        mining activities.
    -   Kumba revised its water strategy during 2020 and we are targeting a more than 14% reduction in water usage
        by 2025. Water efficiency projects such as the reduction of water usage in dust suppression are being
        implemented.
    -   Kumba’s integrated approach to managing social and climate change risks, recognises the importance of
        cross-disciplinary collaboration for effective risk management through integrated water, energy and carbon
        management.

""To successfully deliver on our purpose to re-imagine mining to improve people's lives, we need to change the way
we mine. We need to earn our social license to innovate. Our FutureSmart Mining(TM) approach which includes our
Sustainable Mining Plan, is focused on technology, digitisation and sustainability working to ensure safer, more
efficient and precise mining with an optimised footprint.

""We are continually improving our business model using new technology and strategies that create a safer, greener
and sustainably profitable business. This provides more control over our destiny such that we can meet all of our
sustainability commitments and create value f or all of our stakeholders.""

Safety and health
Kumba continues to prioritise the health, safety and well-being of our workforce and our communities. In these
challenging times, our fatality free record of over four years is testament to our safety culture. This is underpinned by
critical control risk monitoring, risk reduction initiatives and our elimination of fatalities programme.
Our WeCare Covid-19 response programme and protocols are embedded across the operations and have become
part of our day-to-day procedures. We continue to provide essential services, including water, food parcels and
emergency medical support while contributing to the livelihoods and health of our host communities.

Mining and production
We continue to focus on balancing our value chain thereby ensuring that iron ore deliveries meet market demand.
Kumba delivered a solid mining performance for the period. While total waste stripping of 58.8Mt is 16% below the
69.6Mt achieved in Q3 2019 (“the comparative period”), it is ahead of both the first and the Covid-19 impacted second
quarter of this year of 50.1Mt and 44.5Mt, respectively. Overall, steady progress continues to be made with our
scheduled maintenance programme, and equipment performance has improved as a result.

Waste stripping for the period at Sishen increased by 37% to 42.9Mt (Q2 2020: 31.3Mt), driven by primary equipment
availability and a steady increase in direct operating hours. At Kolomela, waste stripping increased by 20% to 15.9
Mt (Q2 2020: 13.2Mt) following the optimisation of hauling routes, resulting in improved truck utilisation.

Production is managed carefully in conjunction with finished stock levels to optimise our value chain. Taking into
account the higher levels of finished stock in Q2 2020 due to Covid-19 related logistical constraints, and the annual
rail and port maintenance taking place in Q4 2020, we drew down on stock levels during the period. Total finished
stock reduced by 0.9Mt to 5.3Mt from 6.2Mt at 30 June 2020. Total production decreased by 1Mt or 9% to 9.5Mt
(Q3 2019: 10.5Mt) and increased by 12% relative to Q2 2020.

Logistics, sales and the market environment
The successful outcome of Covid-19 measures and initiatives to increase workforce capacity at Transnet resulted in
the iron ore export channel haulage rates returning to pre-Covid levels. Consequently, there was a significant
improvement in throughput at Saldanha Port.

Export sales increased by 13% to 10.9Mt (Q3 2019: 9.7Mt) and by 35% relative to Q2 2020. In line with expectations,
there was no off-take from ArcelorMittal South Africa during the period.

China’s strong economic rebound continued to support a favourable iron ore market, with the Platts 62 index CFR
price averaging US$119/dmt for the period. This compares, against US$101/dmt for the year-to-date (“YTD”). Kumba
achieved an average realised FOB export iron ore price of US$117/dmt for the period (2020 YTD: US$103/dmt),
benefiting from the recovery in markets outside of China and a lump:fine ratio of 71:29 (2020 YTD: 67:33). The product
quality averaged 64.2% Fe for the period (2020 YTD: 64.3%).

Full year 2020 guidance
Kumba is on track to meet its full year 2020 guidance announced at our interim results presentation on 28 July 2020.
Our guidance takes into account Transnet’s annual maintenance during October and is as follows:

•   Total sales of 38 - 40 Mt
•   Total production of 37 - 39 Mt
    - Sishen: ~27 Mt
    - Kolomela: ~11 Mt
•   Waste:
    - Sishen: 145 - 160 Mt
    - Kolomela: 45 - 55 Mt

Production and sales volumes referred to for the period are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited
(“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as to the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current beliefs and
expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are
estimates and have not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

Kumba approves Kapstevel South project at Kolomela

Kumba is pleased to announce the approval of its Kapstevel South project at its Kolomela mine by both the Company
and Anglo American’s boards.

The total capital cost of the project will be approximately R7 billion, including pre-stripping. It is anticipated that the
addition of the Kapstevel South pit will deliver an after-tax internal rate of return of ~25% and allow Kolomela to
maintain an estimated EBITDA margin of >35% in the long-term.

The project entails the development of a new pit, Kapstevel South and associated infrastructure at Kolomela. The pit
is a conventional truck and shovel operation producing high quality direct shipping ore (DSO). Whilst the pit is included
in the current life of mine, it contributes significantly to sustaining production of ~13Mt for the remaining life of mine.
Pit establishment and waste stripping will commence this year with first ore expected in 2024.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “The approval of this project, at a time when the global and South African
economies face the challenges of Covid-19, underscores Kumba’s positive longer-term outlook for demand for its
high-quality product. It also demonstrates our commitment to extend the lives of our mines and continue providing
much-needed jobs and livelihoods in the Northern Cape region.”

The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are estimates and the financial information
has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

HIGHLIGHTS
- Four years of fatality-free production
- R13 billion of shared value created
- Average realised FOB price of US$93/tonne                
- Protected EBITDA margin of 55%               
- ROCE of 84%                
- Net cash of R15.7 billion 
- Interim cash dividend of R19.60 per share

OVERVIEW  
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba said: ""Kumba adapted its business quickly and comprehensively to meet the
human, operational and market challenges of the likely enduring reality of Covid-19. The Company delivered a strong
performance in the first half of the year, with EBITDA of R17.4 billion at a margin of 55%. We are a resilient and capital
efficient business with a robust balance sheet, well positioned to navigate the current environment and the longer term. 

The safety and health of our employees and contractors has always been our first priority. We have now marked four
years of being fatality free. In these unprecedented times it is even more critical to safeguard both lives and livelihoods
and support the ecosystem in which we operate. We have implemented an extensive WeCare programme across four pillars of
physical health, mental health, living with dignity, and community response that supports our workforce, communities
and suppliers. In practice, this programme includes screening and testing, workforce education and communication, mental
health support, contingency plans to ensure social distancing at work and to allow for periods of self-isolation, as well 
as remote working. We are contributing to our local communities by providing essential services such as water, healthcare, 
and medical services in partnership with the Provincial Department of Health and the local municipalities. With the support
of our host communities, unions and government and the safe practices of our people, we have been able to reopen and
ramp up production safely.

Kumba's production of 17.9 Mt and sales of 18.6 Mt were in line with our Covid-19 adjusted guidance for the first half 
of the year, following continued improvements as we returned to pre-Covid-19 run-rates in June. Our strong EBITDA
performance translated into R7.1 billion of attributable free cash flow. Taking into account our strong earnings, the
resilience required for our new operating conditions, and need for a robust balance sheet, the Board declared an interim
cash dividend of R19.60 per share, representing a payout ratio of 75% of headline earnings.

We remain committed to our strategic imperatives of margin enhancement and life extension which are key to our
sustainability. Our margin continued to benefit from constructive market prices and currency weakness, as well as the 
early and decisive action taken to protect our margin through additional cash preservation measures including delivering 
R700 million in cost savings for the year to date.

Kumba has been through challenging times before and we know how to respond. Our approach to navigating the pandemic is
based on ensuring the resilience of our business, living our values of care and respect, and fulfilling our purpose to
re-imagine mining to improve people's lives. We are building on our strategy to further strengthen our business and
ensure that we remain agile, resilient and able to meet the challenges that we face.""

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Kumba's operational performance for the period reflects the lockdown and subsequent reopening of operations in Q2 2020
with reduced workforce levels of approximately 50%, before ramping up production to pre-Covid-19 run-rates in June.
Consequently, total tonnes mined for the period decreased by 15% to 117.6 Mt (H1 2019: 138.0 Mt), with total waste 
reducing by 17% to 94.6 Mt (H1 2019: 113.8 Mt).

Both production and sales are closely managed in line with Transnet's logistical capacity, which increased to
approximately 80% in June 2020. As a result, total production was 11% lower at 17.9 Mt, relative to the 20.1 Mt delivered 
in the same period in 2019 with the impact of the pandemic most evident in the second quarter as volumes decreased by 20%. 

Total sales volumes declined by 13% to 18.6 Mt (H1 2019: 21.4 Mt), driven by lower domestic offtake by ArcelorMittal
SA of 0.4 Mt (H1 2019: 1.5 Mt), while export sales volumes decreased by 8% to 18.3 Mt (H1 2019: 19.9 Mt) due to
logistical constraints and severe coastal weather conditions impacting ship loading at Saldanha port.

REVENUE AND EBITDA
Total revenue decreased by 8% to R31.6 billion (H1 2019: R34.5 billion), mainly as a result of lower prices and sales
volumes, partially offset by a weaker exchange rate.

Kumba's average realised iron ore export price decreased by 14% to US$93/tonne (H1 2019: US$108/tonne), while the
average Rand/US$ exchange rate weakened by 17% to R16.67/US$1 (H1 2019: R14.20/US$1). Sales volumes reduced by 13% to 
18.6 Mt (H1 2019: 21.4 Mt) due to lower exports of 1.6 Mt and lower domestic sales of 1.1 Mt. Shipping revenue increased 
by R569 million, benefitting from a weaker currency and higher volumes, partly offset by lower freight rates. 

EBITDA of R17.4 billion reflects a decrease of 14% compared with R20.1 billion in H1 2019. Currency gains from a
weaker exchange rate and reduced operating expenses provided support. However, this was offset by the lower average 
realised FOB price of US$93/tonne (H1 2019: US$108/tonne), the 2.7 Mt impact of lower sales volumes and inflation-led 
cost escalation. 

In line with this, Kumba's EBITDA margin decreased to 55% (H1 2019: 58%), with the mining operating margin declining to
53% (H1 2019: 56%), excluding a net freight loss incurred on shipping operations. 

CASH FLOW
Kumba ended the period with a net cash position of R15.7 billion (H1 2019: R18.4 billion). Cash flow generated from
operations was R15.0 billion (H1 2019: R19.2 billion), underpinned by EBITDA of R17.4 billion, while working capital
increased due to finished stock increasing to 6.2 Mt (FY 2019: 4.5 Mt).

INTERIM CASH DIVIDEND DECLARED
Attributable and headline earnings per share were R26.21 and R26.19 (H1 2019: R31.39 and R31.51), respectively. In
line with Kumba's capital allocation framework and dividend policy, which targets a payout range of between 50% and 
75% of headline earnings, the Board has declared an interim cash dividend of R19.60 representing 75% of headline 
earnings.

OUTLOOK
Safety, health and wellbeing will continue to be our first priority. We are committed to improving on our four-year
fatality-free track record through various initiatives to continue embedding safety behaviour and culture. The Covid-19
response measures implemented are being integrated into the way we operate and do business, and we will continue to
support our communities, business partners, suppliers and customers as part of our commitment to improving lives and
livelihoods.

The extent of the impact of Covid-19 on Kumba's operational and financial performance, including our full-year 2020
guidance, will depend on many factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and related restrictions, 
all of which are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. The implications for our export markets are still unfolding.
Although we are encouraged by China's recovery and the reopening of the European economies, we remain alert to the 
possibility of further risks developing, including a second wave of infection.

The Company's full-year 2020 guidance was revised together with our Covid-19 business response update. To date,
operational performance has been in line with expectations and our guidance is as follows:
- Total sales of 38 Mt to 40 Mt
- Total production of 37 Mt to 39 Mt
  - Sishen: ~26 Mt
  - Kolomela: ~12 Mt
- Waste:
  - Sishen: 145 Mt to 160 Mt
  - Kolomela: 45 Mt to 55 Mt

Kumba's unit costs were reviewed to take into account the Covid-19 adjusted production volume guidance and cost
savings target. Sishen's unit costs are expected to increase to between R385/tonne and R395/tonne, while Kolomela's unit 
costs remain between R280/tonne and R290/tonne with cost pressures from mining inflation and managing the Covid-19 impact
expected to continue. 

Since implementing our savings programme in 2018, we have saved R2.6 billion, and have effectively achieved our 2022
savings target two years ahead of time. With this in mind, and knowing we need to step up our rate of saving if we are 
to offset mining inflation, we are aiming to deliver a further R400 million of savings in the second half of 2020,
bringing the total for 2020 to R1.1 billion.

Our longer-term cost-saving targets are under review. In light of the uncertain and fluid environment in which we are
currently operating, we are monitoring developments and considering the potential risks and opportunities under various
scenarios ranging from the environment deteriorating further to positioning for recovery should conditions improve. Once
we have more certainty, we will provide an update on our longer-term cost-saving targets. 

Our capital expenditure guidance of between R5.6 billion to R6.1 billion for 2020 includes the deferral of R1.0
billion of non-critical capital expenditure to 2021.

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded: ""Our competitive products, flexible value chain and geographically diverse customer
portfolio base ensure that we are in a position of strength. These unprecedented times further highlight the importance 
of maintaining our cost discipline, talented workforce and the ability to adapt quickly to a fast-evolving environment 
with care and respect for all of our stakeholders. We delivered a solid first half performance with R17.4 billion of 
EBITDA and R7.1 billion in attributable free cash flow. Our robust balance sheet and capital discipline provide us with 
the financial flexibility to allocate capital where it is needed most in our business during this time of uncertainty, while
delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.""

Kumba production and sales report, and trading statement, for the six months ended 30 June 2020

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “Kumba's first priority is the safety and health of our employees
and contractors. It is therefore with heartfelt gratitude that in May this year, we marked four years of fatality-free
operations, underlining our sustained commitment to improving safety across all our operations.

""We have been responding to the Covid-19 pandemic with the same focus and rigour. Our comprehensive ""WeCare""
lives and livelihoods response programme is aimed at safeguarding the physical and mental health, wellbeing and
safety of our people at work and at home, as well as that of our local communities. As part of this focus, Kumba has
implemented extensive measures to combat the spread of the virus in the workplace and in our host communities.
These measures include the implementation of extensive health screening measures, our own testing facilities,
securing isolation and quarantine facilities for employees and their families, and appointing additional medical support
staff in the Northern Cape region.

""Business continuity is our next priority to safeguard the livelihoods of all those who rely on our business across our
value chain. While our operational performance reflects the impact of the lockdown and subsequent re-opening with
a reduced proportion of our workforce, we successfully ramped up to close to full capacity in June 2020. Our focus is
on maintaining flexibility and performance along our value chain to protect run-rates and capture the benefits of
healthy demand for our quality products”.

Kumba’s operational performance for the period reflects lower workforce levels in Q2 2020 as guided by the South
African government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Having shut down operations in response to the lockdown,
Kumba re-opened its operations on 27 March 2020 following approval from the Department of Mineral Resources and
Energy to operate at c.50% of workforce levels. With opencast mines permitted to return in phases to 100% of
operations from 1 May 2020, Kumba commenced with the ramp-up to 100% in June 2020.

The safety and health of our employees and contractors has always been our first priority and in the current
environment this is even more critical as we work to safeguard both lives and livelihoods. Covid-19 measures include
screening, testing and quarantine procedures, as well as business contingency plans which have been implemented
across our value chain. These measures support efforts to manage infection rates and to date, operating activities
have not been impacted.

In line with these operating conditions and significantly reduced workforce levels, waste stripping for the period
declined by 17% to 68 Mt (1H 2019: 82.8 Mt) at Sishen and by 15% to 26 Mt (1H 2019: 30.9 Mt) at Kolomela.

Both production and sales are being closely managed in line with Transnet's logistical capacity, which increased to
c.80% in June 2020 after also re-opening at c.50% of workforce capacity. Kumba, along with industry peers, and
Transnet, are working together to ensure optimal use of the rail network and port. At the same time, initiatives are
underway to increase workforce levels, including the provision of training support.

Total production decreased by 11% to 17.9 Mt (1H 2019: 20.1 Mt), with the impact of the pandemic most evident in
Q2 2020 resulting in production falling by 20% to 8.5 Mt (Q2 2019: 10.5 Mt). Total sales decreased by 13% to 18.6
Mt (1H 2019: 21.4Mt) which includes a 76% drop in domestic off-take to 0.4 Mt (1H 2019: 1.5 Mt), while export sales
decreased by 8% to 18.3 Mt (H1 2019: 19.9 Mt), as an increase in severe coastal weather conditions during the period
hampered shipment rates.

Maintaining flexibility across the value chain, from mine to port, remains a key focus area for the Company. The
benefit of having flexibility was demonstrated by our ability to draw down 0.2 Mt of finished stock to 6.2 Mt during the
period (31 December 2019: 6.4 Mt; 30 June 2019: 4.5 Mt), with 2.4 Mt available for shipping at Saldanha Port.

Buoyant iron ore prices, translated into an average realised FOB export iron ore price of US$93/tonne (1H 2019:
US$108/tonne). Lump to fine ratio was 65:35 (1H 2019: 68:32) and product quality was adjusted during the period to
meet market demand resulting in an average Fe quality of 64.4% (H1 2019: 64.3% Fe).

Full year 2020 guidance
Kumba's full year 2020 guidance was revised on 23 April 2020 together with our Covid-19 business response update.
Our ramp up in run-rates are on track and revised guidance remain unchanged.

    •   Total sales of 38 - 40 Mt
    •   Total production of 37 - 39 Mt
            – Sishen: ~27 Mt
            – Kolomela: ~11 Mt
    •   Waste:
            – Sishen: 145 - 160 Mt
            – Kolomela: 45 - 55 Mt

Trading statement for the six months ended 30 June 2020

Kumba is finalising its interim financial results. In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, shareholders are advised that headline earnings for the period are likely to be between R8,137 million
and R8,557 million, a decrease of between 15% and 19% from the previous six months ended 30 June 2019
(""comparative period""). Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are likely to be between R25.37 and R26.68, a decrease
of between 15% and 19% from the comparative period. Reported headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative
period (released on SENS on 23 July 2019) were R10,095 million and R31.51.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to be between R8,146 million and R8,566 million, a decrease of between
15% and 19% from the comparative period. Basic earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be between R25.40 and
R 26.71, a decrease of between 15% and 19%. Reported basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were
R10,058 million and R31.39, respectively.

The decrease in earnings for the period is largely attributable to lower total sales volumes and lower average realised
FOB export prices, partially offset by the weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, relative to the comparative period.
Further information will be provided in the Company’s results for the period, which will be released on SENS on or
about 28 July 2020.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current beliefs and
expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are
estimates and the financial information on which the trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company's external auditors.

Production and sales volumes referred to for the period are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited
(“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as to the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present and future
business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause
Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market
prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities,
the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing
equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the
impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit,
the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of
competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health,
environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Kumba operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Kumba’s most recent Integrated Report.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future.
Important factors that could cause Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual
production during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral
resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities,
the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and
processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of
transport infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and
operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and
economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by
governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental
or other types of regulation in the countries where Kumba operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Kumba’s most recent Integrated Report.

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “The safety and health of our people and all those
who interact with our business are our first priority. We are fully committed to supporting our country’s
efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and have implemented appropriate measures. These include
scaling down our operations to ensure social distancing, issuing personal protective gear and providing
rigorous health screening and management, along with the implementation of our COVID-19 Community
Response Plans which includes continuous supply of essential services to our local communities.

Our 2020 production¹ and sales¹ guidance has been updated to 37-39Mt and 38-40Mt, respectively to
reflect the anticipated impact of the 35-day lockdown. As a measure of prudence in the face of broad-
based economic uncertainty across the world’s markets, we are targeting a cost saving² of R325 million
and deferral on non-critical capital expenditure of R1.0 billion to build upon our robust financial position.
These cash preservation measures add to our liquidity position which remains at levels similar to that at
the end of 2019.”

Overview:
-   Kumba has been fatality free since May 2016 and continues to improve its safety and health
    performance by ensuring that its leading indicators are within required parameters.
-   Total sales of 10.5Mt were 3% below Q1 2019, driven by a 51% lower domestic offtake.
-   Total production decreased by 1% to 9.4Mt compared to Q1 2019, due to lower output at
    Kolomela.
-   Total finished stock decreased to 5.5Mt from 6.4Mt at 31 December 2019.

to the winding down of Saldanha Steel by ArcelorMittal SA, while export sales increased by 1% to
10.2Mt. Relative to Q4 2019, export sales decreased by 3% due to lockdown related logistical
constraints at Saldanha Port.

During the period, Kumba’s mining operations were disrupted by unfavourable weather conditions
resulting in safety-related stoppages, planned maintenance on the key shovel fleet at Sishen and
reliability issues with the truck fleet at Kolomela. Waste stripping at Sishen reduced by 9% to 37.1Mt
(Q1 2019: 40.9Mt) and only increased by 2% to 13Mt (Q1 2019: 12.8Mt) at Kolomela.

From a plant perspective, approximately 7 days of production were lost due to the lockdown. Total
production decreased by 1% to 9.4Mt compared to Q1 2019, and by 20% relative to the high base in
Q4 2019.

With total sales ahead of total production, finished stock was drawn down resulting in total finished stock
levels reducing to 5.5Mt from 6.4Mt as at 31 December 2019.

Update on response to COVID-19

Operational update
On Friday, 27 March 2020, following the announcement of the initial 21-day nationwide lockdown,
Kumba announced that it had been granted approval by the Department of Mineral Resources and
Energy to continue production with a c50% level of workforce. The approval was premised on the
Company implementing appropriate safety and health measures in line with South African government
requirements, continuing with the provision of essential services to local communities and protecting the
integrity of assets. Kumba’s full year 2020 production³ guidance (provided in the Company’s 2019
annual results presentation on Tuesday, 18 February 2020) was also updated based on a 21-day
lockdown period.

On Thursday, 9 April 2020, the President of the Republic of South Africa announced the extension of the
21-day nationwide lockdown by a further 14 days until Thursday, 30 April 2020. Our operations are
continuing safely at the workforce levels approved by the Department of Minerals Resources and Energy
with the support of our key suppliers and service providers ensuring that we continue to supply to our
customers. Appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees are in place and
remain a priority. Kumba continues to provide a wide range of essential services in its host communities,
while also responding directly with additional support to help alleviate the health and economic effects
of COVID-19.

Supporting our employees, host communities and suppliers
In response to the call by our President to contribute to supporting the national fight against the spread
of COVID-19, the Kumba Board has resolved to donate the equivalent of a third of their personal
directors’ fees or salaries for the next quarter towards COVID-19 relief initiatives while the Executive
team has selected to contribute to the employee matching scheme supported by the Anglo American
Foundation.

We have implemented an extensive health awareness and support programme called “WeCare”,
specifically to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and full-time contractors as well as our
host communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this programme, we are helping colleagues
better understand how to protect themselves and others from the virus, monitoring their health to pick
up early symptoms, and to manage their health should they test positive for COVID-19. For example, all
operational colleagues are self-monitoring for any symptoms through temperature checks, prior to,
during and after their shift, that trigger medical assistance being reported.

Kumba has been providing food parcels, water, emergency services, support to health facilities and
social development programmes. In addition, we have collaborated with the Provincial Health
Department to increase access to healthcare services for our community members by enabling more
effective screening through scanners and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing machines which
can be used remotely to test and release results in 24 hours. We have established testing centres
through the Ulysses Gogi Modise Wellness (UGM) Clinic and Tsantsabane Hospital, as well as
quarantine and isolation centres within our host communities.

Kumba is supporting our suppliers through its supplier response plan which delivers a range of support
including reviewing payment terms, facilitating early settlement of invoices for small businesses as far
as possible and assisting in directing small business owners for help from Government and other NGO
assistance programs.

Proactive response programme
Kumba’s capital discipline and balance sheet strength ensures that the Company is resilient and
appropriately positioned to respond to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. As at 31 March 2020,
Kumba’s liquidity position, comprised of cash and undrawn committed facilities, remained similar to that
at 31 December 2019, reflecting the benefit from the weaker currency and a constructive iron ore market.

The situation is highly dynamic and there remains significant uncertainty about the national measures
required to control COVID-19 and the human and economic consequences of those actions. Kumba
has therefore planned a range of escalating measures to ensure that the business withstands additional
macro-economic volatility, while safeguarding long term stakeholder interests. Our first phase of
response targets an additional 2020 cost saving² of R325 million and deferral on non-critical capital
expenditure of R1.0 billion.

In our response programme, preserving business continuity and asset integrity remains a priority. Cost
saving measures currently being implemented include restrictions on all discretionary spending,
reductions in central overheads, demobilisation of non-critical contractors and deferral of certain
exploration and evaluation activities.

All capital deferrals have been carefully considered to ensure long-term asset value is protected. As a
result, the Sishen UHDMS and Kapstevel South feasibility studies remain on track for completion during
H2 2020.

2020 guidance update
Taking all the above into account, the impact of the known disruptions on the previously issued 2020
guidance is summarised as follows:

Footnotes
1. Operational guidance is based on the current 35-day lockdown with production expected to progressively increase through May and June.
2. Cost savings exclude R960 million that continues to be targeted for 2020 as part of our margin enhancement strategy as well as decreased variable costs
   in line with lower levels of operational activity.
3. The total production guidance was updated on 27 March 2020. Based on a 21-day lockdown and c.50% level of workforce, the impact on production was
   expected to be 2-3Mt resulting in the guidance being revised to 38.5-40.5Mt

Production and sales volumes referred to for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 are 100% of Sishen Iron
Ore Company Proprietary Limited (“SIOC”), and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the
non-controlling interests in SIOC.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements which are based on the Company’s current
beliefs and expectations about future events. The operational and financial forecasts provided in this
announcement are estimates and have not been reviewed and reported on by the Company’s external
auditors.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba’s present and
future business strategies and the environment in which Kumba will operate in the future. Important
factors that could cause Kumba’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from
those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any
period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and
development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global
pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing equipment,
the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the

Kumba updates response to South Africa’s COVID-19 measures

Kumba is providing an update on how it is responding operationally to the fast-evolving global impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic.

Kumba’s Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, said: “Kumba’s priorities are the safety, health and wellbeing of
our people and all those who interact with our business around the world. We also have a clear responsibility to
protect the integrity of our business and assets so that we are ready to restart and ramp up any affected operations
safely and as quickly as possible once permitted to do so. This approach will enable us to minimise any interruption
of supply to our customers and support what will be a vital economic recovery phase for South Africa.”

Kumba notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on Monday, 23 March 2020 in
relation to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, that took effect at midnight on Thursday, 26 March 2020 until Thursday,
16 April 2020, in order to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.

Kumba has consulted with the government authorities and industry bodies in South Africa to determine and agree
the appropriate measures to be taken across its operations and business activities. Such measures are to protect
people’s safety and health, the continuing provision of essential services to local communities, the security and
integrity of the assets, the supply of essential raw materials to customers, and the ability to return operations to
normal levels of activity as swiftly as possible once the lockdown restrictions are eased, in support of the country’s
broader economic interests.

In line with South African government requirements, Kumba has started to implement all appropriate measures
across its operations, with a focus on de-densification of the workforce and rigorous health screening and isolation
where needed. During the lockdown period, Kumba will continue with a c.50% level of workforce and the rail and
port logistics infrastructure to support the export of iron ore is expected to continue to service the operations.
Kumba will also continue to provide a number of essential services, including security; mine maintenance; tailings
facility safety management; water treatment; community water supply; accommodation provision; health, safety
and emergency response; and critical head office services.

Themba Mkhwanazi added: “Our operations play a vital role in many of our host communities, including in terms
of jobs and the provision of a number of essential community services, including access to water, health care and
emergency medical services. We are wholly committed to supporting the country’s effort to combat COVID-19,
including continuity of such services, and will continue to work with government and across the industry to provide
all possible support.”

Guidance update:
Shareholders are advised that scaling down operations will impact the company’s 2020 production guidance of
between 41.5Mt and 42.5Mt, as announced in the 2019 Annual Results presentation on Tuesday, 18 February
2020. Based on the 21-day lockdown period and allowing for a safe ramp-up of operations thereafter, we expect
a 2020 production volume impact of between 2 and 3Mt (based on the c.50% reduction in the workforce).

Kumba will provide additional guidance in its scheduled 1Q 2020 Production and Sales Report on Thursday, 23
April 2020.

EXTRACTS FROM THE PROVISIONAL AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 
AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION

HIGHLIGHTS
- Fatality free since May 2016
- Attributable free cash flow of R17.1 billion
- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 83%
- EBITDA margin improved from 45% to 52%
- Operating efficiency up from 65% of benchmark to 68%
- Final cash dividend of R15.99 per share 

OVERVIEW 
Themba Mkhwanazi, Chief Executive of Kumba, said, ""Kumba's strategy has helped deliver exceptional earnings growth, as
we continue to increase the resilience of the business. Against challenging operational conditions, we marked another
year of strong financial performance with EBITDA up by 62% to R33.4 billion. Our financial performance reflects the
benefits of higher iron ore prices, improved efficiencies and further cost savings ahead of our target, which have 
cushioned the impact of the operational challenges experienced during the period. These results were also achieved 
through a relentless focus on safety as we maintained our fatality free track record since May 2016. Our commitment 
to responsible production, aimed at unlocking value from our world-class assets, has in turn allowed us to help build 
thriving communities and improve people's lives.

Kumba's EBITDA margin increased to 52% and cash flow from operations is up by 79% to R34.7 billion. Kumba's strong
performance and robust balance sheet, resulted in the Board declaring a final cash dividend of R15.99 per share. 
Combined with the interim dividend of R30.79 per share, this represents a total payout ratio of 92% of headline 
earnings per share for 2019, in excess of our 50% to 75% dividend payout policy. In total we have created value of  
R19.8 billion for shareholders and our empowerment partners this year.

Since embarking on our margin enhancement strategy, Kumba's return on capital employed has improved from 49% in 2018
to 83% in 2019, reflecting favourable markets and the continued success of our value over volume strategy. We are 
focused on optimising the value of our assets, generating strong cash flows and further improving returns. Kumba has
transformed into a more capital efficient and resilient business, providing greater stability for our employees, 
contractors and the communities around us, as well as delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.""

FINAL CASH DIVIDEND
Our capital allocation framework seeks to ensure that the business generates sufficient cash flow after sustaining
capital before prioritising shareholder returns. This is done while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to protect 
the business from market volatility as well as ensuring that appropriate levels of capital are allocated to life 
extension projects. The Board has declared a final cash dividend of R15.99 per share, and combined with the interim 
dividend of R30.79 per share, this amounts to a total dividend of R46.78 per share (2018: R30.24) for the year. This 
equates to a 92% payout ratio of headline earnings for 2019.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Total tonnes mined increased 2% to 297.9 Mt (2018: 292.5 Mt) with mining activity improving in the second half of the
year following challenges with primary equipment reliability in the first six months of the year. This, combined with
plant maintenance, impacted production volumes which decreased by 2% to 42.4 Mt (2018: 43.1 Mt). The average
lump to fine ratio was broadly maintained at 67:33 (2018: 68:32) and the average quality at 64.2% Fe (2018: 64.5% Fe).

At a mine level, Sishen's production was similar to 2018 at 29.2 Mt with waste stripping down 0.5% to 181.1 Mt (2018:
182 Mt). At Kolomela, production decreased by 5% to 13.2 Mt (2018: 13.9 Mt) owing to the maintenance of the DMS plant
and waste stripping was increased to 63.2 Mt (2018: 56.0 Mt).

Total sales volumes decreased to 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt), driven by lower domestic sales of 2.2 Mt (2018: 3.3 Mt),
while export sales were maintained at 40.0 Mt. Due to lower domestic sales and refurbishment of the ship loader at 
Saldanha Port, finished stock increased to 6.4 Mt (2018: 5.3 Mt). 

REVENUE AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (EBITDA)
Total revenue increased by 41% to R64.3 billion compared to R45.7 billion for 2018, mainly as a result of stronger
prices, higher market premiums and currency gains, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the lower
domestic offtake. Kumba's average realised iron ore export price increased by 35% to US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne), 
while the average Rand/US$ exchange rate weakened by 9% to R14.45/US$1 (2018: R13.24/US$1). Sales volumes reduced by 
2% to 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt). Shipping revenue increased by R938 million benefiting from a weaker currency and 
higher volumes.

EBITDA of R33.4 billion reflected an increase of 62% compared to R20.6 billion in 2018. Growth was driven by a 
35% strengthening of the average realised FOB prices of US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne) and currency gains of 9% from 
a weaker Rand/US$ exchange rate. Cost savings of R920 million and market premia of R646 million went a long way towards
mitigating higher mining and logistics costs, as well as the 2% decline in sales volumes.

Kumba's EBITDA margin increased to 52% (2018: 45%). Kumba delivered strong financial results with net profit up 69% to 
R21.3 billion (2018: R12.6 billion) and headline earnings increasing by 69% to R16.3 billion (2018: R9.7 billion). 
Attributable and headline earnings per share for the year were R50.72 and R50.88 (2018: R30.08 and R30.28), respectively.

CASH FLOW
Kumba ended the year with a net cash position of R12.3 billion (2018: R11.7 billion) net of lease liabilities. Cash flow 
generated from operations increased by 84% to R34.7 billion (2018: R18.9 billion) due to higher EBITDA and lower working 
capital requirements.

OUTLOOK FOR 2020
Kumba's production guidance for 2020 is 41.5 Mt to 42.5 Mt, with Sishen producing ~29 Mt of product and mining 
170 Mt to 180 Mt of waste at a stripping ratio of 4.4, with the average LoM stripping ratio remaining at ~3.4. 
Kolomela's production guidance is ~13 Mt and waste stripping at 55 Mt to 60 Mt with the stripping ratio expected 
to average 4 in 2020 and the LoM average stripping ratio of 3.8.

Total sales guidance is between 42 Mt and 43 Mt, including 1 Mt of domestic sales. 

Unit costs for Sishen and Kolomela are projected to be between R355/tonne to R370/tonne and R280/tonne to 
R290/tonne, respectively. 

Capital expenditure, including deferred stripping costs, is expected to be in the range of R6.6 billion to 
R7.1 billion. 

Themba Mkhwanazi concluded: ""With supportive demand fundamentals for our high quality products, we are focused on
delivering our safe production targets to continue capitalising on this opportunity. We are focused on improving operational
equipment reliability and productivity, building on the strong financial performance in 2019. Underpinned by our strong
balance sheet and capital discipline, we have a solid foundation for achieving our 2020 targets.""

Production and sales report for the fourth quarter and year ended 31 December 2019
Kumba CEO, Themba Mkhwanazi, said ""Kumba delivered a solid operational performance with total production of
42.4Mt and total sales of 42.2 Mt. This in line with the full-year guidance of 42-43Mt and 41.5-42.5Mt, respectively.""
Production and sales volumes referred to are 100% of Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited (""SIOC""),
and attributable to shareholders of Kumba as well as the non-controlling interests in SIOC.

Overview:
- Strong safety and sustainability focus, marking over three and a half years of fatality-free operations.
- Total sales for 2019 of 42.2Mt (2019 guidance: 41.5-42.5Mt) were 2% below 2018 as a result of lower off-take
  from ArcelorMittal SA due to a decision to wind down operations at its Saldanha Steel plant. Export sales for
  the year were flat at 40Mt, with an 8% quarter-on-quarter increase in Q4 2019 offsetting lower domestic sales.
- Total production of 42.4Mt for the year (2019 guidance: 42-43 Mt) decreased by 2%, primarily due to the
  temporary closure of Kolomela's dense media separation (DMS) plant for an infrastructure upgrade. For Q4
  2019, production increased by 12% to 11.8Mt, driven by improved performance at Sishen and the restarting
  of the Kolomela DMS plant as scheduled.
- Total finished stock of 6.4Mt with 2.2Mt at Saldanha Port, ensures that Kumba is well positioned for Q1
  2020.

Total sales of 42.2 Mt (2018: 43.3 Mt) decreased by 2%, driven by a 34% decline in domestic sales to 2.2Mt (2018:
3.3Mt) due to lower off-take by ArcelorMittal SA. Export sales volumes for 2019 were similar to 2018 at 40.0Mt.
Although rail performance improved significantly, shipments were hampered by single loading due to the
scheduled refurbishment of the second ship loader by Transnet. However, relative to Q3 2019, export sales
increased by 8.0% to 10.5Mt (Q3 2019: 9.7Mt), partially offsetting lower domestic sales. Compared to Q4 2018,
export sales decreased by 2% (Q4 2018: 10.7 Mt).
Total finished stock increased to 6.4Mt (Q4 2018: 5.3 Mt) as a result of lower domestic sales and the scheduled
port refurbishment. With 2.2Mt of stock at Saldanha Port, Kumba is well positioned for the first quarter of 2020.

Total production of 42.4Mt (2018: 43Mt) for the year reduced by 2% due to the temporary closure of Kolomela's
(DMS) plant for infrastructure upgrade from the first quarter of the year. Good progress was made in Q4 2019 with
production increasing by 12% to 11.8Mt compared to 10.5Mt in Q3 2019, and by 16% relative to 10.2Mt in Q4
2018. This reflects continued improvements in operational performance at Sishen following unscheduled
maintenance on the DMS plant in Q3 2019, as well as the ramp-up in production at Kolomela with the re-opening
of the DMS plant in Q4 2019 as scheduled.

Kumba's continuous drive towards new levels of P101 benchmark operational efficiency resulted in Sishen's waste
stripping increasing by 11% to 45.3Mt for the quarter (Q4 2018: 50.7Mt), with Kolomela's waste stripping remaining
relatively flat at 14Mt.

Kumba realised an average FOB iron ore export price of US$97/tonne (2018: US$72/tonne) for the year, on the
back of an average lump ratio of 67% and the average Fe quality of 64.2% Fe.

Trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2019
Kumba is currently finalising its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period""), which will
be released on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 18 February 2020.

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, shareholders are advised that
headline earnings for the period are likely to be between R15,680 million and R16,826 million. Headline earnings
per share (HEPS) are likely to be between R48.93 and R52.47, an increase of between 62% and 73% from the
previous year ended 31 December 2018 (""comparative period""). Reported headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period (released on SENS on 19 February 2019) were R9,677 million and R30.28, respectively.

Basic earnings for the period are expected to be between R15,636 million and R16,776 million. Basic earnings
per share (EPS) are expected to be between R48.79 and R52.34, an increase of between 62% and 74%. Reported
basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R9,615 million and R30.08 respectively.

The increase in earnings for the period is largely attributable to the higher average realised FOB export ore price
and a weaker Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, relative to the comparative period. Further information will be
provided in the company's results for the period to be released on SENS on 18 February 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company's external auditors.
