COVID-19 UPDATE: OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO 85% IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK


Stakeholders are referred to the Group’s Business Update published on 19 November and are advised that,
following recent decisions of the Polish and Bulgarian Governments, tenants occupying approximately 85%
of the Group’s GLA are expected to be operational as of 28 November. A summary of the changes to trading
restrictions is set out below:

- In Poland, the restrictions imposed on non-essential stores’ trading will be lifted from 28 November,
  increasing the Group’s operational GLA by approximately 15%. Cinemas and restaurants will remain closed,
  with restaurants being allowed to operate for take away and deliveries. The remaining restrictions affect 1%
  of the Group’s GLA.

- In Bulgaria, the Government announced new trading restrictions effective from 28 November until
  21 December. These restrictions are similar to those imposed in the spring and provide for the closure of non-
  essential stores, except for food stores, pharmacies, pet shops, banks, insurance offices and payment services
  providers. Restaurants are planned to operate only for take away orders and deliveries. These restrictions are
  estimated to affect 5% of the Group’s GLA.

The Czech Republic Government extended the state of emergency up to 12 December, when the situation
will be reassessed. Current trading restrictions affect approximately 2% of the Group’s total GLA.

The temporary restrictions in the other countries where the Group operates, as announced in the recent
Business Update, continue. Most CEE governments are balancing attempts to mitigate the growing pressure
on medical services against those limiting the negative economic impact of the restrictions. Depending on
infection rates, existing restrictions can be lifted, or new ones introduced on short notice. Additional fiscal
support measures are expected to offset the effects of existing and possible new restrictions.

BUSINESS UPDATE

“After the reopening of all stores in May and June, we have seen a steady pick-up in retail activity across the entire portfolio until 30
September. Footfall in the third quarter of 2020 was 77% and tenant sales 89% of prior year levels. Negotiations with tenants
following lockdown are progressing very well and are currently 84% complete. Partially as a result of this progress, the collection rate
reached 97% for the first six months of 2020 and 90% for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020. NEPI Rockcastle’s
balance sheet strengthened after the disposal of the Romanian office portfolio in August (at the terms negotiated in 2019) and the
green bond issue in July. Consequently, the loan-to-value ratio decreased to 31.8% at 30 September and liquidity reached €1.2 billion
(including undrawn committed credit facilities), further outlining our commitment to maintaining a prudent financial policy. Since the
beginning of October, COVID-19 cases have once again increased throughout Central and Eastern Europe, raising new short-term
challenges. However, the Group’s underlying strength and the high potential of the economies where it operates will enable NEPI
Rockcastle to return to sustainable growth in the medium and long term.”
Alex Morar, CEO


BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

    •    On 30 September, 100% of the total gross lettable area (‘GLA’) was operational, as the remaining trading bans for Romanian
         indoor food service and cinemas in Romania, Croatia and Serbia were lifted in the first half of September. Since then, new
         measures have been adopted by governments in certain Central and Eastern Europe (‘CEE’) countries to contain the virus,
         causing the temporary limitation of some tenants’ operations. The restrictions affected approximately 7% of total GLA on 31
         October and 25% at 18 November.
    •    Footfall during the third quarter of 2020 (‘Q3 2020’) was 77% of the prior year level, and decreased to 72% in October, as ne w
         restrictions were introduced.
    •    Tenant sales during Q3 2020 were 89% of the third quarter of 2019 (‘Q3 2019’) value (like-for-like (‘LfL’) property,
         excluding entertainment, food service and hypermarkets), showing a strong recovery after the re-opening of non-essential
         stores.
    •    By the end of October, agreements were reached with tenants representing 94% of Gross Rental Income regarding deferral of
         payments and rent concessions, of which 84% were signed. The significant progress made is a considerable achievement and a
         credit to the great work of the Group’s asset management team.
    •    Collection rate was 97% of reported revenues (adjusted for concessions granted) for the first half of 2020 (‘H1 2020’) and 90%
         for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 (‘9M 2020’).
    •    Government imposed reliefs and negotiated concessions granted to tenants, referring to contractual receivables up to 30
         September 2020, were recognised in the Income Statement of the period, either as a reduction of rental income or as an expense
         with partial forgiveness of receivables. This had a significant impact on the 9M 2020 results with Net Operating Income (‘NOI’)
         amounting to €252 million, 16% lower than in the nine-month period ended 30 September 2019 (‘9M 2019’), reflecting the
         current economic climate in the financial results for the period (see ‘Accounting of COVID-19’s Impact on 9M 2020 Results’
         below).
    •    The net amount of expected credit losses for 9M 2020 was €1.8 million (compared to €0.4 million for 9M 2019), as a direct
         result of the economic impact of lockdowns. There were no significant insolvencies in the period.
    •    European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) occupancy rate as of 30 September 2020 was 95.7%, compared to
         approximately 95.8% as at 30 June 2020.
    •    Liquidity as at 30 September was very strong, amounting to €1.2 billion, of which €575 million in available committed credit
         facilities.
    •    The loan-to-value ratio (‘LTV’) was 31.8% as at 30 September, significantly below the 35% strategic target. During Q3 2020,
         the Group further increased the headroom under debt covenants, which was already substantial.
    •    The launch of the Green Finance Framework and successful issuance of €500 million unsecured green bonds in July 2020
         extended the average debt maturity from 3.6 years as at 30 June to 4.4 years as at 30 September.
    •    Active liability management during the second half of 2019 (‘H2 2019’) and 9M 2020 decreased weighted average cost of debt
         to 2.2% (from 2.4% in H2 2019).
    •    Investment grade credit ratings reaffirmed at BBB by Fitch Ratings (stable outlook) and S&P Global Ratings (negative outlook).
    •    EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share was €6.42 at 30 September, 3.5% lower compared to €6.65 at 30 June, mostly due to
         the recent capitalisation issue.
    •    The disposal of the Romanian office portfolio, announced on 7 August, was successfully completed on 27 August. The
         transaction terms were materially the same as initially agreed in 2019. The transaction was fully settled for net cash proceeds
         of €294.8 million and generated a net gain on disposal of €1.8 million.
    •    The property portfolio’s value is substantially unchanged, at €5.9 billion. No property valuations were undertaken in Q3 2020, in
         accordance with the Group’s policy to perform independent revaluations at half-year and year-end reporting dates.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Status of trading restrictions and government measures

By the end of September 2020, lockdown restrictions had been lifted across the portfolio and all GLA was operational. Since then, the
increase in COVID-19 cases led some governments to announce new restrictions to limit the spread of infections. The most significant
are the temporary closing of non-essential shops in Poland and Czech Republic. A summary of current relevant government measures
in each country is detailed below.

Romania (90% GLA currently operational) – All GLA was operational at 30 September. The subsequent rise in COVID-19 cases
led to the introduction of new local level restrictions commencing on 10 October, based on the infection rate over the previous 14 days
(expressed as number of new cases per 1,000 people). In cities and regions where the infection rate is 1.5-3, indoor food courts and
restaurants can operate at reduced capacity. If it is above 3, cinemas, food courts and restaurants are temporarily closed (outdoor
terraces may remain open, while takeaways and delivery services can continue). Currently the restrictions apply to several cities,
including Bucharest, and affect 4% of the Group’s total GLA.

Poland (31% GLA currently operational) – While on 30 September all GLA was operational, the government subsequently
announced the closure of cinemas and non-essential stores in shopping centres between 7-29 November. Groceries, DIY stores,
pharmacies, services, pet shops and bookstores are exempt. Restaurants and food courts can operate takeaway and delivery services.
These restrictions affect approximately 16% of the Group’s total GLA. Authorities are currently discussing a set of measures to
support the affected businesses.

Slovakia (94% GLA currently operational) – From 15 October, indoor restaurants can only operate takeaway and delivery services
and entertainment tenants are (except for cinemas and fitness centres for which restrictions have been partially lifted on 16 November
and are now allowed to operate at reduced capacity). These measures affect approximately 1% of the Group’s total GLA.

Hungary (83% GLA currently operational) – Starting 11 November, there are new restrictions limiting the activities of indoor
restaurants and entertainment facilities (leisure, fitness, swimming pools, cinemas). In addition, all stores allowed to trade must close
at 7pm. The measures affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

Bulgaria (100% GLA currently operational) – There are currently no trading restrictions and all GLA has been operational since 18
May.

Croatia and Serbia (100% GLA currently operational) – At the start of September cinemas reopened, bringing operational GLA to
100%. Partial restrictions and social distancing measures are in place, such as reduced capacity and working hours for cinemas and
restaurants.

Czech Republic (35% GLA currently operational) – The Government ordered cinemas and non-essential shops, excluding
groceries, pharmacies, pet shops, opticians, tobacconists, pick-up points, IT services, florists and car washes, to close from 22 October
until 20 November. Restaurants can offer takeaway and delivery services if accessible from the street. From 28 October all stores,
except pharmacies, must close at 8pm and on Sundays. The Government is supporting affected retailers by providing a 50% subsidy
for rent for up to three months, with no assistance required from landlords. These measures affect approximately 2% of the Group’s
total GLA.

Lithuania (79% GLA currently operational) – From 7 to 29 November, cinemas and entertainment facilities are closed and indoor
restaurants can only provide takeaway and delivery services. These measures affect approximately 1% of the Group’s total GLA.

Besides measures directly affecting retail, governments also introduced more general restrictions, including mandatory masks in
crowded outdoor spaces in most countries, limitations on social gatherings, schools educating pupils entirely or partially online and
cancellation of public events. Depending on infection rates, existing restrictions can be lifted (most are in place for a period of 2-4
weeks and are subject to reassessment) or new ones introduced on short notice. Currently, most CEE governments are balancing
attempts to mitigate the growing pressure on medical services against those limiting the negative economic impact of the restrictions.
Additional fiscal support measures are expected to offset the effects of existing and possible new restrictions.

Tenant support

Constructive tenant negotiations continue, and by 31 October agreements in relation to aid regarding the impact of the spring
lockdown were reached for 94% of Gross Rental Income, out of which 84% were already signed. The total value of COVID-19 related
rent reliefs and discounts granted up to 30 September amounts to €55.6 million, of which €54.2 million was recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income in 9M 2020, and the rest was subject to straight-lining. A significant amount of this is due to
Polish regulations imposing a rent-free period for tenants, including service charges and marketing costs, during the 14 March – 4
May lockdown. Rent concessions were lower in countries where governments partially subsidised rents subject to agreements between
landlords and tenants (Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia).

In exchange for rent deferrals and concessions, the Company obtained valuable amendments to lease terms, such as:

    •    extended lease duration;
    •    higher sales-based rents with more frequent reconciliation;
    •    concession reversal if turnovers or occupancy cost ratios are better than specified thresholds;
    •    cancellation of some tenant unilateral extension options;
    •    improved occupancy cost clauses, and/or
    •    higher base rent over the lease term via the introduction, or increase, of step rents.

The Group continuously assesses the evolution of COVID-19 related restrictions and their impact on tenants’ operations, and aims to
maintain an ongoing dialogue with its partners.

Trading update

After the reopening of most non-essential stores in May and June, performance improved steadily throughout Q3 2020, with every
month showing higher sales than the previous. Overall sales in Q3 2020 were 11% lower than in Q3 2019 (on a LfL basis, excluding
entertainment, hospitality and hypermarkets). Footfall was 23% lower in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019. In October, when COVID-19
cases increased, footfall was 28% lower than prior year levels (October’s sales figures are not yet available).

The recovery is stronger in secondary cities and smaller shopping centres, while central assets in large cities, which are more reliant
on office workers, improved at a slower pace. The best tenant sales (LfL) were in Czech Republic (-1.2% compared to Q3 2019),
Serbia (-1.7% compared to Q3 2019), Poland (-2.7% compared to Q3 2019) and Slovakia (-3.0% compared to Q3 2019). Hungary (-
19.8% compared to Q3 2019), Romania (-16.8% compared to Q3 2019), Bulgaria (-10.5% compared to Q3 2019) and Lithuania (-
9.9% compared to Q3 2019) performed worst, due to their high exposure to inner city assets in large and capital cities. The best
performing product categories were sporting goods (-0.7% compared to Q3 2019), electronics (-2.3% compared to Q3 2019) and
furniture & DIY (-3.8% compared to Q3 2019), while the worst performing were kiosks (-22.6% compared to Q3 2019) and services
(-21.6% compared to Q3 2019). This reflects how consumer preferences have changed during this period, with new work/life routines
favouring sports and electronics products over services and entertainment offerings. Another feature is the sizeable increase in the
average basket per shopper (e.g. by 7.7% in September 2020 compared to the same month in 2019), which explains why sales
recovered faster than footfall.

During Q3 2020, the Group focused its communication and marketing strategy on the promotion of safety measures, such as collecting
personal data for tracing suspected cases and ensuring social distancing, and on targeted sales campaigns and events (media
partnership with TV shows, sustainability initiatives, drive-in cinemas, exhibitions and workshops, etc). The events were mainly held
outside, on terraces or parking areas, in full compliance with local restrictions.

Leasing activity

In Q3 2020 the Group signed 46 new leases and renewed 72 lease agreements (excluding lease term extensions related to tenant
support agreements), confirming the continuing appeal of NEPI Rockcastle’s properties. New leases and renewals are virtually
identical to those used pre-pandemic. Commercial terms typically include base rent, fully recoverable service charges, marketing fees
and additional turnover rent. Lease terms are a minimum of five years, with no break options or additional incentives, base rent and
marketing fees are indexed annually against consumer price indices and leases are denominated in Euro.

The Group continued to attract new retailers, improving tenant mix and quality. The highlights during Q3 2020 are detailed below.

    •   Promenada Mall, Bucharest, Romania: Burger King opened concurrently with mall’s food court reopening (1 September),
        further to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.
    •   Braila Mall, Braila, Romania: Decathlon opened in September, and toy retailer Smyk opened the city’s first branch.
    •   Mega Mall, Bucharest, Romania: there were ten openings in Q3 2020, Benvenuti (reopening), Dristor Kebap, Gatta
        (reopening), Kiehl’s, Louis Juna, Nike (refurbishment to the latest brand concept, first in the city), Orange (relocation and
        store enlargement), Profihairshop, Tavex and Vans.
    •   Vulcan Value Centre, Bucharest, Romania: KFC opened its first unit in Romania with outdoor digital menus (in addition to the
        indoor ones) and kiosks-type devices, to simplify ordering process.
    •   Shopping City Ramnicu Valcea, Ramnicu Valcea, Romania: three new stores opened in Q3 2020, Bella Italia, GRID and
        Sizeer.
    •   Shopping City Deva, Deva, Romania: the Polish athletic wear retailer Sizeer opened a new store during September.
    •   Bonarka City Center, Krakow, Poland: new openings include Awiteks, Deli Pizza and Soho.
    •   Galeria Warminska, Olsztyn, Poland: CoffeTeria opened and Guess launched a regional flagship store.
    •   Aupark Kosice Mall, Kosice, Slovakia: new lease agreements signed with Coccinelle, Grand Optical and Tosca Blu.
    •   Aupark Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia: the region’s first Samsung lease was signed with Samsung Gallery and Dr. Max opened.
    •   Forum Usti nad Labem, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic: new lease agreements signed with Running Sushi and
        Sportisimo.
    •   Serdika Center, Sofia, Bulgaria: new openings include Nespresso and eMag’s first showroom in Sofia.
    •   Arena Mall, Budapest, Hungary: Gloria Jeans Coffee opened.
    •   Mammut Shopping Centre, Budapest, Hungary: new stores include eMag, Nespresso and Tamaris.
    •   Ozas Shopping and Entertainment Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania: following the successful opening of Adventica, the
        country’s largest family entertainment park, six new lease agreements were signed, including City Jeans, Fielmann, Loois and
        Silver Fox.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants and staff is the Group’s main priority, which is why 32 NEPI Rockcastle
properties have been audited and certified ‘COVID-19 Compliant’ by the SAFE Asset Group, a global certification and advisory
company working in risk and security management. This international certification confirms that certified malls offer a secure
shopping experience during the pandemic.

All centres implement and maintain all recommended safety measures, such as: temperature and mask checks at all entrances; flow
control limiting customer numbers; social distancing; provision of sanitizers; Nano Septic self-cleaning surfaces for all frequently
touched areas; daily disinfection of critical areas, and increased heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) maintenance and
ventilation, including higher percentages of fresh air intake. Furthermore, all tenants and suppliers must adhere to strict employee
protocols.

DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

NEPI Rockcastle reduced development pipeline expenditure in order to preserve liquidity and optimise capital allocation; non-committed
capital expenditure (‘CapEx’) has been deferred, unless it would affect a project’s value.

Key committed projects, such as the extension and refurbishment of Focus Mall Zielona Gora (Zielona Gora, Poland) and Bonarka City
Center (Krakow, Poland), are progressing as per schedule. Permitting and value-enhancing investments continued in strategic projects,
such as the Promenada Mall (Bucharest, Romania) extension and the Promenada Craiova (Craiova, Romania) development. A flexible
approach to contracting enables the Group to suspend and resume developments with relative ease.

During the 9M 2020, NEPI Rockcastle spent €116 million on developments and capital expenditures. The Group continues to invest in
developments that contribute to growth and improve long-term portfolio value and income generation. Estimated capital expenditures
on developments and operating assets, to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2020 amounts to €40 million.

ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO DISPOSAL

As previously announced, NEPI Rockcastle concluded an agreement with AFI Europe on 6 August 2020 to dispose of 100% of shares
in subsidiaries holding the Romanian office portfolio, with a total GLA of 117,500m2, for a transaction value of €307 million
(equivalent to a blended yield of approximately 8%), which generated a net gain on disposal of €1.8 million. Closing took place on 27
August 2020. The net cash consideration was €294.8 million and was fully settled. No material changes were made or discounts
granted to the original terms agreed in 2019. Apart from market standard representations and warranties, the Group has no outstanding
commitments in relation to the disposed assets.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Changes to the Board of Directors

As announced on 29 September, the Board approved the appointment of Mr. Andreas Klingen, an existing Independent Non-
Executive Director, to act as member of the Nomination Committee and Lead Independent Director, effective as of 28 September.

EPRA BPR Gold Award

NEPI Rockcastle has received the EPRA Gold Award for compliance with its Best Practices Recommendations (‘BPR’) for financial
reporting, confirming the Group’s commitment to excellence in financial reporting. EPRA is the leading real estate industry
organisation in Europe. The Group joined EPRA in 2018, and won the Silver Award for BPR in 2019, as a recognition of its
commitment to transparency in reporting and compliance with industry best practices. In 2020, the Group has further improved its
financial reporting and BPR compliance, achievements which were recognised by EPRA through the Gold Award, the highest
standard for transparency of financial performance measures.

ACCOUNTING OF COVID-19’S IMPACT ON 9M 2020 RESULTS

Rent discounts

During 9M 2020, NEPI Rockcastle recognised rent concessions worth €54.2 million in its Statement of Comprehensive Income (detailed
below), resulting in €252 million NOI for the period.

Rent reliefs (reduction of rental income)
The Polish Government imposed a legally enforced rent-free period for tenants, including service charges and marketing costs, during
the State of Emergency from mid-March to early May. This relief has been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a
reduction of Gross Rental Income (€8.6 million) and Service Charge Income (€2.4 million), and as a decrease of Trade and Other
Receivables, in the Statement of Financial Position.

In some instances, the Group has agreed to variable discounts contingent upon tenant sales dropping below a certain threshold. In 9M
2020 these discounts amounted to a total of €0.5 million, recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a reduction of
Gross Rental Income (negative variable rent).

Partial forgiveness of receivables

In order to maintain a long-term functioning retail environment, and based on tenant negotiations, partial forgiveness of contractual
receivables for lockdown, and/or immediately after lockdown, was granted. Discussions with retailers regarding COVID-19 support
continued in all countries throughout Q3 2020, and by 30 September lease modifications (see definition below) were signed by tenants
representing 57% of Gross Rental Income.

For the period up to the signing of lease modifications, the forgiven receivables have not been recognised as lease incentives in the
financial statements, and therefore their financial impact was not straight-lined over the new lease term. As such, tenant concessions
granted before the signing of lease modifications corresponding to 9M 2020, amounting to €42.1 million, were fully accounted for in
the Statement of Comprehensive Income as “Partial Forgiveness of Receivables (COVID-19 Forgiveness)”, and “Trade and Other
Receivables” in the Statement of Financial Position, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 9
“Financial Instruments” (in relation to impairment of receivables). The accounting treatment is also in accordance with IFRS 16,
which allows rental income to be recognised even if recoverability is uncertain and requires rental modifications to be accounted for
only from the effective date of the modification. This approach emphasizes the Company’s commitment to fair and transparent
reporting of the impact of the pandemic and related lockdowns on financial results.

Contractually agreed and signed modifications subject to straight-lining from the effective date of the modification

Contractually agreed and signed concessions granted to, and obtained from, tenants are treated according to IFRS 16 “Leases”.

IFRS 16 defines ‘lease modification’ as a change in scope, or consideration, of the lease, not part of the original terms and conditions,
such as rent discounts, lease extensions, increase in overage/turnover rents, introduction of break options, etc. It also requires that
lease modifications are recognised prospectively over the new lease term and accounted for by the lessor from the date the
modification is contractually agreed and signed by both parties.

Agreed lease modifications are recognised as lease incentives from the date the modification was signed. Such modifications are straight-
lined over the new lease term and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a reduction of Gross Rental Income. In 9M
2020, the reduction recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income was €0.6 million. The impact of rent concessions agreed as of
30 September 2020 on future reporting periods is €1.4 million.

Trade receivables

The collection rate for H1 2020, adjusted for concessions granted, was 97%, based on rental for the six months ended 30 June 2020,
and 90% for 9M 2020 (this increased to 93% by 31 October). On 30 September 2020, uncollected receivables amounted to €76.4
million (including VAT), of which €46.2 million were overdue; these receivables related to 9M 2020 decreased to €58.1 million by 31
October, of which €26.5 million overdue. This balance is adjusted for rent relief and concessions, either legally enforced or negotiated.
The Company expects to collect the full outstanding balance when tenant negotiations are finalised, in line with the pattern already
experienced in respect of completed negotiations, which prompted a significant improvement in collections.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

The Group had a very strong liquidity profile on 30 September, with €594 million in cash and €575 million in undrawn committed
credit facilities.

NEPI Rockcastle’s gearing ratio* (interest bearing debt less cash, divided by investment property plus listed securities) was 31.8%,
significantly below the 35% target.

*The reported gearing ratio (LTV) excludes the €31.9 million right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities as at 30 September 2020

As of 30 September 2020, ratios for unsecured loans and bonds showed ample headroom compared to covenants:

     •     Solvency Ratio: 40% actual vs covenant threshold of maximum 60%;
     •     Consolidated Coverage Ratio: 5.5 actual vs covenant threshold of minimum 2;
     •     Unencumbered consolidated total assets/unsecured consolidated total debt: 264% actual vs covenant threshold of minimum
           150%.

Liability management and bond issue

In July, after meetings with European fixed-income investors, NEPI Rockcastle issued a €500 million inaugural unsecured green bond
with a seven-year maturity, carrying a 3.375% fixed coupon and an issue price of 98.172%. The green bond issue improved the
Group’s liquidity and increased the weighted average debt maturity from 3.6 years as of 30 June to 4.4 years as of 30 September.

Cost of debt

The average interest rate, including hedging, was 2.2% for 9M 2020. This is lower than it was during the same period last year, which
is mainly due to liability management initiatives implemented by the Company in H2 2019 and 9M 2020. All exposure to variable
interest rates is covered by hedges.

The Company continually evaluates its financing options, while keeping in mind the strategic objective to broaden its shareholder base
and maintain an optimal capital structure. Depending on market conditions, the Group may initiate a repurchase of issued bonds or
shares during the following reporting periods.

Credit rating

In April 2020, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (‘S&P’) reaffirmed the Group’s rating at BBB and revised the outlook from stable
to negative, reflecting the agency’s views on potential risks associated with the wider retail real estate sector due to COVID-19 related
disruptions. In September 2020, S&P maintained their rating action from April 2020.

In April and November 2020, Fitch reaffirmed the Group’s BBB credit rating and maintained the stable outlook. The agency
mentioned that the rating action reflects the Group’s large portfolio of regionally dominant shopping centres, and its robust financial
profile, underpinned by low gearing ratios and strong liquidity, providing flexibility in handling the economic impact of the current
context.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings, in accordance with its
prudent financial strategy.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE

NEPI Rockcastle’s Board of Directors had resolved in August to allot and issue fully paid ordinary shares as a capitalisation issue to
the Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding, in lieu of a cash distribution for H1 2020. During September,
25,791,534 shares were issued and listed on the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

OUTLOOK

NEPI Rockcastle issued an earnings guidance in August 2020, which stated that the contraction in distributable earnings per share for
the year ending 31 December 2020 is expected to be approximately 30% compared to the prior year. This guidance did not consider
the impact of further macroeconomic disruptions (such as those potentially caused by a new broad lockdown in CEE countries) and
assumed a continuation of the trading dynamics observed until that date.

The Group’s performance and distributable earnings until 31 October were in line with the guidance. The increase in COVID-19 cases
led some governments to announce new restrictions during November, including the temporary closing of non-essential shops in
Poland and Czech Republic. Further restrictions may be introduced, also in other countries, thus increasing the uncertainty over the
potential negative impact of such measures over the Group’s financial results.

Based on currently available information and restrictions in place, the Group estimates that the impact on its distributable earnings per
share for 2020 will be a further decrease of 2% compared to previously issued guidance. This estimate is highly dependent on
potential future measures which could be taken by governments of the CEE countries where the Group operates, such as further
restrictions on trading or state support to tenants and / or landlords.

This guidance has not been reviewed or reported on by NEPI Rockcastle’s auditors and is the responsibility of the Board of Directors.

CORRECTION TO DEALINGS IN SECURITIES ANNOUNCEMENT


Reference is made to the dealings in securities announcement published on 30 April 2019 which included, inter alia,
information on the receipt of 167 shares by Antoine Dijkstra, a director of NEPI Rockcastle, in terms of an election to
receive the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 as a return of capital by way of an issue of new shares.
Further reconciliations of the share register show that no election to receive the dividend as an issue of new shares was
made by Antoine Dijkstra and the dividend was settled in cash. Accordingly, the 167 shares were not received by Antoine
Dijkstra and the disclosure contained in the announcement published on 30 April 2019 should therefore exclude this
allocation.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEW RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED IN SOME OF THE CEE COUNTRIES
WHERE THE GROUP OPERATES


NEPI Rockcastle provided an update on the COVID-19 related government measures in some of the CEE
countries in which the Group operates in an announcement dated 23 October 2020. Since that date, the
dynamic of the COVID-19 causalities led to the reassessment of the adopted measures, as follows:

-   In Czech Republic, the Government extended the trading ban introduced on 22 October on all non-
    essential shops until 20 November, with restaurants allowed to operate for deliveries and take
    away (provided there is a direct access to the restaurant from the street). These measures affect
    approximately 2% of the Group’s total GLA.

-   In Romania, temporary closing of food courts, restaurants and entertainment tenants (including
    cinemas) continues to apply for a further period of two weeks in cities/regions where the number of
    infections has exceeded 3 cases/1,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days. Indoor restaurants in such regions
    are allowed to only operate for take away orders and deliveries. The restrictions currently apply to
    several cities in Romania, including Bucharest, and affect 3% of the Group’s GLA. The geographical
    extent of these restrictions may change, depending on the prevailing medical situation at local level.

-   The existing restrictions applied in Slovakia, consisting of indoor restaurants operating only for take
    away orders and deliveries and entertainment tenants with activities temporarily suspended, are in place
    up until the 7-day moving average number of new infections falls below 500 cases. These restrictions
    affect approximately 1% of the Group’s GLA.

    Slovakia undertook a nationwide testing programme over the last two weekends, revealing that
    approximately 1% of the population is COVID-19 positive. The extended testing and subsequent
    measures taken are expected to generate a significant reduction of the COVID-19 infections, therefore
    also reducing the need to impose additional restrictions.

-   In Poland, the Government required the majority of non-essential shops in retail locations measuring
    over 2,000 sqm to close between 7 November and 29 November. The activities not affected by the
    Government’s decisions and trading in the Group’s shopping centres are groceries, DIY stores,
    pharmacies and medical stores, cosmetics, pet stores, units selling books or newspapers,
    telecommunication stores and services. Restaurants can operate only for takeaway and deliveries. The
    introduction of the new restrictions in Poland affects approximately 16% of the Group’s total GLA.

    As of today, the Government’s decree issued in March 2020 and providing for the suspension of the
    tenants’ financial obligations for the duration of restrictions is still in place. The Government is
    currently assessing the potential support for the retailers and landlords negatively impacted by these
    measures.

-   In Lithuania, all entertainment areas (cinemas, fitness centers, dancing studios, aquaparks) are closed
    and indoor restaurants can only operate for take away orders and deliveries. These restrictions affect
    approximately 1% of the Group’s GLA.

-   In Hungary, the prime minister announced new restrictions limiting the activities of indoor restaurants
    and entertainment facilities (leisure, fitness, swimming pools, cinemas) starting 11 November. The
    measures will affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

-   There is an increasing number of new COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days in CEE, in line with the
    worldwide trend. The existing restrictions in Bulgaria, Serbia, and Croatia do not prohibit the activity
    of any sector and, as of today, 100% of the Group’s GLA in these countries is operational.

As of today, tenants representing 77% of the Group’s GLA are operating. NEPI Rockcastle continues to
engage constructively with its business partners and the wider communities, prioritising safety and aiming for
a fair and equitable approach that would ensure the long-term success of our retail ecosystem. The Group has
an ongoing dialogue with industry bodies and governments to ensure all health protocols are strictly followed
and shopping centres remain safe destinations.

The Group has a strong liquidity position of approx. €1.2 billion, which includes cash and access to committed
undrawn revolving facilities. Debt covenants show significant headroom to the required levels and there are
no significant financial liabilities due in the following two years. The Group is comfortable that its high-quality
portfolio, prudent LTV (currently at approximately 32%) and robust liquidity will allow it to successfully meet
future challenges.

Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 19 November 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE: RECENT RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED IN SOME OF THE GROUP’S CEE COUNTRIES

Subsequent to the updates concerning the impact of the COVID-19 on the Group’s operations, the most recent
dated 17 September 2020, the Group provides herewith further news on its portfolio.

New measures have been recently adopted by the governments of the CEE countries to contain the spread of
the virus. These measures include temporarily limiting the operations of some of our shopping centres’
tenants:

    -   In Czech Republic, the Government ordered all non-essential shops to close and tightened other social-
        distancing rules starting 22 October. In the past two weeks, the country registered the highest number of
        COVID-19 new infections since the beginning of the pandemic, and the highest in the CEE. While all other
        countries where the Group is present reported between 0.3 and 3.5 new cases / 1,000 inhabitants for the 14-
        day period ended 22 October, Czech Republic reported 10.6 new cases.

        The introduction of the new restrictions in Czech Republic affects approximately 2% of the Group’s total
        GLA. In addition, restaurants in Czech malls, corresponding to 0.2% of the Group’s GLA, operate only for
        take away orders and deliveries. The Government communicated its support for all affected retailers and
        provides a subsidy of 50% of the rent and related charges, with no subsidy requested from landlords. In
        addition, the government covers 100% of payroll costs for companies affected by the restrictions.

    -   In Romania, restrictions relate to temporary closing entertainment tenants in the cities/regions where the
        number of infections has exceeded 3 cases/1,000 inhabitants, while indoor restaurants in such regions can
        only operate for take away orders and deliveries. As of today, these restrictions affect 1.7% of the Group’s
        GLA.

    -   In Poland, temporary restrictions have been implemented for fitness clubs and swimming pools, accounting
        for less than 1% of the Group’s GLA. In addition, from 24 October onwards, indoor restaurants will operate
        only for take away orders and deliveries.

    -   In Slovakia, indoor restaurants only operate for take away orders and deliveries, while entertainment tenants
        temporarily suspended their activities. The restrictions affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

These new measures currently impact approximately 6% of the Group’s total GLA, including indoor restaurants which operate
for take away orders and deliveries. All restrictions are imposed for only two weeks, at the end of which the situation 
will be reassessed.

Considering the dynamic of the new COVID-19 cases, other CEE governments where the Group operates
adjusted the safety restrictions in place, without prohibiting activities in any sectors. Wearing masks became
mandatory in the crowded outdoor spaces in most countries, while gatherings allow a limited number of
people, schools are functioning online only or in a hybrid model, and restaurants are allowed to trade at limited
capacity. The CEE governments’ approach is balanced, aiming to control the pressure on the health system
but also to limit the negative impact on economy.

At Group level, the footfall reached 75%-80% of the same period last year. The negotiations with tenants
progressed, increasing the collection rate for the first six months of the year to over 97% of the reported
revenues (adjusted for concessions granted).

Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 19 November 2020.

PORTFOLIO FULLY OPERATIONAL

NEPI Rockcastle’s portfolio is now 100% operational, as all trading restrictions in the countries where the
Group operates have ended.

Most restrictions had already ended by mid-August, except for indoor food service tenants in Romania and
cinemas in Romania, Croatia and Serbia. Romania ended the trading ban for indoor food service units on 1
September, and all indoor restaurants, food courts and coffee shops are now welcoming customers. Cinemas
opened gradually during the first two weeks of September and, as of today, they are all operating. The
remaining restrictions in Croatia and Serbia have also been lifted, with cinemas opened since the beginning
of September.

Maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants and staff continues to be NEPI Rockcastle’s top
priority. All necessary precautions for safe visits to the malls have been implemented, along with the
governments’ new measures for COVID-19 prevention in the entertainment areas. The Group is also
supporting the sales of indoor food tenants and cinemas by organising dedicated campaigns and promotions.

“We are delighted that all the Group’s properties are fully functional, and we are collaborating with our tenants
to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for visitors. We are already recording notable progress in respect
of footfall and tenants’ sales. We will continue to cooperate closely with all stakeholders in order to
successfully overcome this challenging period.” Alex Morar, CEO of NEPI Rockcastle.

CASH PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS

Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 21 August 2020 relating to the capitalisation issue
at a ratio of 4.2920 ordinary shares for every 100 ordinary shares held by NEPI Rockcastle shareholders on
Friday, 11 September 2020.

Where the application of the ratio in respect of the capitalisation issue gives rise to a fraction of a new
capitalisation share, such fraction will be rounded down to the nearest whole number with a cash payment
(“cash payment”) made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction.

The value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders has
been determined with reference to the volume weighted average traded price of a NEPI Rockcastle share on
the JSE on Wednesday, 9 September 2020, discounted by 10%. On this basis, shareholders are advised that
the gross value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders
is ZAR64.91031. For shareholders on the European register, this gross value is EUR3.27497, being the
aforementioned Rand value converted to Euro at the exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR19.8201 as at
Wednesday, 9 September 2020.

The salient dates and times announced on 21 August 2020 remain unchanged.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE


Shareholders are referred to the interim condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020
wherein shareholders were advised that the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle has resolved to allot and issue fully
paid ordinary shares of €0.01 each (“Capitalisation Shares”) as a capitalisation issue (“Capitalisation Issue”) to the
Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding at a ratio of 4.2920 ordinary shares for every 100
ordinary shares held.

The rationale for the Capitalisation Issue is to ensure that NEPI Rockcastle maintains a strong balance sheet and ample
liquidity while also returning value to shareholders during the present operating environment.

The salient dates in respect of the Capitalisation Issue are as follows:

                                                                           JSE and A2X           Euronext Amsterdam

Capitalisation Shares and Capitalisation Shares listed on
the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam

Shares may not be rematerialised or dematerialised from Wednesday, 9 September 2020 to Friday, 11 September 2020,
both days inclusive. Transfer of shares between the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam may not take place between
Tuesday, 8 September 2020 and Friday 11 September 2020, both days inclusive.

Where NEPI Rockcastle’s shareholder’s entitlement to Capitalisation Shares in relation to the Capitalisation Issue gives
rise to a fraction of a new Capitalisation Share, such fraction will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the
remaining balance will be settled in cash. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined with reference to
the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday, 9 September 2020, less 10% (converted to Euro
at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on
Thursday, 10 September 2020 before 11:00 am South African time.

Application will be made to the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam to list the new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued in terms
of the Capitalisation Issue with effect from the commencement of trade on Monday, 21 September 2020.

Tax and legal implications

The Capitalisation Issue in jurisdictions other than the Republic of South Africa may be restricted by law and failure to
comply with any of these restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdictions

The Capitalisation Issue is not a dividend and therefore will not attract dividend withholding tax in South Africa or the
Isle of Man, but may have tax implications in other jurisdictions, and NEPI Rockcastle’s shareholders are advised to
obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisors in this regard.

Exchange Control Regulations

The following is intended only as a guide and is therefore not a comprehensive statement of the Exchange Control
Regulations of South Africa issued under the Currency and Exchanges Act, 1933, as amended (“Exchange Control
Regulations”), and is applicable to shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE and A2X only.

All aspects relating to the Exchange Control Regulations will be managed by a shareholder’s CSDP or broker.
Shareholders who are in any doubt as to the appropriate course of action to take should consult their CSDP, broker or
other professional advisors.

NEPI Rockcastle shares issued in terms of the Capitalisation Issue are not freely transferable from South Africa and
must be dealt with in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations. Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE can
only receive shares traded on the JSE and A2X.

Capitalisation Shares issued to non-residents will be credited to their CSDP or broker accounts and a “non-resident”
annotation will appear in the CSDP or broker register. Future dividend payments will be credited directly to the bank
accounts nominated for shareholders by their CSDP or broker.

Shares issued to emigrants will be credited to the emigrant blocked share accounts at the CSDP or broker controlling
their blocked assets and a “non-resident” annotation will appear in the CSDP or broker register.

Distribution of Capitalisation Issue

The Capitalisation Shares will be distributed from NEPI Rockcastle’s share premium.

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the NEPI
Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be delivered
in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership of such shares. References to
NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue or to any shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle following the implementation of the Capitalisation Issue should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt,
issue or holding of security entitlements representing beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any
registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares.

All NEPI Rockcastle shares issued pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue will be registered in the name of Nederlands
Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V. (“Euroclear Nederland”), for and on behalf of shareholders. NEPI
Rockcastle shares traded on the JSE and A2X will be delivered in accordance with the rules of Strate and those traded
on Euronext Amsterdam will be delivered in accordance with the rules of Euroclear Nederland.

Shareholders are advised that the Company has not declared a dividend for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020.

SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT: REVIEWED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020


“The last six months were the most economically challenging in recent history. The measures taken by governments in
the fight against the spread of COVID-19 led to the temporary closure of non-essential retailers in all the countries
where NEPI Rockcastle operates, which had an adverse impact on the first half (H1 2020) results. The same strengths
that made NEPI Rockcastle the premier shopping centre owner in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), such as a well-
balanced portfolio of high-quality properties, conservative financial management and exceptional employees, are now
helping it to successfully overcome this period. Evidence is already very encouraging, 96% of total gross leasable area
(GLA) is now functional and fully-operating tenant sales are gradually returning to prior year levels (88% in June).
NEPI Rockcastle engaged constructively with its business partners and the wider communities, prioritising safety and
aiming for a fair and equitable approach that would ensure the long-term success of our retail ecosystem. Moving
forward, we intend to accelerate the digital transformation of our operations and the transition to a more integrated,
omnichannel business model. At the same time, we appreciate that the COVID-19 context might still impact the
economies of our region and we will continue to manage our capital prioritising long-term sustainability, while also
returning value to shareholders even through these unprecedented times. To this end we decided to propose a
capitalisation issue that benefits shareholders while ensuring that the Group maintains a strong balance sheet and ample
liquidity.” Alex Morar, CEO NEPI Rockcastle

DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

The Group achieved 19.66 euro cents in distributable earnings per share for the first half of 2020, 32% lower compared
to 29.02 euro cents in H1 2019, the decrease being directly attributable to the impact of COVID-19.

As over 95% of the leases were not subject to formally agreed modifications by 30 June 2020, government-imposed
reliefs and negotiated concessions during H1 2020 were recognised in the Income Statement of the period, as a reduction
of rental income (€11 million) and as an expense with partial forgiveness of receivables (€37 million). This approach
translated into a significant impact on the H1 2020 results, which reflects transparently the current business
circumstances. For more details on the accounting of rental concessions, please refer to Note 2 of the interim
consolidated financial statements.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION

Shareholders are advised that the Company has not declared a dividend for the six month period ended 30 June 2020.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE

The board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle’s has resolved to allot and issue fully paid ordinary shares as a capitalisation
issue to the Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding. An announcement containing full details of
the capitalisation issue will be released separately on the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam.

EXTERNAL AUDIT REVIEW AND EMPHASIS OF MATTER

The limited review report on the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements has been issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Isle of Man, after having reviewed and obtained the necessary comfort from PwC local
offices in the jurisdictions where the Group operates through its subsidiaries. The local PwC offices review the stand
alone IFRS financial statements of the respective subsidiaries and issue their interoffice review reports to PwC Isle of
Man.

PwC ‘s review report is unmodified and includes an emphasis of matter in respect of material valuation uncertainty
statement included by the external appraisers in their valuation reports, considering the current context and lack of
transactions since the pandemic. PWC’s review report is unmodified and this emphasis of matter only highlights that
assumptions included in valuation reports may change until the next valuation in December 2020. The inclusion of the
material valuation uncertainty clause does not mean that external appraisers’ valuation cannot be relied upon (see more
details in the Directors commentary and interim condensed consolidated financial statements).

FURTHER TRADING STATEMENT


Shareholders are referred to the trading statement published on 17 August 2020 and are advised that in order to
ensure that NEPI Rockcastle maintains a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity during the present operating
environment, the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (the “Board”) has adopted a prudent approach and resolved
not to declare a dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (compared to the dividend per share of 29.02 euro
cents for the prior corresponding period). In this regard, shareholders are referred to the interim consolidated
financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 which will be published on 21 August 2020.

In order to return value to shareholders during these unprecedented times, the Board has proposed a capitalisation
issue, full details of which will be released in due course.

The financial information contained in this trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the various announcements published by NEPI Rockcastle addressing the impact of
COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance, including the announcements published on 1 April and 20
May 2020 respectively, wherein shareholders were advised that NEPI Rockcastle had decided to withdraw its
earnings guidance for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.

The measures taken by governments in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the temporary closure
of non-essential retailers in the shopping centres in all the countries where NEPI Rockcastle operates, which
impacted the six months ended 30 June 2020 (“H1 2020”) results. Further to the easing of restrictions in all the
countries of operation, the vast majority of tenants are operational as of today, with only 4% of the Group’s GLA
still subject to temporary closure restrictions. Footfall and tenants’ sales are gradually recovering.

As NEPI Rockcastle uses dividend per share as its relevant measurement of financial results for trading statement
purposes, it is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes reasonably certain that the dividend
per share for the next reporting period will differ by at least 15% from that of the prior corresponding period.

Shareholders are advised that as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance,
NEPI Rockcastle expects a decline of approximately 32% or approximately 9.4 euro cents in distributable earnings
per share for H1 2020, compared to the distributable earnings per share of 29.02 euro cents for the prior
corresponding period. The Group reflected in its performance for H1 2020 concessions derived from Government
imposed laws (such as rent, service charges and marketing contributions relief during the lock-down period
imposed by Polish authorities) and concessions based on negotiations with tenants, granted as a partial forgiveness
of contractual receivables.

NEPI Rockcastle distributed 100% of distributable earnings as a dividend for the prior corresponding period.
However, given the ongoing uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance
and financial position, the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (the “Board”) has postponed the decision with
regard to a dividend for H1 2020 until the Board meeting due to be held on 20 August, to ensure that all relevant
information is considered. Should the Board resolve to declare a dividend, it is expected that the decline in dividend
per share for H1 2020 will be at least equal to the decline in distributable earnings per share. The Board’s decision
will be announced as soon as possible, and further information will be available in NEPI Rockcastle’s reviewed
financial statements for H1 2020 which will be published on 21 August 2020.

The financial information contained in this trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s auditors.

CONCLUSION OF A NEW AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE DISPOSAL OF THE ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO


Reference is made to the previous announcements published in respect of the disposal of the Romanian office
portfolio (the “disposal”) by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries NE Property B.V., Ingen Europe B.V. (the
“sellers”) to AFI Europe NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFI Properties Ltd. (“AFI Europe” or the
“purchaser”), the last of which was published on 6 July 2020.

The negotiations between the parties have been successfully concluded, resulting in NEPI Rockcastle entering into
an agreement with AFI Europe on 6 August 2020 to dispose of 100% of the shares in the subsidiaries holding the
Romanian office portfolio (the “new agreement”). In accordance with the provisions of the new agreement, the
completion of the disposal is expected to occur within no more than four months, with the completion date to be
set by the purchaser. The purchaser has paid to the sellers a cash advance of €15 million as guarantee for finalising
the completion. No other conditions precedent are required to be fulfilled.

The terms of the new agreement are substantially in line with the initial agreement (as announced on 17 December
2019), and accordingly, the disposal consideration remains unchanged, with a transaction value of €307 million
and an estimated cash consideration of approximately €290 million, to be adjusted based on the subsidiaries’
financial statements as of the date of completion.

Together with the execution of the new agreement and receipt of the cash advance, the parties have also settled the
arbitration.

REVISED NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING


Shareholders are advised that a revised notice of annual general meeting of NEPI Rockcastle shareholders,
(the “Revised Notice of AGM”) was distributed today, Monday, 27 July 2020. This Revised Notice of AGM
replaces in its entirety the original notice of annual general meeting which was published on 30 April 2020.

The date of the annual general meeting (“AGM”) remains unchanged and will be held at the Company’s
registered office, being 2nd Floor, 30 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 1JB on Thursday, 20 August
2020 at 8:30am British Summer Time/9:30am South African Standard Time, for shareholders to consider and,
if deemed fit, pass with or without modification, the resolutions as set out in the Revised Notice of AGM.

The record date to be recorded in the shareholder register in order to be entitled to vote at the AGM is Friday,
14 August 2020. A copy of the Revised Notice of AGM is available on the Company’s website at,
https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NEPI-Rockcastle-Revised-Notice-of-Annual-
General-Meeting.pdf.

Under normal circumstances, the NEPI Rockcastle Board values the opportunity to meet shareholders in
person. However, given the current Isle of Man Government restrictions due to COVID-19, the Board has
concluded that it is appropriate to strongly urge shareholders not to attend the AGM in person this year and,
instead, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are encouraged to submit proxy votes.

NEPI Rockcastle’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NE Property B.V., has closed the green corporate bond
book build referred to in the announcement released earlier today. NE Property B.V. has priced a €500
million unsecured 7 year Eurobond maturing on 14 July 2027 (“the Bond”), carrying a 3.375% fixed
coupon, with an issue price of 98.172%.

S&P and Fitch assigned the Bond a BBB rating, in line with the EMTN Programme rating and the
corporate rating.

The Bond has been placed with a broad range of institutional debt investors across Europe, attracting
a strong demand with an oversubscribed book of over €1.1 billion.

NEPI Rockcastle has developed a Green Finance Framework (the “Framework”) under which the
Company has committed to use proceeds from green bonds to finance and/or refinance existing and/or
future projects which improve the environmental performance of the Group’s property portfolio and
contribute to the Company’s climate impact mitigation objectives. The Framework (available on NEPI
Rockcastle’s website) defines eligibility criteria according to two types of green assets/initiatives:
certified green buildings and energy efficiency projects. The Framework has a Second Party Opinion
provided by Sustainalytics. The net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects included in
the portfolio selected in accordance with the use of proceeds criteria and selection process as defined
in the Company’s Framework.

Application has been made for listing the Bond with Euronext Dublin.

“Fixed-income investors are more than ever committed to ESG issues, and the green bond offered today
is yet another highlight of our ESG progress and commitment for sustainable operations and strong
capital structure. The strong demand and supportive pricing demonstrate investors’ continued
confidence in NEPI Rockcastle’s strategy and management team to weather the current environment.”
Mirela Covasa, CFO of NEPI Rockcastle.

FURTHER UPDATE ON THE DISPOSAL OF THE ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO

Reference is made to the previous announcements published in respect of the disposal of the Romanian office
portfolio (the “disposal”) by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries NE Property B.V., Ingen Europe B.V. and
NEPI Bucharest Two SRL (the “sellers”) to AFI Europe NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFI Properties Ltd.
(“AFI Europe” or the “purchaser”). As per the last Business Update published on 20 May 2020 shareholders were
advised that the disposal was not completed.

NEPI Rockcastle and AFI Europe (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the parties”) initiated arbitration
proceedings (the “arbitration”) in connection with the disputed matter of the sellers requesting the purchaser to
pay the contractual guarantee, and the purchaser contesting the validity of the sellers’ claim and requesting specific
performance of the disposal.

In addition, the sellers and AFI Europe have entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”)
pursuant to which, under certain conditions, the parties may terminate the arbitration and enter into a new binding
agreement regarding the disposal, based on the pricing and other terms of the original transaction (as announced
on 17 December 2019), subject to any requisite amendments required in relation to the payment dates and
completion. The MOU has been signed on 5 July 2020 and negotiations will be conducted on a without prejudice
basis in respect of the arbitration.

The progress of the new transaction will be notified in due course.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) RATING UPDATE ISSUED BY SUSTAINALYTICS AND LAUNCH OF GREEN FINANCE FRAMEWORK
 
NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that in June 2020, Sustainalytics, a leading independent global
provider of ESG and corporate governance research and ratings, reaffirmed NEPI Rockcastle's ESG Risk
rating as Low. The Company’s ESG Risk Rating from Sustainalytics improved to 12.5/100 from 15.1/100
at the end of 2019. The new rating positions NEPI Rockcastle among the top five rated companies in its
sub-industry, Real Estate Management, as compared to 23rd place last year.

The Company’s score has improved in all assessed Material ESG Issues, being:
   - Corporate Governance
   - Human Capital
   - ESG Integration – Financials
   - Product Governance
   - Business Ethics

Sustainalytics concluded that the Company is at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from
ESG factors, due to its low exposure and strong management of material ESG issues. The Company is
noted for its strong corporate governance performance, which is reducing its overall risk. Furthermore, the
Company has not experienced significant controversies during 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle's main initiatives during 2019 focused, inter alia, around the following aspects:

   - reviewing and updating its corporate governance framework, aligning it to best practices, as well
     as voluntarily implementing provisions from the Dutch and UK corporate governance codes;
   - implementing or improving several sound risk management procedures and guidelines;
   - enhancing its business ethics programme and its compliance management system; and
   - improving its cybersecurity and data protection measures to ensure awareness and preparedness at
     Group level.

Sustainalytics reported that the Company's overall management of material ESG issues is strong. Moreover,
the Company's management score has increased significantly in the past year, and its management category
has improved.

More details on NEPI Rockcastle's practices and initiatives can be found in the Corporate Governance and
Sustainability Report sections available in the 2019 Annual Report (https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/NEPI_Rockcastle_Annual_Report_2019.pdf) and in the Sustainability section on
the corporate website (https://nepirockcastle.com/sustainability/focus-and-performance/)

In 2020, NEPI Rockcastle also updated its annual report, to align with the Global Reporting Initiative
Standards: Core option. Alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative Standard further highlights NEPI
Rockcastle’s ongoing commitment to transparency in its sustainability reporting practices.

Moreover, NEPI Rockcastle launched a Green Finance Framework which integrates the Company’s
sustainability targets with its financing activities. The Green Finance Framework allows the Group to
finance or refinance Eligible Green projects, comprising green buildings and energy efficiency spending,
through the issuance of a variety of Green Finance instruments. Currently approximately €2.8 billion of the
Group’s property portfolio is eligible for green (re)financing.

In line with best market practices, the Green Finance Framework is in accordance with the international
applicable principles (Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 2020) and benefits from a
positive Second Party Opinion from Sustainalytics. The Green Finance Framework and second Party
Opinion are available at: https://nepirockcastle.com/sustainability/focus-and-performance/

“Sustainability will remain one of the Group’s priorities in 2020 and the years to come, as it is a long-term
journey that demands a continuing commitment. Now we are also able to integrate sustainability objectives
in our financing activities. The Green Finance Framework will further support NEPI Rockcastle’s
commitments to sustainability and enable us to broaden our investor base”, Mirela Covasa, CFO NEPI
Rockcastle.

ING Bank N.V. and Société Générale acted as joint green structurers in the development of the framework.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEPI ROCKCASTLE’S OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA INCREASES TO 90%


Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 5 June 2020 and are advised that, as a result of
the further easing of trading restrictions in Romania, tenants occupying approximately 90% of the Group’s
GLA are now operational. Romania ended the trading ban on stores located in large shopping centres, except
for cinemas and playgrounds, on 15 June. Indoor restaurants and food courts can only provide take-away food,
while outdoor food and beverage amenities trade normally.
All stores in all other countries in the Group’s portfolio are allowed to trade, except for cinemas and
playgrounds in some locations. The operating GLA is expected to further increase to approximately 94% by
the end of June, as a result of the gradual reopening of cinemas in some countries, while playgrounds are
expected to open at a later stage.
Average footfall exceeds 70% of the levels recorded in the same period last year in most of the Group’s
shopping centres. The Group’s top priority remains maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants
and staff, and all necessary measures for safe visits to the malls have been implemented. Mega Mall in
Bucharest and Bonarka City Centre in Krakow are the first shopping malls in Romania and Poland certified
as COVID-19 safety compliant by SAFE Shopping Centers, confirming that the properties comply with strict
security and safety conditions related to COVID-19 and adhere to best practice and industry standards.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEPI ROCKCASTLE EXPECTS ITS OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA TO INCREASE TO 90% IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS


Shareholders are advised that as of today, tenants occupying approximately 70% of the Group’s GLA are
welcoming their visitors, in the best sanitary conditions. The proportion of the GLA hosting open stores is
expected to increase to approximately 90% by mid-June and approximately 94% by the end of June; this
estimate is based on the expected further easement of trading restrictions for stores located in large shopping
centres in Romania around mid-June (although the final decision has not yet been announced by the
authorities) and progressive reopening of entertainment facilities in most countries.

Indoor and outdoor restaurants, food courts and gyms have opened in all countries, except for Romania.
Entertainment facilities will be reopened in Poland starting 6 June, while in Romania the reopening date will
be communicated at a later stage. Although allowed to trade in some locations, most cinemas have not yet
opened, due to industry supply issues.

Romania commenced the easing of lockdown restrictions on 15 May, reopening shops with direct street access
and retail parks with a built area below 15,000 m2; outdoor terraces, bars, restaurants and coffee shops
reopened on 1 June, with social distancing measures in place. Further easing of restrictions is expected to be
announced during the following week, potentially lifting trading bans for stores in large shopping centres in
mid-June, except for entertainment facilities.

Since the gradual ending of trading restrictions during April and May in most of the CEE countries, the
shopping centres’ footfall has been continuously increasing, despite the restrictions on entertainment areas,
and reached levels above the ones anticipated by the Group. Most of the Group’s shopping centres in Poland,
Czech Republic, Serbia and Croatia, where trading restrictions ended in early May, show footfall already
exceeding 70% of the levels recorded in the same period of 2019.

While the formal May sales reporting is still in progress, tenants have generally seen higher conversion rates
and larger basket sizes than expected, as a result of customers focusing on efficient shopping.

Though many retailers placed most new investments temporarily on hold, there is still demand for letting,
some also coming from new brands looking to enter the CEE market. Lease renewals continue mainly within
previously agreed long-term conditions.

Overall collection of rent and other charges due by 30 April increased to 89%; for April and May a 60-day
rent deferral has been granted to most tenants affected by the lockdowns. Discussions related to tenant
discounts are ongoing, with long-term rent largely unaffected.

“The post-lockdown performance of our shopping centres is very encouraging, and the higher-than-expected
footfall is notable especially considering that many dining and entertainment areas are just opening. Our top
priority remains maintaining the health and safety of our customers, tenants and staff, and we have
implemented all necessary measures for safe visits to our properties. The coming period will require significant
collaboration between stakeholders in our industry to ensure the speedy recovery of the retail environment.”

BUSINESS UPDATE

“COVID-19 had limited impact on revenues during the first quarter (‘Q1’), with social distancing 
measures causing closure of most shops starting mid-March. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak,
our priority has been ensuring the health and safety of all our customers and staff. Over the last few
weeks, in the context of easing of restrictions, a large proportion of retailers have resumed their 
operations and 63% of the Group’s Gross Leasable Area (‘GLA’) is currently open. As we begin to collect 
post-reopening operational data, we are confident that our high-quality portfolio, robust balance sheet 
and strong liquidity together with our unparalleled know-how of the CEE region remain key strengths for 
weathering this storm well.” 
Alex Morar, CEO NEPI Rockcastle 

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

  ratio and other factors;

- marketing contribution relief for April and May for closed units; and  
- variable operating expenses during lockdown period reduced by approximately 40% relative to the 2019 comparative 
  period, on a like-for-like basis.

- availability of hand sanitising dispensers in numerous locations across each property.

DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
The Company has revised its expenditure for the development pipeline, focusing on committed on-going projects. 
NEPI Rockcastle is benefiting from a flexible approach to its development pipeline, anchored by prudent project 
management which enables the Group to reassess and adapt the project pipeline as needed. Construction costs are 
committed on a gradual basis, with the majority of works done by package. The limited use of general contractors 
enables the Group to suspend or terminate development activities at any time, exercising a high degree of control 
over the quality of works and cash flow management. 

The Group had the following committed projects at 31 March 2020:
- Focus Mall Zielona Gora (Zielona Gora, Poland): Necessary works regarding the parking and common areas of the 
  extension (15,600m2) are progressing. New tenants include: Apart, Express Marche, Millennium Bank, Rainbow Tours

  ground floor and opening of an outdoor terrace and a 6 screen cinema by Cinema City will be completed in second 
  quarter (‘Q2’) 2020;

  in Q2 2020;  
- Shopping City Targu Mures (Targu Mures, Romania): A 39,800m2 shopping mall was completed in Q1 2020. The opening 
  was scheduled for end of March and is now estimated for third quarter (‘Q3’) 2020 (after the Romanian government 
  ends trading restrictions). The tenant mix includes Carrefour, CCC, Cineplexx, Flanco, eMag, Hervis Sports, 
  Intersport, KFC, LC Waikiki, LPP (Cropp, House, Reserved and Sinsay) and New Yorker.

During Q1 2020, €50 million was spent on the pipeline projects detailed above. Following a detailed business review,
the Group actively implemented various measures aimed at optimising the allocation of capital, among which was the 
deferral of non-committed  development and capital expenditure projects. Thus, the Group will not launch new 
constructions until there is further clarity on the impact of COVID-19 on the Group’s operations. Consequently, 
the Group estimates to incur further development and capital expenditure of only €70 million in 2020.

ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO DISPOSAL
As already announced, the disposal of the Romanian office portfolio, in accordance with the agreement signed in 
December 2019, was not completed due to the purchaser’s obligations related to the completion procedures not being 
fulfilled. This lead to a breach in the agreement, which entitled the Group to terminate it and claim the 
contractual guarantee. The procedures for recovering the guarantee in accordance with the contractual mechanisms 
have been initiated. 

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT 
NEPI Rockcastle had strong liquidity at 31 March 2020, with €590 million available in cash and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group’s gearing ratio (interest bearing debt less cash, divided by investment property and listed securities, 
excluding the effect of International Financial Reporting Standard 16 (‘IFRS’)) was 32%, below the 35% target.

As of 31 March 2020, ratios for unsecured loans and bonds showed ample headroom compared to covenants:
- Solvency Ratio: 40% actual, vs requirement of maximum 60%; 
- Consolidated Coverage Ratio: 6.3 actual, vs requirement of minimum 2; 
- Unsecured consolidated total assets/unsecured consolidated total debt: 269% actual, vs requirement of minimum 180%.

The Company successfully repurchased the outstanding bond notes due February 2021, with a nominal value of €198 million 
in January 2020. 

In April 2020, the Group’s Investment Grade credit ratings were reaffirmed by Fitch Ratings (BBB, stable outlook) 
and S&P Global Ratings (BBB, negative outlook). NEPI Rockcastle is committed to further enhancing its liquidity 
and maturity profile and will continue to analyse market opportunities as they arise. Depending on market conditions, 
the Group may initiate repurchases of issued bonds or shares during the following reporting periods.

COMMUNITY SUPPORT
The Group supported the community efforts for preventing the spread of the COVID-19 and has collaborated with the 
Red Cross for the purchasing of protective medical equipment. In addition, NEPI Rockcastle started a fundraising 
campaign through the online channels (websites and social media) of its shopping centres in Romania. The entire 
amount collected will be used to support the efforts of the Red Cross organisation.

OUTLOOK
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the global economic outlook for 2020, and there is significant uncertainty about its
impact on NEPI Rockcastle’s operations. In this context, NEPI Rockcastle has decided to withdraw its 2020 earnings 
guidance, as announced on 1 April 2020. 

The recent easing of restrictions led to a significant increase in the Group’s activity, and the first signs are 
encouraging. The Group will continue to provide updates, and will announce a revised earnings guidance when it will
be in a position to reliably estimate the effect of the current context on its performance.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


Background
Since mid-March 2020, local governments in the nine Central and Eastern European (‘CEE’) countries where NEPI
Rockcastle operates have implemented rigorous measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including, among
others, the closure of all stores except those selling essential goods (such as groceries, other food stores and
pharmacies). Such measures were prompt and efficient, leading to a low rate of COVID-19 infections and fatalities
in the CEE.

Non-essential shops opening for trade and first signs of business beginning to normalise
Gradual easing of restrictions has commenced in the second half of April 2020 and is expected to continue
throughout May – June. Governments are adopting different plans for ending the lockdowns, mostly focused on a
phased approach.

Regarding the Group’s operations:
   - trading restrictions have been substantially lifted in Lithuania, with most retail shops, including those in
     shopping centres, being now open. Indoor restaurants and entertainment facilities are expected to open at
     the end of May or beginning of June. The government safety guidelines require shopping centres, among
     others, to ensure a maximum density of one person per 10 square metres. NEPI Rockcastle resumed its
     operations at Ozas Shopping Centre and Entertainment in Vilnius on 25 April 2020.
   - on 4 May 2020, Poland ended the temporary trading restrictions on the stores located in shopping centres
     larger than 2,000 square metres, and all the Group’s malls in Poland have resumed normal trading. Some
     safety guidelines imposed by the government remain in place, including wearing face masks and
     maintaining social distancing when in public spaces. Restaurants currently provide only take-away food.
     Entertainment facilities remain closed as the government continues to monitor the situation.
   - retail parks in Croatia have been open since 27 April, including the Group’s Arena Retail Park (Zagreb,
     Croatia);
   - the office portfolio continues to be functional;
   - non-essential store openings are also being accelerated in Serbia, Czech Republic and Croatia, with trading
     restrictions expected to end by mid-May; and
   - a gradual easing of the lockdown measures has been announced also by Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and
     Bulgaria, although specific dates for allowing trading of non-essential shops located in shopping malls
     have not been yet communicated.

As of today, tenants representing 43% of the Group’s GLA are open, and the number is expected to increase
progressively over the next weeks. The first trading indications in Lithuania and Poland are positive: most of the
tenants have already opened their stores, footfall is gradually increasing, and customers react positively to the new
safety rules. Further increases in footfall and turnovers are expected when the restaurants and cinemas revert to
operations, and also when the neighbouring offices have increased attendance.

Conversion rates are higher than usual, indicating that customers are focused on efficient shopping.
Targu Mures Shopping City, the Romanian mall which was initially planned for opening at the end of March, was
completed. A new opening date will be decided together with the tenants, once the Romanian government provides
more information on the phased easing of restrictions.

Extensive health and safety protocols
The Group has implemented extensive health and safety measures in its shopping centres. The protocol includes,
amongst others:
   - social distancing rules are enforced through markings in seating areas, corridors, elevators, escalators, etc;
   - shopping centres’ staff and customers are expected to wear masks and apply other precautionary measures;
   - communication with visitors is done through various channels, such as radio, posters, videos on electronic
     panels, website and social media messages, and outlines the most significant preventive measures
     customers are expected to apply when visiting the centres;
   - NEPI Rockcastle, its tenants and suppliers strictly monitor their employees for COVID-19 symptoms, and
     instruct them on additional safety norms and procedures;
   - buildings are ventilated with 100% fresh air;
   - additional cleaning and disinfection are performed regularly;
   - frequently used furniture and equipment (such as handrails, food court tables and trays) are disinfected
     every hour; and
   - hand sanitizing dispensers are available in numerous locations across each property.

Measures to support retailers and collections
Governments across the Group’s CEE region have adopted laws implementing measures to assist tenants, ranging
from allowing the ability to defer rental payments for businesses impacted by COVID-19 until the end of 2020
(such as in Romania, although the law is not yet enforced), to providing state financial aid covering part of the
payments due by tenants (Lithuania) or suspending tenants’ financial obligations for the duration of the restrictions
(Poland). Also, CEE governments allow deferral of various tax and social contributions payments, with some
governments implementing suspension of the loan instalments for specific periods. The Group encourages its
tenants to use the fiscal and monetary stimuli provided by governments.

NEPI Rockcastle has an ongoing, active dialogue with its tenants regarding their business performance and ability
to pay. The Group usually collects over 99% of its income. Over 90% of the rent and other charges invoiced for
Q1 2020 have been collected. Although rent payment obligations regarding closed units for April and May (where
already invoiced) have been deferred for 60 days without penalties, as a mean to supporting tenants, collection is
progressing well.

The asset management team is committed to working together with tenants to maintain sustainable, long-term
relationships. Any discounts will be agreed on case-by-case basis, based on a thorough analysis of the tenants’
financial situation, occupancy cost ratio and other factors, and will be focused on maintaining a functioning retail
environment for the long term.

Strong balance sheet and liquidity
The Group is committed to its prudent financial policy, focused on a conservative gearing level (32% as at
December 2019) and robust liquidity. In response to the recent events, NEPI Rockcastle actively implemented
various measures focused on optimising the allocation of capital, including:
    - reducing non-critical operating expenses, especially for the period in which most of the retailers in the
      shopping centres were not trading;
    - deferring non-committed development projects; and
    - deferring non-essential capital expenditure.

The Group estimates strict compliance with all debt-related obligations throughout 2020 and going further, without
any need to obtain deferrals or waivers for any of its unsecured or secured debt. Financial covenants show
significant headroom to the required levels.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to further enhancing its liquidity and maturity profile and will continue to analyse
various options in this respect.

BBB ratings reaffirmed by S&P and Fitch
At the beginning of April 2020, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) Rating Services reaffirmed BBB credit rating for the
Group. The outlook was revised from stable to negative, reflecting the agency’s views on potential risks associated
with the wider retail real estate sector due to COVID-19 related disruptions and, at that time, lack of information
on when non-essential retailers will resume activities. S&P noted that NEPI Rockcastle's liquidity profile remains
robust.

On 30 April 2020, Fitch reaffirmed the Group’s BBB credit rating, and maintained the stable outlook. The agency
mentioned that the rating action reflects the Group's large portfolio of regionally dominant shopping centres, and
its significant financial headroom that will provide flexibility in handling the economic impact of lockdown
measures due to the coronavirus pandemic.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining and further improving its credit ratings.

Q1 business update
The Group continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and updates will be communicated as events unfold.
Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 20 May 2020.

IM1 1JB on Thursday, 20 August 2020 at 8:30am British Summer Time/9:30am South African Standard Time, for

UPDATE ON DISPOSAL OF ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO


The company refers to the announcement dated 16 December 2019 indicating that through its wholly owned
subsidiaries mentioned therein and collectively referred to as the “sellers”, it had entered into an agreement (the
“agreement”) to dispose of the Romanian office portfolio (“Portfolio”) to AFI Europe NV (“AFI Europe” or
the “purchaser”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Africa Israel Properties Limited (the “disposal”). As announced,
the disposal was subject to the fulfilment of conditions precedent, being the unconditional approval of the
Romanian Competition Council and the successful conclusion of formalities with Trade Registry.

The Company advises that the conditions precedent have been fulfilled within the contractually agreed timeline
and, according to the agreement, the completion of the transaction should have occurred on 31 March 2020.
However, the disposal was not completed as the purchaser’s obligations related to the completion procedures
were not fulfilled, leading to a breach in the agreement which entitled the sellers to terminate the agreement and
claim the contractual guarantee.

The current restrictions due to the situation generated by COVID-19 did not prevent completion, as the authorities
involved in processing the share transfer (i.e. the Trade Registry) were open to the public, and the contractual
mechanism allowed for electronic completion. Moreover, legislation recently passed specifically requires public
authorities and professionals, including law firms and notaries, to continue exercising their functions and
providing services, while observing the precautionary measures imposed by the authorities, thus permitting also
in-person completion, using, if needed, power of attorney.

Following its legal assessment, the Company’s stand is that the sellers have duly fulfilled their contractual
obligations, while also considering the emergency orders issued by the authorities in Romania. Discussions on
extending the completion date included both parties proposing terms, and the Company’s recent announcement
noted an estimated postponement until April; however, consensus on those terms was not reached.

The sellers are currently assessing a suitable course of action in accordance with the contractual mechanisms in
place and claiming the contractual guarantee provided by the purchaser regarding the closing procedures.

COVID-19 UPDATE


Subsequent to NEPI Rockcastle’s updates concerning the impact of the COVID-19 on its operations, dated
17 March 2020 and 23 March 2020, there have been significant developments around the COVID-19 situation.
As governments, national authorities and companies continue to implement rigorous measures, there is a high
degree of uncertainty about the impact of this on the Group’s operations. As a result, NEPI Rockcastle withdraws
its earnings guidance for 2020 and expects to provide an update when the Group will be in a position to estimate
the effects of the current situation reliably.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining its conservative gearing level and a robust liquidity. At this stage,
NEPI Rockcastle is actively implementing various measures focused on achieving the most suitable allocation of
capital, including:

- reducing non-critical operating expenses;
- deferring non-committed development projects and non-essential capital expenditure; and
- utilising any relevant facilities provided by national authorities to assist companies in the current context.

The Group continues to assess the situation and will provide further updates when appropriate.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


NEPI Rockcastle provided an initial update concerning the impact of the COVID-19 related government
measures on its activities in an announcement dated 17 March 2020. Since that date, the authorities in
Romania, Serbia and Croatia have increased the safety measures to contain the spreading of COVID-19. New
measures include temporarily limiting the operations of some of our shopping centres’ tenants.

Businesses deemed non-essential by the authorities which are located in the Group’s shopping centres in
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia are now temporarily
closed, while pharmacies, groceries and other food stores remain open in all locations. In some properties, the
food court tenants are operating only for deliveries or pick-ups. All shops in the Group’s Hungarian properties
are open, except for cinemas and entertainment operators. Office properties are fully-functional, although
many businesses (including NEPI Rockcastle) have implemented work-from-home policies to limit social
interactions.

NEPI Rockcastle’s priority remains the health and wellbeing of its customers, partners and employees, and
the appropriate measures have been enforced in all properties. All buildings remain open and are serviced,
with a continuous focus on cleaning and ensuring customer safety. NEPI Rockcastle continues to support the
communities where it operates by donating to the Red Cross and working on implementing other platforms to
encourage donations to and cooperation with NGOs.

The Group notes that large international and national tenants (companies with assets and/or turnover in excess
of €200 million) occupy 67% of its lettable area, lowering the risk of tenant default. Also, Auchan and
Carrefour, which are estimated to have higher-than-usual sales in the coming period, are two of its largest
tenants. Approximately 91.2% of the Group’s gross rental income is fixed rent, and only 3.3% is overage rent
(paid based on sales, on top of fixed rent). The occupancy cost ratio of its tenants was 11.9% in 2019, which
is prudent by industry standards. The Group continues to have regular dialogue with its partners and
encourages the use of the fiscal and monetary stimulus provided by governments.

Zagreb earthquake
The region surrounding Zagreb, Croatia, was impacted by a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in the early morning of
22 March 2020, followed by several aftershocks. NEPI Rockcastle’s local team is unharmed and no damage
to its shopping centre and adjacent retail park has been identified.

NEPI Rockcastle will continue to assess the situation and provide further updates when appropriate.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


NEPI Rockcastle, the premier owner and operator of commercial real estate across nine countries in Central
and Eastern Europe, continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving situation concerning COVID-19 and
follow the advice issued by governments in the countries in which it operates.

In recent days the governments in several markets in which the Company owns and operates commercial real
estate have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus, in line with the World Health Organization
recommendations. Such measures currently include closing non-essential businesses and shops in shopping
centres in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia, except for pharmacies, groceries and
other food stores. Other services such as banking and insurance are still functional in some locations. The
Group’s properties in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Croatia are open, except for cinemas in Hungary. NEPI
Rockcastle has decided to implement shorter trading hours in some locations, as a preventive measure. The
above is subject to change as per information to be made available by the authorities in the respective
countries.

NEPI Rockcastle is focusing on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its employees, tenants and visitors, while
minimising disruption. Extra sanitising measures have been implemented in all properties. All major events
scheduled by the shopping centres until the end of March have been postponed, and the centres’ digital
networks display prevention messages focused on increasing visitors’ awareness. The Group has also been in
touch with international NGOs and plans to redirect its CSR budget to helping local communities navigate the
current challenges.

Footfall and tenants’ sales in 2020 were comparable to the similar period of 2019, apart from the past two
weeks, when decreases were noted in most locations. Rent and service charges for the first quarter of 2020
were generally invoiced in advance and the majority have already been collected. At this stage, determining
the impact on the Group’s contractual obligations in relation to its tenants is difficult. NEPI Rockcastle has
regular dialogue with its partners, and any support offered will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This
assessment depends on other measures to be implemented by governments, including various forms of fiscal
stimulus already announced in some countries, which the Group intends to use.

The Group has a strong liquidity position which includes significant cash and access to undrawn revolving
facilities. Debt covenants show significant headroom to the required levels. As a result of the active liability
management programme executed in 2019, the Group has no significant financial liabilities due in the
following three years. The cash flow allocated to the development pipeline is currently unaffected. The
Romanian office portfolio sale is expected to be finalised in April 2020. The Group will optimise non-urgent
operational expenses, aiming to reduce service charges and their impact on tenants’ costs. The payment of the
dividend corresponding to the second half of 2019, due in early April 2020, will proceed as planned.

NEPI Rockcastle will continue to assess the situation and provide further updates when appropriate. Once
sufficient information is available, the Group will revert with any expected impact on the 2020 earnings. The
Group is confident that its strong balance sheet and geographically diversified, dominant portfolio will prove
resilient against this economic uncertainty.

ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL: FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the circular issued on 21 February 2020, in respect of an election
to receive the final dividend (the ""final dividend"") for the year ended 31 December 2019, either as a cash
dividend or as a return of capital and are advised as follows:

-     Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand
      converted from Euro at an exchange rate determined as on Monday, 2 March 2020 of
      EUR1.00:ZAR 17.2640. Accordingly, the cash dividend of 27.31 eurocents per share will be equal to
      ZAR 4.7148 per share.

-     Equity markets showed significant volatility since the publication of the circular. NEPI Rockcastle is
      confident that its business fundamentals and growth prospects remain sound, and that these are not fully
      reflected in its recent share price movement. Hence, the company will offer shareholders the option of
      receiving their distribution in shares instead of cash at a price which equals EPRA NAV per share of
      EUR 7.32 (""reference price""). The reference price for NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on JSE is
      ZAR 126.3725 (being the reference price of EUR 7.32 converted to ZAR at the exchange rate of
      EUR1.00:ZAR 17.2640), which includes a 13.15% premium to the five-day volume weighted average
      traded price (less distribution) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at 2 March 2020. For NEPI
      Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price is EUR 7.32.

-     Shareholders electing to receive the return of capital will receive 3.7309 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for
      every 100 NEPI Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday, 13 March 2020,
      representing the ratio that the cash dividend bears to the reference price. The final dividend will be paid
      from the Isle of Man.

If no shareholders were to elect to receive the return of capital, the value of the dividends would amount to
EUR 163 804 616. Should all shareholders elect to receive the return of capital, the maximum total number
of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the return of capital will be 
22 377 676.

The share capital of the company as at the date of this announcement is as follows:
                                                                                                  000 EUR

per share for shareholders liable to pay the dividends tax rate of 20%. There is no withholding tax payable in
the Isle of Man.

ZAR:EUR conversion rate announced on Tuesday, 3 March 2020, before 11:00 South African time (""exchange
rate"").

The cash dividend will be paid out of the company's distributable profits.

Return of capital
The rationale for the return of capital is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle and to retain flexibility with regard to the company's cash resources.

The number of NEPI Rockcastle shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the return of capital is entitled
will be determined with reference to the ratio that 27.31 eurocents per share bears to a reference price. The reference
price will be calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average traded price (less the cash dividend) of
NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE, to be announced on Tuesday, 3 March 2020.

NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing
shareholder in respect of the return of capital if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be
acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require
the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover,
capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances, the shareholder will receive the balance of their
entitlement as a cash dividend. The company further reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the return of capital, on a pro rata basis. In such
circumstance, shareholders will receive the balance of their final dividend (net of withholding tax), in cash.

The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the return of
capital will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a
NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (""cash payment"")
made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined
with reference to the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday, 11 March 2020, less 10%
(converted to Euro at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount
will be announced on Thursday, 12 March 2020 before 11:00 South African time.

The new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the return of capital will be funded by way of a reduction
of part of the company's share premium account (which is a reduction of capital).

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the
NEPI Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the return of capital. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be
delivered to shareholders in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership
of such shares. References throughout this announcement to NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant
to the return of capital or to any shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle before or after the implementation of the return
of capital should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt, issue or holding of security entitlements representing
beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares.
All NEPI Rockcastle shares are and will be registered in the name of Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal
Effectenverkeer B.V. (""Euroclear Nederland"") for and on behalf of shareholders.

As at the date of this announcement, the company has 599 797 201 ordinary shares of E0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS
South African resident shareholders
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders.

For those South African resident shareholders receiving the cash dividend, such amount will be regarded as a
foreign dividend and may be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%, unless an
exemption as set out in the South African tax legislation applies.

The receipt of NEPI Rockcastle shares by South African resident shareholders pursuant to the return of capital
should not be classified as a dividend or a foreign dividend for South African tax purposes and accordingly, South
African dividends withholding tax should not be levied on the new NEPI Rockcastle shares so received. However,
the legislation in this regard is complex and its implementation is uncertain. Shareholders should therefore seek
independent professional tax advice.

The gross local dividend amount for shareholders exempt from paying South African dividends tax, as well as the
net local dividend amount for shareholders liable to pay South African dividends tax, will be announced on
Tuesday, 3 March 2020.

NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are advised to consult their professional advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the cash dividend and the return of capital or should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to take.
There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.
Shareholders residing outside South Africa
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders who are resident outside South Africa and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice
from their professional advisors in this regard.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

SHORT-FORM: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019


DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

“We are delighted to report that the Group has achieved the targeted results in a competitive market. Twelve
years since inception and three since the successful merger, our assets continue to outperform. Solidly growing
footfall and retail sales are driven by our continued asset management efforts, focused on delivering locally-
optimal tenant mixes and customer experience. The retail portfolio has further increased with the opening of
high-quality developments and remains the largest and most dominant in the CEE. As we maintain a sound
business profile with strong liquidity, we are delivering on our growing development pipeline and are
confident of our ability to take advantage of all attractive opportunities in our markets.” Alex Morar, CEO.

The Group achieved 27.31 eurocents in distributable earnings per share for the second half of 2019, which,
aggregated with the 29.02 eurocents distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2019, resulted in a total
distribution of 56.33 eurocents for the year ended 31 December 2019. The 2019 distribution is 6.6% higher
than 2018’s 52.86 eurocents, and slightly above previously issued guidance. The strong results reflect the solid
performance of assets and management, and the quality of developments completed.

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 27.31 eurocents per share for the second half of 2019.

Shareholders can elect to receive the distribution either in cash or as an issue of fully-paid shares based on a
ratio between distribution declared and the reference price. The reference price will be calculated based on the
five-day volume-weighted average traded price, less distribution, of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE. The
Group reserves the right to limit the total allocation of shares as a percentage of the total distribution. A circular
containing full details of the election being offered to shareholders, accompanied by announcements on the
Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam will be issued in due course.

Distributable earnings per share for 2020 are expected to be approximately 6% higher than the 2019
distribution. This guidance is based on the assumptions that acquisitions are concluded as planned,
developments are delivered as scheduled, a stable macroeconomic environment prevails and no major
corporate failures occur.

EXTERNAL AUDIT AND KEY AUDIT MATTERS

The audit report on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements has been issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Isle of Man, after having reviewed and obtained the necessary comfort from PwC
local offices in the jurisdictions where the Group operates through its subsidiaries. The local PwC offices audit
the stand alone IFRS financial statements of the respective subsidiaries and issue their interoffice audit reports
to PricewaterhouseCoopers Isle of Man.

The auditors have issued their unmodified audit report on the annual financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2019 and a copy of the audit opinion, together with the underlying audited annual financial
statements is available on the Company’s website.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor’s professional judgement, were of most significance in
the audit of the financial statements. The only key audit matter identified in relation to the 2019 audit was
Valuation of investment property, which is significant due to its magnitude and because the valuation is
complex and highly dependent on a range of estimates (amongst others, rental value, vacancy rates, non-
recoverable expenses, lease incentives, maintenance costs, discount rates and estimated terminal value). The
directors used external appraisers to support their determination of the individual fair values of the investment
property semi-annually.

PwC’s procedures in relation to the key audit matter included evaluation of the objectivity, independence and
expertise of the external appraisers; assessing the methodologies used and the appropriateness of the key
assumptions based on their knowledge of the property industry; using auditor’s experts in valuation of real
estate to assess the appropriateness of the estimates used; and checking on a sample basis, the appropriateness
of the inputs, by reconciling them to contracts and rent roll data. PwC noted that investment property related
data and the key valuation assumptions were supported by available evidence. PwC also assessed the
appropriateness of the disclosures relating to the assumptions. For more information reference is made to the

NEPI ROCKCASTLE SIGNS A E175 MILLION ESG-LINKED SYNDICATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY


On 16 December 2019, NEPI Rockcastle's wholly-owned subsidiary, NE Property BV, signed a E175 million
three-year unsecured revolving credit facility (""RCF"") with two one-year extension options. The facility includes
a non-committed accordion clause that allows the increase of the facility size by up to an additional E150 million.

The RCF also includes an environmental, social and corporate governance (""ESG"") pricing mechanism linking the
margin of the RCF to NEPI Rockcastle's ESG risk rating score. Should the ESG risk rating score increase, the
margin of the RCF will increase, and vice versa.

NEPI Rockcastle's ESG rating has been assessed by Sustainalytics, a leading independent ESG and corporate
governance research provider, ratings and analytics firm that supports investors around the world with the
development and implementation of responsible investment strategies. ESG Risk Rating data licensed by
Sustainalytics may be used as part of the process of setting an interest rate by a lender. The ESG Risk Rating and
Report produced by Sustainalytics is intended for use in the overall assessment of the borrower, being at the sole
discretion of the lenders.

The RCF is to be used for general corporate purposes and has been provided by a syndicate of four banks: Citibank,
Deutsche Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, where Deutsche Bank acted as coordinator, facility agent and
sustainability agent.

In 2018 NEPI Rockcastle extended its existing revolving credit facilities to the amount of E400 million with BRD
- Group Societe Generale, Garanti BBVA International NV, Garanti BBVA Romania, ING Bank NV Amsterdam,
Bucharest Branch, Raiffeisen Bank International and Societe Generale.

This new RCF increases NEPI Rockcastle's total unsecured revolving financing capacity to E575 million, all of
which is currently available for drawdown. The Company enjoys a comfortable liquidity level, according to its
prudent financial policy, allowing it to further invest in its acquisitions and development pipeline.

""We are delighted to put in place this liquidity facility which will strengthen our position while NEPI Rockcastle
continues to grow. The linking of our sustainability scores to our cost of capital demonstrates NEPI Rockcastle's
strong commitment towards ensuring our robust Environmental, Social and Governance practices"" said Mirela
Covasa, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of NEPI Rockcastle.
