Important notice
Shareholders should take note that, pursuant to a provision of the MultiChoice memorandum of
incorporation, MultiChoice is permitted to reduce the voting rights of shares in MultiChoice (including
MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the American Depositary Share (""ADS"") facility) so that the
aggregate voting power of MultiChoice shares that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to
South Africa (as envisaged in the MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation) will not exceed 20% of the
total voting power in MultiChoice. This is to ensure compliance with certain statutory requirements
applicable to South Africa. For this purpose, MultiChoice will presume in particular that:

   •   all MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the MultiChoice ADS facility are owned or held by
       foreigners to South Africa, regardless of the actual nationality of the MultiChoice ADS holder; and
   •   all shareholders with an address outside of South Africa on the register of MultiChoice will be
       deemed to be foreigners to South Africa, irrespective of their actual nationality or domicilium,
       unless such shareholder can provide proof, to the satisfaction of the MultiChoice board, that it
       should not be deemed to be a foreigner to South Africa, as envisaged in article 40.1.3 of the
       MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation.

Shareholders are referred to the provisions of the MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation available

REVIEWED INTERIM RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT
Condensed consolidated interim financial results for the period ended 30 September 2020

EXECUTIVE REVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE
MULTICHOICE GROUP (MCG OR THE GROUP) DELIVERED RESILIENT RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020
The group added 1.2m 90-day active subscribers year on year (YoY) to close the period ended 30 September 2020 (1H FY21) on 
20.1m households and exceeds the 20m subscriber milestone for the first time. This represents growth of 6% YoY, similar to the 
prior year, as increased consumer demand for video entertainment services and an easing of electricity shortages in southern 
Africa were offset by rising consumer pressure in many markets. The 90-day subscriber base is split between 11.4m households 
(57%) in the Rest of Africa and 8.7m (43%) in South Africa.    

Revenue increased 2% (-1% organic) to ZAR26.1bn, with subscription revenues of ZAR22.2bn increasing a solid 5% (3% organic) 
YoY. Top-line momentum was significantly impacted by COVID-19 in the following areas:
- Advertising revenue declined ZAR0.6bn YoY, mainly due to a lack of sport advertising and a generally softer advertising market 
  as a result of lower economic activity. This has, however, returned to nearly pre-COVID-19 levels in the months of August 
  and September.
- Commercial subscriptions were ZAR0.3bn lower than the prior period with hotels, restaurants and other commercial customers 
  largely closed during lockdowns. Although business in the hospitality industry has resumed in recent months, it is expected 
  to take some time to fully normalise.
  
Group trading profit rose 19% to ZAR5.7bn (38% organic), benefitting from a ZAR0.5bn (ZAR1.2bn organic) reduction in losses 
in the Rest of Africa and a resilient performance in South Africa. The trading profit impact of COVID-19 was largely neutral, 
as the ZAR0.9bn revenue loss mentioned above was offset by ZAR0.8bn in delayed content costs.

A strong focus on cost reduction allowed for a further ZAR1bn in costs being eliminated from the base during the period. 
Overall costs decreased 2% compared to the prior period (-9% organic) and resulted in the group maintaining its target of 
delivering positive operating leverage by keeping the growth rate in costs below that of revenue growth.

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 41% on the prior period at ZAR2.7bn. 
The strong earnings growth was attributable to the improvement in trading profit and lower realised foreign exchange losses.

Consolidated free cash flow of ZAR2.1bn was down 13% compared to the prior period. This was mainly due to the end of a 
contractual agreement on the southern Africa transponder lease whereby an upfront prepayment reduced lease payments for the 
first 36 months of the lease term, together with current period foreign exchange movements (ZAR0.5bn), as well as an increase 
in capital expenditure related to a multiyear investment programme to futureproof the group's customer service, billing and 
data capabilities (ZAR0.4bn).

The group continued its strategic focus of investing in local content and produced 1 870 additional hours, despite
disruptions caused by strict early COVID-19 lockdown measures. As a result, the total local content library is now nearing
59 000 hours.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, the group paid direct cash taxes of ZAR2.0bn, slightly more than the prior
year due to higher profitability.

Net interest paid increased to ZAR252m, primarily as a result of the translation of interest on USD transponder lease
liabilities at a weaker ZAR:USD exchange rate.

The strength of the balance sheet is critically important given the uncertain longer-term economic impact of COVID-19
and potential challenges for certain markets in the Rest of Africa as a result of a lower oil price. Some ZAR9.0bn in
net assets, including ZAR7.3bn in cash and cash equivalents, combined with ZAR4.5bn in undrawn facilities, provide
ZAR11.8bn in financial flexibility to fund the group's operations. This strong financial position is after ZAR4bn was 
utilised to settle the MCG and Phuthuma Nathi dividends in September.

The group operates in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have a
notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the Rest of Africa where revenues are
earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. Where relevant in this short-form
announcement, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency, as well as acquisitions and
disposals to better reflect underlying trends. These adjustments are quoted in brackets as organic, after the equivalent
metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These measures constitute pro forma financial
information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form announcement.

Dividend
No dividend has been declared based on the interim results.

(""MultiChoice"" or ""the Company"")

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its condensed consolidated
interim financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2020 (""current period"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
The board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two most appropriate indicators of the
operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to the group’s interim financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (“prior period”), the
group expects core headline earnings per share for the current period to be between 40% (175 ZAR cents) and 45%
(197 ZAR cents) higher than the prior period’s reported 437 ZAR cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 15% (R0.7bn) and 20% (R1.0bn) higher than the prior period’s reported
R4.8bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding M&A) trading profit is
expected to be between 35% (R1.7bn) and 40% (R1.9bn) higher than the prior period’s reported R4.8bn.

The improved financial performance for the current period was achieved despite continued macro-economic
headwinds across the continent, including the impact of COVID-19 which especially depressed advertising revenues
and commercial subscription revenues. The timing of content costs and a strong focus on overall cost reduction
allowed the group to drive a further reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa segment, which has been the largest
contributor to the improvement in group performance.

Core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro forma financial information in terms of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its pro forma nature, may not fairly present the
group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated
by adjusting headline earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of
intangible assets arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business
Combinations; c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses;
e) certain fair-value adjustments under IFRS; f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts; g) non-recurring
empowerment transactions and h) acquisition-related costs. Organic trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign
currency movements and changes in the composition of the group.

Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
Compared to the prior period, the group expects earnings per share for the current period to be between 68% ( 230
ZAR cents) and 74% (250 ZAR cents) higher than the prior period´s reported earnings per share of 336 ZAR cents.

Headline earnings per share for the current period is expected to be between 65% (220 ZAR cents) and 70% (240
ZAR cents) higher than the prior period´s reported headline earnings per share of 341 ZAR cents. The key reasons
for the movements are an improvement in trading performance and lower realised foreign exchange losses due to
more favourable forward exchange contracts maturing.

Further details will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim financial results, due to be released on the
Stock Exchange news service on 12 November 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

Annual results announcement

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAIDEN CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

EXECUTIVE REVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE
MultiChoice Group (MCG or the group) delivered solid results for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Despite global and country-specific macroeconomic challenges, the group added 0.9m 90-day active subscribers to reach 
19.5m households as at 31 March 2020 (FY20). This represents growth of 5% year on year (YoY), which is somewhat lower 
compared to the prior year due to rising consumer pressure in many markets, drought-related electricity shortages in 
southern Africa, and the fact that last year's growth benefited from specific one-off events such as the FIFA World Cup 
which did not recur this year.     

Revenue increased 3% (2% organic) to ZAR51.4bn and included subscription revenue of ZAR42.8bn, which increased 4% 
(3% organic) YoY. Top line momentum was affected by modest subscriber growth due to macro-headwinds in certain markets, 
the group's strategic decision not to increase Premium prices in South Africa and a reduction in sub-licence revenues 
from the South African public broadcaster. This was offset by an increased contribution of 12% (4% organic) by the 
technology business, Irdeto.             

Group trading profit rose 14% to ZAR8.0bn (29% organic), benefiting from a ZAR0.8bn (ZAR1.8bn organic) reduction in 
losses in the Rest of Africa. A strong focus on cost containment allowed for a further ZAR1.4bn in costs to be 
eliminated from the base during the year. Overall costs were contained to a 1% increase compared to the prior year 
(-3% organic) and resulted in positive operating leverage, with the group achieving its target of keeping the growth 
rate in costs below that of revenue growth.      

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 38% on the prior year at 
ZAR2.5bn, despite the impact of the additional 5% share in SA being allocated to Phuthuma Nathi (PN) in March 2019.
Excluding this once-off change in the South African non-controlling interest, core headline earnings would have 
grown 57% YoY.

Consolidated free cash flow of ZAR5.2bn was up 59% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by an improvement in 
the trading result from the Rest of Africa and a reduction in working capital.

The board recommends that a maiden annual gross dividend be declared at 565 SA cents per listed ordinary 
share (ZAR2.5bn).

The group remains fully committed to broad-based black economic empowerment and transformation. In line with
prior commitments, an offer was made to PN shareholders on 25 September 2019, to exchange up to 20% of their
PN shares for shares in the MultiChoice Group. The offer closed on 28 October 2019 and resulted in 3.7m shares
being issued to PN shareholders, while the group acquired 3.8m shares in PN in return. Following the
conclusion of this share swap, the group's overall interest in MultiChoice South Africa increased from 75.0% 
to 76.4%.

The group continued its strategic focus of investing in local content, increasing the library of hours
available by 8%. As a result, the total local content library now exceeds 56 800 hours.

Capital expenditure of ZAR0.8bn was slightly down on the prior year and included a ZAR0.2bn investment as
part of a multi-year programme to futureproof the group's customer service, billing and data capabilities.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, the group paid direct cash taxes of ZAR4.0bn, slightly higher
than the prior year driven by higher profitability.

The strength of the balance sheet is critically important given the uncertain economic impact of COVID-19
and the lower oil price. Some ZAR9.8bn in net assets, including ZAR9.1bn of cash and cash equivalents, combined
with ZAR5bn in undrawn facilities, provides ZAR14.1bn in financial flexibility to fund the business. This
strong financial position is after spending ZAR1.7bn on share buy-backs (including ZAR0.7bn to fund the MCG
restricted share plan) and ZAR1.5bn to settle the FY19 PN dividend during the year.

We operate in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have
a notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the RoA where revenues are
earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. Where relevant in this
short-form announcement, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency, as well 
as acquisitions and disposals to better reflect underlying trends. These adjustments (non-IFRS performance
measures) are quoted in brackets as organic, after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). These non-IFRS performance measures constitute pro forma financial information in 
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form
announcement.

Dividend declaration
The board recommends that a maiden annual gross dividend be declared at 565 SA cents per listed ordinary
share (ZAR2.5bn). This dividend declaration is subject to approval of the MultiChoice South Africa Holdings
Proprietary Limited (MCSAH) dividend at their annual general meeting on Wednesday, 26 August 2020. The 
finalisation date for the dividend declaration by the company will be Thursday, 27 August 2020. Subject to the
aforementioned MCSAH approval, dividends will be payable to the company's shareholders recorded in the register 
on the record date, being Friday, 11 September 2020. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday, 
8 September 2020 (shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 9 September 2020). Share certificates may not be
dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 9 September 2020 and Friday, 11 September 2020, both dates 
inclusive. The dividend payment date will be Monday, 14 September 2020. The dividend will be declared from income. 
It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, yielding a net dividend of 452 SA cents per listed ordinary
share to those shareholders not exempt from paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 113 SA cents per listed
ordinary share. The issued ordinary share capital as at 10 June 2020 was 442.5m ordinary shares (including 15.6m
shares held in treasury). The company's income tax reference number is 9485006192.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its consolidated annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 (""FY20"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
The board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two most appropriate indicators of the
operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to results for the year ended 31 March 2019 (""prior year""), the group expects core headline earnings per
share for FY20 to be between 35% (144 ZAR cents) and 40% (164 ZAR cents) higher than the prior year´s 410 ZAR
cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 10% (R0.7bn) and 15% (R1.1bn) higher than the prior year´s
R7.0bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding any M&A) trading profit is
expected to be between 25% (R1.8bn) and 30% (R2.1bn) higher than the prior year's reported R7.0bn.

The improved financial performance for FY20 was achieved despite continued macro-economic headwinds across
the continent. Management focus on cost containment allowed the business to offset these challenges and drive a
further reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa segment, which has been the largest contributor to the improvement in
group performance.

Core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro-forma financial information in terms of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its pro forma nature, may not fairly present the
group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated
by adjusting headline earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of
intangible assets arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business
Combinations; c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses; e)
certain fair-value adjustments under IFRS; f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts; g) non-recurring
empowerment transactions and h) acquisition-related costs. Organic trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign
currency movements and/changes in the composition of the group.

Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
Compared to the prior year, the group expects earnings per share for FY20 to be between 470 ZAR cents and 510
ZAR cents higher than the prior year´s loss per share of 374 ZAR cents.

Headline earnings per share for FY20 is expected to be between 460 ZAR cents and 500 ZAR cents higher than the
prior year´s headline loss per share of 353 ZAR cents. The key reasons for the movements are:

a)   an improvement in trading performance;
b)   the non-recurring empowerment transaction cost which was incurred in the prior year;
c)   higher unrealised foreign exchange losses due to weaker local currencies, primarily the South African Rand.

Further details will be provided in the consolidated annual financial results, due to be released on SENS on 10 June
2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

Important notice

Shareholders should take note that, pursuant to a provision of the MultiChoice memorandum of
incorporation, MultiChoice is permitted to reduce the voting rights of shares in MultiChoice (including
MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the American Depositary Share (""ADS"") facility) so that the
aggregate voting power of MultiChoice shares that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to
