DIVESTMENT BY SASOL CHEMICALS NORTH AMERICA LLC OF ITS 50% EQUITY INTEREST IN
GEMINI HDPE LLC

The board of directors of Sasol is pleased to announce that Sasol Chemicals North America LLC
(“SCNA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sasol, has agreed principle terms with INEOS Gemini HDPE
Holding Company LLC (“INEOS”) and a new entity to be formed by INEOS (“Newco”) to sell its 50%
membership interest in Gemini HDPE LLC (“Gemini”) to Newco (the “Sale”) for USD404 million
(subject to adjustment for cash, debt, working capital and other items ). Gemini produces and sells
bimodal high-density polyethylene based in La Porte, Texas, United States of America.

The Sale represents a further step in achieving Sasol’s strategic and financial objectives by accelerating
the focus on specialty chemicals and reducing net debt. Proceeds from the transaction will be used by
Sasol to repay near-term debt obligations.

Concurrent with the closing, the Company will have completed the restructuring of its existing debt
facilities and the security package in respect thereof, resulting in Sasol and its subsidiaries being
released from any existing security being provided in relation to Gemini (the “Refinancing”).

The representations and warranties being given by SCNA are general corporate representations and
warranties.

As disclosed in the Sasol financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by the
Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., the value of the net assets relevant to the sale is
USD 176 million (approximately R3 billion) as at 30 June 2020, which is net of the debt facilities
associated with the interest. The loss attributable to the net assets was USD 18 million (approximately
R290 million) for the year ended 30 June 2020.

The Sale between SCNA, INEOS and Newco will only be effective upon restructuring of the existing
debt facilities and the Company’s security package in respect thereof. Closing is anticipated to occur
by 31 December 2020.

The Sale is classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listing Requirements of the JSE.

SASOL BOARD COMMITS TO A 20% SACRIFICE ON NON-EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR BOARD FEES PROPOSED TO SHAREHOLDERS AT 2020 ANNUAL
GENERAL MEETING

In Sasol’s notice of the annual general meeting (AGM) scheduled for 20 November
2020, Sasol included, as special resolution number 1, a proposal to enable it to pay
the same fees to its non-executive directors (NEDs) from 20 November 2020 as
approved by shareholders at Sasol’s 2018 AGM. Without the approval of such
special resolution, the Company cannot pay any remuneration to the NEDs for their
services to the Company as its directors.

In view of the significant challenges still facing Sasol and in acknowledgement of the
erosion of shareholder value over the past two years, the Board has agreed to
commit to a sacrifice of 20% on the Board fees proposed for approval at the 2020
AGM. This fee sacrifice shall remain in place until a revised fee proposal is
considered by shareholders at Sasol’s 2021 AGM. The 20% fee sacrifice will apply to
the Chairman fee and the Board fee as set out more fully in special resolution 1 in
Sasol’s 2020 notice of AGM.

The Remuneration Committee will ensure that a review of the fees payable to NEDs
is carried out with the objective of ensuring that a new resolution on Board fees is
proposed to shareholders at the 2021 AGM.

previously communicated guidance of US$12,8 billion.

The LDPE unit, which uses ExxonMobil technology, has a nameplate capacity of 420 kilotons
per annum, making it one of the largest of its kind in the world. The LDPE unit is one of the
three LCCP plants that will form part of the Sasol/LyondellBasell Louisiana Integrated
Polyethylene joint venture. Production from the LDPE unit is an important milestone to ensure
the JV will be enabled to make a meaningful expansion into the U.S. polymers production
market.

All units which were operating prior to Hurricane Laura have returned to operation, with no
further operational impact from Hurricane Zeta.

LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX (LCCC) STATUS UPDATE, PRODUCTION
AND SALES METRICS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX (LCCC) STATUS UPDATE

On 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall near Sasol´s Lake Charles
Chemicals Complex (including Lake Charles Chemicals Project) in Southwest
Louisiana. Sasol was making significant progress towards a restart of the LCCC
facilities, which had to be suspended as a precautionary measure due to Hurricane
Delta. Hurricane Delta made landfall on 9 October 2020.

Preliminary assessments indicated no further damage caused by Hurricane Delta, and
we are also pleased to report that our employees have safely resumed their duties . The
availability of sufficient industrial-level power from the local provider has resulted in the
commencement of a coordinated startup of the complex. The impact of Hurricane
Laura on the total net saleable tons of our North American Operations was
approximately 170 kilotons in quarter one of financial year 2021.

Seven chemical manufacturing units have returned to operation and all remaining units
which were operating prior to Hurricane Laura are expected to return to operation by
end October 2020. Commissioning activities of our Low Density Polyethylene unit have
resumed, and beneficial operation is still trending towards end October 2020.

Sasol will continue to support its employees and the local community impacted by the
hurricanes with relevant resources and assistance.

DIVESTMENT OF A 50% INTEREST IN SASOL’S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP)
BASE CHEMICALS BUSINESS AND THE CREATION OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH
LYONDELLBASELL

1.   Introduction and background

     The shareholders of Sasol (“Sasol Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement made at our
     November 2017 Capital Markets Day relating to our portfolio optimisation programme. Further Stock
     Exchange News Service (“SENS”) announcements released by the Company on 17 March and 18
     June 2020 confirmed our strategic ambition to focus on our Performance Chemicals business. In the
     March 2020 announcement Sasol set out its response plan, which included decisive action to reduce
     Sasol’s debt and an intention to reset Sasol’s strategy to improve long-term shareholder returns in a
     lower oil price environment. The June 2020 SENS announcement outlined the updated strategy
     (“Future Sasol Strategy”), a key part of which is to increase focus on specialty chemicals.

     As an integral part of the response plan and consistent with the Future Sasol Strategy, the Company
     has been assessing partnering options for its US base chemicals assets, situated at Sasol’s Lake
     Charles property in Louisiana. An extensive competitive process was followed to identify an
     appropriate partner that will enhance the benefits to be gained from the substantial investment in Lake
     Charles. Accordingly, Sasol Chemicals USA LLC (“Sasol Chemicals”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
     Sasol, has now entered into a suite of agreements and term sheets (“Transaction Agreements”) with
     a subsidiary and an affiliate of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (“LyondellBasell”) the effect of which is
     the disposal of a 50% interest in the LCCP Base Chemicals Business (as defined below) and the
     portion of the Lake Charles property from which it operates (“the Sale Land”), for a purchase
     consideration of US$2 billion (subject to closing adjustments) and the creation of a 50/50 joint venture
     in relation to those assets (together, with the other indivisible elements referred to in the Transaction
     Agreements, the “Transaction”).

     Further high level details of the Transaction are set out below. The Transaction constitutes a Category
     1 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and, as such, requires the approval of more
     than 50% of the votes of the Sasol Shareholders present and voting at the general meeting. A circular
     will therefore be delivered to Sasol Shareholders in due course with full details of the Transaction.

     The Transaction will represent a significant step towards achieving Sasol’s strategic and financial
     objectives by materially reducing net debt, and catalysing a rapid shift towards the Future Sasol
     Strategy. The LCCP assets within Sasol’s US Performance Chemicals Business (as more fully
     described below) including the new Ziegler alcohol plant, ethylene oxide and derivatives plants, and
     the Guerbet alcohol plant, will be retained by Sasol. Sasol will also continue to have an integrated, low
     cost ethylene value chain at Lake Charles which will enable it to protect the profitability of the
     performance chemicals business. Following the Transaction, Sasol will continue to realise the core
     strategic and financial benefits of its capital investment in the LCCP.

2.   The Transaction

     Transaction structure

     The Transaction will result in the creation of a 50/50 joint venture with LyondellBasell in relation to the
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business and the associated land. Sasol will retain ownership and
     operatorship of the US Performance Chemicals Business, the other legacy base chemicals assets at
     Lake Charles, and the remainder of the Lake Charles property.

     This will be delivered pursuant to the Transaction agreements, through which Sasol Chemicals will
     dispose of a 50% stake in Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene JV, LLC (“LIP”), a newly incorporated
     subsidiary of Sasol Chemicals to LyondellBasell LC Offtake LLC, a subsidiary of LyondellBasell. The
     purchase consideration will be US$2 billion, subject to customary and ad hoc transaction-specific
     closing adjustments which are not, in aggregate, expected to be material. LIP will hold Sasol’s LCCP
     Base Chemicals Business, as well as the Sale Land. Equistar Chemicals LP, an affiliate of
     LyondellBasell, will be the operator of the business of LIP.

     The Transaction Agreements contain customary representations and warranties from Sasol
     Chemicals and LyondellBasell. If the Transaction is terminated due to, inter alia, breach by Sasol
     Chemicals, or failure to obtain Sasol Shareholder approval of the Transaction, and at any time during
     the six months following the date of such termination, Sasol Chemicals or any of its affiliates enters
     into an alternative transaction with a third party, there will be a break fee payable by Sasol Chemicals
     of US$40 million.

     Transaction scope

     Sasol’s LCCP Base Chemicals Business comprises the manufacture of ethylene and polyethylene
     products using the following assets at the Lake Charles property, and the marketing and sale of these
     products (together the “LCCP Base Chemicals Business”):

     -   The recently constructed ethane cracker, which produces ethylene from ethane feedstock and has
         a capacity of 1540 kilotons per annum (“LCCP Cracker”);
     -   The low density polyethylene (“LDPE”) plant, which has a production capacity of 420 kilotons per
         annum; and
     -   The linear low density polyethylene (“LLDPE”) plant, which has a capacity of 471 kilotons per
         annum).

     The LCCP Base Chemicals Business excludes the original ethane cracker, which has a production
     capacity of 460 kilotons of ethylene per annum (“Original Cracker”). This will be retained by Sasol
     together with the US Performance Chemicals Business, consisting of –

     -   the ethylene oxide value chain which consists of a new 300 kilotons per annum ethylene oxide
         unit and a new 100 kilotons per annum ethoxylation unit;
     -   the new Ziegler alcohol unit (140 kilotons per annum) which supplements the existing Ziegler unit
         (at the Lake Charles property;
     -   the new alumina unit (32 kilotons per annum) which supplements an existing alumina unit at the
         Lake Charles property;
     -   the new Guerbet alcohols (30 kilotons per annum) unit; and
     -   other Performance Chemicals units include a tetramerization unit producing 1-hexene and 1-
         octene, a linear alkyl benzene unit, paraffin extraction unit, and the hydrogenation unit producing
         LPA solvent.

     LIP will, pursuant to tolling arrangements set out in term sheets entered into as part of the Transaction
     Agreements, convert ethane feedstock into ethylene, and also convert ethylene into LDPE and
     LLDPE. Sasol will continue to use its 50% attributable share of ethylene production, together with
     ethylene produced by the Original Cracker, as feedstock for its US Performance Chemicals Business
     and its Gemini HDPE joint venture. Sasol will thereby preserve the benefit of ethylene producer
     economics for its retained business, and the ability to realise any further upside growth opportunities
     in future.

     Transaction timing

     It is expected that the Transaction will be implemented before the end of calendar year 2020
     (“Effective Date”), when the conditions precedent are expected to be fulfilled and the adjusted
     purchase consideration will be received by Sasol Chemicals in cash.

3.   The Partners

     The LyondellBasell group is one of the leading global producers of plastics, chemicals and refined
     products. The LyondellBasell group operates 22 olefins and polyolefins facilities globally with capacity
     to produce approximately 7.6 million tons per annum of ethylene, 5.3 million tons per annum of
     polyethylene and 5.5 million tons per annum of polypropylene as of December 2019. The majority of
     these production facilities are in North America. As of December 2019, and based on published
     capacity data, the LyondellBasell group ranked as the third largest producer of ethylene in North
     America, fourth largest producer of polyethylene in North America, and the largest producer of
     polyethylene in Europe.

     The partnership will provide substantial benefits to Sasol due to the partners’ recognised excellence
     in cost-effective operation of these type of facilities, their recognised track record in maximising upside
     potential and access to their extensive distribution network and customer base.

4.   Rationale

     The Transaction was agreed following a competitive process in which Sasol explored a number of
     potential constructs in order to determine which would realise the most value whilst protecting Sasol’s
     long-term strategic priorities. The intention was to generate significant proceeds to apply towards
     outstanding debt, while enhancing the benefits to be gained from the substantial investment in Lake
     Charles by partnering with a company with world class capabilities in commodity chemicals in the
     industry. Through this process it became clear that the proposal that offered the best combination of
     upfront and long-term value was that offered by the LyondellBasell group. Sasol believes that the
     Transaction has the following compelling benefits for its shareholders:

     -   Accelerated delivery on strategic objectives: Sasol will continue to have full ownership and
         operatorship of the US Performance Chemicals Business as well as the legacy base chemicals
         business, which helps provide an integrated value chain. This is consistent with the Future Sasol
         Strategy of increased focus on a global specialty chemicals portfolio. This portfolio has well-
         established capabilities and potential for long-term growth in a number of product categories
         including Ziegler and Guerbet alcohols, in which Sasol already has a strong market position. Such
         specialty chemicals products are expected to have a more resilient long-term demand outlook and
         higher return on investment than commodity chemicals;

     -   Reduced leverage: The Transaction is a critical part of Sasol’s response plan to reduce net debt,
         improve debt covenant compliance and enhance liquidity. As a result of this Transaction, net debt
         before lease liabilities, is expected to reduce materially from approximately US$10 billion to
         approximately US$8 billion, significantly improving Sasol’s financial position. Together with
         proceeds from other transactions, net debt will reduce by close to US$3 billion;
     -   Integrated value chain retained: The US Performance Chemicals Business will benefit from
         Sasol’s share of low cost onsite ethylene from the joint venture, and all ethylene from the Original
         Cracker. This access to low cost ethylene feedstock, as well as the original market and feedstock
         advantages of the investment in the LCCP, will help protect the profitability of the US Performance
         Chemicals Business;

     -   Well defined partnership with a proven operator: Sasol will continue to have substantial
         participation in the business as a joint venture partner. Clearly defined governance and onsite
         partnership arrangements with a world-class group that has significant global ethylene and
         polyethylene production expertise should create a strong platform for a highly productive
         relationship;

     -   Upside participation: The Transaction delivers immediate strategic and financial benefits, and
         Sasol will also continue to benefit from the ongoing value creation from the LCCP Base Chemicals
         Business, including the upside when the macroeconomic environment improves; and

     -   Growth optionality: Sasol will retain ownership of the remainder of the Lake Charles property and
         will be able to utilise vacant land to develop further facilities on the Lake Charles property. This
         provides Sasol with a solid base to grow its US Performance Chemicals Business. Sasol will also
         be able to secure further ethylene feedstock from future expansions (debottlenecking) of the LCCP
         Cracker to enable future growth of its US Performance Chemicals Business.

5.       Conditions precedent to the Transaction

         The Transaction is subject to the fulfilment of customary conditions precedent, by no later than 31
         March 2021, including:

     -       Approval by Sasol Shareholders of the ordinary resolutions necessary in order to implement the
             Transaction;
     -       Obtaining competition / anti-trust approvals in various jurisdictions; and
     -       Obtaining the consents or waivers of any person to enable the Transaction to be implemented, in
             particular consents required from key technology licence providers.

6.       Use of the Transaction proceeds and balance sheet outlook

         As outlined above, implementation of the Transaction will represent a significant step forward in
         delivering the Company’s response plan announced on 17 March 2020. Proceeds from this
         Transaction, in conjunction with proceeds from previously announced transactions and the progress
         in achieving short term cash savings measures, will make a meaningful and positive impact on Sasol’s
         financial prospects, principally as a result of the intended use of the Transaction proceeds to reduce
         Sasol’s debt. .

         Notwithstanding this progress, the Company continues to work towards a rights offer of up to
         US$2 billion in the second half of the 2021 financial year as the final step of the response plan. This,
         if implemented, would allow Sasol to operate sustainably within its covenant thresholds and so deliver
         on the Future Sasol Strategy. The amount to be raised in any rights offer and its timing remain subject
         to prevailing operating and market conditions as well as other initiatives, such as further disposals,
         that Sasol may implement. Any equity raising will also be aligned with the outlook for the Company
         under the Future Sasol Strategy. In light of the extended period before any rights offer takes place,
         the Company has terminated the standby underwriting arrangements that were put in place in March
         2020.

7.   Historical Financial information (unaudited)

     The value of the assets (fixed assets and working capital) comprising the LCCP Base Chemicals
     Business as at 30 June 2020, being the date of the last published financial information of Sasol, was
     R67,6 billion (US$3,9 billion). The loss attributable to the LCCP Base Chemicals Business for the year
     ended 30 June 2020 was R36,1 billion (US$2,3 billion).

     The historical financial information was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
     Standards and Interpretations of those standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards
     Board. The historical financial information and pro forma financial effects of the Disposal will be detailed
     in the Circular to Sasol Shareholders.

8.    Volume outlook

     Following the transaction the ownership and anticipated steady state production volumes of the
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business will be as follows:

       Production                       Future ownership        Steady state3 volumes

                                                                 [kilotons per annum]

     (1) Includes LDPE and LLDPE.
     (2) Sasol will have 50% of LIP volumes from the time at which the Disposal has been completed and the joint
         venture has been formed.
     (3) Steady-state volumes indicated are before any potential capacity upside from debottlenecking opportunities.

     As a result of the impact of Hurricane Laura there remains uncertainty about the near term outlook at
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business. A further update and additional outlook guidance for
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business will be provided upon release of the first quarter financial year 2021
     Business Performance Metrics results, scheduled for later in October 2020.

9.    Circular to Shareholders

      A circular containing full details of the Transaction and the proposed resolutions will be delivered to
      Sasol Shareholders with a notice of general meeting scheduled to be held on 20 November 2020.

10. Withdrawal of cautionary announcement

      Sasol Shareholders are referred to the Company’s cautionary announcement dated 17 March 2020,
      as well as the subsequent cautionary announcements, and are advised that full particulars regarding
      the disposals and the timing of the rights issue referred to in those announcements have been
     provided, caution is no longer required to be exercised by Sasol Shareholders when dealing in the
     Company’s securities.

Sasol Lake Charles Chemical Complex update

Hurricane Laura made landfall on 27 August 2020 near Sasol’s Lake Charles Chemical
Complex in Southwest Louisiana, and is one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit the
United States. Significant property and utility infrastructure damage has been experienced
across the region.

Sasol’s more than 800 Lake Charles employees are safe; however, hundreds of employees
have suffered significant damage to their homes and remain in temporary housing while utility
restoration and repair work is in progress. Sasol is assisting employees with home preservation,
essential supplies and financial aid. In addition Sasol is supporting the local authorities, utility
partners and citizen groups in community and infrastructure recovery efforts.

Sasol has completed damage assessments of the complex’s 14 manufacturing facilities and
associated utilities and infrastructure. While there was moderate wind damage to cooling towers
and some insulation and building damage, there is no apparent damage to major process
equipment, utilities or infrastructure. This will need to be confirmed once site electrical power is
completely restored and all systems are tested.

Removal of debris, repair work and startup planning continue on the site. Regular employee
work shifts have resumed, and several hundred contractors are working on site to expedite
readiness for startup.

The critical path for operational restart is the re-establishment of reliable external electrical
power service from Entergy, the regional power provider. The Sasol Lake Charles site is
currently partially energized. Entergy expects full load service, industrial-level reliability power,
to be available to Sasol and other industrial customers in the area by early-to-mid October.

Some site utility systems are currently online, with startup of the remaining utilities planned
before reliable power is enabled. Once Entergy declares reliable, full load power is restored,
Sasol will activate a coordinated startup of the site’s two ethane crackers, and derivative units.

The low-density polyethylene unit, the last of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project units to come
online, did not experience any significant storm impacts and commissioning activities have
resumed. The unit’s beneficial operation sequence will be initiated once the site is fully
energized.

Sasol has Atlantic Named Wind Storm (ANWS) insurance coverage for units under construction
as well as operating units.

Sasol’s progress toward securing a partner in its U.S. Base Chemicals business is far
advanced, and was not impacted by Hurricane Laura.

DISPOSAL OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BUSINESS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED

Introduction

Sasol refers its shareholders to the Stock Exchange News Service announcement of
29 July 2020, which informed the market that Sasol South Africa Limited (“SSA”), a
major subsidiary of Sasol, had signed an exclusive negotiation agreement with Air
Liquide Large Industries South Africa Proprietary Limited (“Air Liquide”) for the sale
of SSA’s sixteen air separations units and associated business located in Secunda.

Sasol is pleased to announce that negotiations with Air Liquide have been concluded
and a sale of business agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) has been entered into,
under which SSA shall dispose of its air separation business located in Secunda, (“the
Business”) to Air Liquide (“the Transaction”) subject to the suspensive conditions
outlined below.

Air Liquide is a world leader in gases, technologies and related services, and operates
in 80 countries with approximately 67 000 employees. Air Liquide has provided
technical and engineering support to Sasol in Secunda since 1979.

Description of the Business

The Business comprises the sixteen air separation units (“ASUs”), and related assets
with a combined capacity of up to 42 000 tons of oxygen per day, that provide oxygen
for Sasol’s fuels and chemical production processes in Secunda. The ASUs produce
various other gases utilised at Secunda, and rare gases sold externally. Employees
related to the Business will transfer to Air Liquide as part of the arrangement.

Subsequent to the Transaction, Air Liquide will supply various gases to SSA’s
operations under a long-term gas supply agreement (“Gas Supply Agreement”) with
an initial term of 15 years. It is anticipated that Air Liquide’s expertise would allow, in
coordination with Sasol, a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
associated with oxygen production over time.

In addition to the Sale Agreement and the Gas Supply Agreement, SSA and Air Liquide
(“the Parties”) have also concluded various ancillary service, lease and like
agreements (collectively “the Transaction Documents”). This includes an agreement
for Sasol to sell key utilities to Air Liquide, to enable continuous gas production.

Rationale for the Transaction
This Transaction forms part of Sasol’s expanded and accelerated divestment
programme announced on 17 March 2020. Sasol has identified the operation of the
ASUs and associated business by a third-party expert as an opportunity to deliver
upfront cash proceeds whilst also contributing to Sasol’s objectives of improved
efficiency and decarbonisation at the Secunda site.

Air Liquide has significant expertise in operating industrial-scale ASUs worldwide and
is expected to utilise this experience to deliver efficiency and reliability benefits for
Sasol. Air Liquide will work closely with Sasol to continue to leverage Sasol’s broad
expertise in site operations and optimally managing the integrated value chain. As Air
Liquide already owns the seventeenth ASU on the Secunda site, it is expected that
ownership and operations of the full air separation fleet will provide further gains in
operational efficiency. Improvements will be driven by a variety of factors including
advanced application of technology and technical ability, and potential future capital
investments by Air Liquide. It is expected that these improvements will position the
ASUs for more efficient operations under a rapidly evolving future environmental
landscape. Air Liquide will collaborate with Sasol in the development of our overall
sustainability roadmap at the Secunda site. We will provide more details on this
roadmap in the coming months.

Air Liquide will take full ownership and overall responsibility for managing the ASUs,
including all future capital and operating requirements, to maintain the agreed quantity
and quality of gases supplied to Sasol.

Total estimated capital expenditure of R8 to 12 billion would have been spent by Sasol
over the next 15 years. The ASUs require significant capital to sustain reliable
operations, as well as improved efficiencies to enable decarbonisation. This includes
an extensive restoration and sustenance program to ensure the ability to supply the
site in the longer term.

Terms of the Transaction

   a) Purchase Consideration

In terms of the Sale Agreement, the Parties have agreed that the purchase
consideration payable by Air Liquide to SSA for the Business shall be an amount of
approximately R8,5 billion (EUR148,75 million (to be settled in US Dollars at the
closing of the Transaction), plus ZAR 5,525 billion). The total amount shall be settled
in cash by Air Liquide following satisfaction of the suspensive conditions contained in
the Sale Agreement.

   b) Impact of Gas Supply Agreement (GSA)

The GSA will achieve common objectives of the parties through a long-term supply
agreement. The GSA enables the benefits of securing reliable oxygen supply for the
Secunda site into the longer term.

It is anticipated that the Transaction will result in additional cash outflow for Sasol of
approximately R650 million to R 1,2 billion per annum in real terms, over the term of
the agreement. This estimate is largely dependent on the energy efficiency benefits
which are achieved over time. Furthermore, potential further upside exists through the
joint execution of a GHG reduction roadmap.

   c) Other Significant Terms

The Sale Agreement contains warranties and indemnities which are standard for a
transaction of this nature as well as a typical material adverse change clause, which
allows Air Liquide to terminate the Sale Agreement before closing in the event that
certain defined material adverse changes occur before closing.

   d) Suspensive conditions to the Transaction

The Disposal is subject, inter alia, to the following key suspensive conditions:
    1.1. Approval by the Competition Authorities;
    1.2. Provision by Sasol Limited of a guarantee in favour of Air Liquide, as
         security for SSA’s obligations to Air Liquide under the Sale Agreement and
         selected obligations under the Gas Supply Agreement; and
    1.3. to the extent applicable, approval by the South African Reserve Bank of the
         implementation of the Sale Agreement and the Transaction Documents

     (collectively the “Suspensive Conditions”).

   e) Implementation and Effective Dates of the Transaction

The implementation and effective date of the Transaction shall fall ten business days
after the date on which the Suspensive Conditions are fulfilled or waived, as the case
may be, but will not be earlier than 1 December 2020.

Application of proceeds

The proceeds, net of associated tax obligations related to the Transaction, will be
utilised within the Sasol Group to facilitate repayment of near-term debt obligations.
Total tax obligations related to the Transaction are expected to be approximately R2,1
to R2,3 billion. The availability of the net proceeds for repayment of debt obligations
will depend on the final tax position of SSA.

Net asset value and profits attributable to the net assets of the Business

The value of the net assets of the Business was R5,6 billion at 30 June 2020. As Sasol
currently operates the ASUs internally, the only revenues which were made in relation
to the Business, related to external sales of rare gases (less than R100 million revenue
per year).

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction is classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listing
Requirements issued by the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”) and
accordingly does not require approval by the shareholders of Sasol.
Cautionary

This announcement does not serve to withdraw the cautionary announcement by the
Company on 17 August 2020 and shareholders of Sasol should accordingly continue
to exercise caution when dealing in the Company’s securities.

STATEMENT ON SASOL’S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX

On 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall near Sasol’s Lake Charles
Chemicals Complex in Southwest Louisiana.

Sasol activated its inclement weather protocols ahead of the storm at all affected Gulf
Coast locations in preparation for Hurricane Laura, with the primary concern being the
safety of our workforce, the protection of the environment and the integrity of our
facilities. Part of the response was to temporarily shut down facilities at Lake Charles,
Louisiana, as well as Greens Bayou and Winnie, Texas.

Sasol is supporting its employees in the impacted areas, assisting with temporary
housing, transportation and basic amenities for those affected by the storm.

The storm resulted in widespread electrical blackouts and other damage, preventing
Sasol from operating most utility systems. High voltage transmission line corridors
into the Lake Charles area are damaged, and the full assessment is still in progress
by a local power company. Sasol’s manufacturing facilities in Lake Charles remain
shut down.

Operations recovery crews at the Lake Charles site have started the damage
assessment process, and early reports indicate no apparent damage to process
equipment and no flooding damage experienced as a result of storm surge. The high
wind speeds caused damage to the cooling towers at the Lake Charles Chemicals
Complex.

Other Sasol manufacturing operations in the United States in Greens Bayou and
Winnie, Texas, were not impacted by the storm.

Start-up of the plants will depend on the availability of electricity, industrial gases, other
feedstocks and the restoration process. We are engaging with our customers and
suppliers regularly regarding the impacts on production.

Sasol has Atlantic Named Wind Storm (ANWS) insurance coverage for units under
construction as well as operating units.

Sasol will update the market as more certainty on the situation in Lake Charles is
obtained. We do not envisage that the hurricane will have an adverse impact on any
potential divestment transaction related to Sasol’s base chemical portfolio in the
United States.

AUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 - Short-form announcement

Earnings performance

Sasol delivered a satisfactory set of business results for the first half of the year, driven by oil prices
averaging US$62,62/bbl and a solid production performance. During the second half of the year our
earnings was severely impacted by the sudden collapse in oil prices and the economic consequences
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The combined effects of unprecedented low oil prices, destruction of demand for products and
impairments of R111,6 billion resulted in a loss of R91,3 billion for the year compared to earnings of
R6,1 billion in the prior year. Within a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, our
foundation businesses still delivered resilient results with a strong volume, cash fixed cost and working
capital performance.

The 18% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil coupled with much softer global
chemical and refining margins negatively impacted our realised gross margins especially during the
second half of the year.

The LCCP delivered an improved earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) performance in the second half of the year of approximately R100 million (US$8 million),
despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. This compares to a loss before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation (LBITDA) of R1,1 billion (US$70 million) recorded in the first
half of the year.

Earnings were further impacted by R3,9 billion in additional depreciation charges and approximately
R6,0 billion in finance charges for the year as the LCCP units reached beneficial operation.

Our Energy business's gross margin percentage decreased from 43% in the prior year to 38% due to
the significant impacts of supply and demand shocks that led to lower crude oil prices and product
differentials. We expect that oil prices will remain low for the next 12 to 18 months as the impact of
COVID-19 becomes better understood. Oil markets also continued to remain exposed to shifts in
geopolitical risks as well as supply and demand movements.

Despite experiencing softer commodity chemical prices across most of our sales regions due to weaker
global demand and increased global capacity, our Base Chemicals and Performance Chemicals
businesses, including LCCP, reported increased sales volumes of 19% and 8% respectively, and
maintained robust results on certain products, ensuring a level of resilience in our cash flows.

Total cash fixed costs for the first half of the year were trending above 10% compared to the prior
period, however, in the second half, we significantly improved our total cash fixed cost performance
resulting in the full year cost remaining flat when compared to the prior year. This was largely
attributable to the implementation of our comprehensive response plan focusing on cash fixed cost
reduction and enhanced cash flow.
As a result our key metrics were impacted as follows:

-     Working capital managed to optimal levels achieving an additional benefit of R9,2 billion relative
      to our internal plans. This resulted in a historical low working capital ratio of 12,5% compared to
      14,8% for the prior year. Investment in working capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year;
-     Capital expenditure optimised by approximately R6,0 billion by deferring certain expenditure
      without compromising on safety and the reliability of our operations;
-     Loss before interest and tax (LBIT) of R111,0 billion compared to earnings before interest and tax
      (EBIT) of R9,7 billion in the prior year;
-     Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by 27% from R47,6 billion in the prior year to R35,0 billion;
-     Basic earnings per share (EPS) decreased to a R147,45 loss per share compared to earnings per
      share of R6,97 in the prior year;
-     Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by more than 100% to a R11,79 loss per share
      compared to the prior year; and
-     Core headline earnings per share(2) (CHEPS) decreased by 61% to R14,79 compared to the prior
      year.

1) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBIT for depreciation and amortisation, share-based
   payments, remeasurement items, movement in environmental provisions due to discount rate
   changes, unrealised net losses/(gains) on all derivatives and hedging activities and unrealised
   translation losses arising on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional
   currency. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Core HEPS as noted below, are useful measures of the
   Group's underlying cash flow performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and
   may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. (Adjusted
   EBITDA constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
   Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma
   financial information as set out in the full set of audited summarised financial statements.)
2) Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings per share with certain once-off items
   (provision for tax litigation matters and LCCP cash fixed cost with limited corresponding gross
   margin), year-end close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects
   (exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up, and share-
   based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Year-end close adjustments include
   unrealised net losses/(gains) on all derivatives and hedging activities and unrealised translation
   losses arising on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currency in order
   to remove volatility from earnings from year to year. (Core HEPS constitutes pro forma financial
   information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in conjunction

Balance sheet management

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 18% to R42,4 billion compared to the prior year.
This was largely due to the softer macroeconomic environment during the first six months of the year
which was further impacted by the severe economic consequences from theCOVID-19 pandemic and
lower oil prices during the second half of the year, coupled with the LCCP still being in a ramp-up phase.
The decrease was partially negated by another strong working capital and cost performance from the
foundation business. Investment in working capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year due to
focused management actions, resulting in a working capital ratio of 12,5%. To create flexibility in
Sasol's balance sheet during our peak gearing period, we have successfully engaged with our lenders
to waive our covenants as at 30 June 2020 and to lift our covenants from 3,0 times to 4,0 times of Net
debt: EBITDA (bank definition) as at 31 December 2020. This provides additional flexibility, which is
subject to conditions, consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritising debt reduction
through commitments to suspend dividend payments and acquisitions while our leverage is above 3,0
times Net debt: EBITDA. We will also reduce the size of our facilities as debt levels reduce. Our Net
debt: EBITDA ratio at 30 June 2020, based on the revolving credit facility and US dollar term loan
covenant definition, was 4,3 times. The weaker Rand/US$ dollar exchange rate at 30 June 2020
impacted Net debt: EBITDA by 0,6 times.

During the year we secured incremental US dollar liquidity through a US$1 billion syndicated loan
facility for up to 18 months, and bilateral facilities (with a combined quantum of US$250 million) with
a tenure of two years. These facilities enhance our US dollar liquidity position during the peak gearing
phase as the LCCP ramps up. In the South African market, we have both bank loan facilities and an R8,0
billion Domestic Medium-Term Note Programme (DMTN) which was established in 2017. In August
2019, we issued our inaugural paper to the value of R2,2 billion in the local debt market under this
DMTN programme.

As at 30 June 2020, our total debt was R189,7 billion compared to R130,9 billion as at 30 June 2019,
with approximately R174,6 billion (US$10,1 billion) denominated in US dollar. Our balance sheet is
highly geared, requiring a reduction in US dollar denominated debt in order to achieve a targeted Net
deb t: EBITDA of less than 2,0 times and gearing of 30%, which we believe would be sustainable with
oil at approximately US$45 per barrel (in real terms). Through our comprehensive response plan we
have taken immediate steps to reset our capital structure by targeting to generate at least US$6 billion
by the end of 2021.

Our gearing increased from 56,3% at 30 June 2019 to 114,5% mainly due to remeasurement items
(39%) recognised, a weaker closing Rand/US dollar exchange rate (6%) and the adoption of the IFRS 16
'Leases' accounting standard (4%). Deleveraging the balance sheet is one of our highest priorities to
ensure business sustainability to position us for the future to deliver value to our stakeholders.

Consistent with our long-term commitment to return to an investment grade credit rating, we are
engaging with ratings agencies regarding the progress on our comprehensive response plan.

As at 30 June 2020, our liquidity headroom was in excess of US$2,5 billion well above our outlook to
maintain liquidity in excess of US$1 billion, with available Rand and US dollar based funds improving
as we advance our focused management actions. We continue to assess our mix of funding
instruments to ensure that we have funding from a range of sources and a balanced maturity profile.
We have no significant debt maturities before June 2021 when the US$1 billion syndicated loan
becomes due. In accordance with IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', the recent conditions
which underlie the covenant waiver requires an assessment of our debt maturity that resulted in a
further US$1 billion being classified to short-term debt at 30 June 2020.

Our net cash on hand position increased from R15,8 billion as at 30 June 2019 to R34,1 billion mainly
due to proceeds received from the US$1,0 billion syndicated loan as well as draw downs on the
revolving credit facility negated by LCCP capital expenditure for the year.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R35 billion. This includes R14 billion
(US$0,9 billion) relating to the LCCP and is in line with our internal targets.

In line with our financial risk management framework, we continue to make good progress with
hedging our currency and ethane exposure. For further details of our open hedge positions we refer
you to our Analyst Book (www.sasol.com).


Further cautionary announcement

Shareholders of Sasol (Shareholders) are referred to various cautionary announcements regarding the
expanded and accelerated asset disposal programme and the rights issue, the last announcement
released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 28 July 2020. Accordingly, Shareholders are advised
to continue exercising caution when dealing in the Company's securities until full terms
announcements on the disposal of the air separation units, the US Base Chemicals partnering process
and the rights issue are published.


Dividend

Dividend payments are an important part in our capital allocation framework. However, given our
current financial leverage and the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the Board
believes that it would be prudent to continue with the suspension of dividends. This will allow us to
continue to protect our liquidity in the short-term and focus on reducing leverage in order to create a
firm platform to execute our strategy and drive long-term shareholder returns. In addition, in
accordance with the covenant amendment agreement with lenders, we will not be in a position to
declare a dividend for as long as Net debt: EBITDA is above 3,0 times. We expect the balance sheet to
regain flexibility following the implementation of our comprehensive response plan.


Update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)
Ongoing focus as we ramp up all units to beneficial operation

At the LCCP, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity and bringing all the units to
beneficial operation. The LCCP continued with its exceptional safety record with a recordable case rate
(RCR) of 0,11.

After the ethoxylates (ETO) expansion achieved beneficial operation in January 2020, the alcohol
expansion and the alumina expansion, as well as the new Guerbet unit, achieved beneficial operation
in June 2020. As a result, 100% of the LCCP's Specialty Chemicals units are online, and 86% of total
nameplate capacity of the LCCP is operational.

The last remaining unit to come online will be the low density polyethylene (LDPE) unit, which was
damaged during a fire in January 2020. The unit is expected to achieve beneficial operation before the
end of October 2020. Some challenges in restoring the unit have resulted in a slight delay to the
previous market guidance of the end of September 2020. During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit
start-up, the ethylene produced by the cracker and destined for the unit is being sold to third parties.
As a result, projected earnings for the LCCP complex in this financial year will be impacted only by the
loss in the margin of ethylene to LDPE. In addition, the insurance claims process is underway, and the
first insurance proceeds have been received.

The overall LCCP cost estimate is tracking US$12,8 billion as per our previous guidance. The new ethane
cracker produced at an average rate of above 80% of nameplate capacity during the fourth quarter of
the year.

COVID-19 had a limited impact on the LCCP construction and commissioning activities during the
fourth quarter of the year, and mitigation plans are in place to minimise potential impacts going
forward. The close-out and demobilisation of the LCCP is progressing according to plan with the
remainder of the work limited to the removal of scaffolding. Site demobilisation of construction
equipment, infrastructure and services will be completed after the last unit achieves beneficial
operation. The people on site have reduced to less than 400 and follows the demobilisation plan. This
includes the LDPE restoration resources.


Board activities

The following change to the Board of the Company occurred after the publication of the Company's
Interim Financial Results on 21 February 2020:
- Ms KC Harper was appointed as Independent Director with effect from 1 April 2020.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Sasol will announce group financial results for the year ended 30 June 2020
(2020 financial year) that were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a
severe decline in crude oil and chemical product prices. The impact of the
weak macro-economic environment was partly mitigated by a strong cash cost,
working capital and capital expenditure performance.

Shareholders are advised that, for the 2020 financial year:
- The loss per share is expected to be between R146,75 and R148,15 compared
   to the prior year earnings per share of R6,97 (representing a decline of
   more than 100%);
- Headline loss per share is expected to be between R8,72 and R14,86 compared
   to the prior year headline earnings per share (HEPS) of R30,72
   (representing a decline of more than 100%); and
- Core HEPS (CHEPS**) is expected to be between R11,02 and R18,56 compared
   to the prior year CHEPS of R37,65.

Sasol’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(adjusted EBITDA*) is expected to decline by between 17% and 37% from R47,6
billion in the prior year, to between R30,0 billion and R39,5 billion. This
results from a 18% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil
coupled with much softer global chemical and refining margins impacting our
gross margins adversely, especially during the second half of the 2020
financial year. The cash fixed cost performance for the second half of the
year improved markedly, partly offsetting the impact of lower gross margins.

The loss per share was as a result of the decrease in the adjusted EBITDA as
well as notable non-cash adjustments to earnings. The largest contributor
relates to impairments of a number of cash generating units following the
decline in the long-term macro-economic outlook, and the fair value impact
following the commencement of partnering discussions for our Base Chemicals
assets in the United States. Aggregate pre-tax impairment charges of
approximately R112 billion have been recognised in the 2020 financial year.

The impairments and fair value adjustments have impacted the reporting
segments as follows:
- Energy R12,5 billion across the portfolio;
- Base Chemicals R71,3 billion, primarily in the United States; and
- Performance Chemicals R27,7 billion, primarily relating to its share of
   ethylene producing assets in the United States.

Other non-cash adjustments include:
- Unrealised losses of R7,4 billion on the translation of monetary assets
   and liabilities due to the 23% weakening of the closing rand/US dollar
   exchange rate; and
- Unrealised losses of R4,8 billion on the valuation of financial
   instruments and derivative contracts.
- Depreciation of R3,9bn attributable to those Lake Charles Chemicals
   Project (LCCP) units that reached beneficial operation.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

Sasol will release its Annual Financial Results on Monday, 17 August 2020,
for the year ended 30 June 2020. Given the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the associated restrictions placed on public gatherings, Sasol has
decided to pre-record its results presentation. Sasol’s President and Chief
Executive Officer, Fleetwood Grobler, and Chief Financial Officer, Paul
Victor, will present the results. The pre-recorded presentation will be
available     on    17     August    2020     on    the    following     link:
https://www.corpcam.com/Sasol17082020.

A conference call will also be hosted via webcast at 15h00 (SA) with Fleetwood
Grobler and Paul Victor to discuss the results and provide an update of the
business.    Please     confirm    your    participation     by    registering
online: https://www.corpcam.com/Sasol17August2020

* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for
depreciation, amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement items,
change in discount rates of our rehabilitation provisions, all unrealised
translation gains and losses, and all unrealised gains and losses on our
derivatives and hedging activities.

** Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings with non-recurring
items, earnings losses of significant capital projects (exceeding R4 billion)
which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up, all
translation gains and losses (realised and unrealised), all gains and losses
on our derivatives and hedging activities (realised and unrealised), and
share-based payments on implementation of BBBEE transactions. Adjustments in
relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end are to remove
volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves
and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to
period. We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of the group´s
sustainable operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Core HEPS are not defined terms under IFRS and may not
be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of
Sasol. The adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
due to their nature, may not fairly present Sasol´s financial position,
changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

DISPOSAL OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED;
TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE AND FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


SALE OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED

Sasol is pleased to announce that Sasol South Africa Limited (“SSA”), a Major
Subsidiary of Sasol, has signed an exclusive negotiation agreement with Air Liquide for
the sale of its sixteen air separation units located in Secunda to Air Liquide Large
Industries South Africa Proprietary Limited (“Air Liquide”). The proceeds will total
approximately R8,5 billion.

The air separation units, which have a capacity of up to 42 000 tons per day, provide
oxygen for Sasol’s fuels and chemical production processes in Secunda as well as
producing various other gases utilised at the site. Air Liquide will supply the gases to
SSA’s operations under a long-term gas supply agreement. It is anticipated that Air
Liquide’s expertise would allow, in coordination with Sasol, a targeted reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the oxygen production over the
coming years, which will contribute towards the GHG reduction for the overall Secunda
site.

Air Liquide has been present on the Secunda site since 1979, and already owns and
operates the seventeenth air separation unit, which was commissioned in January
2018. Air Liquide owning and operating the full air separation fleet is expected to
provide optimisation of management of the assets and energy efficiency benefits.

The transaction remains subject to further due diligence, finalisation of relevant
definitive agreements and associated internal and external approvals, including the
Competition Commission and the South African Reserve Bank. The parties aim to
negotiate final agreements by mid August, and a further announcement will be made at
that time. The transaction is currently expected to close within financial year 2021.

This transaction forms part of Sasol’s accelerated divestment programme as part of
Sasol’s comprehensive response plan announced on 17 March 2020.

RELEASE OF TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE

Our accelerated asset disposal programme is impacting the completion of our year-end
processes. We anticipate the release of a trading statement update early in August
2020.
FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Sasol refers to the SENS announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”) on 17 March 2020, outlining a comprehensive response strategy
designed to mitigate the impact of a lower oil price and COVID-19. The strategy
includes a cash conservation programme, an accelerated and expanded asset disposal
programme, as well as a potential rights issue of up to US$2 billion which remains
subject to the progress of other initiatives. A further SENS announcement was released
on 1 July 2020, updating investors on the progress regarding the asset disposal
programme.

Sasol shareholders are advised that implementation of the response strategy is
underway, the outcome of which may have a material effect on the price of the
Company’s securities. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to continue exercising
caution when dealing in the Company’s securities until full announcements on the
disposal of the air separation units, the asset disposal programme and the potential
rights issue are made.

The last remaining LCCP unit to come online is the Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)
plant, which was damaged during a fire in January 2020. Repair work to the unit is
ongoing and the unit is expected to achieve beneficial operation (BO) before the end of
October 2020. Some challenges were experienced in the completion of the restoration
process, resulting in a slight delay to the previous market guidance of a BO date before
September 2020.

Overall project completion was at 99% and capital expenditure amounted to
US$12,7bn.

SASOL’S GUERBET UNIT AT LAKE CHARLES ACHIEVES BENEFICIAL
OPERATION

Sasol is pleased to announce that the Guerbet alcohols unit at the Lake Charles
Chemicals Project (“LCCP”) achieved beneficial operation on 19 June 2020. The new
Guerbet unit is Sasol’s second Guerbet alcohol production site, with the other located in
Brunsbuettel, Germany. This means that 100 percent of LCCP’s specialty chemicals
units are now online, and that 86 percent of total nameplate capacity of LCCP is
operational. The Guerbet unit is the sixth LCCP production unit to be brought into
production, and has a nameplate capacity of 30 000 tons per year, using Sasol’s
proprietary technology.

The LCCP Ziegler unit, which achieved beneficial operation on 16 June 2020, is an
extension of the existing Ziegler plant in Lake Charles and adds to existing Ziegler
capacity from Brunsbuettel in Germany. It is the largest of its kind in the world, adding
nameplate capacity of 173 000 tons per year of alcohol and 32 000 tons per year of
alumina. The Ziegler unit is the most technically complex of the units in the LCCP and is
also based on Sasol’s proprietary technology.

The last remaining unit to come online at LCCP will be the low density polyethylene
(LDPE) plant, which was damaged during a fire in January 2020. This is on track for
beneficial operation by the end of September 2020, as per previous guidance. At the
end of May 2020, the LCCP capital expenditure was tracking the previously
communicated guidance of US$12,8 billion.

SASOL UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO OIL PRICE VOLATILITY AND COVID-19
PANDEMIC

Sasol continues to make significant progress on the response plan measures
announced on 17 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, to address the impacts of oil price
volatility and the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19).

The situation remains highly dynamic, but as lockdown regulations are eased in South
Africa and elsewhere, Sasol is now ramping up operations whilst taking action to ensure
the safety of employees and service providers.

This announcement includes the following:
         - Operational performance update
         - Covenant update
         - Status on financial position
         - Future positioning of Sasol
         - Change in Director’s executive responsibilities and new Group Executive
            Committee structure

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE UPDATE

As previously communicated an unprecedented decrease in fuel demand in South
Africa as a result of COVID-19 resulted in us reducing our production rates at Secunda
Synfuels Operations (SSO) and suspending production at the Natref Refinery in
Sasolburg, in a joint decision with Sasol’s partner, Total South Africa.

Sasol used this period of lower production to bring forward its planned September 2020
maintenance shutdown at SSO. This shutdown was successfully completed in May
2020 and ensures production will be uninterrupted for the remainder of the calendar
year. Similarly, maintenance work planned for later during calendar year 2020 at Natref
was successfully completed during the lockdown period.

Since the lockdown restrictions in South Africa were eased on 1 June 2020, SSO has
ramped up production, and Natref is expected to start production by the end of June
2020 and will ramp up to full capacity as jet fuel demand resumes. The ammonia, nitric
acid and chlor-vinyl plants in Sasolburg also started up in May 2020.
Outside South Africa, Sasol’s operations are performing to plan. Oryx GTL’s train 1
came back into operation at the beginning of June 2020, and train 2 is expected to be
back in production in the second quarter of financial year 2021 following the extended
planned shutdown of the plant.

Sasol previously guided the beneficial operation of the Ziegler and Guerbet units at the
Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) by end June 2020 and is pleased to announce
that the Ziegler unit achieved beneficial operation on 16 June 2020 and the Guerbet
unit’s beneficial operation is imminent. Remediation work on the low density
polyethylene (LDPE) unit is progressing according to plan, and we expect to bring this
unit into production before the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2020.

COVENANT UPDATE

Sasol is pleased to announce the successful conclusion of discussions with lenders
regarding increased balance sheet flexibility in the context of COVID-19 impacts and
market volatility. Our lenders have agreed to waive the covenant at June 2020 and lift
the December 2020 covenant from 3 times to 4 times Net Debt : Earnings Before
Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA).

This additional flexibility is subject to conditions which are customary for such covenant
amendments and consistent with Sasol’s broader capital allocation framework. These
include provisions to prioritise debt reduction at this time, such as commitments that
there will be no dividend payments nor acquisitions while Sasol’s leverage is above 3
times Net Debt : EBITDA. Sasol will also reduce the size of its facilities as debt levels
are reduced, whilst continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position.

In conjunction with these amendments and in light of Sasol’s two notch credit rating
downgrade earlier this year, the interest costs across Sasol’s debt facilities will increase
by approximately US$40 million per annum, before any reduction in borrowings through
any self-help measures or disposals. The applicable interest rate will reduce in the event
that Sasol’s credit rating improves.

UPDATE ON FINANCIAL POSITION

Management continues to progress with the execution of its crude oil hedging
programme for financial year 2021. For quarter 1 financial year 2021, approximately
80% of Synfuels’ liquid fuels exposure was hedged, translating to 6 million barrels. This
consists of 2,5 million barrels of zero cost collars at a put strike price of US$31 per
barrel and a call strike price of US$39 per barrel, and 3,5 million barrels of put options at
an average net strike price of US$37 per barrel. Oil hedges for the remainder of
financial year 2021 are in progress with 2 million barrels using put options hedged at an
average net strike price of US$30 per barrel and 0,5 million barrels hedged using zero
cost collars at a put strike of US$36 per barrel and a call strike of US$45 per barrel.
These oil hedges will significantly protect liquidity during the forthcoming months

Sasol made significant progress with the implementation of its self-help measures as
communicated on 17 March and 23 April 2020. For financial year 2020 Sasol is well on
track to achieve the targets set, whilst for financial year 2021 plans to achieve the
targets set have been developed to a high level of probability.

Sasol reaffirms that liquidity headroom will remain well above US$1 billion, with
improved liquidity balances in Sasol’s US dollar and Rand liquidity facilities. Several
focussed management actions over the past couple of months have improved our
liquidity position.

Sasol remains committed to the delivery of its response plan to bring leverage back in
line with target levels and mitigate the impacts of recent market volatility and COVID-19.

The process to accelerate and expand our asset disposal programme has yielded good
progress for several of Sasol’s assets despite the macro environment volatility in recent
months. Any divestment or similar activity will be executed in line with balance sheet,
shareholder value and strategic objectives, including the potential for partnering options
at Sasol’s US Base Chemicals business.

Further updates on the progress of the disposal transactions will be made as and when
appropriate.

POSITIONING SASOL FOR THE FUTURE

As previously communicated, a key part of Sasol’s response plan is to look beyond the
near-term measures and position the business for sustained profitability in a low oil
price environment. The new strategy will focus on Sasol’s core portfolios of chemicals
and energy. A focused and robust review of the business, and the associated workforce
structures, is underway and a detailed update will be provided to stakeholders alongside
the full year results.

A key decision as a result of this includes the discontinuation of all oil growth activities in
West Africa. The reset of the strategy necessitates a revised operating model, which is
still under development and will be announced in the second quarter of financial year
2021.

The review has identified that the future Sasol business – “Sasol 2.0” – will be focused
on two core businesses, Chemicals and Energy (the Businesses). The revision of our
strategy aims to have a greater focus on enhanced cash generation, value realisation
for shareholders and business sustainability. The Chemicals Business will focus on its
activities in specialty chemicals where it has differentiated capabilities and strong
market positions which can be expanded over time. The Energy Business will comprise
the Southern African value chain and associated assets and will pursue greenhouse
gas emission reduction (GHG) through focus on gas as a key feedstock and renewables
as a secondary energy source. This will be a key enabler to achieve the 2030 and
longer term aspirations to shift to a lower carbon economy.

Our two market-facing Businesses will each be responsible for its own profit and loss,
management of resources and capabilities. A lean corporate centre will enable the
Businesses by fostering synergies and integrating activities, setting strategic boundaries
and allocating capital.

The redesign of the organisation to enable our sustainability at lower oil prices will have
an impact on our workforce structure. We have accordingly issued a notice to our
representative trade unions in South Africa in terms of section 189 of the Labour
Relations Act number 66 of 1995, inviting them to enter into consultation with Sas ol. A
similar process will be followed with the relevant recognised bodies in our other
jurisdictions.

CHANGE IN DIRECTOR’S EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEW GROUP
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE STRUCTURES

As a first step towards this long-term trajectory, the new senior leadership end-state
structure will consist of the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and six
Executive Vice President (EVP) portfolios. An additional EVP Sasol 2.0 Transformation
role will be in place for up to 24 months to help execute our restructuring initiative and
mitigate risks to ongoing operations. Changes in the roles of EVPs will be effective from
1 November 2020. This new structure will also increase our gender and diversity
representation at GEC level.

The EVP portfolios will be structured as follows:

-   The Energy Business Unit will comprise two EVP portfolios;

        o Priscillah Mabelane, whose appointment we announced on 2 June 2020, will
          lead Sasol’s liquid fuels marketing and sales activities, upstream gas,
          sourcing and marketing, and supporting functions associated with the Energy
          value chain.
        o Bernard Klingenberg will lead operations and technical functions within the
          Energy value chain, as well as mining, to ensure continuity in our ability to
          deliver across our integrated value chain.

-   The Chemicals Business Unit will be led by Brad Griffith. He will be fully accountable
    for the full end-to-end chemicals business, from feedstock sourcing through
    operations, marketing and sales and associated supporting activities and functions.

The Corporate Centre will be made up of three EVP portfolios:

    -   Chief Financial Officer, Paul Victor.
    -   Human Resources and Stakeholder Relations, led by Charlotte Mokoena.
    -   Strategy, Sustainability and Integrated Services, led by Executive Director Vuyo
        Kahla. Corporate portfolio strategy, sustainability, enterprise-wide risk
        management as well as enterprise-wide SHE policy and reporting will be added
        to his current responsibilities. Supply chain will move from his current portfolio of
        responsibilities and form part of the business units.

In addition to the permanent roles described above, Marius Brand will be appointed as
EVP Sasol 2.0 Transformation to lead the Group-wide Transformation Programme to
Sasol 2.0 and delivering the long-term sustainability targets by the third quarter of
financial year 2021.

Further details of our repositioning process will be provided at the August 2020 results
release.

BUSINESS UPDATE, PRODUCTION AND SALES METRICS FOR THE NINE
MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020


OPERATIONS SAFETY UPDATE

The safety and wellbeing of our employees and service providers remains our top
priority. Sasol management is disheartened by the tragic fatality suffered by a
service provider at our Secunda operations on 7 April 2020. An internal incident
investigation, in collaboration with the service provider, is well underway to
determine the root cause of this incident. The journey towards zero harm and
eliminating fatalities remains an imperative for Sasol.


FURTHER UPDATE OF COVID-19 ON GLOBAL OPERATIONS

In relation to the COVID-19 impacts on employees and service providers, Sasol
has implemented a range of measures and strict protocols to ensure that
employees can continue to perform essential work safely. Detailed COVID-19
response plans are in place for all sites globally, with dedicated task teams closely
monitoring and managing the situation in line with relevant local guidance.
Fourteen Sasol employees have tested positive for COVID-19 globally, of which
nine employees have recovered and the remaining five employees remain in self-
isolation and are receiving appropriate support. No employee has tested positive
for COVID-19 at our South African operations.

The lockdown in South Africa continues to have a significant impact on fuel
demand. Consistent with Sasol’s COVID-19 update on 8 April, this has resulted in
the phased suspension of production at the Natref refinery and a 25% reduction in
production rates at Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO). Chemicals used in the
mining and construction sectors have also seen a reduction in demand, which has
necessitated the suspension of production of Sasol’s ammonia, nitric acid and
chlor-vinyl plants in Sasolburg. Market demand for Sasol’s other industrial
chemicals has not been significantly impacted and therefore SSO’s residual
operating capacity is prioritising chemicals production for supply to domestic and
export markets. Fuel demand is being closely monitored in light of the two week
extension of the lockdown in South Africa.
The COVID-19 situation remains highly dynamic with infection rates varying
across Sasol’s operating jurisdictions. Sasol’s operations offer some flexibility to
balance fuels and chemicals output to respond to product demand.


RESPONSE STRATEGY PROGRESS

Sasol has made significant progress in implementing the self-help measures
communicated on 17 March 2020 as part of the response strategy to the COVID-
19 pandemic and oil price volatility. Most of the financial year 2020 initiatives have
already been agreed and are now being implemented. However, savings relating
to working capital carry some risk due to higher than expected inventory levels
following reduced demand and the weaker exchange rate impact on accounts
receivable. For financial year 2021, we have made significant progress and have
committed actions in place for more than 80% of the savings target.

The first set of self-help measures announced on 17 March 2020 is being realised
mainly by:
   - Optimising and reducing cash costs. A wide range of measures have been
       taken to cut operating costs. Some examples include non-payment of the
       financial year 2020 short-term incentive scheme to employees, freezing of
       vacancies and the drastic curtailment of external spend through
       engagements with suppliers to consider renegotiations on price and
       reduction in scope of services.
   - Significant results realised by re-prioritising capital expenditure following a
       risk based evaluation.
   - Several actions are planned to manage working capital to optimal levels for
       the Company to the end of financial year 2021 as the disruption associated
       with COVID-19 is expected to ease.

The ongoing negative demand impact from COVID-19 requires management to
consider further self-help measures. These measures are necessary to help
protect the Company’s balance sheet and liquidity until at least the end of financial
year 2021. The Company will implement the following key human capital
measures:
   - A 20% to 40% reduction in directors’ fees.
   - A two-part salary sacrifice for the President and Chief Executive Officer
       (CEO) which entails a donation of 33% of the CEO’s salary for three
       months from May 2020 to the Solidarity Fund set up by the South African
       government to support the fight against COVID-19, and for the remaining
       five months to December 2020, a salary sacrifice of 20% will apply.
   - Salary sacrifices for the Group Executive Committee and senior leadership
       members of 20%, and for middle to junior management levels ranging from
       15-10%. Salary sacrifices are planned for 8 months, however the duration
       of the temporary measures will be reassessed against the progress we
       make towards our savings targets. Furthermore, no salary increases will be
       effected in 2020.

In addition we are proactively investigating the opportunity to conduct critical and
statutory work during the current period of the lower product demand at SSO,
which could allow the maintenance intervention planned for September 2020 to be
optimised significantly or even postponed.

In parallel, Sasol has made progress on its expedited review of the business to
consider how it can be most effectively positioned to be sustainable in a low oil
price environment. Consistent with this approach, the expanded asset disposal
process has yielded good interest in relation to a number of assets, despite the
macro environment uncertainty. Updates on progress will be provided at the
appropriate time.


UPDATE ON FINANCIAL POSITION

Sasol aims to sustain liquidity headroom above US$1 billion for the foreseeable
future considering that it has no significant debt maturities before May 2021. The
contribution of the suite of self-help measures is key in maintaining this liquidity
position with asset disposals remaining essential to reduce Sasol’s debt levels.
The COVID-19 impact will have a significant negative effect on operating cash
flows. The response strategy measures detailed above are necessary to mitigate
the impact of reduced demand and much weaker macro-economic indicators on
the Company’s profitability. The necessity of any additional measures required will
be assessed on the basis of the further market developments.

Sasol appreciates the ongoing support from its lending group. The process to
secure appropriate adjustments to relevant covenants is underway and a further
update will be provided in due course.

We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of lower-for-longer macro-
economic assumptions on the value of our assets ahead of the 2020 financial year
end process. Details will be provided in our future trading updates.


BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Sasol Mining’s full year productivity is expected to range between 1 130-1 180
tons per continuous miner per shift, without taking into account any potential
effects of the COVID-19 spread amongst our workforce and the subsequent
impact on operations. We have reduced our additional external coal stock
purchases by approximately 400 – 600 kilotons for the SSO value chain for the
remainder of the financial year, following the recent reduction in both internal and
external customer demand. The resultant increase in coal stockpiles will help
mitigate potential business continuity risk including the potential impact of the
spread of COVID-19 amongst the workforce.

Given the decline in liquid fuels demand following the COVID-19 prevalence, sales
volumes are expected to be approximately 50-51 million barrels for financial year
2020. This is based on the current extended COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa,
and a phased demand ramp-up after the lifting of the lockdown restrictions.
Accordingly, SSO production for the full year is forecasted to decrease to
approximately 7,3-7,4 million tons. Chemicals production will be prioritised within
the revised SSO operating parameters.

Despite the Lake Charles Chemical Project (LCCP) ramp up continuing in line with
expectations for operational performance, further price weakness means that the
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)
contribution from LCCP for financial year 2020 has been revised to a loss of
between US$50-US$100 million. This compares to the previous guidance of a
positive EBITDA of US$50-US$100 million before the price weakness as a result
of the decline in oil prices and the COVID-19 global demand reduction.

Beneficial operations of the Guerbet and Ziegler units remain on track for the end
of June 2020 and the LDPE unit, which was planned for the second half of the
calendar year 2020, is now targeted to be on-line by the third quarter of calendar
year 2020. The acceleration of this timeline will ensure that Sasol captures the
additional contribution margin above ethylene, given the current low ethylene
prices achieved in the market.

The financial information on which this update is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company's external auditors.

UPDATE ON SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

BACKGROUND

Shareholders are referred to Sasol’s SENS announcement issued on 31 March
2020. In that announcement, Sasol stated it would continue to run its operations,
in line with regulatory requirements applicable in the jurisdictions we operate in, to
ensure uninterrupted supply of essential products such as fuels and chemicals in
these jurisdictions. We reiterate that the COVID-19 pandemic is highly dynamic,
and we will continue to update the market of any further impact on Sasol’s
business.

A small number of Sasol employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and are
receiving our full support. These were isolated cases and have not negatively
impacted operations.

Sasol communicated a comprehensive response strategy on 17 March 2020 and
substantial progress has been made with regards to its US$2billion cash
conservation programme. While the Company has made substantial progress, it
will also implement additional self-help management actions to mitigate further
negative impacts of COVID-19 across its portfolio.

UPDATE ON OPERATIONS

In South Africa, the national COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in an
unprecedented decline in fuel demand since coming into effect on Friday, 27
March 2020. Sasol and its partner in Natref, Total South Africa, decided to
suspend the production at Natref with effect from Thursday, 9 April 2020 until
further notice.

Given the steep decline in fuels demand, a decision was also made by Sasol to
reduce daily production rates at our Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) by
approximately 25% to meet the current market demand, while maintaining optimal
inventory levels. We will maintain these production rates until further notice, while
carefully monitoring the supply and demand balance. A further reduction in
production rates may be required depending on further developments in the fuels
market. All Sasol’s mines are continuing to operate notwithstanding the lower
internal demand, resulting in the external coal purchases being significantly
minimised, compared to what was previously planned for the remainder of this
financial year.

Chemicals production will continue to be prioritised within the revised SSO
operating parameters including this cutback scenario. Despite the suspension of
production at the Natref refinery and lower production rates at SSO, the country’s
current demand for fuels and chemicals, including sanitisers, will be met. The
Company will continue to monitor the chemicals demand as well as supply chain
risks and will keep the market updated on developments.

Given these developments and the decline in demand, liquid fuels sales volumes
are expected to be approximately 50 – 51 million barrels against the previously
guided 57 – 58 million barrels for financial year 2020. Accordingly, Synfuels
production volumes will be approximately 7,3 – 7,4 million tons against the
previously guided range of 7,7 – 7,8 million tons. At this stage a similar reduction
in Synfuels chemicals demand is not being experienced, and Sasol is prioritising
supply of chemicals within South Africa as well as strong export demand.
More detail on production volumes and updated guidance will be provided in the
Company’s Q3 FY20 Business Performance Metrics report, to be released in April
2020.

RESPONSE STRATEGY PROGRESS

As referenced earlier, the Company has made significant progress on the US$2
billion business self-help measures for financial years 2020 and 2021, which form
the basis of the response strategy to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price
volatility.

Given the continued negative impact of COVID-19 on market demand and global
macro-economic indicators, Sasol’s management team is in the process of
proactively identifying further measures to provide an additional buffer against
short term volatility.

Sasol has put in place governance structures to manage the situation
appropriately and will take decisive action where necessary to respond to any
further changes in markets. These additional measures will be communicated to
the market once agreed with the various stakeholders.

Safeguarding the health and well-being of employees and providing essential
products to customers and stakeholders remains the Company’s priority.

SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 LOCK DOWN IN SOUTH AFRICA;
CREDIT RATING AND OIL HEDGING UPDATE, AND CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT

SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 MEASURES

Sasol welcomes and fully supports the directives announced by South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa on 23 March 2020, to combat the spread of COVID-19
in South Africa, including a three-week country-wide lockdown (“the COVID-19
directives”), which effectively commenced on Friday, 27 March 2020 and will
continue until Friday, 17 April 2020.

In South Africa, Sasol’s products and services, by and large, are classified as
essential goods and services as per Annexure B of the Lockdown Regulations
issued by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs on 25
March 2020. Sasol plans to run its South African-based operations for the duration
of the lockdown, and will work with the Government to ensure business continuity
and uninterrupted supply of fuels and chemicals in South Africa during this period.
However, some plants will be required to reduce throughput, or potentially
shutdown following lower product offtake by our customers due to the lockdown.
Furthermore, some intermediate chemicals will be re-directed to the production of
products where demand is not impacted, to the extent possible. To this end, Sasol
has formulated a special blend of alcohols to address the increasing demand for
sanitizer alcohols, and will expedite the production and availability of these critical
products locally to help safeguard the health and wellbeing of South Africans.

Sasol is collaborating with the South African Department of Trade, Industry and
Competition (DTIC) and is also prioritising supply to Government entities and other
essential services to jointly combat the spread of the virus in South Africa.

The health and wellbeing of employees remains Sasol’s foremost priority and
appropriate measures have already been taken to mitigate the risk of COVID-19
infection across all of Sasol’s sites. These measures are being strictly enforced
and closely monitored to ensure the ongoing safety of employees and the public.

Outside of South Africa, most of Sasol’s operations are continuing, with no
significant impacts to North American Operations (NAO) or its supply chain, or to
the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) construction to date. Chemical
manufacturing is defined as a critical infrastructure sector, and therefore NAO and
the LCCP is exempt from the stay-at-home order issued by the Louisiana
government.

All European and Asian assets are currently in operation. The Central Processing
Facility (CPF) in Temane, Mozambique, which supplies natural gas to
Mozambique and South Africa is not affected. Sasol continues to work closely with
suppliers and customers to ensure uninterrupted supply, where possible.

The COVID-19 situation is highly dynamic and with infection rates continuing to
increase in many countries, there is a risk of interruptions to production,
construction and associated supply chains, along with a potential impact on
demand and product pricing in some sectors. Shareholders are therefore advised
that this could impact Sasol’s earnings for 2020 financial year (FY20). The impact
on the business, suppliers and customers is being continuously evaluated and an
update will be provided in the Q3 FY20 Business Performance Metrics report.

UPDATE ON CREDIT RATING AND OIL HEDGING

Sasol notes that the credit rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and
Moody’s have updated their credit rating assessments of Sasol in light of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global growth and the volatility in the oil
price. S&P has announced that it has revised Sasol’s BBB- rating, which was
affirmed on 7 March to BB, with a negative outlook, while Moody’s also announced
that it has revised Sasol’s Ba1 rating to Ba2 and placed the company under review
for a downgrade. Moody’s stated that “South Africa’s 21-day lockdown to contain
the outbreak creates further uncertainty on near-term financial performance, while
an extended lockdown beyond the original timeline could further affect
performance”. The cost of some of Sasol’s floating rate debt is partly linked to our
credit rating and the revised rating profile will therefore result in an increase in
finance costs from existing facilities of approximately US$10 million per annum.

As stated in the market update on 17 March 2020, Sasol has developed a
comprehensive response strategy, which is being executed to mitigate the impact
of COVID-19 and a lower oil price as far as practically possible. This includes a
cash conservation programme, an accelerated and expanded asset disposal and
partnering programme, as well as a potential rights issue of up to US$2 billion,
which remains subject to the progress of other initiatives. Sasol maintains a long-
term commitment to achieving an investment grade credit rating.

Further to this, progress has been made on Sasol’s hedging programme reducing
Sasol’s exposure to any further short term pricing downside. Oil hedges are in
place for approximately 80% of Synfuels fuels Q4 FY20 production, at
approximately US$32 per barrel. Crude oil hedging execution will continue for the
next 12 months, while US$/ZAR and ethane hedging programmes have been
executed for the next twelve month period.

Sasol continues to have liquidity of approximately US$2,5 billion to provide an
additional buffer against short term volatility.

Fleetwood Grobler commented “This is an unprecedented time in the history of
Sasol and the world. We will continue to take decisive action to help safeguard the
health and well-being of our employees and provide essential products to the
many stakeholders that rely on us, while we reposition the business to enhance its
long term future.”

Shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

ADAPTING TO THE CURRENT COMMODITY PRICING LANDSCAPE AND TAKING
DECISIVE ACTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE NET DEBT, THROUGH A CASH
GENERATION PLAN TARGETING US$6 BILLION OF CASH CONSERVATION,
FURTHER DISPOSALS AND A POTENTIAL RIGHTS ISSUE UP TO US$2 BILLION,
AND FURTHER CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

BACKGROUND

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement issued on 12 March 2020, where
Sasol announced it was reviewing a variety of actions to address the challenges created
by the impact of COVID-19 and the recent decline in the oil and chemical prices.

In the short term, Sasol needs to enhance cash flow and reposition the balance sheet
on the assumption that there is a sustained low oil price until the end of financial year
2021. It is important to reiterate that Sasol currently has available liquidity of
approximately US$2.5 billion with no significant debt maturities before May 2021 and it
therefore believes it is positioned to withstand recent market volatility in the short term.
Sasol believes it can maintain liquidity headroom in excess of US$1 billion over the next
12 - 18 months with a US$25 per barrel oil price before the benefits of hedging.

Sasol can today announce a comprehensive response strategy designed to mitigate the
impact of these macroeconomic factors. This includes a commitment to re-set the
organisation to be globally competitive in a sustained low oil price environment. The
global portfolio of our foundation business remains cash positive under prevailing spot
market conditions and an oil hedging programme has been put in place to insulate the
balance sheet from further financial pressure.

A package of measures is being undertaken that is intended to fundamentally reposition
the Company over the following 24 months:
    - A cash conservation programme focused on enhancing cash flow and cost
      competitiveness in a low oil price environment, with US$2 billion cash delivery
      ahead of current plan targeted by 30 June 2021;
    - An accelerated and expanded asset disposal programme executed in line with
      balance sheet, shareholder value and strategic objectives with a view to deliver
      proceeds significantly ahead of the US$2 billion currently targeted;
    - Potential for partnering options at Sasol’s US Base Chemicals assets; and
    - A potential rights issue, which has been underwritten on a standby basis, as a
      supplemental initiative to reset the capital structure, subject to the progress
      made on cash conservation initiatives and asset disposals.

Collectively these actions target generating at least US$6 billion by the end of financial
year 2021. This is expected to reshape Sasol’s balance sheet and provide the platform
to deliver a globally competitive business with high cash yielding assets. Further to this,
Sasol is in discussions with its lenders about additional flexibility in respect of its
financial maintenance covenants to provide improved balance sheet flexibility in
financial year 2021.

OVERVIEW OF COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE STRATEGY

Self-help management actions: US$2 billion targeted by 30 June 2021

Financial year 2020
   - Immediate measures targeted to deliver a cash improvement of approximately
      US$1 billion by 30 June 2020 relative to current plan assumptions, including
      approximately
          o US$800 million to be realised from working capital optimisation and
             re-prioritising capital expenditure; and
          o US$200 million to be realised from cost-saving measures.
   - These improvements build on existing initiatives and take into account the
      anticipated working capital release as inventory and receivables are adjusted for
      lower oil and product prices.
   - Safe and reliable operating units remain a top priority for Sasol.

        Sasol believes achieving these targets would enable it to maintain a net debt to
        EBITDA ratio in compliance with financial maintenance covenants.

Financial year 2021
   - Further measures targeted to deliver approximately US$1 billion additional
      improvement in net debt position relative to previous plan assumptions, including
      approximately:
          o US$700 million to be saved from re-prioritising capital and working capital
            expenditure; and
          o US$300 million from continuing cost savings and business optimisation.

Asset disposals: Accelerated programme with scope increased significantly
above current US$2 billion target
   - Expanding the scope of, and accelerating, the asset disposal programme which
      is now intended to realise proceeds significantly above the previous target of
      US$2 billion.
   - This builds on the comprehensive asset review process and includes the
      potential for partnering Sasol’s US Base Chemicals assets on which there are
      active discussions.

Potential rights issue: Resetting the capital structure through an equity issue
after FY20 results, currently targeted at US$2 billion
    - Potential rights issue to raise up to US$2 billion (equivalent in ZAR terms), with
       execution expected after financial year 2020 results.
    - Sasol has entered into a standby underwriting agreement with BofA Securities,
       Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Securities in respect of a rights issue for an amount of
       up to US$2 billion-equivalent, which contains certain customary terms and
       conditions for transactions of this nature and conditions relating to Sasol making
       progress on certain of the measures described above, in anticipation of entering
       into an underwriting agreement in respect of a rights issue for an amount of up to
       US$2 billion-equivalent. BofA Securities and Citigroup will act as Joint Global
       Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc will act as
       Joint Bookrunner in connection with the potential rights issue.
    - In connection with implementation of the proposed rights issue, the shareholders
       of the Company will be required to approve certain resolutions. In this respect, in
       due course the Company intends to post a circular to shareholders in order to
       convene a general meeting of shareholders around July 2020, and to approve
       the necessary resolutions required to implement the proposed rights offer.
    - The size of the rights issue may be reduced subject to the progress made on the
       other elements of the response strategy.

Liquidity: Liquidity headroom of US$1-2 billion or greater to be put in place over
the following 12 to 18 months
   - Sasol expects to comply with the financial maintenance covenant thresholds in
       its debt agreements at 30 June 2020 assuming, amongst others, a prevailing
       Rand oil price of approximately R580 per barrel. Sasol can sustain a liquidity
       headroom in excess of US$1 billion over the next 12 - 18 months in a US$25 per
       barrel oil price before the benefits of hedging.
   - Sasol is actively engaging the lenders under its debt facilities to discuss
       adequate flexibility on its financial maintenance covenant thresholds in its debt
       agreements.
   - An active oil hedging strategy is in progress.
   - Sasol is targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 and gearing below 30% at
       end financial year 2022.

Business repositioning: Repositioning Sasol for sustainable profitability in a low
oil price environment
    - Sasol is undertaking a purposeful and systematic review of its global cost
       competitiveness and business structure.
    - Sasol is in the process of designing the scope of approximately R2.5 billion in
       expected sustainable net benefits by financial year 2022, expected to increase to
       R3.0 billion by financial year 2023 through efficiency and effectiveness measures
       across the business.
    - The objective is to deliver a focused and profitable business in a sustained low oil
       price environment, creating the scope for sustainable shareholder value creation
       through shareholder returns and strategic investment.
   -   Sasol maintains its commitment to meet the 10% reduction in greenhouse gas
       emissions as per the target set for 2030 for the South African operations, off a
       2017 baseline.


CONCLUSION

Sasol has a high quality, well diversified global portfolio with a range of strategically
advantaged assets and value chain integration. Sasol believes that the portfolio can be
positioned to be sustainably profitable in a future low oil price environment. A reshaped
and strategically focused portfolio based on cost, technology and market advantage is
planned. If assets do not increase the competitive advantage of this future Sasol, they
may be exited, or selective partnering may be pursued. Sasol aims for an asset portfolio
that is globally diverse across sectors and able to operate at the low end of the cost
curve in each sector and region.

The immediate focus is on the actions to stabilise the Company and protect the balance
sheet so that the underlying value of the portfolio is not compromised, and instead the
potential realised in the interests of all Sasol’s stakeholders.

In light of this, the agenda of the Capital Markets Day planned for November 2020 will
be focused on demonstrating progress against our short-term management actions,
including asset disposals, and our sustainability roadmap to meet our 2030 targets.

Sasol believes the immediate and decisive implementation of the measures announced
today can reset Sasol’s capital structure and align it with the cash generation of the
asset portfolio in a low oil price environment. We believe that the future Sasol will have
a strong value proposition, with the capacity to deliver returns to shareholders from the
portfolio and also generate sufficient cash for strategic growth and a sustainable future.

Fleetwood Grobler, Chief Executive Officer, made the following statement:

“In this dynamic and challenging environment, it’s critical that we tighten control on what
we can, acting both swiftly and decisively. My management team and I are fully
committed to delivering on the measures that we have announced today. Sasol has a
strong underlying business and all efforts are being made to enhance EBITDA in a
sustained low oil price environment. Delivering sustainable, long-term shareholder value
is our imperative and we have a clear plan to achieve that.”

Cautionary Statement

Shareholders are advised to exercise caution when trading in the Company’s securities
until such time as the full details of the disposals and the potential rights issue are
published.

UPDATE ON MARKET VOLATILITY AND CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

The unprecedented set of combined challenges driven by COVID-19 and the significant
decline in the oil price have come at a time when Sasol is in a peak gearing phase as
the Company completes LCCP.

Sasol is confident that its foundation business is capable of positive cash flow from
operations in a low oil price environment. At the prevailing Rand oil price of
approximately R580/bbl, Sasol will be within the current covenant levels at 30 June
2020. In anticipation of a lower-for-longer Rand per barrel oil price, a comprehensive
package of actions is being finalised to deliver this and sustainably strengthen the
balance sheet. It is important to note the current liquidity position:

   -   Sasol has current cash and available facilities of approximately US$2,5bn; and
   -   Sasol has no significant debt maturities before May 2021.

Sasol is prioritising the following actions, details of which will be announced to the
market on Tuesday:

   -   Business optimisation to reduce costs;
   -   Working capital optimisation;
   -   Re-scheduling some capital expenditure;
   -   Expanding the scope of, and accelerating, the asset disposal programme to
       realise proceeds in excess of the current US$2 billion target;
   -   Engaging our lending groups. Thus far, engagements have been constructive;
       and
   -   Assessing alternatives to manage Sasol's near-term debt covenant constraints,
       including a potential equity issue.

Sasol will update the market on the conference call at 15:00 SA on Tuesday, 17 March,
with detail on the comprehensive package of actions.

Shareholders are accordingly advised to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company's securities until a further announcement is made.

Fleetwood Grobler commented ""The disruption in the global oil market, coupled with the
ongoing impact of COVID-19 has significantly changed the outlook in just a few weeks.
It is critical that we keep matters within our control by acting quickly and decisively so
that stakeholders don't lose sight of the significant underlying value in this business. We
are therefore working towards a package of measures to ensure that the business is
profitable even at low oil prices and that we continue to have a strong balance sheet to
support it.""

Update On Sasol's Credit Rating

Sasol notes that the credit rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Moody's have completed
their periodic review of Sasol following the release of the company's interim financial results for 2020.

S&P has affirmed Sasol's BBB-/A-3 credit rating whilst Moody's has downgraded Sasol's credit rating
to Ba1/NP. The ratings action by Moody's reflects Sasol's elevated leverage in the context of volatile
market conditions.

As stated in Sasol's recent financial results, protecting the balance sheet remains an important priority
during the peak gearing phase. In this regard, several proactive actions have already been taken
which include a measured financial risk management programme to hedge oil and ethane commodity
price and exchange rate exposures, managing costs, increasing working capital efficiency and
agreeing additional flexibility on covenants with the lending group.

These initiatives continue to benefit the balance sheet with further actions underway. These include
re-phasing discretionary capital, ongoing delivery of the value-driven asset disposal programme and
active balance sheet management to maintain a healthy liquidity position and a balanced debt
maturity profile as Sasol works to restore an optimal capital structure. Sasol maintains a long-term
commitment to an investment grade credit rating.

Subject to the macroeconomic environment and the impact of COVID-19 on global product demand,
Sasol continues to expect the cash flow inflection point to be reached in the second half of FY20 and
de-leveraging to start thereafter. The overall Lake Charles Chemicals Project (""LCCP"") cost estimate
is tracking US$12,8 billion, within our previous guidance of US$12,6 - 12,9 billion. LCCP is expected
to be EBITDA positive in the second half of FY20 with a contribution of US$50 - US$100m for FY20.

Fleetwood Grobler commented ""We recognise the challenges presented by the current market
environment and acknowledge the outcomes of the rating agency reviews. We remain focused on
managing the factors within our control - delivering safe, strong and stable operational performance
and protecting the balance sheet as we bring the Lake Charles Chemicals Project to completion and
start deleveraging. The revised rating profile is not expected to have a material impact on our existing
funding costs. As ever, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework and priorities.""

In light of the above, Sasol management will be hosting a conference call to discuss our approach to
protecting the balance sheet on Tuesday, 10 March 2020, at 15h00 (SA).

GRANT OF CONDITIONAL SHARE AWARDS TO DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED
OFFICERS OF SASOL, AND DIRECTORS OF MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES OF SASOL

In order for Sasol to remain competitive in the market and to keep senior management and
eligible specialists retained, focused, engaged and motivated, Conditional Share Awards are
made annually and forms an important component of the reward mix offered in terms of the
remuneration policy. Shareholder approval of the Sasol Long-Term Incentive Plan (""the Plan""
and/or ""LTI"", as appropriate) was obtained at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.

The Conditional Share Awards have a split vesting period of 50% after three years with the
balance after five years and will only vest to the extent that the Corporate Performance Targets
(detailed below), as approved by the Remuneration Committee, have been achieved after the
performance period of three years. The full award is subject to the achievement of these
targets.

The standard timing for the annual Conditional Share Awards is to be made to eligible
participants at the beginning of the new financial year. However, due to the extended closed
period at the end of the 2019 financial year, the Board agreed to postpone these awards to
later in the 2020 financial year. No compensation is offered to members of the GEC in respect
of the delayed award date and the standard vesting periods of three and five years
respectively, will apply. To align with this timing, the on-appointment Conditional Share Awards
made to F R Grobler and B V Griffith on their appointment as President and Chief Executive
Officer and Executive Vice President: Chemicals Business respectively, as well as the recent
appointment of H C Brand, Executive Vice President: Sustainability and Technology, all subject
to the same performance and vesting conditions as the annual LTI awards, have now been
made.

In compliance with paragraphs 3.63 to 3.66 of the JSE Listings Requirements, Sasol hereby
announces that directors of Sasol, prescribed officers and directors of major subsidiaries of
Sasol, have been granted Conditional Share Awards in terms of the Plan.

The Board, or the Sasol Remuneration Committee, as appropriate, approved the Conditional
Share Awards made on 4 March 2020. In terms of the rules of the Plan, the participants have
to decline such an award within ten business days after the award date, failing which the
award will be deemed to have been accepted.

The rules of the LTI Plan are available on the Sasol website www.sasol.com.

FY20 Corporate Performance Targets

The Board annually considers the Corporate Performance Targets to ensure they reflect a
balanced outcome for both the participants and shareholders and serve as motivation for the
participants to focus on objectives that enable the achievement of the longer-term strategic
priorities. The participants listed above have 100% of their share awards subject to the
achievement of these Corporate Performance Targets (CPTs), which the Board believes is a
significant incentive to encourage performance. The following table sets out the targets:

Earnings performance

We delivered a satisfactory set of business results for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
with increased volumes while cost and working capital tracked our internal targets contributing to
the balance sheet covenant levels being maintained within market guidance. The financial results
were impacted mostly by a weak macroeconomic environment, which resulted in lower margins,
and the LCCP being in a ramp-up phase.

Earnings decreased by 72% to R4,5 billion compared to the prior period. This resulted from a 9%
decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil, softer global chemical prices and refining
margins, lower productivity at our Mining operations and a negative contribution from the LCCP.
Our gross margin percentage decreased by 2% compared to the prior period driven by a softer
macroeconomic environment negatively impacting supply-demand dynamics especially in our
chemicals businesses. We anticipate softer chemical prices over the next 12 to 24 months and
expect structural recovery over the medium to long-term. Our Energy business was impacted by
lower crude oil prices as well as lower refining margins due to weaker demand.

As the LCCP units progress through the sequential beneficial operation schedule, our revenues
do not yet match the costs expensed. We do expect that for the second half of FY20 revenue
will match the costs expensed better and that the LCCP will generate positive earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). The LCCP negatively impacted earnings by
R2,8 billion (EBITDA of R1,1 billion and R1,7 billion in additional depreciation charges). Earnings
were further impacted by approximately R2,0 billion in finance charges for the period as the LCCP
units reach beneficial operation.

As a result of the aforementioned factors our key financial metrics were impacted as follows:

-   Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) decreased by 53% to R9,9 billion compared to the
    prior period;
-   Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by 27% from R26,8 billion in the prior period to R19,6 billion;
-   Basic earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 73% to R6,56 per share compared to the prior
    period;
-   Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 74% to R5,94 per share compared to the
    prior period; and
-   Core headline earnings per share(2) (CHEPS) decreased by 57% to R9,20 compared to the
    prior period.

(1)         Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBIT for depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement
            items, movement in environmental provisions due to discount rate changes, unrealised translation gains and losses, and
            unrealised gains and losses on Group hedging activities. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Group's
            underlying cash flow performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly
            titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the
            JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma financial
            information as set out in the full set of reviewed interim financial results.

(2)         Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings per share with certain once-off items (provision for tax litigation
            matters and LCCP cash fixed cost with limited corresponding gross margin), period close adjustments and depreciation
            and amortisation of capital projects (exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up,
            and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments include translation gains
            and losses arising from translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currency and realised and unrealised
            net gains on Group hedging activities at period end in order to remove volatility from earnings from period to period. Core
            HEPS constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in
            conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma financial information notes as set out in the full set of reviewed
            interim financial results.

Balance sheet management

Our gearing increased from 56,3% at 30 June 2019 to 64,5% which is at the upper end of our
previous market guidance of 55% to 65%. The main reasons for the increase in gearing are the
adoption of the IFRS 16 'Leases' accounting standard (4% increase) and the net earnings impact
of the LCCP being in a ramp-up phase. Consistent with our long-term commitment to maintain
our investment grade credit rating, we continue to actively manage the balance sheet with the
objective of maintaining a healthy liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile.

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 21% to R19,6 billion compared to
R24,8 billion in the prior period. This was largely due to the softer macroeconomic environment
and losses attributable to the LCCP. The decrease was partially negated by another strong
working capital and cost performance from the foundation business. Working capital decreased by
R433 million during the period mainly as a result of focused management actions.

Our net cash on hand position decreased from R15,8 billion as at 30 June 2019 to
R12,7 billion.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R21 billion. This includes
R10 billion (US$0,7 billion) relating to the LCCP and is in line with our internal targets.
In line with our financial risk management framework, we continue to make good progress with
hedging our currency and ethane exposure. For further details of our open hedge positions we
refer you to our Analyst Book (www.sasol.com).

Dividend

After careful consideration of our current leverage and the volatility in the macroeconomic
environment, the Board of directors (Board) decided to pass the interim dividend to protect
and strengthen our balance sheet. This is a decision that was not taken lightly as we remain
committed to delivering shareholder value, however, given the current position of our balance
sheet, the Board made this decision in the long-term interest of our shareholders. We continue to
ensure that we deliver the key elements of our strategy, particularly the completion of the LCCP.

Update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)

Ongoing focus as we ramp up plants to beneficial operation

At the LCCP, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity in the field and bringing the
plants into beneficial operation. The project continued with its exceptional safety record with a
recordable case rate (RCR) of 0,10.

At the end of December 2019, engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete
and construction progress was at 98%, with overall project completion at 99%.

The investigation into the incident which occurred at the LDPE unit in January 2020 is complete.
The root cause analysis determined that a piping support structure, within the LDPE emergency
vent system, failed during commissioning causing a pipe to dislodge. No major equipment was
damaged, and the incident was isolated. Remediation has commenced, however, the replacement
of the high pressure piping material components have long lead times. We expect beneficial
operation of the LDPE unit to be delayed to the second half of calendar year 2020. Parallel
commissioning activities on the remainder of the LDPE unit continue during remediation and
every effort will be made to expedite the restoration project. The overall LCCP cost estimate is
tracking US$12,8 billion, within our previous guidance of US$12,6 billion to US$12,9 billion, and
our EBITDA estimate of US$50 million to US$100 million for FY20 remains.

During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit startup, the ethylene produced by the cracker and
destined for the unit is sold externally. All previously commissioned units were unaffected and are
operating to plan.

The ETO unit, the fourth of seven units, achieved beneficial operation on 30 January 2020. The
unit has a nameplate capacity of 100 kilo tons (kt) per year, forms part of our ethylene oxide
value chain and adds to the capacity of our Performance Chemicals product volumes already
produced and sold on both a regional and global scale. The ETO unit follows the linear low-
density polyethylene (LLDPE), world-scale ethane cracker and ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol
(EO/EG) facilities, which all reached beneficial operation last year and are operating to plan. This
provides additional flexibility to our ethylene oxide value chain and will enable us to divert some
volume away from the mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) product line and support increased margins.
As previously communicated, we still expect the Ziegler and Guerbet plants to achieve beneficial
operation in the last quarter of FY20.

The ethane cracker is ramping up following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor
catalyst in December 2019. The plant is expected to operate according to plan for the remainder
of the year. The LLDPE plant and the EO value chain are ramping up to plan with our learnings to
be carried over to the LDPE ramp-up.

The LCCP remains a world-scale, first quartile feedstock-advantaged plant, highly integrated
across a diverse product slate with high margin products and world class logistics and
infrastructure.
The short-term market outlook for ethane and product pricing remains volatile and estimates will
be updated periodically. We expect EBITDA in the range of US$600 million to US$750 million for
FY21.


Board activities

We have strengthened our LCCP control environment, which includes a detailed remediation plan
with specific focus on culture, processes and governance which is being monitored within the
project, operations and functional teams.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL HALF YEAR ENDED 31
DECEMBER 2019 AND LCCP UPDATE

Trading Statement for the financial half year ended 31 December 2019

Sasol is expected to deliver a satisfactory set of operational results for the six
months ended 31 December 2019, with a good volume, cost and working capital
performance. The financial results were however impacted by a weak
macroeconomic environment. This resulted in lower margins and operating profit.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA*) are expected to decline by between 22% and 32% from R26,8 billion in
the prior half year. This results from a 9% decrease in the rand per barrel price of
Brent crude oil, softer global chemical and refining margins and a negative EBITDA
contribution from the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP). As the LCCP units
progress through the sequential beneficial operation schedule, the costs associated
with the relevant units are expensed while the gross margin contribution follows the
planned volume ramp-up profile and inventory build. Earnings are further impacted
by approximately R1,7 billion in additional depreciation charges and approximately
R2 billion in finance charges for financial half year 2020 as the LCCP units reach
beneficial operation.

Shareholders are accordingly advised that:

-   Earnings per share (EPS) for the financial half year are expected to be between
    R5,37 and R7,76 per share. This is a decrease of between 68% and 78% from
    the prior half year EPS of R23,92;
-   Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to be between R4,79 and
    R7,11 per share. This is a decrease of between 69% and 79% from the prior half
    year HEPS of R23,25. There were no significant impairments recorded for the
    half year 2020;
-   Core HEPS (CHEPS**) are expected to be between R7,90 and R10,04 per
    share. This is a decrease of between 53% and 63% from the prior half year
    CHEPS of R21,45.

We expect net debt to EBITDA to remain below 3,0 times and gearing to remain
within the previous market guidance of 55% and 65% for financial half year 2020.

Lake Charles Chemicals Project update

Sasol provided an update on the impact of the explosion and fire at the low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) unit on 24 January 2020. Mainly as a result of the
aforementioned incident, Sasol has revised its guidance on the EBITDA contribution
from the LCCP for the financial year 2020 to between US$50 million and US$100
million.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol's financial
results for the financial half year ended 31 December 2019 will be announced on
Monday, 24 February 2020.

* Adjusted EBITDA are calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation,
amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement items, movement in
rehabilitation provisions due to discount rate changes, unrealised translation gains
and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities.

** Core HEPS are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items,
period close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects
(exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping
up, and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period
close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end are to
remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves
and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period.
We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of the group s sustainable
operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not
be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The
aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The
adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and due to their
nature, may not fairly present Sasol s financial position, changes in equity, results of
operations or cash flows.

UPDATE ON THE LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP) LOW-
DENSITY POLYETHYLENE UNIT AND SASOL PUBLISHES PRODUCTION AND
SALES METRICS FOR THE FINANCIAL HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER
2019

LCCP Low-Density Polyethylene Unit update

At Lake Charles, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity in the field
and bringing the plants into beneficial operation. The project continued with its
exceptional safety record with a recordable case rate of 0,10.

At the end of December 2019, engineering and procurement activities were
substantially complete and construction progress was at 98%. Overall project
completion was at 99% and capital expenditure amounted to US$12,5 billion.

An explosion and fire occurred at the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit on 13
January 2020. All employees and contractors are safe and accounted for. In line with
standard safety protocols as well as the necessary regional requirements, the unit
had to be made safe before re-entry of personnel into the affected area could be
allowed. The area which is the subject of the explosion, is a high pressure section of
the LDPE unit.

The investigation is underway to determine the cause, extent of the damage, and the
scope and timeline of repair. Initial findings indicate the damage is limited to a small
portion of the LDPE unit and, importantly, major equipment such as the compressors
were unaffected. Parallel commissioning activities on the remainder of the LDPE unit
will continue. The technology providers, licensors and other external experts are fully
engaged and in addition, we have mobilized and dispatched a team of Sasol
technical and operations experts to support the investigation team.

During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit start-up, the ethylene produced by the
cracker and destined for the unit will be sold externally. The projected earnings for
the LCCP complex in this financial year will only be impacted by the loss in the
margin of ethylene to low-density polyethylene. In addition, the insurance process
has been initiated and cover includes construction and commissioning activities. We
expect to determine the repair scope and outage duration by the second half of
February.

All previously commissioned units were unaffected and are operating to plan. The
Ethoxylates, Ziegler and Guerbet plants are also unaffected and remain within cost
and schedule as per our previous guidance.
Production and sales metrics for the financial half year ended 31 December
2019

Sasol has published its production and sales metrics for the financial half year ended
31 December 2019 on the Company´s website at www.sasol.com, under the Investor
Centre section or via this URL: http://www.sasol.com/investor-centre/financial-
reporting/business-performance-metrics.

Sasol expects a largely strong operational performance for the financial year ending
30 June 2020, with:

-   The Mining business updating their full year forecasted productivity to 1 170 – 1
    200 t/cm/s. This will however result in further external coal purchases of
    approximately 1,3 – 1,6 million tons during H2 FY20 to supplement the
    contracted Isibonelo volumes and enable recovery to desired stockpile levels;
-   Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement in
    Mozambique is expected to be 114 – 118 bscf, in line with previous market
    guidance;
-   Secunda Synfuels Operations full year production is forecasted to be
    approximately 7,7 – 7,8 million tons, in line with previous market guidance;
-   Natref is targeting production rates of above 600m³/h for the remainder of the
    year;
-   Energy’s sales volumes are on track to achieve previous market guidance of
    approximately 57 – 58 mm bbl for FY20;
-   As previously communicated, ORYX GTL expects to achieve a utilisation rate of
    55% – 60% for FY20 due to an extended planned shutdown during H2 FY20;
-   In line with previous market guidance, Base Chemicals sales volumes (excluding
    Polymers US products) are expected to be 1 – 2% higher than the prior year, and
    the total sales volumes are expected to be 15 – 20% higher than the prior year;
    and
-   Given the continuing macroeconomic headwinds and the softer outlook on global
    GDP growth in calendar year 2020, Performance Chemicals expects sales
    volumes for the full financial year to remain flat to slightly below the prior year’s
    level (excluding LCCP). Total sales volumes for the business are expected to be
    7 - 9% higher than the prior year.

SASOL CONFIRMS INCIDENT AT LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT
(LCCP) LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE UNIT

On Monday 13 January 2020 at 13:15 (US Central Standard Time), Sasol
experienced an explosion and fire at its LCCP low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit.

The fire was extinguished and all employees and contractors are safe and accounted
for.

The new LDPE unit had not yet achieved beneficial operation (BO) as planned for in
December 2019. The unit was in the final stages of commissioning and startup
when the incident occurred. The unit has been shut down and an investigation is
underway to determine the cause of the incident, the extent of the damage and
resulting impact on the LDPE unit's BO schedule.

All other Lake Charles units and previously commissioned LCCP units, namely the
ethane cracker, ethylene glycol/ethylene oxide and linear low-density polyethylene
units, are unaffected and operating to plan. The ethane cracker has achieved
nameplate capacity following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor
catalyst in the plant during December 2019.

The remaining three downstream units under construction to complete the integrated
LCCP site, Ziegler alcohols and alumina, alcohol ethoxylates and Guerbet alcohols,
are also unaffected and remain within cost and schedule as per our previous
guidance.

SASOL'S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP) ETHANE CRACKER
SUCCESSFULLY REPLACES ACETYLENE CATALYST AND INCREASES
ETHYLENE PRODUCTION RATES

Sasol is pleased to announce that the LCCP Ethane Cracker is increasing production
rates following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor catalyst. The
Ethane Cracker achieved beneficial operation in August 2019 but has run approximately
50 - 60% of nameplate capacity due to underperformance of the plant's acetylene
removal system. This issue has now been resolved.

The outage to replace the catalyst was successfully completed on schedule and within
budget. Following the outage, the unit was started up smoothly and ethylene production
rates are approximately 85 - 90% of nameplate capacity and are increasing. Ethylene
quality meets US Gulf Coast ethylene pipeline specifications.

Sasol also looks forward to the completion of the LCCP Low Density Polyethylene
(LDPE) Unit which is being commissioned with beneficial operation expected later in
December 2019. The remaining three downstream units under construction to complete
the integrated LCCP site, Ziegler Alcohols and Alumina, Alcohol Ethoxylates, and
Guerbet Alcohols, remain on cost and schedule as per our previous guidance.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL HALF YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER
2019 AND UPDATE ON BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT

The Company hereby advises that for the half year ending 31 December 2019:

-   Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to decrease by at least 20%, or
    R4,65, compared to the HEPS of R23,25 reported for the period ended 31 December
    2018; and
-   Earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decrease by at least 20%, or R4,78,
    compared to EPS of R23,92 reported for the period ended 31 December 2018.

A more detailed trading statement will be published as soon as more certainty has been
attained with respect to the range of the decrease in HEPS and EPS.

Our results for the six months ending 31 December 2019 may be further affected by
adjustments resulting from our half year-end closure process. This may result in a change
in the estimated earnings noted above. This trading statement only deals with the
comparison to the prior period.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed
and reported on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol's results for the financial half
year ending 31 December 2019 will be announced on Monday, 24 February 2020.

The Company has taken a number of actions consistent with its ongoing commitment to
balance sheet flexibility, access to liquidity, and maintaining an optimal funding mix. This
includes putting in place incremental liquidity through a US$1 billion syndicated loan facility
with Bank of America, Citi, Mizuho and MUFG of up to 18 months and two bilateral facilities
with a combined quantum of US$250 million, and a tenor of two years. These facilities
enhance the Company's US$ liquidity position during the peak gearing phase as the Lake
Charles Chemicals Project ramps up. These incremental facilities should not affect Sasol's
net debt position.

In these new facilities, consistent with the Company's existing revolving credit facility and
US$ Term Loan facility, the covenant has been set at 3,0x net debt: earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). However, across all of these
facilities, the lenders have agreed that for the financial reporting periods ending December
2019 and June 2020 the covenant will be increased to 3,5x.

Sasol remains committed to its investment grade credit rating. Sasol is currently rated
BBB-/A-3 and Baa3/P-3 by S&P and Moody's respectively.

Short-form announcement

Audited financial results for the year ended 30 June 2019

Earnings performance
Our foundation business delivered resilient results with a mostly strong volume and
normalised cash fixed cost performance against the backdrop of a challenging
macroeconomic environment. Our business was impacted by market and geopolitical risk,
including subdued growth in global gross domestic product (GDP).

Our gross margin percentage decreased 2% compared to the prior year driven by a softer
macro environment negatively impacting supply-demand dynamics especially in our
chemicals business. We view this as temporary as the market is expected to recover over
the short-to-medium term. Our Energy business benefitted from higher crude oil prices and
higher diesel differentials. These benefits were partly offset by weaker petrol differentials
driven by negative supply-demand fundamentals.

Cash fixed cost, excluding capital growth and the impact of exchange rates, increased by
5,7%, relative to our internal 6% inflation target. Our cost management processes remain
robust while we continue to evaluate further opportunities to embed our continuous
improvement efforts. The sustained competitiveness of our business remains top of mind.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased 9% compared to the prior year due to lower chemical product
prices and higher LCCP (Lake Charles Chemicals Project) operating cost. As the LCCP
progresses through the sequential beneficial operation schedule, the costs associated with
relevant units are expensed while the gross margin contribution follows the ramp-up profile
and inventory build. We expect a closer match between margin and costs for the LCCP to be
achieved from 2020.
EBIT (Earnings before interest and tax) decreased 45% to R9,7 billion, largely due to
significant remeasurement items of R18,6 billion (US$1,3 billion) recorded in the current year
resulting from softer chemical prices as well as the higher than anticipated capital spend on
the LCCP.

Core headline earnings per share (CHEPS)(2) increased 5% to R38,13 compared to the prior
year. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased 12% to R30,72 per share compared to
the prior year. The increase in core headline earnings continues to reflect our cash flow
generating ability from our foundation businesses despite weaker chemicals pricing.

Balance sheet management
Cash generated by operating activities increased to R51 billion compared to R43 billion in
the prior year. This was largely attributable to favourable Brent crude oil prices and the
exchange rate, together with our strong working capital performance. These benefits were
offset by softer chemical prices and losses attributable to the LCCP incurring costs with
limited corresponding returns while in ramp-up phase.

Our net cash on hand position decreased from R17,0 billion to R15,8 billion as at 30 June
2019.
Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R56 billion. This includes R30
billion (US$2,1 billion) relating to the LCCP. The higher LCCP capital cash flows and
significant impairments recorded increased our gearing to 56,3%, which is above our
previous market guidance of 44 - 49%.

We continue to actively manage the balance sheet with the objective of maintaining a robust
liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile. Active balance sheet management will
remain a key ongoing focus during this peak gearing phase.

During 2019, we refinanced the US$4 billion LCCP asset-based facility in two phases,
initially by the issue of US$2,25 billion of US dollar-denominated bonds and thereafter by a
US$1,8 billion 5-year bank loan financing (with a net debt: EBITDA covenant of 3,0 times).

The US dollar bond issue was Sasol's first such issuance since the inaugural US$1 billion
10-year bond issued in 2012. The issuance comprised a US$1,5 billion 5,5-year bond and a
US$0,75 billion 10-year bond. This refinancing enabled Sasol to optimise our mix of funding
instruments between bank loans and bond market, while at the same time extending the
maturity of the debt profile from 2021 to as far out as 2028. An additional benefit of
refinancing away from asset-based security was that S when relying on forward-looking statements to make
investment decisions, you should carefully consider both these factors and other
uncertainties and events. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date on which
they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

OUTCOMES OF THE INDEPENDENT BOARD REVIEW AND EXECUTIVE
TRANSITION PLAN

Following the publication of revised guidance for the Lake Charles Chemicals Project
(LCCP) on 22 May 2019, the Board of Directors (Board) of the Company
commissioned an independent review (the Review), which was conducted by global
consulting firms at the direction of external legal counsel.

The Company's announcement on 22 May 2019 set out the principal factors that had
resulted in an increase in the LCCP capital cost guidance relative to the previous
estimate that was issued on 8 February 2019:

1. Adjustments to the February 2019 cost forecast of approximately $530 million,
   comprising:
   -   Duplication of investment allowances of approximately $230 million.
   -   Correction for certain contracts and variation orders of approximately $180
       million.
   -   Forecast improvements not expected to be realised and adjustments for
       potential insurance claims and procurement back-charges of approximately
       $120 million.
2. Additional events and remaining work impacting the February 2019 cost forecast
   of approximately $470 million, comprising:
   -   Repair and replacement of defective components and related impacts on units
       such as the Ethane Cracker, Ethylene Oxide / Ethylene Glycol and Utilities of
       approximately $210 million; and
   -   Remaining work and finishing activities, primarily on the Low Density
       Polyethylene, Ziegler, Alumina and Guerbet units of approximately $260
       million.
3. A contingency amount for items that could impact the cost forecast of $300
   million.

Additionally, throughout the LCCP, there have been adverse weather conditions and
related productivity issues, including but not limited to the impacts of Hurricane
Harvey in 2017.

Based on remediation measures taken, the Board is confident that the cost to
completion estimate for the LCCP, confirmed by the Board's most recent
assessment of LCCP management's reporting, is tracking the 22 May 2019
announced cost guidance range of between $12,6 billion and $12,9 billion. The
Board also remains comfortable that the principal factors for the cost increase as
identified in the 22 May 2019 market guidance are sound, and that criminal conduct
is not one of those factors.

Outcomes of the Review

The purpose of the Review was to consider the circumstances that may have
delayed the prompt identification and reporting of these developments, root causes,
and the legal consequences thereof. The Review, which is legally privileged, has
now been concluded.

The Board has made the following key conclusions:

-   The primary responsibility for shortcomings in relation to LCCP lies with the
    former leadership of the LCCP's Project Management Team (PMT), which
    engaged in conduct that was inappropriate, demonstrated a lack of competence,
    and was not transparent. However, on balance, the Board finds that there is not
    sufficient evidence to conclude that these individuals acted with an intent to
    defraud.

-   In addition, certain governance shortcomings relating to the LCCP also
    contributed, including a culture of excess deference within the control
    environment and governance structures that oversaw the LCCP.

-   No earnings, financial position, or cash flow restatements are required.

Some of the driving factors behind the cost and schedule increases are common in
projects of the size and nature of the LCCP, but some are shortcomings that may
have been avoided.

In light of these findings, the Board has concluded that appropriate steps need to be
taken to ensure appropriate accountability, to re-establish trust in the Company and
its leadership, and to assist in promoting a culture of ""constructive dialogue"" across
the organisation.

Specific Causal Factors

The Board has identified multiple causal factors that affected the prompt
identification and reporting of the errors, omissions, and inaccuracies in the project
cost estimate that underpinned the 8 February 2019 market guidance and which
were described in the 22 May 2019 announcement. This was based on a substantial
amount of independent work and included additional substantive and analytical
testing procedures on LCCP capital expenditures, accruals, and associated
transactions during the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2019.

The causal factors include:
-   Competence - Insufficient experience within the LCCP leadership team in
    executing mega projects.

-   Conduct - Inappropriate conduct and an improper tone at the top of the LCCP,
    including an excessive focus on maintaining cost and schedule estimates at the
    expense of providing accurate cost and schedule estimation to oversight bodies
    (including Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers (Joint CEOs)) within the
    Company.

-   Segregation of duties - Insufficient segregation of duties of the LCCP project
    controls environment from the LCCP project execution environment, which
    prevented the identification of certain potential errors in cost and schedule
    estimation.

-   Control procedures - Inadequate control procedures within the LCCP control
    environment that allowed erroneous and/or unsupported reporting by the LCCP
    leadership to go unchallenged without proper escalation of potential red flags.

-   Ethics process - Inadequate procedures to ensure that internal ethics complaints
    as to the LCCP were escalated appropriately.

-   Project-related Control Environment - A culture of excess deference within the
    control environment that oversaw the LCCP caused certain individuals with
    control responsibilities and in oversight committees, including but not limited to
    the Steering Committee created to oversee the LCCP, to exhibit insufficient
    scepticism toward reporting by the LCCP leadership team.

It is the Board's assessment that the former leadership of the LCCP PMT's conduct
was inappropriate, demonstrated a lack of competence, and was not transparent.
These, coupled with governance shortcomings, were the primary factors in relation
to the prompt identification and reporting of developments relating to the LCCP's
costs and schedule between 1 January 2019 and 22 May 2019. The Board believes
these factors compromised the ability of the various LCCP governance structures,
including the Board in relation to LCCP matters, to perform their oversight role
effectively on behalf of shareholders.

Remediation

A number of significant remediations and consequence management steps have
already been implemented or initiated to hold the responsible individuals to account
and to address the shortcomings identified during the Review. These include:

-   Reassigned oversight and accountability for the LCCP to a new Executive Vice
    President as of 1 April 2019 and added additional project management resources
    to the LCCP.

-   Implemented a new LCCP controls structure, independent from the LCCP's
    execution activities, and redesigned controls on cost reporting regarding the
    LCCP to ensure segregation of duties, control effectiveness, and appropriate
    oversight.
-   Commissioned additional external assurance work to validate aspects of the
    Company's estimates regarding the LCCP's cost and schedule.

-   Engaged in consequence management, including initiating disciplinary action
    against the Executive Vice President previously in charge of the LCCP and
    removing him from all work responsibilities, and effected the negotiated
    separation from the Company of the three Senior Vice Presidents with roles in
    the project.

-   For FY2019, the Joint CEOs were awarded zero as the value of their short-term
    incentive.

-   For FY2019, all members of the Group Executive Committee (GEC) were
    awarded zero as the value of their short-term incentive.

-   Reduced incentives awards for individuals company-wide based on relation
    and/or proximity to LCCP.

-   Requiring that various employees involved in the LCCP and/or its oversight
    engage in additional training, including on reporting obligations.

-   Re-evaluating the effectiveness of the finance function holistically with a specific
    focus on parts of the function supporting Sasol's business in the United States,
    which will be led by the Audit Committee.

-   Continuing with the roll-out of the Aspirational Culture programme within the
    entire Group and reconfirming critical leadership behaviours on a Group-wide
    basis.

-   Revising the Company's procedures regarding the escalation of ethics complaints
    and internal investigation findings.

The Board believes, however, that further remedial steps are required to embed a
new culture at all levels in the Company. At the leadership level, there needs to be
more robust challenge of key decision making. At the LCCP, the Company's
executive leadership placed too much trust in the PMT leadership. A spirit of
""constructive dialogue"" which includes empowering challenge and avoiding
conformity, needs to extend though the Company so that people always feel able
and free to speak up without fear for their prospects.

To address this, in addition to ongoing culture transformation initiatives, the
Company intends to focus on promoting leaders who have demonstrated their ability
to promote transparency and constructive dialogue.

Further Accountability Measures

With the LCCP now nearing completion, the Board firmly believes that this strategic
project will soon start delivering significant strategic and financial benefits to our
shareholders and other stakeholders, and will help Sasol to gain a competitive
position in a growing international chemicals market.

However, it is a matter of profound regret for the Board that shortcomings in the
execution of the LCCP have negatively impacted our overall reputation, led to a
serious erosion of confidence in the leadership of the Company and weakened the
Company financially. Sadly, the LCCP challenges have tarnished the entire
Company, which has world-class assets and teams that have delivered a
consistently strong performance.

The Board has resolved to ensure that the Company lives its values and to ensure
that there is a culture of accountability and consequence management. It is also the
judgment of the Board that, for trust to be restored in the Company, a leadership
reset is required.

It is in this light that Mr. Bongani Nqwababa and Mr. Stephen Cornell, Joint CEOs,
have agreed to an amicable mutual separation with the Company. Effective 31
October 2019, Bongani and Stephen will step down as Joint CEOs, and as executive
directors of Sasol and its subsidiaries. To be clear, the Board has neither identified
misconduct nor incompetence on the part of the Joint CEOs.

The Board has appointed Mr. Fleetwood Grobler, EVP: Chemicals, to assume the
role of President and CEO and as an executive director, with effect of 1 November
2019.

Dr Mandla Gantsho, Chairman of Sasol, said: ""I would like to thank Bongani and
Stephen for their long and loyal service to Sasol, and for showing exemplary
leadership by putting the interests of the company first in agreeing to step down to
allow for a leadership reset.""

Dr Gantsho added: ""With Fleetwood assuming the role of President and CEO, Mr.
Brad Griffith, currently Senior Vice President: Performance Chemicals, has been
appointed as EVP: Chemicals with effect from 1 November 2019. Fleetwood will
retain oversight responsibility over the final stages of LCCP, with the SVP currently
responsible for the construction of the remaining units of the LCCP continuing to
report to him.""

Dr Gantsho also remarked: ""With the Board Review completed, and key remedial
actions already implemented or underway, Sasol is now focused on restoring trust
and ensuring that it delivers value for all its stakeholders.""

He concluded: ""Sasol remains rooted in our South African heritage, and we are
determined to transition towards a fully-fledged integrated international chemicals
and energy company. With his background in both Synfuels and Chemicals business
for over 35 years, Fleetwood enjoys the full confidence of the Board and is uniquely
placed to lead the Company in the next phase of its value-based growth.""

Update on independent Board review and release of 2019 annual financial
results

On 16 August 2019, Sasol announced that the Board of Directors of Sasol (the
Board) had decided to delay the announcement of the Company's financial results
for the year ended 30 June 2019 (2019 financial results) which were due to be
released on 19 August 2019 and that the Board expected to release them on
19 September 2019. This delay was to allow for the completion of the assessment of
possible internal control weaknesses identified during the independent review
announced by the Board previously.

The Board has resolved to commission additional work under the independent
review and to stipulate for in-depth investigation into certain aspects contemplated
under the original scope. This will allow a complete and thorough investigation,
enabling the effective conclusion of the audit of the Company's 2019 financial
results. This work includes an assessment as to whether any identified control
weakness and root cause of the changes in the cost and schedule of the Lake
Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) were present in the previous financial year and/or
in the technology function of the Sasol group.

The Board is focused on resolving this as soon as possible and all efforts are being
made to get to a swift outcome without compromising the integrity of the processes
underway. Additional resources have been deployed by the independent experts to
complete the review by mid-October 2019. The external audit work is being
conducted in parallel with the independent review and will be completed shortly
thereafter, with the objective of releasing the audited 2019 financial results by no
later than Friday, 31 October 2019. A further announcement will be made as soon as
the Board has determined the date on which the 2019 financial results will be
released.

The Board is mindful of the Company's financial reporting obligations to regulators
and shareholders under the applicable South African and United States regulatory
requirements and will do all within its control to meet its obligations in that regard.

At the date of this announcement, nothing has come to the attention of the Board
that necessitates a revision of the guidance on the earnings ranges provided in the
trading statement of 25 July 2019 and the cost guidance for the LCCP of
US$12,6 - 12,9 billion provided on 22 May 2019.

Update on Sasol's Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) Ethane Cracker unit

As noted in our 16 August 2019 communication, a problem relating to a large heat
exchanger on our Ethane Cracker which interrupted the start-up for several days
was successfully resolved and start-up resumed.

We are currently halfway through achieving our 72 hour beneficial operation
production test run on the Ethane Cracker.

On 24 August 2019, we reached the important milestone of producing ethylene at
the LCCP that meets the feedstock requirements of some of our downstream units.
However, the ethylene produced is marginally below polymer grade specification due
to the acetylene reactor system that is not performing as expected. Efforts to
upgrade ethylene to polymer grade specification are underway with the support of
the catalyst supplier and the technology licensor.

We are currently operating the plant stably at a capacity utilisation of around fifty
percent which is in line with our ramp-up plan. The ability to manage our facilities
and meet our production needs in the US as an integrated site, now allows us the
flexibility to consume this ethylene produced internally and to place it externally.

The further ramp up in volumes will be executed as these current operational issues
are resolved.

The completion of all other downstream derivative units has continued to advance.
However, schedule pressure is evident in most areas and the latest forecast for
beneficial operation dates of the units is provided below:

    Low Density Polyethylene              November 2019 (previously mid October 2019)
    Ziegler                               January 2020 (previously January 2020)
    Ethoxylates                           January 2020 (previously December 2019)
    Guerbet                               March 2020 (previously February 2020)


As a consequence of these technical issues and the revised beneficial operation
dates, the LCCP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) guidance for the 2020 financial year has been adjusted from US$300-350
million to US$150-300 million.

Notwithstanding the revisions to the beneficial operation dates, the cost guidance for
the LCCP of US$12,6-12,9 billion remains unchanged. We remain confident that the
incremental costs resulting from the delay can be absorbed within the existing base
cost and contingency buffer.

UPDATE ON SASOL BOARD REVIEW, DELAY OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS
ANNOUNCEMENT AND UPDATE ON THE LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS
PROJECT

In the Company's Trading Statement of 25 July 2019, updated guidance was
provided on the independent review commissioned by the Board to ascertain the
factors that impacted the cost and schedule changes for the Lake Charles Chemicals
Project (LCCP).

A preliminary report from the independent review was presented to the Board on 14
August 2019. The report contains observations which point to possible LCCP control
weaknesses. Management and the Board will assess such control weaknesses and
identify whether any further remedial actions are required. In addition, the
Company's auditors are required to consider these assessments in terms of
International Standards on Auditing and the Auditing Standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board.

As a consequence, the Board has decided to delay the announcement of Sasol's
2019 financial results until the independent review and external audit has been
completed. The Board therefore expects to announce the 2019 financial results on
19 September 2019. At that time, Sasol will also release its suite of reports including
the Annual Financial Statements, Annual Integrated Report, Sustainable
Development Report, Climate Change Report and Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Notwithstanding the independent review, the Board remains confident that the
guidance on the earnings ranges provided in the Trading Statement and the previous
cost guidance for the LCCP of $12,6-12,9 billion remain unchanged.


LCCP UPDATE

Sasol provided an update on the LCCP in its Trading Statement of 25 July 2019, in
which the Company stated that beneficial operation of the Ethane Cracker was
expected at the end of July 2019 or soon thereafter.

The final stages of the Ethane Cracker startup were initiated in July 2019. As is
often the case with major plant startups, a technical challenge relating to a large heat
exchanger was encountered. As a result, the Cracker startup was interrupted for
several days to resolve this issue. The startup has now resumed and an update on
the achievement of beneficial operation will be provided on or before 26 August
2019.

TRADING STATEMENT AND LCCP UPDATE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

Trading update

Sasol's foundation business is expected to deliver resilient results with a strong
volume, cost and working capital performance, despite a weak macroeconomic
environment resulting in lower chemical prices and petrol differentials.

There are a number of non-cash adjustments to the results which will result in a
decrease in earnings per share. The largest of these were the sizable impairments of
relevant cash generating units (CGUs) due to the softer outlook for global chemical
and gas prices and the higher capital spend on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project
(LCCP). In addition, as the LCCP progresses through the sequential beneficial
operation schedule, the costs associated with relevant units are expensed while the
gross margin contribution follows the ramp-up profile and inventory build.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA*) is expected to decline by between 4% and 14% compared to R51,5 billion in
the prior year, despite the 19% increase in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil.
This is mainly as a result of the negative EBITDA contribution from the LCCP and the
impact of softer chemical margins.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 is
expected to increase by between 7% and 17% (approximating R1,92 to R4,66 per
share) compared to the prior year HEPS of R27,44. Core headline earnings per share
(CHEPS) is expected to increase by between 1% and 11% (approximating R0,36 to
R4,00 per share) compared to the CHEPS for 2018 of R36,38. CHEPS is adjusted for
once-off items, which includes operating losses from the LCCP during ramp-up.

Earnings per share (EPS) for the 2019 financial year is expected to decrease by
between 46% and 56% (approximating R6,56 to R7,99 per share) from the prior year
EPS of R14,26 as a result of higher impairments recorded in the financial year.

Sasol´s earnings for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 have been significantly
impacted by the following remeasurement items before tax:

    1. North American value chain R12,9 billion (US$914 million). The Ethylene
       Oxide/Ethylene Glycol (EO/EG) CGU and the Tetramerization (TET) CGU
       were impaired by R5,5 billion (US$388 million) and R7,4 billion (US$526
       million) respectively. The impairments were mostly as a result of an
       increase in capital cost for the LCCP and softer forecasted US ethylene and
       global Mono-ethylene Glycol (MEG) prices based on the latest expert
      consultants' macro-economic assumptions as at 30 June 2019.

    2. The Ammonia CGU in the Southern African value chain was impaired by
       R3,3 billion mainly as a result of much softer forecasted international
       ammonia sales prices.

    3. The Canadian shale gas business was further impaired by R1,9 billion
       (CAD181 million) during the financial year.

Given the above financial performance, our gearing is expected to increase above our
previous market guidance of 49%, however we expect the net debt to EBITDA to
remain well below our debt covenant level of 3,0 times. We continue to progress our
asset portfolio optimisation strategy, with further details to be provided during the
results announcement.
A detailed production summary and key business performance metrics for the financial
year for all of our businesses, including our hedging activities, is available on our
website, www.sasol.com. The salient features are:

   - Mining productivity improved by 5%, with a 22% decrease in external
     purchases.
   - Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) achieved an excellent performance
     post the total West factory shutdown, enabling full year production levels in
     line with our prior year.
   - Liquid fuels sales volumes increased by 2% to 60 million barrels, exceeding
     previous market guidance.
   - Base Chemicals sales volumes (excluding Polymers US products) showed a
     strong recovery during the second half of the financial year, exceeding our
     previous market guidance.
   - High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) production volume in the US was 218kt.
     The Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and EO/EG plants are
     ramping up, and achieved saleable production of 103kt and 41kt,
     respectively.
   - Performance Chemicals sales volumes declined by 3% due to external
     supply constraints and a softer macro-environment. The Speciality Chemical
     portfolio remains resilient.

We are also pleased to report that agreement has been reached with the South
African Revenue Services to withdraw all the issued and pending assessments for
the crude oil procurement matter relating to Sasol Oil for financial years 1999 to
2016.

Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) update
The LCCP remains in line with the revised cost estimate provided in May 2019 and
is mostly tracking schedule. As at the end of June 2019, overall project completion
is at 98%. Engineering and procurement activities are substantially complete and
construction progress is at 94%. The Ethane Cracker start-up sequence has
commenced and we expect beneficial operation (BO) by the end of July or shortly
thereafter. We are experiencing some schedule pressure on the Low Density
Polyethylene (LDPE) plant and expect BO to be delayed by four to six weeks as it
has taken longer than planned to complete the construction, as well as the cleaning
and preparation of critical equipment. While the Ethoxylates (ETO) and Guerbet
plants are currently tracking schedule as previously announced, the Ziegler unit BO
is expected to be delayed by four to eight weeks mainly due to slower piping hydro-
testing completion. Mitigation plans are in place to minimise the delay to the
maximum extent possible.
When updated guidance was provided on the LCCP in May 2019, it was
announced that the Board was to undertake an independent review on the project.
The review is ongoing and is conducted by independent external experts. It is an
in depth exercise entailing the review of a voluminous amount of documents and
numerous interviews. As a result, it is anticipated that a report on this review will
be submitted to the Board by the end of August 2019. The Board will be convened
shortly thereafter to consider the report, following which an update will be
provided.

All references to years refer to the financial year ended 30 June.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol's financial
results for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 will be announced on Monday,
19 August 2019.



* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation,
amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement items, change in discount
rates of our rehabilitation provisions, unrealised translation gains and losses, and
unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities.

** Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items,
period close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects
(exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still
ramping up, and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE
transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our
derivatives at period end are to remove volatility from earnings as these
instruments are valued using forward curves and other market factors at the
reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline
earnings are a useful measure of the group's sustainable operating performance.
However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The aforementioned
adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The adjustments have
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and due to their nature, may not fairly
present Sasol's financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash
flows.

Sasol achieves beneficial operation of second Lake Charles Chemicals Project production
unit; ratings and funding covenant update

Sasol provided an update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) in an announcement on 22
May 2019. The announcement included reference to the fact that beneficial operation of the Ethylene
Glycol (EG) facility had been achieved, with the beneficial operation of the Ethylene Oxide (EO)
facility expected within days.

Sasol is pleased to announce that the EO facility achieved beneficial operation on 31 May 2019. The
combined EO/EG unit is the second of the seven LCCP production units to come online.

Management continues to take actions to mitigate the impact of LCCP's revised capital cost on the
business, whilst ensuring these actions do not adversely impact Sasol's long term sustainability.
Sasol still expects peak gearing in FY19 and with net debt to EBITDA for FY19 remaining within the
2,0 – 2,3x guidance range. The net debt to EBITDA covenant applicable to the $3,9bn Revolving
Credit Facility has been amended from 2,5x to 3,0x.

Following the LCCP announcement, Standard & Poor's and Moody's both affirmed Sasol's investment
grade rating, with Moody's amending its outlook to negative.

UPDATE ON THE LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (""LCCP"")

In the Company's trading statement, released by the Stock Exchange News Service
on 8 February 2019, updated guidance was provided for the LCCP's schedule and
capital costs, which were estimated in the range of $11,6 to $11,8 billion. Following
this announcement a number of changes were made to the management of the
LCCP, with project accountability immediately reassigned to the Executive Vice
President of Chemicals, Fleetwood Grobler and the strengthening of our project
controls organisation.

This team became concerned regarding the accuracy of the project's cost forecast
and, as a consequence, our third quarter Business Performance Metrics
announcement in April 2019 indicated that the LCCP's cost was tracking the upper
end of the range. Management also initiated a full review of the costs and schedule
until project completion with input from independent technical and financial advisers.

This review identified significant additional concerns related to the LCCP forecasting
process and a marked increase in the projected total cost. The review also confirmed
that the actual project expenditure (as at 31 December 2018) amounting to $10,9
billion was accurate and complete. Weaknesses in the project's integrated controls
were identified and are being remediated.

The Board has also commissioned a review to be conducted by independent
external experts. This review will cover the circumstances that may have delayed the
prompt identification and reporting of the above-mentioned matters. Upon conclusion
of the review, the Board will take appropriate action to address the findings.


UPDATE ON KEY PROJECT PARAMETERS

-   The first derivative unit, Linear Low Density Polyethylene, achieved beneficial
    operation on 13 February 2019 and the plant continues to ramp up in line with
    expectations.

-   We have achieved beneficial operation of the Ethylene Glycol unit (EG), with
    beneficial operation of the Ethylene Oxide unit (EO) expected in the coming days.

-   The Ethane Cracker is still expected to achieve beneficial operation in July 2019.

-   The remainder of the LCCP schedule for beneficial operation is as previously
    indicated in February 2019 apart from the beneficial operation of the last
    derivative plant (Guerbet unit), which is expected to be one month later in
    February 2020.

-   As of the end of March 2019, overall project completion was at 96%, with
   construction completion at 89% and capital expenditure on the project amounted
   to $11,4 billion.

Following the review noted above, the cost estimate for the LCCP has been revised
to a range of $12,6 to $12,9 billion which includes a contingency of $300 million. The
principal factors that impacted the revised cost estimate to complete the LCCP are
as follows:

1. Adjustments to the February 2019 cost forecast – approximately $530 million

   -   Correction for duplication of investment allowances of approximately $230
       million.
   -   Correction for certain contracts and variation orders managed by Sasol,
       outside the primary engineering, procurement and construction contract, of
       approximately $180 million.
   -   Forecast improvements not expected to be realised and adjustments for
       potential insurance claims and procurement back-charges of approximately
       $120 million.

2. Additional events and remaining work impacting February 2019 cost forecast -
   approximately $470 million

    Ethane Cracker, EO/EG and Utilities - approximately $210 million:
   -   Work to correct previously identified defective carbon steel forgings
       significantly impacted critical path activities with a greater than expected cost
       impact. This included the removal and re-instatement of insulation,
       instrumentation and cabling, as well as post repair heat treatment.
   -   Replacement of the internals of numerous heat exchangers due to corrosion.
   -   The completion of painting, insulation and fireproofing at the Ethane Cracker
       and EO/EG was impacted as a result of the necessary repair activities
       outlined above.

    Remaining Work – primarily Low Density Polyethylene and Ziegler / Alumina /
    Guerbet units - approximately $260 million
   -   The review identified a significant increase in required finishing activities
       such as heat tracing, insulation, fireproofing and associated work as well as
       additional infrastructure costs.

3. A contingency amount for items that could impact the cost forecast - $300 million

   -   Worse than anticipated weather impact.
   -   Lower than assumed productivity and associated time extension.
   -   A new risk identified relating to bolting materials that may need to be
       replaced.
   -   Other unforeseen items impacting finishing and commissioning activities.


ACTIONS TAKEN TO DATE

This increase in the anticipated LCCP capital costs is extremely disappointing.
Executive management has implemented several changes since February 2019 to
further strengthen the oversight, leadership for the project and frequency of
reporting. Actions include segregation of duties between project controls and
finance functions and assigning a Senior Vice President to have responsibility for the
LCCP project controls. Initiatives to improve decision making, transparency and
documentation within the project management team are also in progress. The new
project leadership has been instrumental in identifying and remediating these issues.

The reviews and investigations initiated by management to date indicate that any
impact on the underlying controls are limited to the LCCP.


FINANCIAL IMPACT

The increase in the LCCP's cost does not alter Sasol's capital allocation strategy.
The plan remains to reduce balance sheet gearing towards 30% followed by an
increase in the dividend pay-out ratio to 40% and remains on track to occur between
financial years 2020 to 2023. Over this period the anticipated contribution from the
LCCP has been negatively impacted by a change in the short and medium term
pricing outlook. Operating costs for the LCCP, although projected to be slightly
elevated during start-up, are otherwise still in line with previous guidance. As a result
the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for
financial year 2022 of $1,3 billion have been revised to approximately $1 billion. The
long term market pricing outlook is still in support of a long term run rate EBITDA
contribution from the LCCP of $1,3 billion. The short term market outlook for ethane
and product pricing remains volatile and estimates will be updated periodically.

In light of the increase in capital costs as well as the latest market pricing outlook, the
forecast internal rate of return for the LCCP has declined from 7,5% to 6,0 - 6,5%.
The larger part of this move comes from the change in chemical pricing assumptions
given that a US10 cents change in ethane pricing impacts the EBITDA by
approximately $150 million per annum.

The increased capital cost will result in the gearing level for Sasol remaining
elevated for 18 to 24 months. Based on current assumptions, peak gearing is still
expected to occur during financial year 2019 with forecast net debt to EBITDA
remaining within the 2,0 to 2,3x guidance range. The Company's balance sheet
continues to be actively managed in order to maintain a robust liquidity position and
debt maturity profile. As part of this the Company recently issued a $2,25 billion bond
which was used to partly settle the LCCP's project asset finance facility. The
Company has been successful in extending the maturity profile of the debt portfolio
over the last few years with the first significant repayment due in 3,5 years
(November 2022). Efforts to further to optimise the maturity profile continue as the
Company executes its value based strategy and moves towards targeted gearing
levels. Retaining the Company's investment grade credit rating remains a priority.

Several additional management actions have been identified and are in the process
of being implemented in an effort to conserve cash over the following 12 to18
months. These actions are focussed on further cash fixed cost savings, capital
portfolio optimisation, working capital improvements and asset disposals at value.

As previously communicated to the market, management has substantially
completed the detailed asset review programme. This process forms a key part of
the portfolio optimisation strategy, and has now progressed to the stage where the
disposal of larger non-core assets can be accelerated. The Company will target the
disposal of assets which have an aggregate net asset value exceeding $2 billion.
The safeguarding of value will be prioritised through this process, and the financial
metrics disclosed above do not rely on any asset disposals. Relevant disposals will
therefore further support the deleveraging of the balance sheet, as well as
simplification of the investment portfolio and increased focus in executing our value
based strategy.

The financial information on which the LCCP update is based has not been reviewed
or reported on by the Company's external auditors.

SASOL PUBLISHES PRODUCTION AND SALES METRICS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2019

Sasol has published its production and sales performance metrics for the nine months
ended 31 March 2019 on the Company's website at www.sasol.com, under the Investor
Centre section or via this URL: https://www.sasol.com/investor-centre/financial-
reporting/business-performance-metrics

Overview
Sasol delivered an improved quarterly production and sales performance. Our production
volumes have stabilised post the total West factory shutdown at our Secunda Synfuels
Operations (SSO) during the first half of FY19. Our Lake Charles Chemicals Project
(LCCP) is progressing with the continued ramp-up of the linear low density
polyethylene (LLDPE) unit, following the achievement of beneficial operation (BO) of
this unit in February 2019.

Operating Business Units
Mining productivity continues to track towards targeted productivity levels. Our
productivity rate improved by 10% from the previous year to 1 170 t/cm/s for the
period ending 31 March 2019 and our stock piles have been managed optimally to fully
meet internal customer demand. Current indications are that Mining will achieve
production levels of approximately 38 million tons for the full year, aligned to the
requirements of our value chain customers. At our Mozambican upstream operations, we
delivered a robust production performance, in line with expectations. We expect to
achieve our production target of between 114 - 118 bscf for FY19.

Regional Operating Hubs
Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) maintained stable production in Q3 FY19, continuing
to support a normalised run-rate of 7,8 million tons per annum. Stable production at
SSO has enabled us to offset the previously reported 6% reduction in production
volumes for the 1H FY19, now resulting in a 3% reduction in volumes compared to the
prior year. We expect to achieve the upper end of our planned production targets of
7,5 - 7,6 million tons for the year. In Sasolburg, Natref continued with its improved
performance and achieved a production run rate of 636m³/h for FY19 year to date, and
our Sasolburg operations continue to deliver stable production post the planned
shutdowns. In Europe, our operations were negatively impacted by a force majeure on
external ethylene supplies into our Marl site, resulting in a reduction in production
volumes for FY19 year to date.
Strategic Business Units
Our Energy business exceeded our prior period liquid fuels sales volumes by 4%,
enabled through higher SSO and Natref production. We remain on track to achieve the
upper end of our previous sales volumes market guidance of approximately 57 - 58
million barrels. We are pursuing our retail strategy and opened five new Retail
Convenience Centres (RCCs) and divested from four non-profitable RCCs year to date.
We continue to target 15 new RCCs for the financial year. ORYX GTL achieved an average
utilisation rate of 86%, as a result of the extended shutdown.

Base Chemicals delivered a strong performance in Q3 FY19 which resulted in a 9%
improvement in volumes compared to Q2 FY19. The Base Chemicals business (excluding US
produced products) achieved a 6% improvement in volumes compared to Q2 FY19 post the
extended SSO shutdowns during 1H FY19. This was enabled by largely stable operations
at our production facilities in South Africa. At our US Polymers businesses, the high
density polyethylene (HDPE) plant continues to ramp up production during this
financial year and the plant is expected to achieve an average utilisation rate of 80
- 90% for the full year. Our new LLDPE plant, one of the LCCP units, reached beneficial
operation during Q3 FY19 and management continues to focus on the successful ramp-up
of the plant. Notwithstanding the 6% decrease year to date in overall Base Chemicals
sales volumes compared to the prior year, we maintain our expectation that our annual
sales volumes (excluding US produced products) will be 1% lower compared to the
previous financial year.

Performance Chemicals sales volumes increased by 4% quarter on quarter but decreased
by 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the force majeure in Europe in Q2
FY19, planned shutdowns and a softer macro-environment in Europe and Asia. As a
consequence of a slower recovery from unplanned supply constraints, we expect our
sales volumes for the full year to be 1 - 2% below the previous year (excluding LCCP).
In Rand terms, we have seen continued strong margins over the reporting period.

Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)
At Lake Charles, we continue to focus on safely improving productivity in the field
and bringing the plants to mechanical completion and then beneficial operation. The
project continued with its exceptional safety record with a RCR of 0,11. Overall
project completion is at 96%. We are tracking the schedule and the upper end of the
cost estimate provided to the market in February 2019. We expect the Ethylene Oxide
/ Ethylene Glycol unit to reach beneficial operation in June 2019 as per previous
guidance.

Market Performance
During the period ending 31 March 2019, we experienced higher average crude oil prices
compared to the prior year, which benefitted our Energy business. This was offset by
weaker refining margins, due to lower petrol differentials. Our chemicals businesses
are experiencing softer prices in some end-markets. The group benefitted from the
weaker exchange rate during the period ending 31 March 2019 compared to the prior
year.
Conclusion
Overall, operational stability has been restored as we head towards the end of the
financial year. SSO's current production levels support a normalised run-rate of 7,8
million tons per annum. We have revised our ORYX average utilisation rate for the
year down to 83%. Performance Chemicals sales volumes have been revised to 1 - 2%
lower than the prior year (excluding LCCP). We have optimised our sales plans with
the aim of recovering the volumes lost as a result of the shutdowns and external
supply constraints.

- ORYX GTL utilisation at 99%
- Ethylene supply constraints result in 3% decrease in Performance Chemicals sales volumes
- Base Chemicals volumes down 11%, impacted by SSO shutdown

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa said:
""We recorded a satisfactory operational and financial performance against the backdrop of a volatile
macroeconomic environment and an uncertain geo-political climate, which impacted global demand
growth. Our production and sales performance was mixed with largely lower than expected production in the first
half of the financial year, mainly as a result of the longer than planned total shutdown at our Secunda Synfuels
Operations (SSO). However, our operational performance was enhanced by management interventions in previous
periods resulting in improved performances at Natref and Sasol Mining. Post the shutdowns, we are pleased to see
steady progress across our value chains.

As always, we remain focused on our key controllable factors, with safety, reliability of operations and cost
control being paramount. Our Continuous Improvement (CI) programme will be a key feature to deliver future
value to shareholders and improve our cost competitive advantage. This initiative is driven with the same
discipline and rigour that allowed us to deliver, and exceed expectations, on our Business Performance Enhancement
Programme and Response Plan targets.""

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell said:
""While the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) fundamentals remain firmly intact, we acknowledge the disappointing 
cost and schedule overrun. The project was impacted by several challenges, within and beyond our control, in the 
fourth quarter of the previous calendar year. Despite incremental cash flows from the project being deferred due to 
a schedule delay, we remain confident that the project will deliver the steady EBITDA(1) run-rate of US$1,3 billion 
in financial year 2022. While this update will have an impact on our cash flow inflection point and gearing, we continue 
to proactively protect our balance sheet, while managing the capital structure and gearing during these turbulent times. 
Our short-term focus remains on productivity in the field, process safety and progressing units to mechanical completion 
followed by beneficial operation. The linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) unit achieved beneficial operations on 
13 February 2019, and is the first of seven LCCP production units to come online.

Our commitment to sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders, is underpinned by driving our roadmap to deliver
on our financial and sustainability goals, as well as contributing meaningfully to inclusive growth and development 
of our fenceline communities.

We are mindful of the challenges we face, however, our management team is fully committed to ensuring Sasol is a
credible stakeholder partner with a compelling investment proposition that will deliver value to all stakeholders.""

Overview(1,2,3)
Our underlying cash generation remains sound, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA)(4) increasing by 10% when compared to the prior period and normalised cash fixed cost contained to below
our inflation target. Our earnings growth was, however, slower than expected due to volatility in the oil price and
lower than expected production and sales volumes. As we are in the commissioning phase of the LCCP production
units, the delay in income from these units will result in lower earnings due to costs being recognised without
corresponding revenues.

Earnings attributable to shareholders for the period ended 31 December 2018 increased by 114% to R14,7 billion
from R6,9 billion in the prior period, largely due to the significant remeasurement items recorded in the prior
period. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 32% to R23,25 per share and earnings per share (EPS)
increased by 112% to R23,92 per share compared to the prior period.

Core headline earnings per share (CHEPS)5 increased by 18% to R21,45 per share compared to the prior period,
mainly as a result of higher average crude and product prices, the effect of the weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate
and higher margins in specialty chemicals measured in rand terms. This was partially offset by lower than expected
production and sales volumes due to the extended shutdown at SSO and external ethylene supply constraints
which impacted our European operations. Post the shutdowns, we are seeing much improved production in all of
our units with SSO performing at run-rates indicative of 7,8 million tons (mt)/per annum. We expect steady
progress in the second half and production to be in line with previous market guidance.

Average crude oil prices moved higher by 26%, however in December 2018, we saw the oil price trending much
lower at ~ US$50/bbl highlighting the volatility in supply demand balances. Whilst we benefitted from the higher oil
price in the first quarter, we have to ensure that we remain focused on cost, cash and capital conservation to
sustainably operate in volatile periods.

Excluding the effect of our hedging programme, the average rand/US dollar market exchange rate of R14,20
weakened by 6% from the prior period and the closing exchange rate weakened by 5% from R13,73 in June 2018 to
R14,36 in December 2018. The weaker closing exchange rate negatively impacted gearing and the valuation of our
foreign exchange derivatives and loans.

The movement in macroeconomic factors can be summarised as follows:

Operational performance overview

Sasol experienced some challenges with regards to our operational performance in the first quarter of the year,
largely due to the extended planned shutdown at SSO which impacted production and sales volumes across the
value chain. We did however deliver a stronger operational performance in the second quarter of the year and are
maintaining stable operations. Our current production run-rates at SSO support an annualised run-rate of
7,8 million tons. In Europe, our operations maintained their good performance, but were affected by external
ethylene supply constraints which impacted sales volumes.

The highlights of our business performance are summarised below:
-   Mining's productivity continues to improve although we have not yet achieved targeted productivity levels. Our
    productivity rate improved by 8% from 1 099 t/cm/s in the prior period to 1 187 t/cm/s in December 2018. Supply
    to our internal value chain remains sufficient and our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working
    capital target. We are now planning to reduce external purchases to pre-2017 strike levels;

-   Production volumes from our Eurasian Operations decreased by 8% mainly resulting from external ethylene
    feedstock supply shortages and planned shutdowns;

-   ORYX GTL continued to deliver an exceptional performance, with an average utilisation rate of 99%;

-   Natref improved its performance by 43% and achieved a production run-rate of 641m3/h;

-   The planned Steam Station 2 shutdown at Sasolburg Operations (SO) was completed ahead of schedule and
    achieved stable operations post the shutdown. A detailed study was undertaken that proved the viability of
    specific SO assets, which are not gas dependent, to have a useful life beyond 2034. The useful life of these
    assets was therefore extended to 2050;

-   Liquid fuels sales volumes increased 4%, enabled by the strong performance from Natref, and increased sales to
    wholesale and commercial customers;

-   Sales volumes from our Performance Chemicals business decreased by 3%, mainly as a result of a force majeure
    in Europe triggered by external ethylene supply constraints; and

-   Base Chemicals sales volumes decreased by 11%, impacted by the extended shutdown at SSO and lower fertiliser
    demand. Our 50% joint venture high density polyethylene plant (HDPE) in the US with INEOS Olefins and
    Polymers USA is ramping up to expectations and delivered 91 kt of saleable product for Sasol for the six months.

A detailed production summary and key business performance metrics for the financial year for all our businesses
were published on our website, www.sasol.com, on 8 February 2019.

Cost, cash and capital performance
Cash fixed costs, excluding capital-growth and once-off business establishment costs, increased by 4,3% which is
1,7% below our inflation target. Our cost management processes remain a key focus to protect and improve our
competitive position, while ensuring that we maintain safe and sustainable operations. As indicated previously,
Sasol is targeting a longer term sustainable inflation rate of 6%.

Our net cash position decreased by 7%, from R17 billion in June 2018 to R16 billion as at 31 December 2018 mainly
due to the funding requirements of the LCCP. Loans raised during the period amounted to R28 billion, mainly for
funding of our growth projects. During the period, we utilised an additional US$1,7 billion of the US$3,9 billion
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), in order to meet the group's funding requirements. In addition, in September 2018
Sasol raised bonds in the US capital markets to the value of US$1,5 billion (maturity in 2024) and US$0,75 billion
(maturity in 2028), respectively. The proceeds of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding LCCP
project asset finance facility.

Working capital increased R2,1 billion from June 2018, mostly as a result of higher feedstock prices. Inventory
holding in days reduced by 11% compared to June 2018.

Cash generated by operating activities increased by 79% to R25 billion compared with R14 billion in the prior period.
This is largely attributable to favourable Brent crude oil and product prices and a weaker rand/US dollar exchange
rate.

Actual capital expenditure amounted to R30 billion. This includes R16 billion (US$1,1 billion) relating to the LCCP. Our
capital expenditure estimate for the full year has been revised to R52 billion largely due to optimisation of the
capital portfolio.

Due to funding of the LCCP, more than 85% of our debt is now US dollar denominated. Given the significantly
weaker closing exchange rate of R14,36, gearing increased to 48,9%, which is above our target and previous market
guidance. The exchange rate increased gearing by approximately 2% compared to our internal forecast. The higher
capital cash flows on the LCCP during November to December 2018 further impacted gearing increasing it to 48,9%.
Net debt to EBITDA increased to 2,17 times for the same reasons. While this is above our target of 2,0 times and
previous market guidance, our investment grade credit ratings remain intact. Notwithstanding the current oil price
and exchange rate volatility, as well as the increased expenditure on the LCCP, we still plan to manage the balance
sheet debt metrics to within investment grade credit ratings.

Our dividend policy is to pay dividends with a dividend cover range based on CHEPS. Taking into account the impact
of the current volatile macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, the current strength of our balance
sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a gross interim dividend of R5,90 per share
(18% higher compared to the prior period). The dividend cover is 3,6 times at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
3,6 times).

Update on hedging activities

Sasol continues to monitor opportunities to optimally protect its trading portfolio and balance sheet. The group
entered into a number of hedging transactions relating to the crude oil price, rand/US dollar exchange rate, ethane
price and the coal price.

Our hedging programme for financial year 2019 has been completed, with ~70% of our exposure to the rand/US
dollar exchange rate and ~80% of our oil exposure hedged. We are currently executing on our hedging programme
for financial year 2020 with US$613 million of our exposure to the rand/US dollar exchange rate already hedged as
at 31 December 2018. In January 2019, we hedged an additional US$87 million, thereby increasing our total cover to
US$700 million.

The current ethane hedging programme is being executed to cover the existing ethane cracker in the US. Hedging
for the LCCP cracker is planned to match the start-up schedule.

Should attractive hedges become available in the market at an acceptable cost, we will enter into additional hedges
in mitigation against these financial risks. The volumes hedged, exposure and floor prices for financial years 2019
and 2020 are detailed in the Analyst Book available on our website, www.sasol.com.

Continuous improvement (CI) and digitalisation

Our group wide CI programme, aimed at improving the robustness and competitiveness of our business, has a
medium-term target to increase our Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for our foundation businesses by at least
two percentage points by financial year 2022. The targeted ROIC increase is off a 30 June 2017 base, normalised for
remeasurement and once-off items, and excluding assets under construction.

To date, we have completed industry benchmarks against our global peers for the majority of our functions and
major value chains. Based on the outcome of these, a number of value enhancing opportunities with a high
probability to meet our financial year 2022 ROIC target have been identified. Approximately R2 billion of value has
been unlocked with specific gross margin, cash fixed costs and balance sheet initiatives in the first half of financial
year 2019. This benefit was offset by the impact of production interruptions during the period.

Digitalisation is a significant lever for our CI programme, with specific focus on improving the quality and availability
of data across all areas of the business to enable automation, advanced analytics and improved decision making
and operations.

We have made good progress with our focused asset review process. The majority of our reviewed assets will be
retained, with some earmarked for growth while others will be enhanced through detailed improvement plans.
Although the initial asset reviews are nearing completion, the asset portfolio will be continuously reviewed to
achieve a high grade portfolio and ensure optimal performance against our targets.

Effective tax rate

The decrease in our effective corporate tax rate from 31,6% to 24,1% was mainly as a result of the successful
outcome of the Sasol Oil tax litigation matter resulting in the reversal of the provision of R1,3 billion. The adjusted
effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted investments, remeasurements and once-off items, is 29,0%
compared to 26,4% in the prior period due to lower energy efficiency allowances.

Satisfactory operational performance, higher oil and product prices (1,3)

Operating Business Units

Mining - improving productivity rates while striving towards zero harm
Normalised earnings* decreased by 3% to R2,8 billion compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of lower
sales volumes to SSO and higher royalty taxes of R260 million associated with our capital expenditure. We did
however benefit from higher selling prices to SSO and a 12% increase in export coal prices, although our export
volumes were 6% lower when compared to the prior period.

Normalised unit cost of production increased by 5% to R299 per ton compared to the prior period, which is below our
inflation target. Our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working capital target and supply to our
internal value chain remains sufficient. We remain focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations and
increasing production in line with our internal plans. We are therefore targeting a normalised unit cost of
production of between R295 to R304 per ton for the full year.

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) - strong operational delivery from Mozambique and
Gabon
Normalised earnings* amounted to R812 million for the period.

Our Mozambican producing operations recorded an EBIT of R1,2 billion largely due to higher sales prices, which was
partly negated by lower demand in the Mozambican gas market. We maintained stable operations during the period
and remain on track to achieve our targeted volumes for the year.

Our Gabon asset recorded an EBIT of R335 million compared to R47 million for the prior period due to higher sales
prices and a 3% increase in production volumes.

Our Canadian shale gas asset in Montney generated an operating loss of R363 million compared to the operating
loss of R437 million excluding the partial impairment of R2,8 billion in the prior period.

Strategic Business Units

Energy - volume improvement offset by product mix margin impact
Our normalised earnings margin improved by 1% to 23% compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of higher
crude oil prices (48%), weaker rand/US dollar exchange rates (18%) and higher liquid fuels volumes (2%), partially
offset by the margin impact resulting from more sales volumes sourced from Natref as a result of the longer than
planned SSO shutdown (15%). Liquid fuels sales increased by 4% due to higher wholesale and commercial sales on
the back of higher SSO and Natref production. The higher sales to wholesale and commercial customers resulted in
lower margins relative to the retail channel which was impacted by poor market conditions in South Africa.

Normalised earnings* increased by 38% to R10 billion when compared to the prior period. We continued to focus
on cost containment and reduced our normalised cash fixed costs to R7,0 billion, which is 0,9% below inflation.

ORYX GTL contributed R956 million to EBIT mainly due to higher Brent crude oil prices and a 1% increase in
production volumes. ORYX GTL maintained the prior period average utilisation rate of 99%. In December 2018, a
leak was discovered in the waste heat boiler of one of the reformer reactors. We therefore expect to have an
extended shutdown to repair the waste heat boiler. We anticipate an average utilisation rate of 90% for the full
year.

In Nigeria, Escravos GTL (EGTL), production volumes were 25% lower compared to the prior period largely due to an
unplanned shutdown. Maintenance activities have since been completed and the plant is back in production.
Optimisation efforts to reduce costs and improve plant efficiency continue.

In line with our strategy to increase our South African retail presence, we continue to target 15 new Retail
convenience centres for the financial year, which will include greenfield developments as well as other oil company
conversions increasing our retail outlets to 411, excluding any divestments.

Performance Chemicals - robust market demand, adversely impacted by supply constraints
Sales volumes (normalised for the PASG transfer(1)) decreased by 3% compared to the prior period, mainly due to
planned shutdowns and a force majeure in Europe, triggered by external ethylene supply constraints. We continued
to take advantage of the strong demand for our organics and advanced materials products and expanded our
footprint in differentiated markets. The margins for our European and US specialty businesses remained strong in
rand terms, benefitting from robust demand and favourable market conditions.

Normalised earnings*, adjusted for the transfer of PASG to Base Chemicals, decreased by 8% to R3,7 billion
compared to the prior period, mainly due to lower sales volumes, growth costs associated with the LCCP and the
extended shutdown at SSO.

Our Organics business was impacted by the force majeure in Europe, however, in rand terms we have seen strong
margins over the period. Wax sales volumes decreased due to the disposal of our Alexandria Wax business in
financial year 2018, as well as lower paraffin sales. Our Advanced Materials business delivered a solid performance
and maintained robust margins. We expect our annual sales volumes (excluding LCCP) for Performance Chemicals
to be 1 to 2% higher than the prior year.

Excluding growth costs associated with our projects in the US and Brunsbuttel and foreign translation effects, cash
fixed costs were contained to 3,3% for the period, which is below our inflation target.

1  In line with Sasol's updated strategy, we have reorganised the Chemical portfolio to support our value-based 
   growth strategy. Consequently, we have transferred the Phenolics, Ammonia and Specialty Gases (PASG) results from 
   Performance Chemicals to Base Chemicals, effective 1 July 2018. Ammonia and Specialty Gases are managed by Energy. 
   The metrics have been restated for the transfer.

Base Chemicals - higher prices, but volumes under pressure
Our business benefitted from higher US dollar chemical prices with our average sales basket price increasing by
10%. We have seen a significant increase in our US Polymers basket sales price as we transitioned merchant
ethylene sales to downstream derivatives following the ramp-up of our HDPE plant. The HDPE price differential was
US$900/ton for the period compared to the spot merchant ethylene price of US$400/ton.

Sales volumes decreased by 11% mainly due to the extended planned shutdown at SSO and lower fertiliser demand.
Notwithstanding this decrease, we are expecting annual sales volumes (excluding US produced products), to be 1%
lower for the full year.

Normalised earnings*, adjusted for the transfer of PASG from Performance Chemicals, decreased by 15% to
R2,5 billion compared to the prior period mainly due to lower sales volumes. Our cash fixed costs, normalised for
growth and once-off items increased by only 2,9%, which is below our inflation target. Our results includes the
reversal of an impairment of R949 million (R683 million after tax) on our integrated ethylene assets in Sasolburg
due to the useful life extension from 2034 to 2050. The useful life extension further resulted in a lower depreciation
charge of R139 million which is partly offset by higher depreciation in the US with the new plants and infrastructure
reaching beneficial operation.

Our 50% joint venture HDPE plant with INEOS Olefins and Polymers USA is ramping-up to expectations and is
expected to achieve an average utilisation rate of approximately 80% for the full year.

* Normalised earnings represent reported EBIT adjusted for remeasurement items and the closing rate translation effects. 
  We believe normalised earnings are a useful measure of the group's sustainable operating performance. However, 
  this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other 
  companies. Normalised earnings constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings 
  Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma financial information.

Advancing projects to enable future growth

-   Update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP):
    As at the end of December 2018, engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete and
    construction progress was at 84%. Our overall project completion was 94% and capital expenditure amounted
    to US$10,9 billion.

    The first derivative unit, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) reached beneficial operation on
    13 February 2019, approximately two months late. Utilities to support the early process units were fully
    operational by end November 2018. These utilities together with LLDPE comprised ~40% of the LCCP total cost,
    prior to the revised estimate.

    Unfortunately, during the last quarter of calendar 2018, several factors within and beyond our control impacted
    the completion schedule and associated cost for the remaining units resulting in the overall project capital cost
    estimate being revised from US$11,13 billion to a range of US$11,6 - 11,8 billion. The difference between the upper
    and lower end of the range is a contingency and weather provision of US$200 million.

    Management maintains our unrelenting focus on delivering the remaining units per the revised schedule and we
    are confident that the fundamentals for the LCCP - being, among others, a feedstock advantaged plant, a world
    scale highly integrated facility, diverse product slate with high margin products and world class logistics and
    infrastructure - remain intact. We maintain our guidance that the project will deliver a steady state EBITDA of
    US$1,3 billion in financial year 2022.

    More details on the project can be found in our updated project factsheet at https://www.sasol.com/investor-
    centre/lake-charles-chemicals-project/lake-charles-chemicals-project-fact-sheet.

-   Focusing on our asset base in Africa:
    In Mozambique, the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) reservoirs have proved more complex than expected
    with reduced expectation of recoverable volumes. The remaining uncertainty coupled with a lower-for-longer
    forecast in the oil price, suggest a revised development concept maximising the use of existing wells and
    processing facilities. A PSA Phase 1 project decision for feasibility studies is planned for the last quarter of
    calendar year 2019, with a Field Development Plan amendment to be submitted in December 2019. Phase 1 gas
    results confirm resource cover for Central Termica de Temane (CTT), formerly known as the Mozambique Gas to
    Power Project (MGtP), and which was also confirmed via an independent resource certification study. A gas term
    sheet is being negotiated for gas supply to Electricidade de Mocambique (EDM) for CTT.

    The initial appraisal of the Phase 2 Pande gas reservoirs has been completed. The drilling results indicate gas
    volumes to be at the lower end of expectations. An extension of the commercial assessment period has been
    granted to enable further appraisal and development of the gas markets. Focused efforts are underway to
    assess the range of options and possibilities to sustainably secure and source gas feedstock.

    Sasol is one of four participating interest owners of the Etame Marin Permit, and holds a 30% participating
    interest, with VAALCO Gabon SA being the operator. In September 2018, VAALCO through its wholly owned
    subsidiary and other Etame participating interest owners, announced the receipt of the Presidential Decree
    approving the successful execution of an amendment to the Etame Marin Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in
    Gabon between the government of Gabon and the Etame participating interest owners. The amendment
    provides for a 10 year extension of the three exclusive exploitation areas under the PSC until September 2028.

Maintaining our focus on safety and sustainable value creation

We continued to deliver our broader sustainability contributions during the period:
-   Safety remains one of our top priorities and is a core value. We are deeply saddened to report that we
    experienced two tragic fatalities at our Sasol Mining operations. The corrective actions from the investigations
    include adapting our systems and processes applicable to weekend work and our service provider interface
    which have been implemented.

-   Our 12 month rolling RCR for employees and service providers, excluding illnesses, is 0,26 at December 2018 as
    compared to 0,30 at December 2017. Although this is an improvement, we remain vigilant and aware of the need
    to improve our safety performance by implementing our high severity injury programme. Importantly, we have
    adapted our leadership development programmes to include frontline supervisor training that focuses on team
    engagement, together with an alignment of our critical safety behaviours within Sasol's culture transformation
    programme.

-   The transition to a lower carbon economy is a prerequisite to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.
    Sasol is committed to playing our part in this transition in the areas where we operate. In this regard, Sasol will
    be providing more information on our climate change management approach during our financial year 2019
    reporting cycle.

-   In South Africa, the carbon tax was voted on by the Standing Committee on Finance in Parliament on 5 February
    2019. The initial carbon tax will be R120 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) with a number of tax free
    allowances. This will now progress to the National Assembly.

-   Energy efficiency improved 5% from the 2015 baseline. These improvements are largely due to energy saving
    projects and initiatives implemented from 2015 and a refinement of the calculation methodology. This was
    further enhanced by optimisation initiatives across our operations. Sasol's South African energy efficiency for
    the half year improved by 6,6% from the 2015 baseline. We are on track to meet our 2030 objective of a 15%
    improvement from the 2015 baseline.

-   We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response in accordance with our key performance
    indicators. Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all operations globally are projected to reduce
    marginally to 65,5 million tons when compared to 67,1 million tons in the prior year. Our GHG emissions intensity
    (measured in CO2e per ton of production) is projected to be lower at 3,57 compared to 3,77 in 2018. This is largely
    due to the shutdowns experienced at our Secunda facilities.

-   Sasol has consistently communicated our commitment to meeting our air quality compliance obligations
    through air quality improvement roadmaps. We intend applying for a further round of postponements as
    currently provided for in law to complete execution of the air quality roadmaps, in a safe manner, towards
    compliance with all relevant minimum emission standards, save for sulphur dioxide (SO2). We continue to
    participate in an ongoing engagement process with both the Department of Environmental Affairs and the
    Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs in relation to the challenges that we face in meeting the SO2 new
    plant standards for our boiler plants.

-   In line with our commitment to responsibly manage our water use, results for the half year related to water
    management, reflect a decrease in total water usage from 67,3 million m3 to 66,0 million m3 and a decrease in
    river water use from 54,1 million m3 to 52,7 million m3. Potable water use has increased from 6,0 million m3 to
    6,4 million m3.

-   From a product stewardship perspective, we continue to implement efforts to enhance product transport safety
    performance by growing rail transport and increasingly deploying technology to eliminate road transport
    incidents. In response to the global plastics waste challenge, Sasol will participate and develop joint solutions
    with industry through our associations. To this end, Sasol has joined the recently-announced Alliance to End
    Plastic Waste, a global initiative of companies along the plastics value chain aimed at eliminating plastic waste in
    the environment.

-   During the period, we paid R21,6 billion in direct and indirect taxes to and received direct tax refunds of
    R3,1 billion from the South African government. Sasol remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South
    Africa, contributing significantly to the country's economy.

-   We invested R918 million in skills and socio-economic development during the period, which includes our
    Ikusasa programme, the Sasol Siyakha Trust which finances small, medium and macro enterprises, bursaries,
    graduate development, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa programme focuses on
    education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the Secunda and Sasolburg regions.

-   Sasol delivered on our commitments towards sustainable transformation and B-BBEE during the past three
    years. Sasol achieved a Level 4 contributor status well ahead of our planned 2020 timeframe. During the past six
    months our expenditure with black-owned suppliers amounted to R9,4 billion representing 67% of the R14
    billion targeted for the 2019 financial year.

-   On 8 February 2019 the Sasol South Africa Limited Board declared an interim dividend of R11,44 per ordinary
    share to the benefit of Khanyisa shareholders.

Business performance outlook* - improved production performance and continuation of cost focus

The current economic climate continues to remain highly volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign
exchange movements are outside our control and may impact our results, our focus remains firmly on managing
factors within our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial
risk management and maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

We expect an overall improved operational performance for the year ending 30 June 2019, with:
-   SSO maintaining post shutdown run-rates, targeting the upper-end of 7,5 to 7,6 million tons;
-   Liquid fuels sales volumes of approximately 57 to 58 million barrels in line with our previous market guidance;
-   Base Chemicals sales volumes, excluding US produced products, to be 1% lower for the financial year;
-   Performance Chemicals annual sales volumes to be between 1% to 2% higher (excluding LCCP);
-   Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement (PPA) in Mozambique to be between
    114 bscf to 118 bscf;
-   ORYX GTL to achieve an average utilisation rate of 90% due to a leak discovered in December 2018 in the waste
    heat boiler of one of the reformer reactors. We therefore expect to have an extended shutdown to repair the
    waste heat boiler;
-   Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line within our inflation assumption of 6%;
-   Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R52 billion for 2019 and R30 billion for 2020 as we progress
    with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result of exchange rate
    volatility and other factors;
-   Gearing and net debt to EBITDA will be managed within our Board approved levels of between 45% and 49% and
    2,0 times and 2,3 times respectively;
-   Rand/US dollar exchange rate to range between R13,85 and R14,50; and
-   Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$60/bbl and US$65/bbl.

Tax litigation and contingency

As previously reported, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued revised assessments for Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd
(Sasol Oil) relating to a dispute around our international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to 2014 tax
years. Following an unfavourable ruling for Sasol Oil by the Tax Court on 30 June 2017, Sasol Oil made a provision in
its financial statements of R1,3 billion, including penalties and interest, which covers the 2005 to 2014 tax years. On
9 November 2018, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) upheld an appeal filed by Sasol Oil and set aside the ruling by
the Tax Court. The SCA effectively confirmed Sasol Oil's view that the grounds argued by SARS for additional
taxation of Sasol Oil's international crude oil procurement activities has not been fulfilled. On the basis of this
judgement, Sasol Oil has reversed the accrual of R1,3 billion. On 29 November 2018, SARS applied to the
Constitutional Court for leave to appeal against the SCA decision. On 4 February 2019, the Constitutional Court
dismissed SARS' application with costs with the arguments that the matter falls outside the jurisdiction of the
Court and, in any event, bears no reasonable prospect of success.

In addition to the above litigation, the potential liability relating to the ongoing dispute with SARS in relation to its
revised assessments for the 2013 and 2014 tax years based on a different primary ground of assessment regarding
Sasol Oil's crude oil procurement activity amounts to R13 billion (including interest and penalties as at 31 December
2018). Sasol Oil disagrees with SARS' assessment for the 2013 and 2014 periods. This tax dispute remains the
subject of an ongoing appeal with the Tax Court lodged by Sasol Oil. A possible obligation may arise for the tax
years subsequent to 2014, which could give rise to a future potential liability.

Further, as reported previously, following a SARS request for information on Sasol Financing International Plc (SFI)
which performs an off-shore treasury function for Sasol, SARS proceeded to an audit over a number of years. This
audit culminated in the issuance of a final audit letter on 16 February 2018. Consequently, revised assessments
were issued by SARS in respect of the 2002 to 2012 tax years. SFI has co-operated fully with SARS during the course
of the audit related to these assessments. SFI, in consultation with its tax and legal advisors, does not support the
basis of these additional assessments for all the years. Accordingly, SFI submitted objections and/or appeals (as the
case may be) to the revised assessments as the legal process unfolds. In addition, Sasol has also launched a judicial
review application against the SARS decision to register SFI as a South African taxpayer. SARS' answering affidavit
in this litigation was submitted on 8 February 2019 and SFI will respond accordingly. The dispute relates to the
place of effective management of SFI. The potential tax exposure is R3,2 billion including interest and penalties as
at 31 December 2018.

Sasol is committed to compliance with tax laws and any disputes with tax authorities on the interpretation of tax
laws and regulations will be addressed in a transparent and constructive manner.

Change in directors

There were no changes in directors during the six months ended 31 December 2018.

Declaration of cash dividend number 79

An interim gross cash dividend of South African 590 cents per ordinary share (31 December 2017 - 500 cents per
ordinary share) has been declared for the six months ended 31 December 2018. The cash dividend is payable on the
ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the
company, as well as capital remaining after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support the current operations
for the ensuing year. The dividend has been declared out of retained earnings (income reserves). The South African
dividend withholding tax rate is 20%. At the declaration date, there are 624 606 120 ordinary and 6 331 347 Sasol
BEE ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to shareholders who are not exempt from the
dividend withholding tax, is 472 cents per share, while the dividend amount payable to shareholders who are
exempt from dividend withholding tax is 590 cents per share.

*   On 1 July 2018, the group adopted IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. The new accounting standard has been applied 
    prospectively. The impact of the adoption of the new standard is a reduction of R121 million on the opening 
    shareholders' equity position. This was adjusted for in the current year as the impact is immaterial.

**  A non-controlling interest has not been recognised on the Sasol Khanyisa transaction as the accounting for 
    the transaction is similar to an option over Sasol shares granted for no consideration. Any ultimate value created 
    for participants in the Khanyisa transaction will be granted in the form of SOLBE1 shares.

*** The Sasol Inzalo transaction was terminated in September 2018 and as such the share capital relating to the 
    transaction was cancelled and the share-based payment reserve was reclassified to retained earnings in accordance 
    with IFRS. In addition, on 7 September 2018, 16 085 199 Sasol Limited preferred ordinary shares were repurchased 
    from Sasol Inzalo Public Funding (RF) (Pty) Ltd at a purchase price of R542,11 per share as per the shareholders
    authorisation obtained at the Annual General Meeting held on 17 November 2017.

Basis of preparation

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 31 December 2018 have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', the
SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements
as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa,
2008, as amended, and the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the disclosures required for complete
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Board
is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the company is sufficient to support the current operations for the
next 12 months.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historic
cost convention except that certain items, including derivative financial instruments, liabilities for cash-settled
share-based payment schemes, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets designated
at fair value through other comprehensive income, are stated at fair value.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in South African rand, which is Sasol
Limited's functional and presentation currency. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these
condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in
the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2018, except for the adoption of IFRS 9
'Financial Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and an amendment to IAS 23 'Borrowing
Costs' with effect from 1 July 2018. Both IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 were adopted using the modified transition approach,
where the comparative financial information is not restated as permitted by the standard. The amendment to IAS
23 is applied prospectively.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements appearing in this announcement are the responsibility of
the directors. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements. Paul Victor CA(SA), Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for this set of condensed
consolidated interim financial statements and has supervised the preparation thereof in conjunction with the
Senior Vice President: Financial Control Services, Brenda Baijnath CA(SA).

New International Financial Reporting Standards adopted

IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'
IFRS 9 provides a single classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business
model in which they are managed and their cash flow characteristics. The group's financial assets are classified as
measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss, or fair value through other comprehensive income.
The group elected to recognise the fair value gains and losses on its current unlisted equity investments through
other comprehensive income. Due to the limited unlisted investments held, this change in measurement basis from
amortised cost to fair value had an insignificant effect on Sasol's accounting, and therefore no transition
adjustment is presented.

For financial liabilities the existing classification and measurement requirements of IAS 39 will remain the same.

Under IFRS 9, impairments of financial assets classified as measured at amortised cost are recognised on an
expected loss basis which incorporates forward-looking information when assessing credit risk, with the expected
losses recognised in profit or loss. The effect of the change was inconsequential on Sasol's accounting as the
expected loss basis is not significantly different from the stringent debtor management policies currently applied
by Sasol, and therefore no transition adjustment is presented.

The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the group's accounting policies relating to financial
assets and financial liabilities.

The IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements are not effective for the group until the International Accounting
Standards Board's macro hedging project is finalised.

IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'
Under IFRS 15, revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when a performance obligation is satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer. A good or service is transferred when the customer obtains
control of that good or service. The transfer of control of Sasol's energy and chemical products usually coincides
with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession, with the group's performance
obligations primarily satisfied at a point in time. Amounts of revenue recognised relating to performance
obligations over time are not significant. The accounting for revenue under IFRS 15 therefore represents an
inconsequential change from the group's previous practice for recognising revenue from sales with customers, and
therefore no transition adjustment is presented.

An analysis of revenue from contracts with customers by product is presented. Amounts presented for
comparative periods include revenues determined in accordance with the group's previous accounting policies, but
the differences are inconsequential.

Amendment to IAS 23 'Borrowing Costs'
The amendment to IAS 23 clarifies that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is
ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity borrows generally when
calculating the capitalisation rate on general borrowings. Previously, if any specific borrowing remained
outstanding after the related asset was ready for its intended use or sale, Sasol recognised the finance costs
related to this borrowing in profit and loss.

The adoption of the amendment has been applied prospectively from 1 July 2018 and had a material impact on the
group's earnings for the period as Sasol has a large number of projects to which borrowing costs are capitalised.
The impact of applying the amendment for the period ended 31 December 2018 is:

IFRS 16 'Leases' (Effective for the group from 1 July 2019)
IFRS 16 will be applied by the group from 1 July 2019. Under the new standard, all lease contracts, with limited
exceptions, will require a lessee to recognise a right of use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased
asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.

The adoption of the standard will have a material effect on the group's financial statements, significantly increasing
the group's recognised assets and liabilities. We expect an increase in the depreciation expense and also in cash
flows from operating activities as the lease payments will be reflected as financing outflows. The group will apply
the full retrospective approach permitted by the standard, which requires restatement of the comparative period's
financial information.

Based on the group's current assessment, the impact is expected to be between R9 billion - R12 billion of additional
liabilities that will be recognised on the statement of financial position with a corresponding lease asset. The
additional lease liability will add between 3,8% - 5,1% on gearing.

Pro forma financial information
Core headline earnings, Normalised EBIT, EBITDA and US dollar convenience translations included in this
announcement constitutes pro forma financial information.

The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of directors and is presented for illustrative
purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly present Sasol's financial
position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The underlying information, used in the preparation
of the pro forma financial information, has been prepared using accounting policies which comply with IFRS and are
consistent with those applied in the published group consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended
30 June 2018.

This pro forma information has not been reported on by the group's auditors, being PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc.

Related party transactions

The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an arm's
length basis at market rates with related parties.

Significant events and transactions since 30 June 2018

In accordance with IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting', we have included an explanation of events and transactions
which are significant to obtain an understanding of the changes in our financial position and performance since
30 June 2018. There were no significant acquisitions and disposals since 30 June 2018.

Financial instruments

Fair value
Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined unless the instrument is listed in an active market.
Where possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy

The table below represents significant financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, or for
which fair value is disclosed at 31 December 2018. This includes the US dollar bonds, interest rate swap, crude oil

SASOL LIMITED – Updated trading statement for the six months ended 31 December 2018

Shareholders of Sasol are referred to the Company's trading statement released on the Stock Exchange
News Service (SENS) on 21 November 2018 (Announcement), wherein the Company indicated that an
updated trading statement will be released on SENS in January 2019, once reasonable certainty is
attained with regards to the 31 December 2018 half-year financial results.

We have now reached a reasonable degree of certainty that the financial performance for the six months
ended 31 December 2018 (half year 2019) is expected to be within the updated earnings ranges
contained in the table below. Core headline earnings per share (Core HEPS) and earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are within the previously provided range as
outlined in the Announcement. However, we are revising the range slightly upwards with regards to
earnings per share (EPS) and headline earnings per share (HEPS). The main reason for the increase
is the impact of half year-end valuation adjustments associated with crude oil hedges and closing
exchange rates. The updated ranges can be summarised as follows:

Cost
The normalised cash fixed cost for the period under review has been contained to below our 6% inflation
target despite operational challenges experienced during the period.
LCCP update
As at the end of December 2018, engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete
and construction progress was at 84%. Our overall project completion was 94% and capital expenditure
amounted to US$10,9 billion.

The first derivative unit, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), produced first product in January 2019
and beneficial operation is expected in February, approximately two months behind schedule. Utilities
to support the early process units were fully operational by end November 2018. These utilities together
with LLDPE will comprise ~40% of the LCCP existing total cost.

Unfortunately, during the last quarter of CY2018, several factors within and beyond our control impacted
the completion schedule and associated cost for the remaining units resulting in the overall project
capital cost estimate being revised from US$11,13 billion to a range of US$11,6 – 11,8 billion. The
difference between the upper end and lower end of the range represents a contingency and weather
provision of US$200 million.

These factors which impacted the revised cost estimate include:

?     Changes to scope
         o Late scope additions for the Cracker as a result of incomplete engineering work not
             timeously identified;
         o Increased scope to ensure process safety for the Cracker and Ethylene oxide / Ethylene
             Glycol (EO/EG) unit due to defective carbon steel forgings. The impact was fully assessed
             late in Q4 CY2018 leading to a one month delay;
?     A cumulative month of work being lost as a result of excessive rainfall in Q4 CY2018;
?     Productivity losses exacerbated by high absenteeism around public holidays and construction
      rework since end November 2018; and
?     Schedule delays of the remaining units will result in additional overhead costs.

While our underlying productivity factor remained on track, the inclement weather, scope additions and
absenteeism had a significant impact on actual productivity. These factors were assessed and
quantified late in Q4 CY2018 and where feasible, management interventions were put in place to arrest
the controllable trends. Unfortunately, the mitigating actions were not successful in reversing the full
impact on schedule and cost.

The beneficial operation dates for the individual units have been revised as follows:

Management maintains our unrelenting focus on delivering the remaining units per this updated plan
and we remain confident that the fundamentals for the LCCP - being, among others, a feedstock
advantaged plant, a world scale highly integrated facility, diverse product slate with high margin
products and world class logistics and infrastructure - remain intact.
As a result of the delays highlighted above, we are revising our LCCP EBITDA estimate down from
US$110 – US$160 million to an EBITDA loss of US$165 – US$195 million for FY19. However, we
maintain our guidance that LCCP will deliver a steady state EBITDA of US$1,3 billion in FY2022.

* EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation, amortisation, remeasurement
items, share-based payments and unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities.
** Core HEPS are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period close
adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects, exceeding R4 billion which have
reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up and share-based payments on implementation of
B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period
end are to remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and
other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline
earnings are a useful measure of the group´s sustainable operating performance. However, this is not
a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. The aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The

Trading statement for the financial half year ending 31 December 2018

Sasol is expected to deliver a solid set of results, underpinned by higher Brent crude oil
and product prices, a weaker average rand exchange rate, a satisfactory performance
of its global assets and much lower remeasurement items during the six months ending
31 December 2018. Our underlying cash flow performance and earnings are expected
to be much stronger than the period ended 31 December 2017 (prior period).

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ending 31 December 2018 are
expected to increase by between 12% and 29% (approximating R2,12 to R5,12 per
share) compared to the prior period HEPS of R17,67. Earnings per share (EPS) for the
same period are also expected to increase by between 80% and 100% (approximating
R9,03 to R11,29 per share) from the prior period EPS of R11,29.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA*) are expected to
increase by between 10% and 30% largely driven by stronger macroeconomics and
core** headline earnings per share (CHEPS) are expected to increase by between 15%
and 35% (approximating R2,73 to R6,38 per share) compared to the prior period
CHEPS of R18,22. The difference between CHEPS and EBITDA is largely due to
depreciation and employee share-based payment expenses.

A detailed production summary and key business performance metrics for the financial
half year for all our businesses will be available on our website, www.sasol.com on
24 January 2019 and an announcement will be published on SENS notifying
shareholders accordingly. We will at this date include a more detailed analysis on our
earnings performance including the impact of the closing rate at 31 December 2018.

Our results for the six months ending 31 December 2018 may be further affected by
actual trading results in the remaining period and any further adjustments resulting from
our half year-end closure process. This may result in a change in the estimated
earnings noted above. This trading statement only deals with the comparison to the
prior period.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol will be releasing its
audited results for the six months ending 31 December 2018 on Monday, 25 February
2019.

* EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation, amortisation,
remeasurement items, share-based payments and unrealised gains and losses on our
hedging activities.
** Core HEPS are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period
close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects, exceeding R4
billion which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up and share-
based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments
in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end are to remove volatility from
earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and other market factors
at the reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline
earnings are a useful measure of the group’s sustainable operating performance.
However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The aforementioned adjustments
are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The adjustments have been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and due to their nature, may not fairly present Sasol’s financial
position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

SASOL OIL (PTY) LTD – TAX LITIGATION UPDATE

As previously reported, the South African Revenue Service (""SARS"") issued revised
assessments for Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd (""Sasol Oil"") relating to a dispute around its
international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to 2014 tax years. The litigation
in the Tax Court, relating to the international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005
to 2007 years of assessment, was concluded and judgement was delivered in favour of
SARS on 30 June 2017. Sasol Oil made a provision in its 2018 annual financial
statements of R1.3 billion, including penalties and interest, which covers the 2005 to 2014
tax years relating to the tax assessment ground to which this litigation is related.

Sasol Oil filed an appeal against the judgment by the Tax Court with the Supreme Court
of Appeal. Today the Supreme Court of Appeal decided to uphold the appeal and to set
aside the ruling by the Tax Court. The Court effectively confirmed Sasol Oil’s view that
the ground for additional taxation of Sasol Oil’s international crude oil procurement
activities has not been fulfilled.

On the basis of this judgement, Sasol Oil will reverse the accrual of R1.3 billion.

SASOL PUBLISHES PRODUCTION AND SALES METRICS FOR THE THREE
MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018

Sasol has published its production and sales performance metrics for the three months
ended 30 September 2018 on the Company’s website at www.sasol.com, under the
Investor Centre section or via this URL: http://www.sasol.com/investor-centre/financial-
reporting/business-performance-metrics

Overview:

Sasol benefited from higher Brent crude oil and product prices during the quarter and a
weaker average rand exchange rate against major currencies. We have seen higher
productivity across most of our operations with an increased focus on safety, margins
and cost control.

Operating Business Units
Operationally, our mining operations are building momentum with increased productivity
over the past quarter and have fully restored the stock piles to above target levels.
External purchases have been significantly reduced and current indications are that
Mining will achieve the targeted production levels of 40 million tons for the full year. At
our Mozambican upstream operations, we delivered a robust production performance,
in line with expectations. We expect to achieve our production target of between 114 -
118 bscf for FY19.

Regional Operating Hubs
Turning to our regional operating hubs, we are seeing excellent production results from
our Natref operations following focused management interventions and capital
investments over the past few years. The run rates achieved over the past quarter
averaged 661m3/h, which builds of the average of the previous quarter of 600m3/h. We
are confident that this improved performance will continue over the ensuing months. In
Sasolburg, most of our plants completed the shutdowns within the planned time and
cost schedules. Our Eurasian operations continue to deliver on its planned production
targets. However, in Secunda, the planned full shutdown at our Sasol Secunda
Operations (SSO) West factory was longer than estimated mainly due to technical
issues with the Steam Header 2 project and challenges with start-up which further
delayed the commissioning date. The extended shutdown impacted our production and
sales volumes across the value chain. We are however confident that we will achieve
our planned production targets for the remainder of the year. The longer shutdown will
result in annual production guidance reducing to 7,5 – 7,6 million tons.

Strategic Business Units
Our Energy business is continuing to benefit from the higher oil price and largely
achieved our targeted liquid fuels sales volumes for the quarter, notwithstanding the
challenges experienced at SSO. This was enabled through improved production from
Natref. We are on track to achieve our previous market guidance sales of 57 – 58
million barrels for the year. ORYX GTL achieved a stellar operational performance,
achieving an average utilisation rate of 106%. The notable production rates coupled
with the high oil price bodes well for Sasol's profitability. At Base Chemicals, we are
seeing higher chemical prices globally versus the comparable period and continue to
focus on margin expansion. In South Africa, we are on track achieve our target of 2 –
3% volumes increase despite the challenges at SSO. The high density polyethylene
(HDPE) plant in the US is expected to ramp up production during this financial year, and
we expect to achieve an average utilisation rate of 80 – 90% for the full year. HDPE
derivitisation enables additional value extraction from ethylene, which significantly
improves our US Base Chemicals average sales basket prices. Performance Chemicals
produced a solid set of sales volumes and margins overall are holding strong. We are
on track to achieve our previous market guidance of 2 – 4% volumes increase for the
full year.

Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)
We are making good progress with the project in Lake Charles and indications are that
the capital cost of the project will remain within the previous market guidance of
US$11,13 billion. As at end September 2018, the engineering and procurement were
substantially complete and the construction progress was at 75%. Steam reached
beneficial operation in August 2018. Overall project progress was 91% and capital
expenditure amounted to US$10,4 billion. More than 80% of our production will be
available in quarter one of calendar year 2019. Based on an ethane price of 28cpg, we
expected to deliver on our 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) guidance of US$250 million to US$300 million. However, given
current forecasted ethane prices, we expect EBITDA to average between $110 million
to $160 million using an ethane price 37cpg. The ethane price volatility will significantly
impact the EBITDA and is not within our control.

Conclusion
Overall, we have delivered a solid performance for the first quarter, except for the SSO
extended shutdown. Our operations are stable and delivering according to plan and we
are taking advantage of all opportunities to maximise margins. At this point, all
indications are that we will meet our revised production and sales targets for the year.
Our cost performance is within market guidance.

In line with Sasol’s updated strategy, we have reorganised the Chemical portfolio to
support our value-based growth strategy. Consequently, we have transferred the
Phenolics, Ammonia and Speciality Gases results from Performance Chemicals to Base
Chemicals, effective 1 July 2018. Management of the Ammonia and Speciality Gases is
housed in the Energy SBU. The metrics have been restated for the transfer.

Additional information on the company earnings and production guidance can be found
on the company’s website.

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING REPURCHASE OF PREFERRED ORDINARY SHARES FROM SASOL
INZALO PUBLIC FUNDING (RF) PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“INZALO PUBLIC FUNDCO”), A
SUBSIDIARY OF SASOL INZALO PUBLIC (RF) LIMITED

1.      Shareholders are reminded that at a general meeting held on 17 November 2017, shareholders
        authorised Sasol, by way of a specific authority, to repurchase all or some of the Sasol preferred
        ordinary shares (“Preferred Ordinary Shares”) held by Inzalo Public FundCo at the 30 day volume
        weighted average price (“VWAP”) of a Sasol ordinary share (“SOL Share”) on the business day
        immediately prior to the date of repurchase of the Preferred Ordinary Shares.

2.      Sasol today repurchased 16 085 199 Preferred Ordinary Shares, being all the Preferred Ordinary
        Shares from Inzalo Public FundCo. The 30 day VWAP of a SOL Share on 6 September 2018 was
        R542,11. Sasol therefore paid R8 720 million for such Preferred Ordinary Shares. The 16 085 199
        Preferred Ordinary Shares were cancelled upon repurchase in accordance with section 35(5) of the
        Companies Act 2008, as amended, and have the same status as authorised but unissued shares.

3.      The proceeds of the repurchase of the Preferred Ordinary Shares were sufficient to discharge in full
        the preference share funding obligations of Inzalo Public FundCo. The guarantee which Sasol gave to
        the holders of Class C preference shares has therefore ceased to have any effect.

4.      The financial effect of the repurchase on Sasol’s earnings per share, headline earnings per share, net
        asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share will be confined to the legal fees, the
        taxes levied by the South African Revenue Services and the JSE documentation fee which are
        considered negligible. The repurchase of the Preferred Ordinary Shares has been funded out of
        available cash and credit facilities.

SAFETY

Safety Recordable Case Rate (RCR), excluding illnesses,improved to 0,27, our lowest so far, regrettably four fatalities

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa said:

Our resilient 2018 performance was underpinned by higher sales and production volumes, in the second half of the
year. This was enabled by our continued focus on factors within our control and higher global oil prices, resulting in
improved product prices and margins, notwithstanding continued exchange rate volatility. Overall, our operational
performance was satisfactory, however unplanned Eskom electricity supply interruptions and two internal outages
at Secunda Synfuels Operations, negatively impacted volumes. Enhancing our foundation businesses, a core aspect
of our value-based strategy, will be delivered through ensuring safe and sustainable operations, robust asset
management strategies, continuous improvement and digitalisation, underscored by disciplined capital allocation.

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell said:

2019 will be a defining year for Sasol with the start-up of the LCCP, a catalyst for transforming our earnings profile(1).
Mozambique, our other key growth area, remains central to our gas strategy where we are stepping up efforts to
secure long-term gas feedstock, while delivering on our stakeholder commitments. Improving the flexibility of our
balance sheet, through increased cash flow and reduced gearing, and managing an optimal capital structure will be
a key focus ahead. We remain confident in delivering on our strategy, which will realise sustainable long-term value
for our stakeholders.

Financial results overview(2,4)

Sasol delivered a resilient set of results, underpinned by satisfactory sales and production volumes, delivering a flat
normalised real cash fixed cost base and benefitting from much higher crude oil and product margins in the second
half of the financial year. Our financial results were negatively impacted by several unplanned Eskom electricity
supply interruptions and two internal outages at our Secunda Synfuels (SSO) and Natref operations that resulted in
lower production volumes, as well as a 6% stronger average rand/US dollar exchange rate compared to the prior period.

Our underlying cash flow performance was robust. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA(4)) increased by 10% when compared to the prior year. Core headline earnings(3) per share (CHEPS) however
decreased by 6% to R36,03 compared to the prior period and Headline Earnings Per Share decreased by 22% to
R27,44. The difference between core headline earnings and EBITDA in the current year is largely due to depreciation
of approximately R16 billion and employee share-based payment expenses of R1,5 billion due to the marked
improvement of the Sasol share price at the end of the financial year. The share-based payment relating to our
Khanyisa Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) transaction of R3 billion is excluded from core
headline earnings and EBITDA as it is considered to be a once-off and non-cash item.

Sasol's core headline earnings per share were impacted by the following notable once-off and period close items:

Earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2018 decreased by 57% to R8,7 billion from
R20,4 billion in the prior year. This resulted in earnings per share (EPS) decreasing by 57% to R14,26 compared to
the prior year. The stronger average rand/US dollar exchange rate and the negative impact of remeasurement
items, largely driven by the stronger longer-term rand exchange rate, resulted in a much lower profit and earnings
per share for the year.

The closing exchange rate however weakened by 5% which negatively impacted gearing and the valuation of our
derivatives and foreign debtors and loans. Our hedging programme for the 2018 and 2019 financial years is
complete and positions Sasol well to steer through these periods of volatility. The average Brent crude oil price
moved 28% higher compared to the prior year, and, since December 2017, spot prices have moved closer to the
US$75/bbl mark which positively impacted our results. The rand per barrel oil price increased by approximately
20% to R818 per barrel compared to 2017, (refer to table below), and has subsequently increased by approximately
15% - 25% since the end of June 2018. The spot rand per barrel oil price is now ranging between R950 and R1 050
per barrel.

The movement in macroeconomic factors can be summarised as follows:

    and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our
    derivatives at period end is to remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and other
    market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of
    the group's sustainable operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Core headline earnings constitutes pro-forma financial information in terms
    of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation set out on page 19.
(4) EBITDA is calculated by adjusting earnings before interest and taxation for depreciation, amortisation, remeasurement items, share-
    based payments and unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of the group's
    underlying cash flow performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled
    measures reported by other companies.

Operational and cost performance

Sasol experienced some challenges with regards to our operational performance during the year, largely due to
planned and unplanned production interruptions at SSO, Natref and Mining which impacted production and sales
volumes across the value chain. Despite these interruptions, we delivered a stronger overall operational
performance in the second half of the year. Our production run-rates during the fourth quarter of financial year
2018, on an annual average basis, supports our internal targeted run-rates.

Sales volumes increased by 1% for our Performance Chemicals business spurred by robust market demand despite
Eskom electricity supply interruptions. Base Chemicals reported a 1% decrease in sales volumes mainly due to
production interruptions at SSO and a stock build for our high density polyethylene joint venture in the US.
Excluding the impact of Eskom electricity supply interruptions, sales volumes increased by 1%. Liquid fuels sales
volumes were down 2% due to lower volumes from SSO and Natref and a challenging South African retail liquid
fuels market.

The highlights of our business performance are summarised below:

-   In the first half of the year, our mining operations were focused on ramping up production volumes post the
    labour strike in the prior year. However, in the period December 2017 to February 2018 we experienced three
    tragic work-related fatalities which significantly slowed us in ramping up our operational performance and
    resulted in lower than expected production volumes.

    We are committed to ensuring that our mining operations remain safe and have implemented a number of
    initiatives to restore our safety performance. Our Business Improvement Programme (BIP), aimed at increasing
    productivity and achieving cost efficiency was refocused post the stabilisation of our safety performance in
    March 2018 and to date we have seen some positive results. Our production run rate over the past quarter has
    improved by more than 20% compared to the previous quarter and is representative of a run rate to achieve
    40 million tons per year and match pre strike production rates.

-   Production volumes from SSO decreased by 3% to 7,6 million tons mainly as a result of unplanned Eskom supply
    interruptions (1%) and internal outages (2%) during the year. Notwithstanding, we continued to improve
    operational processes and plant efficiencies to realise better production yields. Our production run rates
    achieved during May and June 2018, supports full year production of approximately 7,8 million tons.

-   Our Eurasian Operations continued to improve on their operational performance and delivered a 3% increase in
    production volumes. This was largely due to stronger product demand and increased plant availability.

-   ORYX GTL delivered a strong production performance, with an average utilisation rate of 95% exceeding our
    market guidance of 92%.

-   Natref's production volumes were 9% lower due to planned shutdowns and an unexpected electricity supply
    interruption at the start of the financial period. The second half of the year however yielded much improved
    production rates despite a planned shutdown in quarter four. The increased volumes in the second half of 2018
    partially offsets the lower production volumes recorded in the first half of the year. The production run rate for
    quarter four was 600mï¿½/h resulting in a full year run rate of 536mï¿½/h. This compares to a run rate of 592mï¿½/h in 2017.

A detailed production summary and key business performance metrics for the financial year for all our businesses is
available on our website, www.sasol.com.

Turning to our cost performance, cash fixed costs were up 2% in real terms in the first half of the year mainly as a
result of above-mentioned planned and unplanned production interruptions. In the second half of the year, we
increased our focus on improving our cost efficiency and managed to keep our normalised cash fixed costs
(excluding growth and once-off items) for the year flat in real terms. We are of the view that our cost management
processes remain robust to protect and improve our cost competitive position and still positions us in managing
our cost base to within our inflation target, while ensuring that we maintain safe and sustainable operations.
Whilst we have reduced our cost base significantly through our Business Performance Enhancement Programme
(BPEP) and Response Plan (RP), we are continuing to evaluate further opportunities to reduce cost through our
Continuous Improvement (CI) programme. The inflation rate for South Africa remains volatile and has moved from
6,5% over the past two years to 4,7% at 30 June 2018. Against this backdrop, we are targeting an inflation rate of
6% as a more sustainable increase for our cost base. We are well positioned to continue with this improved
operational and cost performance into the 2019 financial year.

Cash and capital performance

Cash generated by operating activities decreased slightly to R42,9 billion compared with R44,1 billion in the prior
year. This is largely attributable to a R3,8 billion increase in working capital. Our trade receivables increased by
R2,8 billion due to higher chemical sales prices and higher volumes in June 2018 which translated into cash in July
2018. In addition, due to the last day of the financial year being on a weekend, R1 billion was received from debtors
in the first three business days of July 2018. Inventory increased by R3,4 billion mainly as a result of higher
feedstock costs as a result of the increase in crude oil prices compared to the previous financial year. Inventory
holding in days were slightly higher compared to the previous financial year.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R53,4 billion. This includes R30,1 billion (US$2,3 billion)
relating to the LCCP. The capital spending rate is aligned to our internal targets and with previous market guidance provided.

Our net cash position decreased by 42%, from R29,3 billion in the prior period to R17 billion as at 30 June 2018 due
to the funding of the LCCP and investments to fund growth projects. Loans raised during the year amounted to
R25 billion, mainly for the funding of our US growth project. Short-term debt increases relates to the Sasol Inzalo Public
transaction unwinding in September 2018. During the year, we increased our existing US$1,5 billion Revolving Credit
Facility to US$3,9 billion and extended the maturity to five years, with the inclusion of two further extension
options of one year each. In addition, our Domestic Medium Term Note Programme of R8 billion provides us with
access to the South African debt capital markets. The focus on our funding plan will now shift to ensuring that
longer-term debt instruments are put in place.

Due to the funding of the LCCP, more than 80% of our debt is now US dollar denominated. Given the significantly
weaker closing exchange rate of R13,73 and the related translation loss of R4,8 billion arising on the valuation of the
balance sheet at year end, gearing increased to 43,2%, which is slightly below our internal ceiling and market
guidance. Included in net debt is R6,1 billion of new finance leases mainly relating to Oxygen Train 17 in Secunda and
rail storage facilities at the LCCP.

We are actively reviewing our capital structure and funding plan to ensure that we maintain an optimum solvency
and liquidity profile. The unwinding of the Sasol Inzalo transaction has been structured to ensure that our credit ratings
are maintained at investment grade and with the least amount of dilution to our shareholders. The Sasol Limited
Board (the Board) approved that Sasol repurchase the shares from Inzalo Public Funding Limited (RF) and settle the outstanding 
debt of R7,4 billion and a cash top-up for value realised of approximately R600 million in September 2018, assuming a share
price of R500. This step will eliminate any Sasol shareholder dilution as a result of the unwind of the Sasol Inzalo B-BBEE
structure.

We therefore expect our gearing to remain around peak levels of 40% - 44% in 2019 due to higher debt associated
with the Inzalo unwind. Accordingly, the Board approved that we manage the balance sheet to below our peak
internal gearing ceiling of 44% for the 2019 financial year.

In January 2018, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Sasol's credit rating at a BBB-/A-3 with a stable outlook. This is two
notches above the South African sovereign credit rating and is at investment grade. Similarly Moody's Investors
Service (Moody's) confirmed South Africa's sovereign rating at Baa3 changing the rating from negative to stable in
March 2018, while affirming Sasol's global scale long-term issuer rating at Baa3, adjusting the outlook from
negative to stable. Sasol's national scale long-term rating was affirmed at Aaa.za. Moody's has delinked Sasol from
the South African sovereign rating by one notch.

Our dividend policy is to pay dividends with a dividend cover range based on CHEPS. Taking into account the impact
of the current volatile macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, the current gearing range of 43,2%,
and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a gross final dividend of R7,90 per ordinary share and Sasol
BEE ordinary share (1,3% higher compared to the prior year). The dividend cover was 2,8 times at 30 June 2018
(30 June 2017: 2,8 times).

Update on hedging activities

As part of our enterprise risk management framework, we entered into a number of hedges to mitigate specific
financial market risks and provide protection of our balance sheet and operating cash flows against unforeseen
movements in oil prices, interest rates, currency movements, commodity and final product prices. A summary of
our group hedges are presented below:

Our hedging strategy has held us in good stead as we have managed to secure a floor of US$48/bbl for 2018 and
US$53/bbl for 2019 which protects our balance sheet against crude oil price volatility. On the exchange rate, we
have realised gains of R2,8 billion (cash flow) in 2018 which protected earnings and the balance sheet given the
average exchange rate of R12,85/US$1.

The current volatility in the crude oil price and exchange rate impacted the valuation of the open hedges at the end
of 2018. The unrealised losses include:

-   R0,3 billion loss on the rand/US dollar zero-cost collars;
-   R1,2 billion loss on Brent crude oil put options. The open instruments were valued against an average strike of
    US$56/bbl; and
-   R0,4 billion loss on export coal swaps.

These losses are highly dependent on market factors and could change in 2019 depending on the actual oil price
realised and exchange rate performance. We have completed our hedging programme for 2019 and are considering
our hedging strategy for 2020 given the current oil price outlook and exchange rate volatility.

Continuous improvement and digitalisation

Our low oil price RP achieved cumulative cash savings of R85,3 billion since January 2015, exceeding our target
range of R65-75 billion. The RP has delivered sustainable annual cash fixed cost savings of R3,5 billion which is in
addition to the R5,4 billion sustainable cost savings from our BPEP. This brings our cumulative sustainable cost
savings to R8,9 billion. We have now formally closed the RP at the end of June 2018. This proactive initiative
enabled us to manage the balance sheet through periods of oil price volatility, while maintaining our investment
grade and ability to fund our growth projects.

To ensure that we remain relevant and competitive and to reap the benefits of a higher oil price, we have
introduced a CI programme. CI, building on the solid foundation established by the BPEP and the RP, is aimed at
ensuring our continued competitiveness at an oil price of $40/bbl, while enhancing our offering to markets across
all the industries in which we compete. Our medium-term target is to increase our Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
for our foundation businesses by at least two percentage points by 2022 to 19%. This is off a 2017 actual base,
normalised for remeasurements and once-off items and excluding assets under construction. To date, we have
identified value enhancing opportunities to the value of 50% of the target, which positions us well towards
achieving our 2022 medium-term target.

Value adding digitalisation improvements, process simplification, selective core function repositioning and asset
performance reviews, are considered across all our businesses globally as key enablers to achieving our CI targets.

Our digitalisation objectives are centered around improving asset health management (predictive maintenance),
increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of operations (yield, energy, throughput, plan and schedule
achievement), advancing customer engagement, and extracting value from business process automation. Through
the effective use of data and digital technologies, we are positioning digitalisation to significantly contribute to our
continuous improvement target of a 2% ROIC uplift by 2022. We are making steady progress with our focused
asset review process. Several non-strategic assets have been identified for possible disposal or reduced
shareholding. During the past financial year we successfully disposed of our shareholding in our Base Chemical joint
ventures in Malaysia and several smaller investments. The disposal process for our Canadian shale assets has
commenced. Market updates will be made as sufficient progress is made without negatively impacting the disposal process.

Effective tax rate

Our effective corporate tax rate increased from 28,3% to 35,4% largely as a result of impairments relating to our
shale gas assets in Canada (R2,8 billion) and the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in Mozambique (R1,1 billion)
as well as the share-based payment expense (R3 billion) with the implementation of Sasol Khanyisa. The adjusted
effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted investments, remeasurements and once-off items, is 27,3%
compared to 26,5% in the prior year.

Satisfactory operational performance, higher oil and product prices(1,3)

Operating Business Units

Mining - improving productivity, benefitting from higher global coal prices

Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) increased by 41% to R5,2 billion compared to the prior period, mainly as a
result of the strike action in 2017. Earnings, excluding the strike cost and remeasurement items, increased by 4%
due to higher selling prices to SSO, an increase in export coal sales volumes and a 16% increase in export coal prices,
partially offset by additional external coal purchases of R865 million to restore the stockpile to two million tons. At
30 June 2018, our coal stockpiles were fully restored through own production and additional external coal
purchases. Based on our improved production run rate in the last quarter, we expect our external purchases from
Anglo Coal's Isibonelo Colliery to return to our targeted level of five million tons per year. External coal purchased to
supplement production ceased during July 2018.

Normalised unit cost of production increased by 5% to R284/ton compared to the prior year as a result of
productivity rates not reaching our planned internal targets. This is in line with previous market guidance.

Sasol Mining concluded a three-year wage agreement with all five of our participating trade unions in August 2017.

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) - strong operational delivery from Mozambique and
Gabon, partial impairment of PSA

EBIT adjusted for remeasurement items and the closing rate translation effect (normalised earnings*) amounted to
R270 million for the period.

Our Mozambican producing operations recorded an EBIT of R2 billion largely due to higher sales prices which was
partly negated by lower demand in the Mozambican gas market. The valuation of the PSA was impacted by weaker
long-term macroeconomic assumptions and lower than expected oil volumes. This resulted in a partial impairment
of R1,1 billion (US$94 million). We are currently reviewing the capital spend on the oil field development plan
following the results of the drilling campaign and an update to the PSA approved capital expenditure will be
communicated at the 2019 interim results. We expect lower capital expenditure as a result of the oil development
but the gas development still remains according to our estimates made at FID (Final Investment Decision).

Our Gabon asset recorded an EBIT of R537 million, 82% higher compared to the prior year largely due to higher
sales prices. This was partially offset by a 12% decrease in production volumes resulting from the natural decline of
the field.

We impaired our Canadian shale gas assets by R2,8 billion in the first half of the year due to a further decline in
long-term gas prices. The disposal process for these assets has commenced, however these assets have not yet
been classified as held-for-sale. Further announcements will be made once the process develops to an advanced stage.

Strategic Business Units

Performance Chemicals - increased sales volumes, robust market demand, adversely impacted by
stronger rand

Our sales volumes increased by 1% compared to the prior year despite Eskom electricity interruptions at SSO and
Hurricane Harvey. We continued to take advantage of the strong demand for our organics and inorganics products
and expanded our footprint in differentiated markets. The margins for our European and US specialty businesses
remained resilient, benefitting from robust demand and favourable market conditions. Production volumes from
our Eurasian Operations increased by 3% due to stronger demand and increased plant availability.

EBIT decreased by 7% to R8,2 billion compared to the prior year, mainly due to the stronger exchange rate, start-up
costs associated with our growth projects and production interruptions at SSO. Excluding growth costs associated
with our projects in the US and Brunsbï¿½ttel, cash fixed costs were contained to 2,6% for the year, which is below
inflation target.

Base Chemicals - lower volumes, profitability adversely impacted by the stronger rand

Our business benefitted from higher chemical US dollar prices, which improved by 12% due to higher crude oil
prices and favourable conditions prevailing in certain of our Solvents markets. The market demand remained strong
for most of our products, however the impact of the stronger exchange rate offset this benefit in earnings.

Normalised earnings* decreased by 18% to R5,2 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the stronger
exchange rate which negatively impacted earnings by R1,8 billion or 27%. Our cash fixed costs, normalised for
growth and once-off items increased by only 5,5%, which is below our inflation target. Remeasurement items
includes an impairment of R5,2 billion (R3,7 billion after tax) on our South African Chlor Vinyls cash generating unit,
as a result of the continued and sustained strengthening of the exchange rate outlook and the resulting impact on
Base Chemicals margins.

Sales volumes decreased by 1% mainly due to production interruptions at SSO. Improved efficiencies in our Ethylene 
and Propylene value chains have however partially negated the impact of production interruptions on sales volumes.

Our 50% joint venture HDPE plant with Ineos Olefins and Polymers USA achieved beneficial operation in November
2017. The plant ramped up production during quarter four and is performing to expectations. We have successfully
completed all guarantee runs and transitioned to bimodal production.

As part of the strategic review of our asset portfolio, we disposed of our 40% interest in the Petronas Chemicals
LDPE plant and our 12% share in Petronas Chemicals Olefins plant in March 2018 for R1,9 billion (US$163 million). We
are continuing to review our other assets and investments in the portfolio to further enhance performance and
improve the ROIC for the group.

Energy - margins improve, but volumes under pressure

Our normalised earnings* margin increased from 21% to 22% mainly as a result of a higher crude oil prices. This was
partially offset by lower liquid fuels volumes of R680 million (6%) and the stronger exchange rate of R1,9 billion
(17%).

Normalised earnings* increased by 12% to R15,1 billion when compared to the prior year. We continued to focus on
cost containment and identifying opportunities to further reduce our cost base. Normalised for the Power
Purchase Agreement with Eskom coming to an end in 2017, our cash fixed costs increased by only 1,9%, which is
well below inflation.

Natref's production volumes were 9% lower largely due to planned and unplanned production interruptions and an
Eskom electricity supply interruption at the start of the year. The first half of the year was challenging. However,
Natref delivered a strong performance during the last quarter of the year with an improved production run rate of
600mï¿½/h despite a planned shutdown in quarter four. The increased volumes in the second half of the year partially
offsets the lower production volumes recorded in the first half of the year. We expect the positive production run
rate to continue in 2019.

ORYX GTL delivered a strong production performance with an average utilisation rate of 95%. ORYX GTL contributed
R1,2 billion to operating profit with volumes increasing by 1% compared to the prior year.

In Nigeria, Escravos GTL (EGTL), optimisation efforts to reduce costs and improve plant efficiency are progressing
well, with a marked improvement on average utilisation rates. This, together with a higher oil price outlook,
resulted in a reversal of impairment of our investment in EGTL of R254 million.

The challenging economic environment also impacted our gas sales volumes to the external market, resulting in a
reduction of 3% compared to the prior year. The available gas was, however, utilised internally in our integrated
value chain.

In line with our strategy to grow our South African retail presence and maximise margins, we opened 12 new Sasol
retail convenience centres (RCCs) and divested from 10 non-operating RCCs. We are continuing to accelerate the
growth of our retail network through organic growth and potential acquisitions. We are also improving our retail
offering to meet the changing trends of our customer base through embracing digitalisation. As part of our
commitment to transformation, we continued to focus on procurement, skills and enterprise development
initiatives and improved our B-BBEE score for Sasol Oil from a level 7 to a level 3 in the current year.

Advancing projects to enable future growth

We are making steady progress in delivering on our growth pipeline:

-   Growing our footprint in North America:

    -   We are progressing with LCCP in Lake Charles and indications are that the cost of the project will remain
        within the previous market guidance of US$11,13 billion. As at end June 2018, engineering, equipment
        fabrication and procurement were substantially complete and construction progress reached 68%
        completion. Overall the project is 88% complete with capital expenditure amounting to US$9,8 billion. The
        project remains on track to start up the first three manufacturing units in the second half of the 2018
        calendar year. A significant milestone was reached when we achieved first steam production in July 2018. The
        expected start-up date of the remainder of the manufacturing units remains in the second half of the 2019
        calendar year.

        We have updated the LCCP economics with the current view of long-term market assumptions obtained from
        independent market consultants. Due to the volatile market and differing views of where ethane will
        be sourced from, the assumptions from the market consultants differs significantly. In a scenario where
        ethane is sourced from the Gulf area, the internal rate of return (IRR) is 8,0% - 8,5% and assumes an ethane 
        price of between US$30-40 cents per gallon. The alternative view which assumes that ethane is sourced further away 
        from the Gulf yields an IRR of 5,2% - 5,7% as the ethane price is between US$60-65 cents per gallon. In both of these
        scenarios the oil price is assumed to be US$60-80/bbl and the EBITDA at steady state ranges between
        US$1,2 billion to US$1,3 billion. At spot prices, using the last quarter of 2018 as a reference, the IRR is 8,5% -
        8,9%. The spot WACC rate for the US at 30 June 2018 was 7,68%.

-   Focusing on our asset base in Africa:

    -   Our strategic R14 billion mine replacement programme, which will ensure uninterrupted coal supply to SSO in
        order to support Sasol's strategy to operate our Southern African facilities until 2050, is nearing completion.
        Phase two of the Impumelelo colliery project is on track to be completed within budget, late in the 2019
        calendar year. The Shondoni colliery underground infrastructure was completed during May 2018 and the
        colliery was officially inaugurated on 5 July 2018. The phases completed to date were within budget and schedule.

    -   In Mozambique, the PSA Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling activities have been completed. In total, 11 wells were
        drilled comprising seven oil wells and four gas wells. The Inhassoro oil reservoirs have proved more complex
        than expected and, with the reduced expectation of recoverable oil volumes and uncertainty on the oil price,
        we are looking to maximise the use of existing processing facilities in the adjacent Petroleum Production
        Agreement (PPA) facilities. Phase 1 gas results confirm gas resources cover for Central Termica Temane (CTT),
        formerly Mozambique Gas-to-Power Project (MGtP). Phase 2 appraisal drilling results indicate gas volumes to
        be at the lower end of our initial estimates. Focused efforts are underway to assess the range of options and
        possibilities to sustainably secure and source gas feedstock.

    -   In continuing to execute our strategy, we have concluded a farm-in into the DE8 block in Gabon where we
        now hold 40% working interest of that block. An exploration well drilled during the year was unsuccessful
        and written off.

Maintaining our focus on safety and sustainable value creation

We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the year:

-   Safety remains one of our top priorities and is a core value. However, we are deeply saddened to report that we
    had four work-related fatalities and six high severity injuries this year. An incident, which resulted in the tragic
    death of an employee, was investigated as a fatality and the harm was determined to have been self-inflicted.
    The main learnings from this investigation were taken on board and implemented. Our thoughts remain with the
    families of our employees who have lost their lives in Sasol's service this year.

    A senior executive safety workshop was conducted as a necessary intervention to evaluate industry best
    practices and strengthen the standardised approach to prevent fatalities and high severity injuries across the
    group. Four focus areas were identified which will form the basis of our safety programme for the next financial
    year. Our 12 month rolling Recordable Case Rate for employees and service providers, excluding illnesses,
    improved to 0,27, our lowest level ever recorded. We believe our focused programme will also improve our injury
    rate.

-   During the year, we invested R2 billion in skills development and socio-economic development, which includes
    our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa programme
    focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the Secunda and
    Sasolburg regions.

-   This year saw the publication of the draft Carbon Tax and Climate Change Bills, both of which are expected to be
    implemented during the course of 2019. Sasol is supportive of the ""Just Transition"" campaign where a holistic
    approach is taken to achieving a lower carbon economy. Sasol continues to constructively engage with
    government on both these critical pieces of legislation. Further, we are progressing transparency around our
    climate change management, aligned with international initiatives, such as the Task Force for Climate Related
    Financial Disclosure requirements. Ongoing engagements with key stakeholders inform the robustness of our
    journey.

-   Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all operations globally is slightly lower at 67,43 million tons for
    2018 when compared to 67,68 million tons in the prior year. Our GHG emissions intensity (measured in carbon
    dioxide equivalent per ton of production) is higher at 3,78 compared to 3,66 in 2017. This is due to lower
    production levels in Secunda as a result of production interruptions.

-   Sasol supports the objective of the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act (NEMAQA) to
    contribute to an environment that is not harmful to human health or wellbeing. We regularly engage with the
    Department of Environmental Affairs on this to achieve a sustainable regulatory framework to support
    meaningful improvements in ambient air quality.

-   While most of Sasol's processes will be able to comply with new plant Minimum Emission Standards by 2025,
    there are selected activities that will not. For these specific cases, Sasol relies on applications for postponement
    of the applicable compliance timeframes as we continue to investigate technical solutions that will ensure
    compliance. In support, we are progressing the implementation of our committed air quality roadmaps.

-   The Sasol Group Energy Intensity index (EIi) improved from the 2015 baseline by 6,03% against our internal
    target of 3% (1% per year). Our South African Operation's EIi for 2018 is 6,62% and has essentially remained
    unchanged from the previous year mainly due to unplanned electricity supply outages resulting in frequent
    plant interruptions at our South African operations.

-   During the year, we paid R39,5 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South African government. Sasol
    remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South Africa, contributing significantly to the country's
    economy.

-   During 2018, Sasol made good progress in terms of Preferential Procurement which resulted in actual spend
    with black owned suppliers increasing by R5,2 billion to R12,7 billion from the prior year.

-   Sasol is committed to sustainable transformation and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). In
    our recent B-BBEE verification, Sasol achieved a Level 6 contributor status representing a key milestone in our
    journey of achieving at least a Level 4 contributor status by 2020.

Unwinding of Inzalo B-BBEE transaction

As announced on 26 June 2018, Sasol settled the Sasol Inzalo Groups preference share debt of approximately
R4,6 billion in June 2018 by utilising existing cash to repurchase up to 9,5 million preferred ordinary shares from
Sasol Inzalo Groups Funding (Pty) Ltd (RF) at a 30 day, volume weighted average price (VWAP) of R475,03, and funded the 
residual shortfall on the third party debt of R59 million. The Sasol Inzalo Public Funding Limited (RF) debt becomes 
due in September 2018. The Board has approved that Sasol settle the Sasol Inzalo Public debt in the same manner as 
Sasol Inzalo Groups so as to limit dilution on our shareholders, while maintaining investment grade ratings by utilising 
existing cash or credit facilities to repurchase 16,1 million preferred ordinary shares from 
Sasol Inzalo Public Funding Limited (RF). Based on Sasol's current share price and the forecast debt balances, there could 
be residual value, after settlement of third party debt, which will be distributed to Sasol Inzalo Public Funding Limited (RF) 
ordinary shareholders.

Business performance outlook* - strong production performance and cost
reductions to continue

The current economic climate continues to remain highly volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign
exchange movements are outside our control and may impact our results, our focus remains firmly on managing
factors within our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial
risk management and maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

We expect an overall strong operational performance for 2019, with:

-   SSO volumes of between 7,6 to 7,7 million tons impacted by a planned full shutdown in 2019;

-   Liquid fuels sales of approximately 57 to 58 million barrels due to a planned full shutdown at SSO;

-   Base Chemicals sales volumes, excluding US produced products, to be 2%-3% higher than the prior year, with
    US dollar product pricing expected to follow Brent crude oil prices. Our US HDPE plant will contribute for the full
    year, while LCCP is expected to start contributing during the second half of the year.

-   Performance Chemicals sales volumes to be 2%-4% higher, excluding the LCCP;

-   Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement in Mozambique to be between 114 bscf to
    118 bscf;

-   We expect to achieve an average utilisation rate of 95% at ORYX GTL in Qatar;

-   Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line within our inflation assumption of 6%;

-   Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R38 billion for 2019 and R30 billion for 2020 as we progress
    with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result of exchange rate
    volatility and other factors;

-   Our balance sheet gearing to range between 40%-44%;

-   Rand/US dollar exchange rate to range between R12,50 and R13,50; and

-   Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$65/bbl and US$75/bbl.

Competition law compliance

In 2012, the South African Competition Commission referred allegations of price-fixing and market division against
various petroleum products producers, including Sasol to the Competition Tribunal. Sasol and the other companies
involved settled the matter with the Competition Commission on a no fine and no admission of guilt basis and
provided undertakings regarding future exchange of information within the industry. The application for
confirmation of the settlement agreement was heard before the Competition Tribunal on 7 February 2018. On 3 May
2018, the Competition Tribunal approved the settlement agreement. This effectively closed the investigations with
no penalty imposed on Sasol.

Tax litigation and contingency

As previously reported, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued revised assessments for Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd
(Sasol Oil) relating to a dispute around our international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to 2012 tax
years. Sasol Oil has co-operated fully with SARS during the course of the audit related to these assessments.

The litigation process in the Tax Court, relating to the international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to
2007 years of assessment, was concluded and judgement was delivered on 30 June 2017 in favour of SARS. As a
result, a liability of R1,3 billion has been recognised in the prior year financial statements in respect of the 2005 to
2014 matters that remain the subject of the ongoing litigation. Sasol Oil, in consultation with its tax and legal
advisors, does not support the basis of the judgement and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).
The SCA hearing will take place on 21 August 2018, and it is anticipated that the judgement will likely be delivered
within a few months thereafter.

SARS has notified Sasol Oil of its intention to place on hold the field audit relating to this issue for the 1999 to 2004
tax years pending the outcome of the litigation. As a result of the judgement handed down on 30 June 2017, a
possible obligation may arise from the field audit, which is regarded as a contingent liability.

In addition, there could be a potential tax exposure of R12,6 billion for the periods 2013 to 2014 on varying tax
principles relating to the aforementioned activities, which remains the subject of an appeal. Supported by specialist
tax and legal advisors, Sasol Oil disagrees with SARS' additional assessments for the 2013 and 2014 periods and has
filed an appeal in the Tax Court, which has been suspended, pending the decision of the SCA. A possible obligation
may arise for the tax years subsequent to 2014, which could give rise to a future contingent liability also depending
to a degree on the outcome of the SCA hearing. SARS' decision to suspend the payment of this disputed tax for the
periods 2005 to 2014 currently remains in force.

In 2010, SARS commenced with a request for information in respect of Sasol Financing International Plc (SFI). This
matter progressed to an audit over the years and has now culminated in SARS issuing a final audit letter on
16 February 2018. Consequently, assessments were issued in respect of the 2002 to 2012 tax years. SARS argues
that the place of effective management of SFI, an offshore treasury function, was South Africa. This approach could
result in potential tax exposure of R3,1 billion (including interest and penalties as at 30 June 2018). SFI has co-
operated fully with SARS during the course of the audit related to these assessments. SFI, in consultation with its
tax and legal advisors, does not support the basis of these additional assessments for all the years. Accordingly, SFI
lodged objections and will submit appeals (as the case may be) to the assessments as the legal process unfolds.
SARS' decision to suspend the payment of this disputed tax for the periods 2002 to 2012 currently remains in force.
Sasol is committed to compliance with tax laws and any disputes with tax authorities on the interpretation of tax
laws and regulations will be addressed in a transparent and constructive manner.

Change in directors

Ms MBN Dube was appointed as an independent director with effect from 1 April 2018 and Mr HG Dijkgraaf retired
as an independent director on 30 April 2018. Mr MJN Njeke was appointed as the lead independent director with
effect from 30 April 2018.

Declaration of cash dividend number 78

A final gross cash dividend of South African 790 cents per share (30 June 2017 - 780 cents per ordinary share) has
been declared for the year ended 30 June 2018. The cash dividend is payable on the ordinary shares and the Sasol
BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the company, as well as capital adequacy
remaining after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support the current operations for the ensuing year. The
dividend has been declared out of retained earnings (income reserves). The South African dividend withholding tax
rate is 20%. At the declaration date, there are 623 081 550 ordinary, 16 085 199 preferred ordinary and 6 394 179
Sasol BEE ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to shareholders who are not exempt from the
dividend withholding tax, is 632 cents per share, while the dividend amount payable to shareholders who are
exempt from dividend withholding tax is 790 cents per share.

This pro-forma information has been reported on by the group's auditors, being PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. Their
unqualified reporting accountant's report thereon is available for inspection at the company's registered address.

Related party transactions

The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an arm's
length basis at market rates with related parties.

Subsequent events 
The Sasol Limited Board approved that Sasol repurchase the shares from Inzalo Public Funding Limited (RF) in
September 2018 and settle the outstanding debt of R7,4 billion and a cash top-up for value realised of approximately
R 600 million in September 2018, assuming a shape price of R500. This will then conclude the unwinding of the 
Sasol Inzalo transaction.

Financial instruments

Fair value

Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined unless the instrument is listed in an active market.
Where possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy

The table below represents significant financial instruments measured at fair value at reporting date, or for which
fair value is disclosed at 30 June 2018. The US dollar bond, the interest rate swap, the crude oil put options, the
zero-cost foreign exchange collars and the coal swaps were considered to be significant financial instruments for
the group based on the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position. The calculation of fair value
requires various inputs into the valuation methodologies used. The source of the inputs used affects the reliability
and accuracy of the valuations. Financial instruments have been classified into the hierarchical levels in line with
IFRS 13.

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or indirectly).
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are unobservable.

SOL: SASOL LIMITED - Trading statement for the financial year ended 30 June 2018

Sasol is expected to deliver a resilient set of results, underpinned by higher sales and production
volumes and much higher crude oil and product margins in the second half of the financial year. Our
financial results were however negatively impacted by several unplanned Eskom electricity supply
interruptions and two internal outages at our Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) that resulted in lower
production volumes.
Our underlying cash flow performance is expected to be strong. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA*) are expected to increase by between 6% and 16%. Core**
headline earnings per share (HEPS) are however expected to decrease by between 1% and 11%
(approximating R0,46 to R4,30 per share) compared to the 2017 financial year (prior year) Core HEPS
of R38,47. The difference between Core HEPS and EBITDA in the current year is largely due to
depreciation of approximately R16 billion and employee share-based payment expenses of R1,5 billion
due to the marked improvement of the Sasol share price at the end of the financial year. The share-
based payment relating to our Khanyisa Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)
transaction of R3 billion is excluded from Core HEPS and EBITDA as it is considered to be a once-off
and non-cash item.
HEPS for the financial year ended 30 June 2018 are expected to decrease by between 16% and 26%
(approximating R5,64 to R9,16 per share) compared to the prior year HEPS of R35,15. Earnings per
share (EPS) for the same period are also expected to decrease by between 52% and 62%
(approximating R17,46 to R20,80 per share) from the prior year EPS of R33,36.

From a macro-economic perspective, the stronger average rand/US dollar exchange rate and the
negative impact of remeasurement items, largely driven by the stronger longer-term rand exchange
rate, resulted in a much lower operating profit and earnings per share for the financial year. However,
the closing exchange rate weakened by 5% which negatively impacted gearing and the valuation of our
derivatives and foreign debtors and loans. Our hedging programme for the 2018 and 2019 financial
years is complete and positions Sasol well to steer through these periods of volatility. The average
Brent crude oil price moved 28% higher compared to the prior year, and, since December 2017, spot
prices have moved closer to the US$75 per barrel mark which positively impacted our results. The rand
per barrel oil price increased by approximately 20% to R818 per barrel compared to 2017, (refer to table
above), and has subsequently increased by approximately 15% – 25% since the end of June 2018. The
spot rand per barrel oil price is now ranging between R950 and R1 050 per barrel.

Sasol experienced some challenges with regards to its operational and cost performance during the
year, largely due to planned and unplanned production interruptions at Natref and a safety related
stoppage at Mining in the first half of the year, which adversely impacted sales and cost across the
value chain. Despite two additional safety related stoppages at Mining and unplanned electricity
outages in Secunda, we managed to claw back and deliver a stronger operational performance in the
second half of the year through focused interventions and management actions. Our Eurasian
operations increased production volumes by 3% due to stronger product demand and increased plant
availability. In the last quarter, we have seen considerably higher yields and production volumes across
the value chain which are more closely aligned to our internal targets. We are well positioned to continue
with this improved operational performance into the 2019 financial year.
Sales volumes increased by 1% for our Performance Chemicals business spurred by robust market
demand despite Eskom electricity supply interruptions. Base Chemicals reported a 1% decrease in
sales volumes mainly due to production interruptions at SSO and an initial stock build for our high
density polyethylene joint venture in the US. Excluding the impact of Eskom electricity supply
interruptions, sales volumes increased by 1%. Liquid fuels sales volumes were down 2% due to lower
volumes from SSO and Natref and a challenging South African retail liquid fuels market.

Remeasurement and once-off items include:
1. Items recorded in the second half of the financial year:
- As highlighted in our 2018 Interim Results Announcement, we expressed some caution with regards
  to the impact of a stronger long-term rand on the valuation of our Southern African value chain’s
  assets. A partial impairment of R3,7 billion (net of tax) on our South African Chlor Vinyls cash
  generating unit has been recorded as a result of the continued and sustained strengthening of the
  exchange rate outlook and the resulting impact on Base Chemicals margins.
- Due to the weaker long-term macro-economic assumptions, as well as a result of lower than
  expected oil volumes from the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in Mozambique, a partial
  impairment of R1,2 billion (US$89 million) was recorded.
- The implementation of Sasol Khanyisa, our B-BBEE ownership transactions, resulted in the
  recognition of a share-based payment expense (IFRS2 cost) of R3 billion.
2. Items recorded during the first half of the financial year and communicated previously:
- A partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets of R2,8 billion (CAD281 million) largely due
  to a further decline in gas prices.

Our results for the financial year may be further affected by adjustments resulting from our year-end
closure process. This may result in a change in the estimated earnings noted above. All references to
years refer to the financial year ended 30 June.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol's financial results for the financial year ended
30 June 2018 will be announced on Monday, 20 August 2018.

* EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation, amortisation, remeasurement
items, share-based payments and unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities.
** Core HEPS are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period close
adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects, exceeding R4 billion which have
reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up and share-based payments on implementation of
B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period
end are to remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and
other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline
earnings are a useful measure of the group’s sustainable operating performance. However, this is not
a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. The aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The
adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and due to their nature, may not fairly
present Sasol’s financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

Announcement regarding repurchase of preferred ordinary shares from Sasol Inzalo Groups Funding
Proprietary Limited (RF) (“Inzalo Groups Funding”)

1.      Shareholders are reminded that at a general meeting held on 17 November 2017, Sasol shareholders
        authorised the Company, by way of a specific authority, to repurchase all or some of the unlisted Sasol preferred
        ordinary shares (“Preferred Ordinary Shares”) held by Inzalo Groups Funding at the 30-day volume weighted
        average price (“VWAP”) of a Sasol ordinary share of no par value (“SOL Share”) on the business day
        immediately prior to the date of the repurchase since the Preferred Ordinary Shares would have, had they not
        been repurchased today, redesignated as SOL Shares on Wednesday, 27 June 2018.

2.      The 30-day VWAP of a SOL Share on 25 June 2018 was R475,03.

3.      Sasol today repurchased 9 461 882 Preferred Ordinary Shares from Inzalo Groups Funding for a purchase
        price of R475,03 per Preferred Ordinary Share (“the Repurchase”).

4.      After deducting the proceeds of the Repurchase of the Preferred Ordinary Shares from the aggregate amount
        outstanding in respect of the preference shares issued by Inzalo Groups Funding, the preference share funding
        shortfall remaining due as regards the Class C preference shares (together with costs and taxes) is R59,42
        million. On 27 June 2018, Sasol will subscribe for 1 ordinary share in Inzalo Groups Funding for an amount of
        R59,42 million, so as to place Inzalo Groups Funding in funds to settle the Class C preference share funding
        shortfall and any applicable costs and taxes. By doing so, Sasol ensures that the guarantee which it gave to the
        holders of Class C preference shares in Inzalo Groups Funding will not be called up.

5.      The financial effect of the Repurchase on Sasol’s earnings per share, headline earnings per share and net asset
        value per share will be limited to the legal fees, the taxes levied by the South African Revenue Services and the
        JSE documentation fee, which are considered negligible. The Repurchase will be funded from Sasol’s available
        cash resources.

REPURCHASE OF SASOL SHARES BY SASOL FROM THE SASOL INZALO EMPLOYEE SCHEME
AND THE SASOL INZALO MANAGEMENT SCHEME (COLLECTIVELY “INZALO EMPLOYEE
SCHEMES”)

1.     Resolutions in relation to the treatment of the Sasol ordinary shares (SOL Shares) held by the
       Inzalo Employee Schemes at the end of these schemes were passed at a general meeting of
       ordinary shareholders of Sasol held on 16 May 2008. In accordance with these resolutions and
       depending on the SOL Share price prior to the end of the Inzalo Employee Schemes on 4 June
       2018, Sasol was entitled to repurchase some or all of the SOL Shares held by the Inzalo
       Employee Scheme trusts in accordance with the provisions of the Inzalo Employee Scheme trust
       deeds. The Inzalo Employee Scheme trusts together held 25 231 686 SOL Shares.

2.     Sasol exercised its rights of repurchase under the Inzalo Employee Schemes trust deeds on
       4 June 2018 by repurchasing 25 231 686 SOL Shares from the Inzalo Employee Schemes, at a
       nominal value of R0,01 per share (the Specific Repurchase). Accordingly, the Inzalo Employee
       Schemes ceased to hold any SOL Shares and consequently the relevant vested participants in
       the Inzalo Employee Schemes will receive no distribution of SOL Shares.

3.     The effect of the Specific Repurchase is that SOL Shares representing 3,9% of Sasol’s total
       issued share capital before the Specific Repurchase, have been cancelled and restored to
       Sasol’s authorised ordinary share capital with effect from 4 June 2018. After the cancellation,
       Sasol will have 623 066 479 SOL Shares in issue.

4.     Sasol has applied for the delisting of the SOL Shares from the JSE with effect from Thursday,
       07 June 2018. The acquisition will have no financial effect on Sasol or its shareholders, other
       than in respect of Specific Repurchase costs that are normally incurred in transactions of this
       nature. The financial effect of the Specific Repurchase on Sasol’s earnings per share, headline
       earnings per share, net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share will be
       confined to the cost of the sponsor fee, the legal fees, the taxes levied by the South African
       Revenue Services and the JSE documentation fee which are considered negligible. The Specific
       Repurchase has been funded out of Sasol’s existing reserves resulting in a reduction of
       contributed tax capital.

ALLOCATION RELATING TO THE SASOL KHANYISA TRANSACTION


1.      The shareholders of Sasol at the meeting held on Friday, 17 November 2017 approved a transaction
        known as the Sasol Khanyisa transaction. The Sasol Khanyisa transaction comprised a number of
        elements, one of which is a free share allocation (“Free Share Allocation”) under the Sasol Khanyisa
        Invitation. High level details of the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation can be found in the circular to Sasol
        shareholders dated Wednesday, 18 October 2017, which is available on the Sasol website at
        www.sasol.com.


2.      We refer to the joint announcement published on 29 March 2018 relating to the Free Share Allocation
        to holders of SOLBE1 Shares and SIPBEE Shares whose names appear on the relevant securities
        registers on Friday, 6 April 2018 (""Record Date"") (""Eligible Shareholders"").


3.      Sasol Khanyisa will send a letter (""Letter"") to Eligible Shareholders on 16 April 2018 with full details
        of their entitlement to receive:


        3.1.    from Sasol Khanyisa Public, ordinary shares for free; and


        3.2.    from Sasol, arranged by Sasol Khanyisa Public, SOLBE1 Shares for free,


        (""Free Shares"").
                                                                                                             2


4.   Disposals of SOLBE1 Shares and/or SIPBEE Shares


     Eligible Shareholders need to be aware that from the date of this announcement:


     4.1.   if SOLBE1 Shares are sold before Wednesday, 9 May 2018, the buyer/s will receive the right
            to the associated portion of the Free Shares (this is what is known as trading ""cum rights"");


     4.2.   if SIPBEE Shares are sold before Wednesday, 9 May 2018 when trading in SIPBEE Shares
            will be suspended, they will be sold cum rights and that, accordingly, the buyer/s will receive
            the right to the associated portion of the Free Shares.


5.   Suspension of trading in SIPBEE Shares


     5.1.   Trading in SIPBEE Shares on the BEE Segment of the JSE will be suspended from
            Wednesday, 9 May 2018 until they are delisted on or about 7 September 2018 in accordance
            with the terms of their listing on the BEE Segment on 1 December 2015.


     5.2.   The reason for the suspension is to avoid any purchaser of SIPBEE Shares after Wednesday,
            9 May 2018 from having any expectation that such purchaser will receive the portion of the
            Free Share Allocation applicable to those SIPBEE Shares.

        1.1.    SOLBE1 shareholders validly exercised the Election Right in respect of 962 277 SOLBE1
                shares. Accordingly –

                             Thursday, 5 April 2018 and will remain as SOLBE1 shares; and

                1.1.2.       245 741 SOLBE1 shares will be issued as capitalisation shares to the holders
                             of such SOLBE1 Shares on Friday, 1 June 2018.

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING SUSPENSION OF TRADING IN SOLBE1 SHARES OF

1.      We refer to the SENS announcement published on Wednesday, 21 February 2018 relating to the
        consequences of not exercising the Election Right as more fully described in that SENS
        announcement.

2.      Should a SOLBE1 shareholder –

        2.3.    have disposed of some of such SOLBE1 shareholder’s SOLBE1 Shares from Wednesday,

        09:00, Tuesday, 27 March 2018 until 09:00 on Friday, 6 April 2018. The reason for this suspension
        is that the SOLBE1 Shares in question will automatically re-designate as SOL Shares on Thursday,
        5 April 2018 and the suspension in trading is required in order to enable the correct shareholders’
        names to be on the SOLBE1 securities register on Thursday, 29 March 2018, being the record date
        for purposes of the re-designation (“Record Date”). The names of the Non-Electing SOLBE1

        to the SOL securities register on Thursday, 5 April 2018.

SPECIFIC REPURCHASE AND CANCELLATION OF ORDINARY SHARES HELD
BY SUBSIDIARY

At the annual general meeting held on 17 November 2017, Sasol
shareholders approved a specific authority to acquire 8 809
886 ordinary shares from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sasol
Investment Company (Pty) Ltd (SIC) at Sasol’s closing ordinary
share price on the business day prior to the approval of the
repurchase by the Sasol board of directors (the Board) or its
nominee (Specific Repurchase).

In accordance with the authority conferred on him by the
Board, the Chief Financial Officer today, after the Board
concluded that Sasol satisfied the solvency and liquidity test
as required in terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE
Limited (JSE), sections 4 and 46 of the Companies Act,
approved the Specific Repurchase of 8 809 886 ordinary shares
from SIC at the closing price on 23 February 2018 of R394.50
per ordinary share effective, 26 February 2018.

The effect is that the shares have been cancelled and restored
to Sasol’s authorised ordinary share capital as from today. No
treasury shares will be in issue after the Specific
Repurchase. Application will be made to the JSE for the
delisting of the shares with effect from Monday, 5 March 2018.
The acquisition will have no financial effect on Sasol or its
shareholders, other than in respect of Specific Repurchase
costs that are normally incurred in transactions of this
nature. As the Specific Repurchase is intra-group, between
Sasol and its wholly-owned subsidiary, SIC, the net cash
position of the Sasol group will not change as a result of the
acquisition (except for the payment of the transaction costs).

Consequently, the financial effect of the Specific Repurchase
on Sasol’s earnings per share, headline earnings per share,
net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per
share will be confined to the cost of the sponsor fee, the
legal fees, the taxes levied by the South African Revenue
Services and the JSE documentation fee which are considered
negligible. The Specific Repurchase will be funded out of
Sasol’s existing reserves resulting in a reduction of
contributed tax capital.

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa said:
Our sustained focus on cost, cash and capital conservation drove a largely strong set of results, notwithstanding
continued macro-economic volatility. The recent recovery in global oil and product prices positively impacted our
results, however this was offset by operational challenges at our Natref and Mining operations, currency effects
and poor economic conditions in South Africa. Encouraging recent developments signal a more stable political and
investor friendly outlook for the country, in addition to a more positive global growth outlook with stronger
demand in markets where we operate. Our recent safety performance has regrettably been marred by tragic
fatalities in our mining operations. We are committed to the safety and health of our employees, communities and
the environment. Safety, as one of our core values and number one priority receives our constant and
unwavering attention.

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell said:
We are making steady progress in delivering the LCCP within the revised schedule, as we place increased emphasis
on business readiness. Once fully operational, the LCCP will transform Sasol's earnings profile¹. The start-up of this
world-scale chemicals facility and the implementation of our broad-based black economic empowerment
ownership structure, Sasol Khanyisa, are landmark milestones to be delivered this calendar year. Guided by our
clear strategic choices, we will continue to enhance our robust foundation to deliver on our refined value-based
growth strategy. To this end, exercising disciplined capital allocation remains paramount to ensure we deliver
sustainable growth and ongoing value to our shareholders.

Financial results overview(2,4)
Sasol delivered a largely strong set of results, underpinned by higher crude oil and product prices, increased
demand for our specialty chemical products and a satisfactory operational performance across the value chain. Our
results were however constrained by poor economic conditions in South Africa, which impacted on demand for our
products, as well as operational challenges at our Natref and Mining operations, a much stronger closing rand/US dollar
exchange rate and the negative impact of remeasurement and once-off items.

Earnings attributable to shareholders for the six months ended 31 December 2017 decreased by 20% to R6,9 billion
from R8,7 billion in the prior period. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 17% to R17,67 and earnings per
share (EPS) decreased by 21% to R11,29 compared to the prior period. EPS was negatively impacted by the scrapping
of our US gas-to-liquids (GTL) project amounting to R1,1 billion (US$83 million) and a partial impairment of our
Canadian shale gas assets of R2,8 billion (CAD281 million).

Core headline earnings(3) increased by 5% to R18,22 per share compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of
higher crude oil and product prices, higher margins in specialty chemicals and improved refining margins, partially
offset by the stronger rand/US dollar exchange rate.

1   This forward looking statement is the responsibility of the directors and in accordance with standard practice, it is noted that this
    statement has not been reviewed and reported on by the company's auditors.

2   All comparisons to the prior period refer to the six months ended 31 December 2016. Except for earnings attributable to 
    shareholders and the RP cash conservation measures, all numbers are quoted on a pre-tax basis.

3   Core headline earnings are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period close adjustments and depreciation
    and amortisation of significant capital projects, exceeding R4 billion which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up
    and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our
    derivatives at period end is to remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and other
    market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period. We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of
    the group's sustainable operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

4   All non-GAAP measures (such as normalised operating profit, core headline earnings, adjusted effective tax rate, etc.) have not been
    reviewed and reported on by the company's auditors.

Sasol's core headline earnings were impacted by the following notable once-off and period close items:

Average Brent crude oil prices moved higher by 19% and since December 2017, spot prices have moved closer to the
US$70/bbl mark, which if sustained at these levels, are expected to positively impact our results during the second
half of financial year 2018. Similarly, our Natref refining margins increased by 16% to US$9,73/bbl. In the chemicals
business, we have seen a steady increase in most commodity chemical prices and the average margins for most of
our specialty chemicals products, in dollar terms, have remained resilient.

Excluding the effect of our hedging programme, the average rand/US dollar market exchange rate strengthened by
4% from the prior period to R13,40, and the closing rand/US dollar market exchange rate strengthened by 5% from
R13,06 in June 2017 to R12,37. This resulted in translation losses of R1,2 billion on the valuation of the balance sheet
compared to translation losses of R341 million in the prior period.

Operational performance overview
-   At Mining, we are continuing to stabilise our mining operations post the strike in financial year 2017. We have
    seen some improvement in production run rates and will intensify our focus on safe and reliable operations as
    we improve the productivity rate to pre strike levels;

-   Production volumes from Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) decreased by 1% due to a planned shutdown;

-   Production volumes from our Eurasian Operations increased by 2% due to stronger product demand and
    increased plant availability;

-   ORYX GTL continued to deliver an exceptional performance, with an average utilisation rate of 99%;

-   Natref's production volumes were down 21% owing to plant shutdowns and an unexpected Eskom electricity
    supply interruption at the start of the financial period. This, together with softer market demand, lowered our
    liquid fuels sales volumes by 3%. We have implemented a Crude Procurement and Refinery Optimisation
    Programme (CPROP) that is aimed at improving plant availability and optimising the business operational
    performance over the ensuing months;

-   Our Performance Chemicals sales volumes, increased by 3% mainly due to increased market demand; and

-   Our Base Chemicals sales volumes decreased by 1% mainly due to lower volumes from SSO due to the 
    Superflex Catalytic Cracker (SCC) shutdown and higher inventory holdings resulting from port constraints in South Africa.

Cost, cash and capital performance
Our low oil Response Plan (RP) achieved capital conservation and cash savings of R6,2 billion for the period. This
brings the total capital and cash conserved since January 2015 to R75,6 billion, which exceeds our target of 
R65-75 billion. Our focus for the remainder of FY18 will be to further improve the level of our sustainable cost 
savings and to fully embed the cost containment culture established through our people.

To enhance our cost competitiveness and to remain profitable at an oil price of $40/bbl, we are transitioning to a
Continuous Improvement (CI) programme that is built on the solid foundation established by the Business
Performance Enhancement Programme and the RP. Our medium term target is to increase our Return on
Invested Capital (ROIC) for our foundation businesses by at least two percentage points by 2022, off a 2017 base. Digitisation, 
simplification of processes, capital efficiency and sharing of services will be key drivers to achieving our CI targets. 
Further detail on the targeted elements of CI (cost, gross margin and capital) will be communicated in August 2018.

Cash fixed costs, excluding capital growth and once-off business establishment costs, increased by 2% in real terms
due to the cost impact of production interruptions. Inflation for the period was 4,7%. We are however focused on
ensuring that we remain cost competitive and can contain our cost within inflation, while ensuring that we
maintain safe and reliable operations. Accordingly, our forecast for the financial year indicates that cash fixed cost
increases will still track our targeted inflation rate of 6%.

Our net cash position decreased by 44%, from R29,3 billion in June 2017 to R16,3 billion as at 31 December 2017 due
to the funding of the LCCP and investments to fund growth projects. Loans raised during the period amounted to 
R18,7 billion, mainly for the funding of our growth projects. The increase in short term debt relates to the 
Inzalo transaction unwinding between June and September 2018. During the period, we increased our existing 
US$1,5 billion Revolving Credit Facility to US$3,9 billion and extended the maturity to five years, with the 
inclusion of two further extension options of one year each. In addition, our Domestic Medium Term Note Programme of 
R8 billion provides us with access to the South African debt capital markets. The focus on our funding plan will 
now shift to put longer-term debt instruments in place.

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 17% to R14 billion compared with R16,8 billion in the prior
period. This is largely attributable to an increase in working capital underpinned by planned inventory builds and
increased prices.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R27,7 billion. This includes R16,7 billion (US$1,2 billion)
relating to the LCCP. Our capital expenditure estimate for the full year has been revised down to R54 billion largely
due to optimisation of the capital portfolio.

Due to the funding of the LCCP, gearing increased to 39%, which is in line with our targets and current market
guidance. Notwithstanding the current oil price volatility and the stronger rand exchange rate, we are still planning
to manage the balance sheet to below our peak internal gearing target of 44% by the end of the 2018 financial year.
We are actively reviewing our capital structure and funding plan to ensure that we maintain an optimum solvency
and liquidity profile. The unwind of the Inzalo transaction will be structured to ensure that our credit ratings are
maintained at investment grade and with the least amount of dilution to our shareholders. We expect our gearing
to remain around peak levels in the 2019 financial year due to the higher debt associated with the Inzalo unwind. 

In January 2018, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Sasol's credit rating at a BBB-/A-3 with a stable outlook. This is two
notches above the South African sovereign credit rating and is at investment grade. Similarly Moody's Investors
Service (Moody's) placed South Africa's Baa3/negative ratings on review for downgrade in November 2017, while
affirming Sasol's global scale long-term issuer ratings at Baa3, with a negative outlook. Sasol's national scale long-
term rating was affirmed at Aaa.za. Moody's has delinked Sasol from the South African sovereign rating by one
notch.

Our attributable earnings were significantly impacted by mostly once-off items, impairments and translation
effects. Accordingly, to provide more stability in the dividend payment, the Board has approved a change in
dividend policy to pay dividends with a dividend cover range based on Core HEPS. As previously reported Core HEPS
reflects the sustainable business operations and is used by the Board to measure the business and financial
performance. Taking into account the impact of the current volatile macro-economic environment, capital
investment plans, the current strength of our balance sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a
gross interim dividend of R5,00 per share (4% higher compared to the prior year). The dividend cover was 3,6 times at
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 3,2 times).

Update on hedging activities
Sasol entered into a number of hedges to mitigate specific financial risks and provide protection against
unforeseen movements in oil prices, interest rates, currency movements, commodity and final product prices. A net
gain of R0,6 billion was recognised on the valuation of open hedges for financial year 2018 and 2019. These include:

-   R3,9 billion gain on the rand/US dollar zero-cost collars. The open instruments were valued against an average
    floor of R13,70/US$1;

-   R2,5 billion loss on Brent crude oil put options. The open instruments were valued against an average strike of
    US$49/bbl; and

-   R0,8 billion loss on export coal swaps.

Should attractive hedges become available in the market at an acceptable cost, we will enter into additional hedges
in mitigation against these financial risks. The volumes hedged, exposure and floor prices for financial years 2018
and 2019 are detailed in the Analyst Book available on our website, www.sasol.com.

Effective tax rate
The increase in the effective corporate tax rate from 28,4% to 31,6% was mainly as a result of the R2,8 billion
partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets. The adjusted effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted
investments, remeasurements and once-off items, is 26,4% compared to 29,2% in the prior period due to energy
efficiency allowances.

Effect of a stronger rand exchange rate
The rand strengthened significantly against the US dollar in December 2017. The continued and sustained strengthening of 
the rand/US dollar exchange rate in the second half of the financial year could result in the impairment of certain of 
our South African chemical businesses as their margins are highly sensitive to the exchange rate. Further the stronger 
rand/US dollar may have an impact on our provisions, discount rates and capital estimates at 30 June 2018.

Satisfactory operational performance, higher oil and product prices (1,3)
Operating Business Units

Mining – focus on stabilising operations post the strike, benefitting from higher global coal prices
Operating profit increased by 87% to R2,9 billion compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of additional costs
associated with the strike action in financial year 2017. Normalised operating profit, excluding the strike cost,
increased by 13% due to higher selling prices to SSO and a 19% increase in export coal prices.

We are continuing to ramp up our mining operations to achieve the targeted production run-rates, pre the strike.
The business improvement plan (BIP), which is aimed at improving productivity and cost efficiency, is currently
underway and some benefits have already been noted. However, our momentum was interrupted in August 2017 by
an unplanned mining incident and in December 2017 by a tragic fatality which resulted in lower productivity.
Accordingly, our normalised unit cost of production increased by 3% above inflation to R284/ton compared to the
prior year. We are now focusing on making the operations safe and consequently, we expect our production to be
lower than planned for the full year.

Our immediate attention is on a return to safe and reliable operations to ensure a continuous supply to Sasol's
integrated value chain. We are currently restoring coal stockpiles through our own production and additional
external purchases. We therefore are targeting a unit cost of production of between R285/ton to R295/ton for the
full year. Additional coal purchases will negatively impact on our unit cost per sales ton.

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) – strong operational delivery from Mozambique and
Gabon
E&PI recorded an operating profit of R115 million, excluding the impairment of our Canadian shale gas operations of
R2,8 billion, compared to an operating profit of R204 million in the prior period.

Operating profit from our Mozambican producing operations increased from R988 million in the prior period to
R1 187 million due to higher sales prices and the positive impact of foreign currency gains.

Our Gabon asset recorded an operating profit of R47 million compared to an operating loss of R41 million in the
prior period, mainly due to higher sales prices. This was partially offset by a 3% decrease in production volumes
resulting from the natural decline of the field.

We impaired our Canadian shale gas assets by a further R2,8 billion (CAD281 million) due to a further decline in long-
term gas prices. The remaining carrying value of the property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2017 is R3,5
billion (CAD357 million). The disposal process for these assets has commenced, however these assets have not yet
been classified as held-for-sale. Further announcements will be made once the process is at an advanced stage.

Strategic Business Units

Performance Chemicals – increased sales volumes, resilient margins, adversely impacted by stronger rand
Sales volumes increased by 3% compared to the prior period, due to higher demand for our commodity products,
mainly organics and wax. The margins in our European and US specialty businesses remained resilient, benefitting
from robust demand and favourable market conditions. Production volumes from our Eurasian Operations
increased by 2% due to stronger demand and increased plant availability.

Our operating profit, decreased by 14% compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of Hurricane Harvey, the
stronger rand exchange rate and start-up costs associated with our growth projects. Based on the latest business
performance and strong market demand, we expect to recover some of the lost margins in the second half of the
year.

Base Chemicals – higher prices, profitability adversely impacted by the stronger rand
Sales volumes decreased by 1% due to lower volumes from SSO as a result of the SCC shutdown, and higher inventory
holdings resulting from port constraints in South Africa. In the US, our ethylene sales volumes decreased by 34%
due to Hurricane Harvey and an initial stock build at our high-density polyethylene (HDPE) joint venture that
reached beneficial operation in November 2017.

Our operating profit, normalised for once-off items and translation effects on the valuation of the balance sheet,
increased by 6% compared to the prior period mainly due to higher prices.

Our basket of commodity chemical US dollar prices improved by 10%, however this benefit was partially offset by a
4% stronger rand/US dollar exchange rate. Solvents prices increased considerably on the back of increased propylene 
prices and short term price opportunities in the ketones market.

Our 50% joint venture HDPE plant with Ineos Olefins and Polymers USA achieved beneficial operation on
11 November 2017. The plant is ramping up with the initial stock build progressing well.

Energy – margins improve, but volumes under pressure
Our normalised operating margin increased from 18% to 21% mainly as a result of improved production and cost
performance of our international GTL ventures as well as the higher international prices of refined products,
partially offset by mostly lower liquid fuels and gas sales volumes and the impact of a stronger rand/US dollar
exchange rate.

Operating profit increased by 4% to R5 748 million when compared to the prior period. Excluding remeasurement
items, most notably the scrapping of our US GTL project, operating profit increased by 26%.

We are taking measurable actions to address operational challenges at our Natref operations, focusing on plant
availability and improved run rates.

ORYX GTL delivered an excellent production performance with an average utilisation rate of 99%. ORYX GTL
contributed R454 million to operating profit with volumes increasing by 4% compared to the prior period.

At Escravos GTL in Nigeria, we are continuing with optimisation efforts to reduce costs and improve plant
efficiency. Planned maintenance work is underway as we ramp up the plant towards design capacity.

The challenging economic environment also impacted our gas sales volumes to the external market, resulting in a
reduction of 7% compared to the prior period. The available gas was, however, utilised internally in our integrated
value chain.

Advancing projects to enable future growth
We are making steady progress in delivering on our growth pipeline:

-   Growing our footprint in North America:
    -   Overall construction on the LCCP continues on all fronts, with most engineering and procurement activities
        nearing completion. At 31 December 2017, capital expenditure amounted to US$8,8 billion, and the overall
        project completion was 81%. The total forecasted capital cost for the project remains within the previous
        market guidance of US$11,13 billion and is tracking the approved schedule. We are very pleased to see an
        improvement in productivity post Hurricane Harvey and will continue to closely monitor the productivity
        rates as we approach beneficial operation for the first units in the second half of calendar year 2018. The tax
        reform in the US has positively impacted on the returns of the project and we expect, based on our current
        interpretation of the tax reform, that the net present value will increase by between US$400 -
        US$500 million.

        As previously reported, we are still of the view that limited structural changes have occurred to market
        fundamentals since February 2017, when we last published the long-term Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the
        project. Hence based on our internal assessment, we are of the view that the IRR is in a range of between
        7,5% to 8,5%, based on conservative ethane prices. At spot prices, using the last quarter of the 2017 calendar
        year as a reference, the IRR is between 9% and 9,5%. These updated numbers include the benefits from the
        tax reform. The revised economics, earnings profile, capital spend and sensitivities are detailed in the Analyst
        Book available on our website, www.sasol.com.

-   Focusing on our asset base in Southern Africa:
    -   Our strategic R14 billion mine replacement programme, which will ensure uninterrupted coal supply to SSO in
        order to support Sasol's strategy to operate its Southern African facilities until 2050, is nearing completion.
        Phase two of the Impumelelo Colliery project which commenced during the first half of the 2016 calendar
        year is on track to be completed within budget, late in the 2019 calendar year.

    -   In Mozambique, we have successfully drilled and tested nine wells relating to the first phase of the
        development programme for the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) licence area and at the end of
        December 2017 drilled the first of two delineation wells relating to the second phase. We anticipate oil
        production to be between the mid to lower end of the range presented in the Field Development Plan. The
        gas wells have confirmed that there is sufficient gas to cover our future downstream opportunities. The
        surface facilities design and oil field development plan are being optimised and it is anticipated that
        substantial capital savings will be realised.

    -   In continuing to execute our strategy, we have concluded a farm-in into the DE8 block in Gabon where we
        now hold 40% working interest of that block. An exploration well is currently being drilled with results
        expected before the end of the quarter.

Maintaining our focus on safety and sustainable value creation
We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the year:

-   In the first six months, we experienced two tragic fatalities which deeply concern us. Our heartfelt condolences
    go out to the families of our employees who lost their lives. These fatal incidents have undergone detailed
    investigations, and, together with senior level meetings, learning insights are being developed and embedded in
    our on-going efforts to prevent similar incidents.

    Our 12 month rolling RCR for employees and service providers, excluding illnesses, is 0,30 at December 2017 as
    compared to 0,27 for December 2016. We remain committed to our goal of zero harm through continuous
    improvement actions to eliminate high severity incidents in all our operations.

-   During the period, we invested R681 million in skills development and socio-economic development, which
    includes our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa
    programme focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the Secunda
    and Sasolburg regions.

-   In December 2017, National Treasury released the second draft of the proposed Carbon Tax Bill for comment.
    While Sasol supports a just transition to a lower-carbon economy, we remain concerned that the proposed
    carbon tax will further diminish the country's investment attractiveness and competitiveness. A preliminary
    review of the Bill indicates that a number of concerns remain including non-alignment to the Department of
    Environmental Affairs' carbon budget mechanism post 2020. Sasol continues to engage with our government
    stakeholders on all the aspects of climate change policy, including carbon tax.

-   To ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, Sasol applied for certain
    postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance timeframes. We are on track
    with the implementation of committed air quality roadmaps, supporting the 2014 postponement decisions.
    Shorter postponements were also granted and further applications are underway.

-   We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response in accordance with our key performance
    indicators. Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all operations globally are projected to reduce
    marginally to 67,1 million tons when compared to 67,6 million tons in the prior year. Our GHG emissions intensity
    (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of production) is projected to be relatively constant at 3,70
    compared to 3,66 in 2017.

-   The Energy Efficiency programme to consolidate monitoring and reporting across the group shows an
    improvement from the 2015 baseline to date for the Sasol Group Energy Intensity index (EIi) of 4,59%. Our utility
    EIi for the 2018 half year improved above our internal target of 0,5% to 2,43% for the South African Operations.
    The consolidated EIi, which includes our international operations, improved by 0,57% from the previous financial
    year.

-   During the period, we paid R18,2 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South African government. Sasol
    remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South Africa, contributing significantly to the country's
    economy.

-   The Department of Water and Sanitation is planning for material changes in the water sector and have released
    several draft policy, planning and regulatory documents for consultation. These proposed changes could have
    implications for Sasol considering that we are a large water user undertaking various water use activities. Sasol
    will continue to respond to these developments to ensure both business and public interests are realised.

-   Sasol is committed to sustainable transformation and broad-based economic empowerment (B-BBEE). In our
    recent B-BBEE verification, Sasol achieved a Level 6 contributor status representing a key milestone in our
    journey of achieving at least a Level 4 contributor status in 2020.

-   Our shareholders approved the Sasol Khanyisa B-BBEE transaction on 17 November 2017, which marks a
    significant milestone in achieving our B-BBEE ownership credentials.

Unwinding of Inzalo B-BBEE transaction
As reported on 9 October 2017, we have investigated funding options to settle our financing obligations under the
Sasol Inzalo B-BBEE transaction. Based on current market conditions, Sasol plans to settle the Sasol Inzalo Groups
debt of approximately R4,6 billion in June 2018 by utilising our existing cash and credit facilities to repurchase up to
9,5 million preferred ordinary shares from Sasol Inzalo Groups Funding (Pty) Ltd and fund any residual shortfall. At a
Sasol ordinary share price of R425, we expect the scheme to have a shortfall of R1,1 billion. Based on our current
forecast, gearing will remain within our risk appetite of 44% in the 2018 financial year and we are confident that we
will maintain our investment grade credit rating metrics.

The Sasol Inzalo Public debt becomes due in September 2018, and we will make a further announcement on the
source of funding for the settlement of the Sasol Inzalo Public debt in August 2018, based on prevailing market
conditions at that time. We will endeavour to utilise existing cash and credit facilities to settle any residual shortfall
on the Sasol Inzalo Public debt, so as to limit the dilution on our shareholders while maintaining investing grade
ratings.

Business performance outlook* – strong production performance and cost reductions to continue

The current economic climate continues to remain highly volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign
exchange movements are outside our control and may impact our results, our focus remains firmly on managing
factors within our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial
risk management and maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

We expect an overall strong operational performance for the year ending 30 June 2018, with:

-   SSO volumes of 7,7 million tons due to an unplanned electricity supply interruption to our operations in January
    2018;

-   Liquid fuels sales of approximately 59 million barrels due to lower production at Natref and slower South African
    economic growth;

-   Base Chemicals sales volumes, excluding merchant ethylene, to be between 1% to 3% higher than the prior year,
    with US dollar product pricing expected to follow oil prices. Normalised operating profit for the full financial year
    is estimated to be between R3 billion to R5 billion;

-   Performance Chemicals sales volumes, excluding merchant ethylene, to be between 2% to 3% higher, with
    average margins for the business remaining resilient;

-   Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement in Mozambique to be between 114 bscf to
    118 bscf;

-   Average utilisation rate at ORYX GTL in Qatar to exceed 92%, taking into account two planned plant shutdowns
    in the second half of the financial year;

-   Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line within our inflation assumption of 6%;

-   Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R54 billion for 2018 and R38 billion for 2019 as we progress
    with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result of exchange rate
    volatility and other factors;

-   Our balance sheet gearing up to 44%;

-   Rand/US dollar exchange rate to range between R12,50 and R14,00; and

-   Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$55/bbl and US$65/bbl.

*The financial information contained in this business performance outlook is the responsibility of the directors and in accordance with
 standard practice, it is noted that this information has not been reviewed and reported on by the company's auditors.

Competition law compliance
The South African Competition Commission conducted proceedings against various petroleum products producers,
including Sasol. Sasol and the other companies involved settled the matter with the Competition Commission on a
no fine and no admission of guilt basis including undertakings regarding the exchange of information within the
industry in future. The application for confirmation of the settlement agreement was heard before the Competition
Tribunal on 7 February 2018. The tribunal has accepted the settlement agreement in principle, subject to the
Commission and respondents making two minor amendments to the settlement agreement. We continue to
interact and cooperate with the South African Competition Commission in respect of leniency applications as well
as in the areas that are subject to the South African Competition Commission investigations.

Tax litigation and contingency

As previously reported, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued revised assessments for Sasol Oil (Pty)
Ltd (Sasol Oil) relating to a dispute around our international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to 2012
tax years. These revisions could result in potential adjustments to the company's taxable income and an additional
tax liability (including interest and penalties until 31 December 2017) of approximately R1,3 billion for the periods
2005 to 2014. Sasol Oil has co-operated fully with SARS during the course of the audit related to these
assessments. SARS' decision to suspend the payment of this disputed tax for the periods 2005 to 2014 currently
remains in force.

The litigation process in the Tax Court, relating to the international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005 to
2007 years of assessment was concluded and judgement was delivered on 30 June 2017 in favour of SARS. As a
result, a liability of R1,3 billion has been recognised in the interim financial statements in respect of the 2005 to
2014 matters that remain the subject of the ongoing litigation. Sasol Oil, in consultation with its tax and legal
advisors, does not support the basis of the judgement and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Appeal. Sasol
Oil anticipates the matter to be heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal in quarter three of calendar year 2018.

SARS has notified Sasol Oil of its intention to place on hold the field audit relating to this issue for the 1999 to 2004
tax years pending the outcome of the litigation. As a result of the judgement handed down on 30 June 2017, a
possible obligation may arise from the field audit, which is regarded as a contingent liability.

In addition, there could be a potential tax exposure of R12,1 billion for the periods 2013 to 2014 on varying tax
principles relating to the aforementioned activities. Supported by specialist tax and legal advisors, Sasol Oil
disagrees with SARS' assessment for the 2013 and 2014 periods. This also remains the subject of an ongoing appeal
with the Tax Court lodged by Sasol Oil. A possible obligation may arise for the tax years subsequent to 2014, which
could give rise to a future contingent liability.

In 2010, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) commenced with a request for information on Sasol Financing
International Plc (SFI). This matter progressed into an audit over the years and has now culminated in the
issuance of a final audit letter on 16 February 2018. Consequently, revised assessments were issued in respect of
the 2002 to 2012 tax years. These revisions relate to a dispute around the place of effective management of SFI, an
offshore treasury function, and could result in potential tax exposure of R3 billion (including interest and penalties).
SFI has co-operated fully with SARS during the course of the audit related to these assessments. SFI, in
consultation with its tax and legal advisors, does not support the basis of these additional assessments for all the
years. Accordingly, SFI will submit objections and/or appeals (as the case may be) to the revised assessments as the
legal process unfolds. SFI has already submitted the application for suspension of payment.

Sasol is committed to compliance with tax laws and any disputes with tax authorities on the interpretation of tax
laws and regulations will be addressed in a transparent and constructive manner.

Change in directors
Ms Imogen Mkhize retired as non-executive director with effect from 17 November 2017 and Dr Martina Flöel was
appointed as non-executive director with effect from 1 January 2018.

Declaration of cash dividend number 77
An interim gross cash dividend of South African 500 cents per ordinary share (31 December 2016 – 480 cents per
ordinary share) has been declared for the six months ended 31 December 2017. The cash dividend is payable on the
ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the
company, as well as capital remaining after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support the current operations

Basis of preparation

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 31 December 2017 have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, the
SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements
as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa,
2008, as amended, and the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the disclosures required for complete
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a going-concern basis. The Board
is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the company is sufficient to support the current operations for the
next 12 months.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historic
cost convention except that certain items, including derivative financial instruments, liabilities for cash-settled
share-based payment schemes, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale financial
assets and liabilities, are stated at fair value.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in South African Rand, which is Sasol
Limited's functional and presentation currency.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements appearing in this announcement are the responsibility of
the directors. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements. Paul Victor CA(SA), Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for this set of condensed
consolidated interim financial statements and has supervised the preparation thereof in conjunction with the
Senior Vice President: Financial Control Services, Brenda Baijnath CA(SA).

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements
are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the consolidated annual financial statements for the
year ended 30 June 2017.

Related party transactions
The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an arm's
length basis at market rates with related parties.

Significant events and transactions since 30 June 2017
In accordance with IAS34, Interim Financial Reporting, we have included an explanation of events and transactions
which are significant to obtain an understanding of the changes in our financial position and performance since
30 June 2017.

Financial instruments

Fair value
Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined unless the instrument is listed in an active market.
Where possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below represents significant financial instruments measured at fair value at reporting date, or for which
fair value is disclosed at 31 December 2017. The US dollar bond, the interest rate swap, the crude oil put options, the
zero-cost foreign exchange collars and the coal swaps were considered to be significant financial instruments for
the group based on the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position. The calculation of fair value
requires various inputs into the valuation methodologies used. The source of the inputs used affects the reliability
and accuracy of the valuations. Financial instruments have been classified into the hierarchical levels in line with
IFRS 13.

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or indirectly).
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are unobservable.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements, including the segment report for the six

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING DATE FROM WHICH SOLBE1 ELECTION RIGHT MAY BE EXERCISED
AND CONSEQUENCES OF NOT EXERCISING THE SOLBE1 ELECTION RIGHT

1.    We refer to the SENS announcement published on 29 January 2018 relating
      to the Election Right.


2.    The purpose of this announcement is to advise –


      2.1.   each SOLBE1 shareholder who is entitled to exercise the Election
             Right, that such SOLBE1 shareholder may do so from today, Wednesday,
             21 February 2018 but the last date and time by which the Election,
             if   exercised,   must    be   received     by     Computershare,    the    SOLBE1
             shareholder’s CSDP or broker is 12h00 on Thursday, 22 March 2018;


      2.2.   that should a SOLBE1 shareholder –


             2.2.1.    not exercise the Election Right during the period referred
                       to in paragraph 2.1;


             2.2.2.    have    disposed     of   or   dispose    of   some   of   such   SOLBE1
                       shareholder’s SOLBE1 Shares from Wednesday, 7 February
                       2018; or


             2.2.3.    have acquired SOLBE1 Shares from Wednesday, 7 February
                       2018;


             2.2.4.    have exercised the Election Right but the election is void
                       for any reason,


           such SOLBE1 shareholder will be unable to trade in such SOLBE1
           shareholder’s SOLBE1 Shares or remaining SOLBE1 Shares, as the case
           may be, from 17:00 on Monday, 26 March 2018 (“Last Day to Trade”)
           until 09:00 on Friday, 6 April 2018.   The reason for this is that
           the SOLBE1 Shares in question will automatically re-designate as

SASOL ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING AN ELECTION RIGHT BEING GRANTED TO SOLBE1
SHAREHOLDERS AND THE SOLBE1 BONUS AWARD ? DECLARATION AND FINALISATION
ANNOUNCEMENT

1.      Introduction


        On Friday, 17 November 2017, Sasol shareholders approved, inter alia, the
        Sasol Khanyisa transaction which included changes to the rights attaching
        to SOLBE1 Shares to enable a right of election, more fully detailed in
        paragraph 2.1 (the ?Election Right?), to be given to the holders of SOLBE1
        Shares whose names appear on the securities register on an appropriate
        record date to be determined by Sasol. This date has been determined as
        Friday, 9 February 2018 (the ?Record Date?). Further details regarding the
        Election Right are contained in the circular published to Sasol shareholders
        on 18 October 2017, a copy of which can be viewed at
        http://www.sasol.com/sites/sasol/files/content/files/Sasol%20Limited%20Cir
        cular_Web%20FINAL_0.PDF.

2.      Election Right and SOLBE1 Bonus Award


        2.1.   The Election Right, if exercised (the ?Election?), will result in
               those SOLBE1 Shares in respect of which such right is exercised, not
               automatically re-designating as SOL Shares on 5 April 2018 (being the
               earlier re-designation date determined by the Sasol board and
               communicated on SENS on 17 November 2017), but remaining as SOLBE1
               Shares. Additionally, if the Election Right is exercised, the SOLBE1
               shareholder in question will receive, on 1 June 2018, a bonus award
               in the form of a capitalisation issue, of one SOLBE1 Share for every
               four SOLBE1 Shares held on the Record Date. In accordance with a
               ruling granted by the JSE, fractional entitlements to SOLBE1 Shares
               will be rounded up to achieve the issue of whole numbers of SOLBE1
               Shares.
     2.2.   All SOLBE1 Shareholders registered on the securities register on the
            Record Date will receive the document containing the Election Right
            and details of how to exercise the Election Right, which will be
            distributed to SOLBE1 Shareholders on or about 16 February 2018.

3.   Last Day to Trade (including off-market transactions) in order to be eligible
     for the Election Right


     In order to be eligible for the Election Right, the last day to transact
     (whether on or off-market) in SOLBE1 Shares so as to be on the securities
     register on the Record Date, being Friday, 9 February 2018, is Tuesday, 6
     February 2018 (the ?Last Day to Trade?).


4.   Transactions (including acquisitions, disposals and transfers) in SOLBE1
     Shares after the Last Day to Trade


     From Wednesday, 7 February 2018 (and even after the Record Date) ?


     4.1    any person who acquires or takes transfer of SOLBE1 Shares will not
            be entitled to the Election Right in respect of those SOLBE1 Shares;
            and


     4.2    any SOLBE1 shareholder who disposes of or transfers SOLBE1 Shares will
            not be entitled to exercise the Election Right at all, even in respect
            of any remaining SOLBE1 Shares held by that shareholder on Friday,
            9 February 2018 and even if that SOLBE1 shareholder receives the
            document containing the Election Right.

5.   Some salient terms and conditions of the Election Right


     5.1.   To be valid the Election Right can only be exercised in respect of a
            shareholder?s entire holding of SOLBE1 Shares on the Record Date and
            will be irrevocable once made; and


     5.2.   SOLBE1 shareholders who exercise the Election Right will be unable to
            trade in the applicable SOLBE1 Shares from the date on which the
            Election is received by Computershare Nominees Proprietary Limited or
            such shareholder?s CSDP or broker, as applicable, until 5 April 2018.
            On this date, the SOLBE1 Shares, held by those SOLBE1 Shareholders
            who did not exercise the Election Right, will re-designate to SOL
            Shares. If you trade your existing SOLBE1 Shares after dispatching
            the Election Form to Computershare, your CSDP or broker, your Election
            will be treated as invalid. Your Election, even if you do not trade
            after dispatching the Election Form, will only take effect once
            received by Computershare, your CSDP or broker, but continues to be
            irrevocable until received.


     5.3.   The SOLBE1 bonus award shares have not been and will not be registered
            with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the
            US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any securities laws of any
            state of the United States and may not be offered or sold in the
            United States absent an exemption from registration requirements.


     5.4.   If you are in the United States at the time you exercise the Election,
            you must complete and return a U.S. representation letter to
            Computershare, or if Computershare is not your CSDP, to your CSDP or
            broker. You can ask Sasol to provide you with this representation
            letter.

Trading statement for the six months ended 31 December 2017

Sasol’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended 31
December 2017 are expected to increase by between 12% and 17%
(approximating R1,81 to R2,57 per share) compared to the 2017 financial
half year (prior period) HEPS of R15,12. Core HEPS 1 are expected to
increase by between 1% and 6% compared to the prior period CHEPS of R17,41.
Earnings per share (EPS) for the same period are expected to decrease by
between 20% and 25% (approximately R2,84 to R3,55 per share) from the prior
period EPS of R14,21.

Sasol is expected to deliver a largely strong set of results, underpinned
by a satisfactory operational performance across most of the value chain,
higher crude oil and product prices and increased demand for our specialty
chemicals products. Our results were however constrained by poor economic
conditions in South Africa, which impacted on demand for our products, a
less than satisfactory operational performance at our Natref operations, a
much stronger closing rand/US dollar exchange rate and the negative impact
of remeasurement and once-off item charges.

Average Brent crude oil prices moved higher by 19% and since December 2017,
spot prices have moved closer to the US$70/bbl mark, which if sustained at
these levels, are expected to positively impact our results during the
second half of financial year 2018. Similarly, our refining margins
increased by 16% to US$9,73/bbl. We have also seen a steady increase in
most commodity chemical prices. Despite the volatile macro-economic
environment, average margins for most of our specialty chemicals products
increased over the first six months ended 31 December 2017.

Sales and production performance are summarised as follows:
   - Normalised sales volumes increased by 3% for our Performance
      Chemicals business spurred by increased market demand;
   - Base Chemicals business reported a 1% decrease in normalised sales
      volumes attributable to delays at a port in South Africa and the
      impact of Hurricane Harvey in the US. Sales volumes lost as a result
      of the port constraint are expected to be recovered during the second
      half of the financial year;
   - Production volumes from our Secunda Synfuels Operations decreased by
      1% due to a planned shutdown. The Secunda Synfuels production volume
      trend is still in line with our planned 2018 production targets;
   - Our Eurasian Operations increased production volumes by 2% on the
      back of stronger product demand and increased plant availability;
   - Production volumes of 63kt from our FT Wax facility were achieved and
      are in line with market guidance;
   -  Natref’s production volumes were down 21% owing to plant shutdowns
      and an unexpected Eskom electricity supply interruption at the start
      of the financial period. This, together with softer market demand,
      lowered our liquid fuels sales volumes by 3%;
   -  ORYX GTL continued to deliver an exceptional performance, with an
      average utilisation rate of 99%;
   -  Our mining operations were interrupted in December 2017 due to a
      tragic fatality at our Syferfontein Colliery which resulted in lower
      than expected production volumes. We are currently restoring the
      coal stockpile through our own production and additional external
      purchases to ensure continued supply to the Sasol integrated value
      chain.
   -  We are making steady progress with our LCCP project in Lake Charles.
      At 31 December 2017, capital expenditure amounted to US$8,8 billion,
      and the overall project completion was 81%. The total forecast
      capital cost for the project remains within the previous market
      guidance of US$11,13 billion and project progress is tracking the
      approved schedule. The recent tax reform changes in the US will have
      a positive impact on the returns of the asset and are expected to
      provide increased value to shareholders. More detail on the impact of
      the tax reform changes will be shared with the interim results to be
      released on 26 February 2018.

1
  Core headline earnings are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period close adjustments and depreciation and
amortisation of capital projects, exceeding R4 billion which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up and share-based payments
on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end is to remove
volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from
period to period. We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of the group’s sustainable operating performance. However, this is not
a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The afore-mentioned
adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and due to their
nature, may not fairly present Sasol’s financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.


Sasol´s earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2017 will be impacted
by the following notable once off and period close items:

                                                           HEPS       EPS

Included in remeasurement items is an impairment of our US GTL project
amounting to R1,1 billion (US$83 million) and a partial impairment of our
Canadian shale gas assets of R2,8 billion (CAD281 million), driven mainly
by the depressed gas market outlook.

The effective corporate tax rate increased from 28% in the prior year to
31% mainly due to the impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets. The tax
litigation matter in respect of our crude oil procurement process is
ongoing and there are no further significant developments.
Core HEPS(1) are expected to range between an increase by 1% and 6% compared
to the prior period, mainly as a result of higher crude oil and product
prices, higher margins in specialty chemicals and improved refining
margins, partially offset by the stronger rand/US dollar exchange rate. The
increase/(decrease) to Core HEPS is as follows:

Sasol signs US$3,9 billion five-year Revolving Credit Facility

Sasol, the South African chemicals and energy company, has increased its
existing US$1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility (“the Facility”)to US$3,9
billion and extended the maturity to five years, with the inclusion of two
further extension options of one year each (“the Transaction”).

Sasol launched the Transaction with a targeted facility size of US$3,0
billion, which was subsequently increased to US$3,9 billion, given the
notable oversubscription.

Sasol mandated Citi and Mizuho Bank, Ltd as Joint Global Co-ordinators for
the Transaction, which launched in early November 2017 to a targeted group
of banks. The Joint Global Co-ordinators each pre-committed to the
Transaction, and invited banks to commit at one of three ticket levels,
with the following titles: Bookrunner and Mandated Lead Arranger (BMLA),
Mandated Lead Arranger (MLA) and Lead Arranger. The Company also
accommodated a limited number of smaller tickets with the Arranger title.

Syndication closed oversubscribed with 17 banks committing, allowing Sasol
to increase the Facility and offer scale back to the Joint Global Co-
ordinators, BMLAs and the MLAs.

Along with the Joint Global Co-ordinators, there were eight other BMLAs:
ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas S.A. South
Africa Branch, Intesa SanPaolo Bank Luxembourg S.A., J.P. Morgan Securities
plc, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation Europe Limited and UniCredit Bank Austria.

Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank and HSBC joined as MLAs, Export
Development Canada and Standard Chartered Bank joined as Lead Arrangers and
Wells Fargo Bank N.A., London Branch and Societe Generale joined as
Arrangers.

EY acted as Independent Financial Advisor to Sasol in respect of the
transaction.

SASOL AMENDS PLAN TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES TO SETTLE
EXPECTED OUTSTANDING SASOL INZALO DEBT

Sasol shareholders are referred to the Company’s
announcement on 20 September 2017 (the “First Announcement”)
regarding Sasol’s broad-based black economic empowerment
ownership transaction, incorporating information relating to
the termination of the Sasol Inzalo black economic
empowerment transaction (“Sasol Inzalo transaction”).

The Sasol Inzalo transaction was a landmark, broad-based
black economic empowerment initiative that received
shareholder approval in 2008. A significant amount of the
funding to facilitate this transaction was obtained through
the issue of preference shares to external banks to
facilitate the acquisition of Sasol preferred ordinary
shares by Sasol Inzalo Groups Funding (Pty) Ltd and Sasol
Inzalo Public Funding (Pty) Ltd (collectively “the Inzalo
FundCos”).

Under the terms approved in 2008, 25 547 081 Sasol preferred
ordinary shares are due to be re-designated to Sasol
ordinary shares during June and September 2018. This would
result in dilution for existing ordinary shareholders of
approximately 4%. These shares would then need to be sold in
the market by the Inzalo FundCos in order to fund the
redemption of the preference shares and cumulative
dividends. Based on the recent trading range of Sasol’s
share price, however, this would not be sufficient to
satisfy these obligations and creates a funding shortfall of
between R2 billion and R3 billion. This shortfall will be
made good by Sasol in terms of a guarantee granted in
respect of a portion of the preference share funding at the
outset of the transaction.

In the First Announcement Sasol indicated that its preferred
funding option would be to undertake an accelerated book-
build of up to 43 million Sasol ordinary shares to enable
the funding of the minimum amount sufficient to repurchase
the relevant Sasol preferred ordinary shares and settle the
relevant obligations and associated costs of the Inzalo
FundCos. The rationale for this option was to achieve rapid
resolution of Sasol and the Inzalo FundCos’ respective
financing obligations with a structure designed to help
protect Sasol’s investment grade credit rating with limited
incremental dilution for shareholders of approximately 1%
incremental dilution pursuant to the issue by Sasol of new
ordinary shares.

Following extensive engagement with shareholders, Sasol is
now undertaking to explore, in consultation with the
external banks and Inzalo FundCos, different funding options
to settle the relevant financing obligations. Sasol will
therefore no longer pursue the preferred funding option, as
described in the First Announcement, of issuing up to 43
million ordinary shares through an accelerated book-build
process. Sasol’s intention is to mitigate the amount of
shareholder dilution whilst still maintaining Sasol’s
investment grade credit rating. Sasol will communicate its
final plan for settling the Inzalo FundCos’ debt in February
2018.

The terms of Sasol Khanyisa relating to Sasol Inzalo
participants, SOLBE1 shareholders and qualifying employees
as set out the First Announcement are in no way affected by
this announcement.

SASOL ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT

As a company proudly rooted in our South African heritage, we embrace broad-based black economic
empowerment (""B-BBEE"") as a key enabler for economic transformation and inclusive growth. We are
committed to contributing meaningfully to sustainable transformation and view this as both a social and
business imperative. As part of our ongoing commitment to transformation, we are pleased to introduce
Sasol Khanyisa, our proposed new B-BBEE ownership structure. 

OUR SASOL INZALO BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION NEARS THE END OF ITS 10-YEAR TERM

Sasol shareholders are reminded that the Sasol Inzalo B-BBEE transaction (""the Sasol Inzalo
Transaction""), which was created in 2008 with the objective of providing many South Africans with the
opportunity to own an equity interest in Sasol, will come to an end in 2018. The Sasol Inzalo Transaction
included the following participants:

- the Sasol Inzalo employee trusts (""Sasol Inzalo employee trusts"");
- the Sasol Black Economic Empowerment (""BEE"") ordinary (""SOLBE1"") shareholders (""Inzalo Cash
  Element"" or ""SOLBE1 shareholders"");
- the Sasol Inzalo Groups funded element (""Inzalo Groups element"" or ""Inzalo Groups"") and the Sasol
  Inzalo Public funded element (""Inzalo Public Funded element"" or ""Inzalo Public""); and
- the Sasol Inzalo Foundation.

54 different selected entities participated in Inzalo Groups, which included groups comprising Sasol
customers, suppliers, franchisees and non-governmental organisations. In addition, more than 200 000
members of the South African black public participated in the Inzalo Public Funded element and Sasol
Limited has more than 50 000 SOLBE1 shareholders. Approximately 23 000 Sasol employees participated
in the Sasol Inzalo employee trusts.

The Sasol Inzalo employee trusts will come to an end in 2018 and separately the new Sasol Khanyisa
Employee Share Ownership plan (""ESOP""), as described in paragraph 3.3 below, will be implemented.
Since 2008, the Sasol Inzalo employee trusts received dividends in the amount of approximately
R1,6 billion equivalent to approximately R52 000 per participant. Based on the closing Sasol Ordinary
share price (SOL) of R389 on 4 September 2017, there will be no distribution of SOL shares to participants
in the Sasol Inzalo employee trusts when the Sasol Inzalo Transaction ends in 2018.

SOLBE1 shareholders will, subject to the requisite Sasol shareholder approval being obtained, be given the
right to participate in Sasol Khanyisa in accordance with the terms and conditions described in paragraph 3.1 below.

In relation to the Inzalo Groups element and the Inzalo Public Funded element, the acquisition through
subsidiaries (""Inzalo FundCos"") of preferred ordinary shares in Sasol (""Preferred Ordinary Shares"") by
Sasol Inzalo Groups (RF) Limited and Sasol Inzalo Public (RF) Limited (together ""Inzalo"") was partly
funded by way of equity contributions from Inzalo shareholders, with a large portion of the required funding
being raised by the issue of preference shares by the Inzalo FundCos to Sasol and various banks. Sasol
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sasol Financing (Pty) Ltd (""Sasol Financing""), provided a residual
guarantee for the full redemption and cumulative dividends of a portion of the preference share funding
taken up by various banks.

The Inzalo FundCos will be required to dispose of the Preferred Ordinary Shares in order to be in a position
to redeem the preference share funding and cumulative dividends in 2018. Any shortfall in the value of the
Preferred Ordinary Shares held by the Inzalo FundCos will be made good through a subscription of shares
by Sasol in the Inzalo FundCos. Based on the closing SOL share price of R389 on 4 September 2017,
there is a shortfall (backed by the guarantee referred to above) and a funding commitment for the Sasol
Group of approximately R2,1 billion, and as a result there will be no distribution of SOL shares to Inzalo
Groups and the Inzalo Public Funded element participants when the Sasol Inzalo Transaction ends in 2018.

Sasol's preferred funding option, subject to shareholder approval, is that Sasol repurchases the Preferred
Ordinary Shares from the Inzalo FundCos at the 30 day volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") of a SOL
share at the relevant time utilising cash raised through an issue of up to 43 million SOL shares through an
accelerated book-build to facilitate the issue. Sasol will only issue such number of SOL shares which are
required for the above purpose. 

The Sasol Inzalo Foundation will be renamed and will continue as a public benefit organisation, driving
excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at all levels of the
education value chain. The Sasol Inzalo Foundation benefitted over 20 million learners in South African
public schools by way of 118 natural science, technology and mathematics school work books that were
developed. In addition, more than 800 bursaries and fellowships have been awarded to students at 16
South African universities, to name but a few examples.

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION BY SASOL OF SASOL KHANYISA, A R21 BILLION BROAD-BASED
BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION

1.  Overview

    Separately from the termination of the Sasol Inzalo Transaction, the board of directors of Sasol (the
    ""Board"") intends, subject to, inter alia, shareholder approval, to implement the Sasol Khanyisa transaction
    (""Sasol Khanyisa"") in fulfilment of the ownership requirements of the Revised Codes of Good Practice (the
    ""Codes""), which came into effect on 1 May 2015. The Sasol Khanyisa ownership structure is intended to
    achieve approximately 20% direct black ownership in Sasol South Africa Proprietary Limited (""SSA""),
    currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sasol, for a period of up to ten years (the ""Khanyisa Empowerment
    Period"") which, along with black ownership at Sasol, translates (for measurement purposes) into at least
    25% black ownership at SSA level for the Khanyisa Empowerment Period. Sasol Khanyisa will enable
    Sasol to meet its net ownership objectives under the Codes and to achieve empowerment on an ongoing
    basis thereafter due to an automatic exchange at the end of the Khanyisa Empowerment Period of shares
    in Sasol Khanyisa or SSA for SOLBE1 shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, as more fully
    described in paragraph 4 below.

2.  Creation of a sustainable B-BBEE structure through Sasol Khanyisa

    Sasol's contributor status in terms of the Codes is based on the Sasol Group's performance across each of
    the following pillars: equity ownership, management control, skills development, enterprise and supplier
    development (which includes preferential procurement expenditure as a sub-component) and socio-
    economic development.
    
    By implementing Sasol Khanyisa, Sasol will seek to ensure ongoing and sustainable equity ownership of
    Sasol by black South Africans. Whilst Sasol Khanyisa will have a finite period of ownership as regards
    SSA, the transaction has been structured to have a long-lasting effect on Sasol after the Khanyisa
    Empowerment Period. To this end, shareholders in Inzalo Public and Inzalo Groups (""Inzalo
    Shareholders""), holders of SOLBE1 shares on the requisite record dates for participation, and qualifying
    Sasol employees who are beneficiaries in the Sasol Inzalo employee trusts (""Sasol Inzalo employee trust
    participants"") and who are in the employ of the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, will have an opportunity to
    participate in Sasol Khanyisa with effect from 1 June 2018 (or such other date as Sasol may determine)
    (""Effective Date"").
    
    In addition to the above, Sasol employees, who are Black Persons as defined in the B-BBEE Act (""Black
    Persons"") and who are employed by the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, and such new employees joining
    the Sasol Group between 19 May 2018 and the 5th anniversary of the Effective Date, will also be afforded
    the opportunity to further participate in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP.
    
    Sasol has been primarily guided by the following design principles in structuring Sasol Khanyisa:
    
    2.1     achieving effective (direct and indirect) B-BBEE ownership credentials of at least 25% for SSA and,
            ultimately, after the settlement of any residual funding obligations outstanding at that date, achieving
            ongoing and sustained, unencumbered B-BBEE ownership of SOLBE1 shares;
    
    2.2     achieving a sustainable B-BBEE transaction at an acceptable economic cost and within market norms;
    
    2.3     maintaining appreciable involvement of broad-based women's groups for the duration of the
            Khanyisa Empowerment Period;
    
    2.4     incentivising qualifying Inzalo participants (as defined in paragraph 3.2 below) and eligible SOLBE1
            shareholders (as defined in paragraph 3.2 below) to participate in Sasol Khanyisa by offering
            ordinary shares in Sasol Khanyisa Public (RF) Proprietary Limited (""Sasol Khanyisa Public"") for no
            consideration payable by them, which will result in them holding shares indirectly in SSA;
    
    2.5     providing Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants and qualifying Sasol employees the opportunity
            to participate in Sasol Khanyisa by acquiring vested rights through a new employee share
            ownership plan in SSA;
    
    2.6     Sasol will be providing notional and other vendor funding for Sasol Khanyisa; and
    
    2.7     promoting direct, unencumbered investment in Sasol in the form of SOLBE1 shares from the date of
            implementation of Sasol Khanyisa.
    
3.  Terms of Sasol Khanyisa

    Sasol Khanyisa consists of three distinct elements:

    3.1 SOLBE1 shareholders to elect not to re-designate their SOLBE1 shares to Sasol ordinary shares

        Current SOLBE1 shareholders will, subject to the requisite Sasol shareholder approval being obtained, be
        given the right, by way of a specific invitation to be extended by Sasol to elect that their entire holding of
        SOLBE1 shares will not re-designate to SOL shares in accordance with their existing rights (""the Election"").
        This opportunity to make the Election will be made available by Sasol to all SOLBE1 shareholders recorded
        on the share register at a date to be selected by Sasol in its sole discretion (the ""Election Record Date"").
        
        SOLBE1 shareholders, pursuant to having made the Election, will retain their existing SOLBE1 shares and
        will receive from Sasol one additional SOLBE1 share, by way of a bonus award, for every four SOLBE1
        shares beneficially owned on the Election Record Date, with fractional entitlements rounded up where
        necessary (""SOLBE1 Bonus Award""). The SOLBE1 shares held by such SOLBE1 shareholders will remain
        listed on the Empowerment Segment of the Main Board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""JSE"").
        Application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the shares comprising the SOLBE1 Bonus Award with
        effect from the Effective Date.
        
        In order to effectively facilitate the process, Sasol will determine an earlier date than originally envisaged,
        occurring during the period from 1 April 2018 to 27 June 2018, to be the date on which the SOLBE1 shares
        re-designate to SOL shares.
        
        Those SOLBE1 shares held by SOLBE1 shareholders who do not make the Election will re-designate to
        SOL shares and they will accordingly not participate in Sasol Khanyisa. Application will be made to the JSE
        to amend the listing of the requisite number of SOLBE1 shares that have re-designated to SOL shares with
        effect from the date of re-designation.
        
    3.2 Sasol Khanyisa Invitation to SOLBE1 shareholders and Sasol Inzalo participants
        
        Separately, Sasol Khanyisa Public will extend an invitation to eligible SOLBE1 shareholders and qualifying
        Sasol Inzalo participants (""Sasol Khanyisa Invitation""). Invitees will be deemed to have accepted the
        invitation unless they have indicated in writing that they do not wish to participate.
        
        Eligible SOLBE1 shareholders are the holders of SOLBE1 shares on the Sasol Khanyisa invitation record
        date (the ""Sasol Khanyisa Invitation Record Date""), being the day after the date on which the SOLBE1
        shares held by those SOLBE1 shareholders who do not exercise the Election, re-designate as SOL shares.
        
        Qualifying Sasol Inzalo participants are all Inzalo Shareholders who are shareholders in Inzalo Public and
        Inzalo Groups at the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation Record Date.
        
        Sasol Khanyisa Public will extend the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation as follows:

        - Eligible SOLBE1 shareholders will be issued on the Effective Date, for no consideration payable by them:

          - by Sasol Khanyisa Public, one share in Sasol Khanyisa Public for every one SOLBE1 share
            beneficially owned on the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation Record Date; and

          - by Sasol, one SOLBE1 share for every ten Sasol Khanyisa Public shares to be beneficially owned.

        - Qualifying Sasol Inzalo participants will be issued on the Effective Date, for no consideration
          payable by them:

          - by Sasol Khanyisa Public, one share in Sasol Khanyisa Public for every one Sasol Inzalo
            share beneficially owned on the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation Record Date; and

          - by Sasol, one SOLBE1 share for every ten Sasol Khanyisa Public shares to be beneficially owned.

        Application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the SOLBE1 shares, issued in respect of the Sasol
        Khanyisa Invitation, on the JSE on the Effective Date.

    3.3 Sasol Khanyisa Employee Share Ownership Plan

        The Sasol Khanyisa ESOP consists of two employee share ownership plans, one for Sasol Inzalo
        employee trust participants and the other for qualifying Black Sasol employees, both of whom will become
        vested beneficiaries of the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust, unless they 'opt out', for no consideration to them.
        The Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust will subscribe for the requisite number of SOLBE1 shares, SOL shares
        and SSA shares, as further described below.
        
        3.3.1 Participation by Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP
        
              The Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP comprise:

              a) Black Persons who are existing Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants and who are employed by
                 the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, who will be entitled to elect to acquire upfront vested rights, and
                 subject to certain conditions, will receive R100 000's worth of SOLBE1 shares or SOL shares based
                 on an election by black employees; and

              b) other employees, who are existing Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants but who are not Black
                 Persons, and who are employed by the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, who will acquire upfront
                 vested rights, subject to certain conditions, will receive R100 000's worth of SOL shares.

              The number of SOL shares or SOLBE1 shares to which each such Sasol Inzalo employee trust participant
              will acquire vested rights will depend on the 30 day VWAP of the SOL shares or the SOLBE1 shares, as
              the case may be.
              
              Application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the requisite number of SOLBE1 and SOL shares with
              effect from the Effective Date. Sasol Khanyisa ESOP beneficiaries, who remain employed for the periods
              specified in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust deed, will obtain ownership of the SOLBE1 or SOL shares to
              which they acquired vested rights.

        3.3.2 Participation by qualifying Black Sasol employees in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP

              In addition to participation by Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants as set out in paragraph 3.3.1, 
              Sasol employees who are Black Persons and who are employed by the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, and such
              employees joining the Sasol Group between 19 May 2018 and the 5th anniversary of the Effective Date
              (""Qualifying Sasol Employees""), will acquire vested rights to SSA shares. They will become owners of the
              shares in which they have vested rights if, subject to various exceptions, they remain employed for the
              required period.
              
              A maximum of 28 385 647 SSA shares will be made available to the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP, with Qualifying
              Sasol Employees in the employ of the Sasol Group on 18 May 2018, each obtaining an equal number of
              vested rights to SSA shares.
              
              The Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust will receive a trickle dividend from SSA, as determined in accordance with
              a formula set out in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust deed, (less any withholding tax) in respect of the SSA
              shares in which the participants have vested rights.  
               
              Qualifying Sasol Employees, subject to some exceptions, who remain employed for the required period, will
              obtain ownership of the SSA shares in which the participant has vested rights. Beneficiaries of the Sasol
              Khanyisa ESOP Trust will participate indirectly in any resolution of the shareholders of SSA or Sasol (as
              the case may be) that the trustees are entitled to vote on.
              
4.  Automatic exchange of Sasol Khanyisa Public shares for SOLBE1 shares
              
    At the end of the Khanyisa Empowerment Period, holders of Sasol Khanyisa shares and participants in the
    Sasol Khanyisa ESOP will ultimately receive SOLBE1 shares for their Sasol Khanyisa shares and vested
    rights to SSA shares. This will occur via a share exchange (the ""Share Exchange"") on the basis of a ratio
    that will be determined by an independent expert taking into account the relative value of Sasol and SSA at
    that time. Participants who receive SOLBE1 shares following the Share Exchange will then be free to trade
    their SOLBE1 shares on the Empowerment Segment of the JSE as they deem fit.

5.  Financing of Sasol Khanyisa

    5.1. Sasol Khanyisa Public
         
         Sasol Khanyisa Public will establish Khanyisa Fundco as its wholly-owned subsidiary, which will:
         
         - issue preference shares (""Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares"") to Sasol for a subscription
           consideration of up to a maximum of R10 billion;
         
         - use the entire proceeds of such issue to subscribe for up to a maximum of 28 385 647 SSA shares,
           resulting in Khanyisa Fundco directly, and Sasol Khanyisa Public indirectly, owning up to a
           maximum of 10,75% of the total issued share capital of SSA; and
         
         - receive distributions on its SSA shares in accordance with SSA's dividend policy, when such
           distributions are made.
         
         The Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares will be redeemed at the end of the Khanyisa Empowerment
         Period. Dividends on the Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares are calculated daily and are compounded
         monthly on the subscription price of each Khanyisa Fundco Preference Share at a rate equal to 75% of the
         prime rate (as defined in the funding agreements relating to Khanyisa Fundco). Dividends in respect of the
         Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares will be required to be paid to Sasol on 1 April and 1 October of each year.
         
         For so long as the Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares have not been redeemed, unless Sasol agrees to a
         higher percentage, a maximum of 2,5% of the dividend which Khanyisa Fundco receives from SSA will be
         declared to Sasol Khanyisa Public, as its sole ordinary shareholder. These dividends may be distributed to
         the shareholders of Sasol Khanyisa Public (after the deduction of dividend withholding tax). Khanyisa
         Fundco will not be entitled to declare any further dividend to Sasol Khanyisa Public for so long as the
         Khanyisa Fundco Preference Shares have not been redeemed.

    5.2. Sasol Khanyisa ESOP

         The SSA shares to be issued to the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust will be the subject of notional vendor
         funding by SSA. For so long as the notional vendor funding is in existence, 2,5% (which could be adjusted
         upwards in accordance with an objective formula) of the dividend declared by SSA to its ordinary
         shareholders (other than the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust) will be declared on the SSA shares held by the
         Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust.
         
         SSA has the right to repurchase a number of SSA shares from the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP Trust on the
         basis of a predetermined formula at the issue price thereof.

6.  Fairness opinion

    The Sasol Board has appointed Deloitte & Touche as an independent expert to provide a voluntary fairness
    opinion to assist Sasol shareholders in determining the fairness of Sasol Khanyisa to Sasol shareholders.
    The opinion of Deloitte & Touche will be included in the circular to shareholders referred to in paragraph 10
    below (""Circular"").

7.  Pro forma financial effects

    The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the Sasol Inzalo Transaction and Sasol Khanyisa
    (the ""Transactions"") on, inter alia, Sasol's basic earnings per share, headline earnings per share, weighted
    average number of shares in issue, diluted earnings per share, diluted headline earning per share,
    weighted average number of diluted shares in issue, net asset value per share and net tangible asset value
    per share, based on the most recently published audited consolidated financial results of the Sasol Group
    for the financial year ended 30 June 2017.
    
    The pro forma financial effects assume that the Transactions had been fully implemented on 1 July 2016
    for purposes of presenting the pro forma financial effects thereof on the pro forma consolidated income
    statement, and 30 June 2017 for purposes of the pro forma consolidated statement of financial position and
    the pro forma consolidated statement of changes in equity.
    
    The pro forma financial effects are presented in a manner consistent in all respects with International
    Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and Sasol Group's accounting policies. The pro forma financial
    effects are presented in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements and the Guide on Pro Forma
    Financial Information issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
    
    The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the Directors and was prepared for illustrative
    purposes only and may not, because of its nature, fairly present Sasol Group's financial position, changes
    in equity and results of its operations or cash flows, nor the effect and impact of the Proposed Transactions
    going forward. It does not purport to be indicative of what the financial results would have been, had the
    Transactions been implemented on a different date.
    
                                                                                    Pro forma after the

    Notes and assumptions:
    
    1.   The ""Before"" column is based on the published audited consolidated financial statements of the Sasol
         Group for the year ended 30 June 2017.
    
    2.   The ""Pro forma after the Transactions"" column has been calculated on the basis that all of the steps to
         execute the Sasol Inzalo transaction termination and to implement Sasol Khanyisa have been
         completed; and is based on the following assumptions for each of the three distinct elements of the
         Sasol Khanyisa Transaction:
    
         i.   The Election pursuant to which the SOLBE1 Bonus Award will be made: This has been assumed to
              occur on the basis that 15% of the SOLBE1 shareholders will elect that his/her SOLBE1 shares do
              not automatically re-designate to SOL shares. Any re-designation from SOLBE1 to SOL shares is
              inconsequential for the purposes of the per share information contained in the pro forma financial
              effects, as the SOL shares and SOLBE1 Shares are treated as issued shares;
    
         ii.  Sasol Khanyisa Invitation: It has been assumed that 100% of Qualifying Sasol Inzalo participants
              and eligible SOLBE1 shareholders do not reject the Sasol Khanyisa Invitation; and
    
         iii. Sasol Khanyisa ESOP:
    
              -   For the benefit of the Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants: It has been assumed that no
                  such employee notifies the trustees that he/she does not wish to become a vested beneficiary, 
                  and that 15% of the Black Persons who are Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants will not 
                  elect to acquire vested rights in SOL shares instead of acquiring vested rights in SOLBE1 
                  shares; and
    
              -   For the benefit of the Qualifying Sasol Employees: It has been assumed that no such
                  employees reject participation in the Sasol Khanyisa ESOP.
    
         The Directors have considered a number of scenarios and, based on comparative precedent from a
         recent similar transaction, consider that the most likely outcome (as summarised above) is that 15% of
         the SOLBE1 shareholders will make the Election and that 15% of Black Persons who are Sasol Inzalo
         employee trust participants will not elect to acquire vested rights in SOL shares instead of acquiring
         vested rights in SOLBE1 shares. In note 5 below, a scenario has been presented to illustrate the
         financial effects should:
    
         - 100% of the SOLBE1 shareholders make the Election; and
    
         - 100% of the Black Persons who are Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants will not elect to
           acquire vested rights in SOL shares and instead acquire vested rights in SOLBE1 shares.
    
    3.   The effects on basic earnings, diluted earnings, headline earnings, and diluted headline earnings per
         share are calculated on the basis that the proposed Transactions were effective on 1 July 2016, while
         the effects on net asset value and net tangible asset value per share are calculated on the basis that
         the proposed Transactions were effective on 30 June 2017 for purposes of presenting the pro forma
         financial effects thereof on the Sasol Group.
    
    4.   The increase in the weighted average number of issued shares is congruent with:
    
         i. the assumed specific issue of sufficient SOL shares in terms of the accelerated book-build to fund
            the A, B and C preference share funding, the Inzalo shortfall, as well as any related costs and taxes
            (31,25 million shares)(1);
    
         ii. the 2,92 million SOLBE1 shares will be included in the weighted average number of shares in
             relation to the SOLBE1 Bonus Award and the Khanyisa Invitation as it relates to eligible SOLBE1
             shareholders and eligible Inzalo shareholders .
    
             (1) For purposes of the pro forma financial effects, the assumed specific issue of SOL shares has been 
                 calculated based on the number of SOL shares to be issued as at the Last Practicable Price, in order 
                 to settle the outstanding balance on the A, B and C preference shares outstanding as at 30 June 2017, 
                 plus related costs and taxes that would ensue upon the issue. However, the final number of SOL shares 
                 required to be issued at the Inzalo Transaction Termination dates will depend on the SOL share price at 
                 the Inzalo Transaction Termination dates, dividends declared and paid between 30 June 2017 and the 
                 Inzalo Transaction Termination dates as well as dividends which accrues on the A, B and C preference 
                 shares between 30 June 2017 and the Inzalo Transaction Termination dates. This cannot be reliably 
                 estimated as at the Last Practicable Date and consequently, this could result in additional SOL shares 
                 being issued to cover the additional funding costs and taxes not yet accrued at 30 June 2017.
    
    5.   The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares includes the impact of the
         SOL/SOLBE1 shares to be issued, as calculated in terms of IAS 33: Earnings per share, in terms of the
         Sasol Khanyisa ESOP for the benefit of the Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants.
    
         As described in note 2 above, a scenario has been presented below to illustrate the financial effects
         pertaining to the following:
    
         - 100% of the SOLBE1 shareholders make the Election; and
    
         - 100% of the Black Persons who are Sasol Inzalo employee trust participants elect not to acquire
           vested rights in SOL shares and instead acquire vested rights in SOLBE1 shares.
    
         However, the pro forma financial effects do not consider the impact of the shares to be issued pursuant
         to the Automatic Share Exchange as this cannot currently be reliably estimated. This increase in the
         weighted average number of diluted shares is dependent on the SOLBE1 share price, and its relative
         net fair value to a SSA share, which considers the underlying funding (FundCo preference share
         funding and ESOP notional vendor funding), at the date of the termination of the Sasol Khanyisa
         Transaction. At each reporting date, the diluted earnings per share impact will be determined by
         calculating the number of SOLBE1 shares which would be issued for no consideration. This will be
         based on the difference between the average SOLBE1 share price for the reporting period, and the
         unexpensed share-based payment charge at the reporting date.
    
         The following table provides the illustrative financial effects of the potential issues of SOLBE1 shares,
         on basic earnings per share, headline earnings per share, weighted average number of shares in
         issue, diluted earnings per share, diluted headline earning per share, weighted average number of
         diluted shares in issue, net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share, should the
         assumptions applied above be increased to 100%.

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa said:
Notwithstanding the volatile macro-economic environment in which we operate, Sasol delivered a resilient
performance. This is testament to the robust foundation we have in place to position Sasol for long-term
growth, since we are able to operate profitably and generate healthy free cash flows at oil prices of
US$40/bbl. Our sound business fundamentals are further reflected in our record production volumes and
earlier-than-anticipated realisation of the full Business Performance Enhancement Programme (BPEP)
savings target. Our heightened focus on macro-economic risk mitigations to protect and strengthen our
balance sheet and our ability to operate safe, reliable and sustainable operations positions us well for future
value-based growth.

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell said:
Disciplined cost control, focused cash conservation and effective management of financial risks have enabled
us to continue delivering shareholder value and achieving a competitive market position. These factors,
integral to our DNA, attest to the underlying resilience of our business and our determination to provide
shareholders with a world-class investment. To drive future growth, we will sustain this robust foundation
through meticulous ongoing continuous improvements, while further enhancing our systems and capital
allocation process. As we refine our long-term strategy, our objective is to ensure we have sufficient
flexibility to deliver value-based growth under various scenarios. By identifying all opportunities that can contribute to
increased total shareholder returns, Sasol is driving an exciting new era of growth for our shareholders and
stakeholders. 

Financial results overview(1,3)

Sasol delivered a strong business performance across most of the value chain, with our Secunda Synfuels
Operations (SSO) reporting record volumes and our Eurasian Operations delivering their highest production
volumes since 2015. However, continued volatility in the macro-economic environment, particularly the
stronger rand and low oil price, has adversely impacted our financial performance.

Earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2017 increased by 54% to R20,4 billion from
R13,2 billion in the prior year. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 15% to R35,15 and earnings
per share (EPS) increased by 54% to R33,36 compared to the prior year. The prior year EPS was negatively
impacted by the R9,9 billion partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets.

Core headline earnings(2) increased by 6% (R2,29 per share) compared to the prior year. The Sasol Limited
Board (""the Board"") considers core headline earnings as an appropriate indicator of the sustainable operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for period close and once-off items as noted below.
 
Sasol's headline earnings were impacted by the following notable once-off and period close items:

                                                                                     2017       2016

Included in remeasurement items is a partial impairment of our US Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) project amounting to
R1,7 billion (US$130 million) due to the uncertainty around the probability and timing of project execution and
the reversal of a partial impairment of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) amounting to R0,8 billion
(US$65 million), which resulted from lower spot discount rates and the extension of the useful life of the
project to 50 years.

The highlights of our operational performance can be summarised as follows:

- SSO increased production volumes by 1% to a record 7,83 million tons;
- Natref production volumes decreased by 5%. Planned plant shutdowns during the first half of the year
  contributed to a 3% decrease in production volumes and unplanned downtime during May 2017 led to a
  2% reduction in production volumes;
- Our Eurasian Operations increased production volumes by 6% due to stronger product demand;
- ORYX GTL achieved a utilisation rate of 95%, compared to 81% in the prior year, which is higher than
  market guidance;
- Our Performance Chemicals business reported a 2% increase in sales volumes, which is at the upper end
  of our market guidance, mainly as a result of stronger demand and improved plant stability; 
- Our Base Chemicals sales volumes increased by 3%, slightly below market guidance, due to extended
  shutdowns at our Chlor Vinyls and Polypropylene plants and a fire at a third party warehouse; and
- Liquid fuels sales volumes in our Energy Business decreased by 2% due to a greater portion of
  production volumes from SSO being allocated to our higher margin yielding chemical businesses and
  lower Natref production volumes. Excluding the effect of the Natref downtime and lower allocated
  volumes from SSO, our liquid fuels sales volumes increased by 1%.

The decrease in the effective corporate tax rate from 36,6% to 28,3% was mainly as a result of the
R9,9 billion partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets in the prior year. The adjusted effective tax
rate, excluding equity accounted investments, remeasurements and once-off items, is 26,5% compared to
28,2% in the prior year.

We have seen some recovery in global oil and product prices as average Brent crude oil prices were 15%
higher compared to the prior year (average dated Brent was US$49,77/bbl for the year ended 30 June 2017
compared with US$43,37/bbl in the prior year). Despite softness in commodity chemical prices experienced
at the start of the financial year, we have seen a steady increase in demand and robust margins in certain key
markets. The average margin for our speciality chemicals business remains resilient, despite a margin squeeze
in our ammonia business as a result of oversupply in global markets.

Excluding the effect of our hedging programme, the average rand/US dollar market exchange rate
strengthened by 6% from R14,52 in 2016 to R13,61, and the closing rand/US dollar market exchange rate
strengthened by 11% from R14,71 to R13,06. This resulted in translation losses of R2,3 billion on the valuation
of the balance sheet compared to translation gains of R1,1 billion recognised in the prior year (including
foreign exchange contracts).

We continued to deliver a strong cost performance and managed to contain our cash fixed costs to
below inflation in nominal terms, despite the additional once-off costs incurred due to the Mining strike.
Through our continued focus on cost control and the commitment of our people, we achieved our Business
Performance Enhancement Programme (BPEP) sustainable savings exit run-rate target of R5,4 billion per
annum in 2017, a year earlier than previous market guidance. We have now closed out our BPEP programme,
having achieved the targeted sustainable savings. Going forward we are committed to further drive
continuous improvement to identify opportunities to sustainably drive down costs and deliver improved
returns to our shareholders and stakeholders.

Our comprehensive Response Plan (RP), to counter the effects of a low oil price by focusing on capital
conservation and cash savings, has continued to yield positive results in line with our 2017 targets, despite margin
contraction and the negative impact of a much stronger exchange rate. The RP realised capital conservation and cash 
savings of R32,3 billion in 2017, bringing our total cumulative cash conservation to R69,4 billion. The RP's objective is to place
the company in the best possible position to operate profitably in a US$40/bbl oil price environment and to
proactively manage the balance sheet and our liquidity. We have increased our RP sustainable annual cash
cost savings target from R2,5 billion to at least R3,0 billion by 2019, in addition to the R5,4 billion sustainable
savings from our BPEP. This takes our cumulative sustainable cost savings to R8,4 billion. 

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R60,3 billion. This includes R36,8 billion
(US$2,7 billion) relating to the LCCP. Our actual capital expenditure for the full year is below previous market
guidance of R66 billion, largely due to the stronger exchange rate, re-phasing of the LCCP capital cash flow
and active management of the capital portfolio.

During the current financial year, Sasol entered into a number of hedges to mitigate specific financial risks
and provide protection against unforeseen movements in oil prices, interest rates, currency movements, and
commodity and final product prices. Approximately 50% of the crude oil exposure was hedged with crude oil
put options for 2017 and 2018 at a net price of ~US$48,15/bbl. A total net loss of R237 million (US$17 million)
was recognised during the period. To manage the exposure to the US dollar, approximately 70% of the
rand/US dollar exposure has been hedged with zero-cost collar instruments at a floor of ~R13,46 for 2018.
A net gain of R1 608 million (US$118 million) was recognised during the period. Should appropriate hedges
become available in the market at an acceptable cost, we will enter into additional hedges as mitigation
against these financial risks. 

Our net cash position decreased by 44%, from R52,2 billion in June 2016 to R29,3 billion as at 30 June 2017
mainly due to the funding of the LCCP and the effect of a stronger closing rand/US dollar exchange rate.
Loans raised during the year amounted to R13,3 billion, mainly for the funding of our growth projects. We
have sufficient liquidity in place to fund the LCCP and our business operations.

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 19% to R44,1 billion compared with R54,7 billion in
the prior year. This is largely attributable to purchases of crude oil options of R1,3 billion (US$103 million),
increases in working capital as well as a stronger rand/ US dollar exchange rate. Notwithstanding reduced
cash flows, our balance sheet has the capacity to lever up, as we continue to execute our growth plans and
return value to our shareholders. Accordingly, in support of our funding strategy, gearing increased to 27%,
which is better than our previous market guidance of 30% to 35%. This provides us with additional headroom
compared to our internal targets.

To manage the impact of price volatility and the lower oil price environment, the Board concluded that our
internal gearing ceiling will remain at 44% until the end of the 2018 financial year. The net debt-to-EBITDA
ratio is 1,13 times compared to 0,56 times in the prior year and is expected to remain below our target of 2,0
times. We actively manage our capital structure and funding plan to ensure that we maintain an optimum
solvency and liquidity profile. 

Our dividend policy is to pay dividends within a dividend cover range based on HEPS. Taking into account the
current volatile macro-economic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation initiative,
the current strength of our balance sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a gross final
dividend of R7,80 per share. The dividend cover was 2,8 times at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: 2,8 times).

(1) All comparisons to the prior year refer to the year ended 30 June 2016. Except for earnings attributable to shareholders
    and the RP cash conservation measures, all numbers are quoted on a pre-tax basis.
(2) Core headline earnings are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items, period close adjustments
    and depreciation and amortisation of significant capital projects, exceeding R4 billion which have reached beneficial
    operation and are still ramping up and share-based payments on implementation of BBBEE transactions. Once-off
    items relate to the impact of the prolonged labour actions at Mining as well as the Sasol Oil tax litigation matter. Period
    close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end is to remove volatility from earnings
    as these instruments are valued using forward curves and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary
    from period to period. We believe core headline earnings is a useful measure of the group's sustainable operating
    performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures
    reported by other companies.
(3) All non-GAAP measures (such as normalised operating profit, core headline earnings, adjusted effective tax rate, etc.)
    have not been audited and reported on by the company's auditors.
(4) Normalised operating profit is calculated by adjusting operating profit for translation effects relating to the closing
    exchange rate, valuation of hedges, remeasurement items, the reversal of the provision relating to Escravos (EGTL) in
    the prior year and the strike at Mining.

Strong operational performance supported by sustained cost
improvements(1,3,4)

Operating Business Units
Mining - uninterrupted supply to Secunda Synfuels Operations, however negatively impacted by
strike action

Operating profit decreased by 21% to R3,7 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of
labour actions at our Secunda mining operations in the first half of the financial year. Notwithstanding the
impact of labour actions, we delivered our full supply commitment of coal volumes to the integrated Sasol
value chain through our own production and increased external coal purchases. SSO used additional gas
during the strike period to limit the amount of coal required. The labour action resulted in additional once-off
costs of R1 billion and external coal purchases of R0,4 billion to ensure continuous
supply to SSO. The total cost amounts to R1,4 billion. 

We are still ramping up our operations to achieve targeted production run-rates and flexibility in our operations. A business
improvement programme to improve productivity and cost efficiency is currently underway. We expect to see
our mines return to the targeted level of operational performance in the next 12 months. Due to the lower
productivity, our normalised unit cost of production increased by 13% above inflation to R270/ton compared
to the prior year. Our business improvement programme is further aimed at limiting these cost increases to
inflation with a targeted unit cost of production between R260 - R270/ton for 2018. 

Our export coal business benefited from higher global coal prices during the year; however a portion of the
volumes was sent to SSO during the strike period.

Exploration and Production International - returning to profitability with focused management of
the asset portfolio

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) recorded an operating profit of R585 million compared to
an operating loss of R1,8 billion (excluding the impact of the partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas
operations of R9,9 billion) in the prior year. This result was achieved through focused management of the
asset portfolio and strict cost control. Operating profit includes a translation gain of R337 million versus a
translation loss of R695 million in the prior year.

Operating profit from our Mozambican producing operations increased to R2,0 billion from R1,1 billion in the
prior year, mainly due to a 2% increase in gas production volumes and the net positive impact of foreign
currency translations. 

Our Gabon asset recorded an operating profit of R295 million compared to an operating loss of R994 million
in the prior year, mainly due to higher sales prices, the partial reversal of an impairment of R197 million
and lower depreciation charges. This was offset by an 18% decrease in production volumes resulting from the
deferral of drilling activities in line with our RP cash conservation initiatives.

Our Canadian shale gas asset in Montney generated a lower operating loss of R746 million, compared to an
operating loss of R1,1 billion (excluding the impact of a partial impairment of R9,9 billion) in the prior year. Our
Canadian gas production volumes increased by 6% compared to the prior year, mainly due to completion
activities on existing wells. There were no drilling rigs in operation during the year in line with our RP cash
conservation initiatives.

Strategic Business Units

Performance Chemicals - increased sales volumes, resilient margins

Operating profit of R10 billion increased by 2% on a normalised basis and decreased by 11% in absolute
terms compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of significantly lower margins on ammonia due to lower
market prices, the impact of a stronger rand and a partial impairment of R527 million (US$38,4 million)
relating to our US Phenolics cash generating unit. 

Sales volumes increased by 2% compared to the prior year mainly due to an increase of 2% in Organics
volumes. Our Fischer-Tropsch Wax facility in South Africa continues to ramp up and produced 92 thousand tons (kt) of hard
wax in 2017, which is in line with our forecast. These additional wax volumes were offset by lower volumes
from our European wax facility due to reduced demand.

The European organics products benefited from improved volumes and margins resulting from favourable
market conditions. Our US assets benefited from higher ethylene sales prices during the first half of the
financial year, but subsequently came under pressure as a result of reduced market prices. Cash fixed costs
remained below inflation for the year.

Base Chemicals - increased sales volumes, stronger rand adversely impacted profitability

Operating profit increased by 25% to R5,6 billion compared to the prior year and our operating margin
increased from 13% to 16%. 

Our normalised operating profit of R5,1 billion is at the mid-point of our previous market guidance, but is
13% lower compared to the prior year. This is largely due to the stronger exchange rate, which negatively impacted
earnings by R2,5 billion in 2017.

Sales volumes increased by 3% mainly as a result of higher volumes from SSO and improved production
due to the commissioning of the C3 Expansion project in the prior year. The US dollar basket price of our
commodity chemicals improved by 6% compared to the prior year, but this was negated by the stronger
rand/US dollar exchange rate. Cash fixed costs, normalised for new business set-up costs and higher costs
resulting from the increased ratio of chemicals volumes from SSO, were contained well within inflation.

Energy - strong cost performance, margins remained robust

Operating profit, including equity accounted earnings, of R11,2 billion decreased by R2,9 billion or 20%
compared to the prior year. Normalised operating margins improved by 1% to 21% in 2017.

Normalised operating profit increased by 5% mainly due to higher crude oil prices, solid production
performance of ORYX GTL, further positive contributions from our BPEP and RP initiatives, partially negated
by a 19% decrease in petrol differentials, stronger rand/US dollar exchange rates and lower liquid fuel sales
volumes. In nominal terms, our cash fixed costs increase was contained to less than 1%, well below inflation,
due to strict cost control and lower costs allocated from SSO.

Gas sales volumes were 2% lower compared to the prior year mainly due to lower market demand. Our share
of power produced at the Central Térmica de Ressano Garcia (CTRG) joint operation in Mozambique amounted
to 658 gigaWatt-hours of electricity, 1% higher than the prior year.

ORYX GTL delivered an excellent production performance with an average utilisation rate of 95%, while
maintaining a world class safety recordable case rate of zero. ORYX GTL contributed R839 million to operating
profit with volumes increasing by 16% compared to the prior year. In Nigeria, Escravos GTL resumed operation
after completion of the scheduled maintenance programme with both trains running as expected. The plant
is expected to ramp up towards design capacity during the year.

Advancing projects to enable future growth

We are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline:

-    Growing our footprint in North America:

     -  Overall construction on the LCCP continues on all fronts, with most engineering and procurement
        activities nearing completion. At 30 June 2017, capital expenditure amounted to US$7,5 billion,
        and the overall project completion was 74%. The total forecasted capital cost for the project
        remains within the approved US$11 billion budget and project progress is tracking the approved
        schedule. This budget includes a contingency which, measured against industry norms for this
        stage of project completion, is considered sufficient to effectively complete the project to beneficial
        operation (BO) within the approved budget. Various savings opportunities have been identified and
        are continuously being implemented to mitigate project risks. Although unplanned event-driven
        risks may still impact the execution and cost of the project, we are confident that the remaining
        construction, procurement, execution and business readiness risks can be managed within the
        budget. We continue to monitor the economics of the project against the backdrop of a challenging
        macro-economic environment. We rely extensively on the views of independent market consultants
        in formulating our views on our long-term assumptions. Their views differ significantly, from period
        to period, which again is indicative of the volatility in the market. For these reasons, the internal 
        rate of return (IRR) for the LCCP, based on these different sets of price assumptions, varies between 
        a range of returns which is both higher and lower than our weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 
        At spot market prices, using the last quarter of 2017 as a reference, the IRR is between 8% to 8,5%.
        We are of the view that limited structural changes have occurred to market fundamentals since February 2017, 
        when we last published the expected long-term IRR of the project, hence, based on our internal assessment, we are 
        of the view that the IRR is in a range of 7% to 8% (Sasol WACC at 8% in US$ terms) based on conservative 
        ethane prices. The cracker, however, remains cost competitive and is at the lower end of the cost curve 
        for ethylene producers. We will continue to focus on factors that we can control, which are progressing the 
        cost and schedule of the project according to plan. The updated economics, earnings profile, capital spend 
        and sensitivities are detailed in the Analyst Book available on our website, www.sasol.com.

      - Construction of our 50% joint venture high-density polyethylene plant with Ineos Olefins and
        Polymers USA is essentially complete and we are in the commissioning phase with start-up on
        track for quarter four in calendar year 2017. The plant will be the largest bi-modal high density
        polyethylene (HDPE) manufacturing facility in the US (470kt per annum) and is expected to produce
        some of the most cost competitive performance resins based on InnoveneTM S technology. The
        market conditions continue to be favourable with low feedstock cost and strong polyethylene
        market demand.

-   Focusing on our asset base in Southern Africa:

     -  Our strategic R14 billion mine replacement programme, which will ensure uninterrupted coal supply
        to SSO in order to support Sasol's strategy to operate its Southern African facilities until 2050, is
        nearing completion. Phase 2 of the Impumelelo Colliery project commenced during the first half of
        the 2016 calendar year and is on track to be completed within budget of R0,9 billion, late in the 2019
        calendar year.

     -  The development of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) licence area in Mozambique remains
        on budget and schedule. We have successfully drilled and tested four oil wells and two gas wells, and
        captured 3D seismic over parts of the PSA. Gas reserves look promising and in line with expectations.
        We are now anticipating oil production between the mid to lower end of the range anticipated in
        the Field Development Plan. The surface facilities design and oil field development plan are being
        optimised in line with the lower volumes, and it is anticipated that substantial capital savings will be realised.  
 
Maintaining our focus on sustainable value creation

We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the year:

-    Safety remains a top priority for Sasol. Regrettably, we experienced the loss of five of our colleagues
     during the year. Our thoughts remain with our colleagues' families and friends. Our safety RCR for
     employees and service providers, excluding illnesses, improved to 0,28 at 30 June 2017 (0,29 as at
     30 June 2016). We retain our focus on safety and strive for zero harm.

-    During the year, we invested R1,6 billion in skills development and socio-economic development, which
     includes our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa
     programme focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the
     Secunda and Sasolburg regions. In line with our commitment to support our fenceline communities, we
     increased our investment in Secunda and Sasolburg by 54% to R128 million.

-    While we support the transition to a lower-carbon economy, we are concerned that the proposed carbon
     tax in South Africa will diminish the country's competitiveness. It also does not address the structural
     issues that lie at the heart of the country's carbon intensity. The proposed design of the carbon tax
     creates substantial regulatory and investment uncertainty as there is insufficient clarity relating to the
     phases of the tax, especially post 2020. This is exacerbated by the fact that the carbon tax is not aligned
     with the carbon budget system which is currently in the trial phase of implementation. Sasol continues
     to engage with the South African government on these policy issues.

-    To ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, Sasol applied for
     certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance timeframes.
     We have received decisions on our initial postponement applications from the National Air Quality
     Officer, which, while aligned with our requests, imposed stretched targets reflected in our atmospheric
     emission licences. In some cases shorter postponements were granted and further applications have
     been made to extend compliance timeframes in line with our committed environmental roadmaps.

-    We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response in accordance with our key
     performance indicators. Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the financial year 30 June 2017
     is 67,6 million tons compared to 69,3 million tons for the prior year. Our GHG emissions intensity
     (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of production) is relatively constant at 3,66 due to lower
     production resulting from planned shutdowns.  GHG targets in South Africa are being developed in
     conjunction with the South African government's process for setting carbon budgets.

-    The improvement in our utility Energy Intensity Index (EII) of 4,2% exceeded our internal target of 1%
     improvement for the year for our operations in South Africa. Including our international operations, we
     improved our EII by 1,67% from the previous financial year.

-    During the year, we paid R35,6 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South African government.
     Sasol remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South Africa, contributing significantly to the
     country's economy.

-    The revised Mining Charter was published on 15 June 2017. It is intended to ensure alignment between
     the BBBEE Act and the Mining Charter and introduces a number of new requirements which may
     have a significant impact on Sasol. Amongst others, it increases the Black Economic Empowerment
     (BEE) ownership targets from 26% to 30% and requires an additional payment of 1% of the turnover
     generated by new mining rights to its BEE shareholders. The Chamber of Mines applied to the High Court
     for an urgent interdict to suspend the implementation of the revised Mining Charter until such a time
     as an application for a judicial review of the revised Mining Charter has been dealt with. The Minister of
     Mineral Resources announced on 12 July 2017 not to implement the revised Mining Charter pending the
     completion of the litigation. Sasol is assessing the impact of the revised Mining Charter on its business.
 
Business performance outlook* - strong production performance and cost reductions to continue

The current economic climate continues to remain highly volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign
exchange movements are outside our control and may impact our results, our focus remains firmly
on managing factors within our control, including volume growth, security of feedstock supply, cost
optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial risk management and maintaining an investment
grade credit rating.

We expect an overall strong operational performance for 2018, with:

- Base Chemicals US dollar product prices to recover during the year and our South African Base Chemicals
  sales volumes to be between 3% to 5% higher than the prior year; in addition our US high-density
  polyethylene plant will contribute an additional 80kt to 110kt during the second half of the year.
  Normalised operating profit is estimated to be between R3 billion to R5 billion;
- Performance Chemicals sales volumes, excluding merchant ethylene which will now be accounted
  for in Base Chemicals, to be between 2% to 3% higher, with average margins for the business
  remaining resilient;
- Liquid fuels sales volumes to be marginally below 60 million barrels due to planned shutdowns at Natref;
- Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement to be between 114 bscf and 118 bscf;
- Average utilisation rate at ORYX GTL in Qatar to exceed 90%;
- Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line with SA PPI;
- Cumulative capital conservation and cash flow contribution from our RP to be close to the upper end of our targeted range of
  R65 billion to R75 billion by the end of FY18;
- Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R59 billion for 2018 and R37 billion for 2019 as we
  progress with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result
  of exchange rate volatility and other factors;
- Our balance sheet gearing up to a level of between 35% and 44%;
- Rand/US dollar exchange rate to range between R13,00 and R14,50; and
- Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$45/bbl and US$55/bbl.

* The financial information contained in this business performance outlook is the responsibility of the directors and
  in accordance with standard practice, it is noted that this information has not been audited and reported on by the
  company's auditors. 

Competition law compliance

The South African Competition Commission is conducting proceedings against various petroleum products
producers, including Sasol. The Competition Commission has finalised a market inquiry in the South African
LPG market and Sasol is in the process of implementing the Commission's recommendations. We continue
to interact and co-operate with the South African Competition Commission in respect of the areas that are
subject to the Commission's investigations. To the extent appropriate, further announcements will be made in future.

Tax litigation and contingency

The South African Revenue Service (""SARS"") has issued revised assessments for Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd
(""Sasol Oil"") relating to a dispute around its international crude oil procurement activities for the 2005
to 2012 tax years. These revisions could result in potential adjustments to the company's taxable income
and an additional tax liability including interest and penalties of approximately R1,2 billion for the periods
2005 to 2014. Sasol Oil has co-operated fully with SARS during the course of the audit related to these
assessments. SARS' decisions to suspend the payment of this disputed tax for the periods 2005 to 2012
currently remain in force. The litigation process in the Tax Court, relating to the international crude oil
procurement activities for the 2005 to 2007 years of assessment was concluded and judgement was
delivered on 30 June 2017 in favour of SARS. As a result, a liability of R1,2 billion has been recognised in
the annual financial statements in respect of the 2005 to 2014 matters that remain the subject of the
ongoing litigation. Sasol Oil, in consultation with its tax and legal advisors, does not support the basis of the
judgement and issued a Notice of Intention to Appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal on 31 July 2017. The Tax
Court granted Sasol Oil's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal on 14 August 2017.

SARS has notified Sasol Oil of its intention to place on hold the field audit relating to this issue for the 1999 to
2004 tax years pending the outcome of the litigation. As a result of the judgement handed down on 30 June
2017, a possible obligation may arise from the field audit, which is regarded as a contingent liability.

In addition, there could be a potential tax exposure of R11,6 billion for the periods 2013 to 2014 on varying
tax principles relating to the aforementioned activities. Supported by its specialist tax and external legal
advisors, Sasol Oil disagrees with SARS' assessment for 2013 and 2014 periods. Accordingly, Sasol Oil
has submitted an objection to the revised assessments and requested suspension of payment. Sasol Oil and
SARS have come to a resolution with regards to the request for suspension of payment, resulting in
SARS suspending payment for the significant majority of the disputed tax. Further based on the outcome of the
Tax Court judgement, a possible obligation may arise for the tax years subsequent to 2014, which could give
rise to a further contingent liability at 30 June 2017.

Change in directors 

Ms GMB Kennealy and Ms ME Nkeli were appointed as Non-executive Directors with effect from 1 March 2017.

Declaration of cash dividend number 76

A final gross cash dividend of South African 780 cents per ordinary share (30 June 2016 - 910 cents per
ordinary share) has been declared for the financial year ended 30 June 2017. The cash dividend is payable on
the ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency
of the company, as well as capital remaining after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support the
current operations for the ensuing year. The dividend has been declared out of retained earnings (income
reserves). The South African dividend withholding tax rate is 20%. At the declaration date, there are 651 439
446 ordinary (including 8 809 886 treasury shares), 25 547 081 preferred ordinary and 2 838 565 Sasol BEE
ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to shareholders who are not exempt from the
dividend withholding tax, is 624 cents per share, while the dividend amount payable to shareholders who are
exempt from dividend withholding tax is 780 cents per share.

Basis of preparation 

The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited's
(JSE) Listings Requirements for summary financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies
Act applicable to summary financial statements. The JSE requires summary financial statements to be
prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements
of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain
the information required by IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The summarised consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosure required for complete
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. These summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the historic cost convention except that certain items, including derivative instruments, liabilities
for cash-settled share-based payment schemes, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and
available-for-sale financial assets, are stated at fair value. The summarised consolidated financial statements
are presented in South African rand, which is Sasol Limited's functional and presentation currency. The
accounting policies applied in the preparation of these summarised consolidated financial statements are in
terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the consolidated annual financial statements for the
year ended 30 June 2017. The summarised consolidated financial statements appearing in this announcement
are the responsibility of the directors. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the
summarised consolidated financial statements. Paul Victor CA(SA), Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for
this set of summarised consolidated financial statements and has supervised the preparation thereof in
conjunction with the Senior Vice President: Financial Control Services, Brenda Baijnath CA(SA).

Related party transactions

The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an
arm's length basis at market rates with related parties.

Financial instruments

Fair value
Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined unless the instrument is listed in an active
market. Where possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below represents significant financial instruments measured at fair value at reporting date, or
for which fair value is disclosed at 30 June 2017. The US dollar bond, the interest rate swap, the crude oil
put options, the zero-cost foreign exchange collars and the coal swaps were considered to be significant
financial instruments for the group based on the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position
and the fact that these instruments are traded in an active market. The calculation of fair value requires
various inputs into the valuation methodologies used. The source of the inputs used affects the reliability and
accuracy of the valuations. Financial instruments have been classified into the hierarchical levels in line with IFRS 13.

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or
          indirectly).
Level 3   Inputs for the asset or liability that are unobservable.

Trading statement for the financial year ended 30 June 2017

Sasol´s earnings per share (EPS) for the financial year ended 30
June 2017 are expected to increase by between 48% and 58%
(approximating R10,40 to R12,56 per share) compared to the 2016
financial year (prior year) EPS of R21,66. Headline earnings per
share (HEPS) for the same year are expected to decrease by
between 11% and 21% (approximating R4,55 to R8,69 per share)
from the prior year HEPS of R41,40. The prior year EPS was
negatively impacted by the R9,9 billion impairment of our
Canadian shale gas assets.

Sasol delivered a strong business performance across most of the
value chain, with our Secunda Synfuels Operations reporting
record volumes and our Eurasian Operations delivering their
highest production volumes since 2015. However, continued
volatility in the macro-economic environment, particularly the
stronger rand and low oil price, has adversely impacted our
financial performance. Excluding the effect of our hedging
programme, the average rand/US dollar market exchange rate
strengthened by 6% from R14,52 in 2016 to R13,61, and the
closing rand/US dollar market exchange rate strengthened by 11%
from R14,71 to R13,06. This was partially offset by a 15% higher
average Brent crude oil price of US$49,77/bbl (30 June 2016 –
US$43,37/bbl).

The highlights of our operational performance can be summarised
as follows:

- Secunda Synfuels Operations increased production volumes by 1%
  to a record 7,83 million tons;
- Natref production volumes decreased by 5%. Plant shutdowns
  during the first half of the year contributed to a 3% decrease
  in production volumes and the plant incident on 22 May 2017,
  which resulted in unintended downtime, led to a 2% reduction
  in production volumes;
- Our Eurasian Operations increased production volumes by 6% on
  the back of stronger product demand;
- ORYX GTL achieved a utilisation rate of 95% compared to 81% in
  the previous year;
- Our Performance Chemicals business reported a 2% increase in
  sales volumes, which is at the upper end of our market
  guidance, mainly as a result of stronger demand, higher
  chemical margins and improved plant stability. Our Base
  Chemicals sales volumes increased by 3%, slightly below market
  guidance, due to a fire at one of our third party warehouses;
  and
- Liquid fuels sales volumes in our Energy Business decreased by
  2% due to a higher portion of production volumes from Secunda
  Synfuels Operations allocated to our higher margin yielding
  chemical businesses and lower Natref production volumes.

Sasol’s earnings were impacted by the following notable once off
and period close items:
                                                          HEPS       EPS

(US$65 million), which resulted from lower spot discount rates
and the extension of the useful life of the project to 50 years.

Sasol completes majority of Rand/US dollar hedging programme
for its 2018 financial year

In December 2016, Sasol announced that it entered into crude
oil put options, in terms of the Company’s financial market
risk policy, to mitigate specific risks and to provide
protection against adverse movements in commodity and final
product prices.

The Company also stated that as part of its financial risk
mitigation strategy it was reviewing other commodity and
currency hedges to protect and strengthen the Company’s
balance sheet as measured in terms of its gearing and net debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (“EBITDA”) targeted levels. In its half-year to
31 December results published on 27 February 2017, Sasol
announced that it had hedged approximately 12% of its Rand/US
dollar exposure for specific periods in its 2018 financial
year.

Sasol has completed the majority of its Rand/US dollar hedging
programme for the 2018 financial year ending on 30 June 2018
using zero-cost collar instruments. Hedges with a total
notional amount of US$4 billion (averaging US$1 billion per
quarter) have been put into place, with an annual average
floor of R13,46/US$, and an annual average cap of R15,51/US$.
These levels approximate the quarterly averages.

These hedges approximate 70% of the Company’s expected net
Rand/US dollar exposure in the 2018 financial year. These
hedges will provide Sasol with some cash flow and balance
sheet protection, as gearing and net debt to EBITDA levels are
expected to peak during the 2018 financial year. In addition,
the financial risk mitigation strategy with reference to
currency hedges is expected to partially mitigate the negative
translation impact of valuing the balance sheet at each
reporting date. The Company continues to review financial
market risks, and should additional material hedges be put
into place, appropriate announcements will be made.

Transitioning to the future 
Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa said: 
""Notwithstanding the volatile macro-economic environment in which we operate, Sasol delivered a resilient
performance. This is attributable to our continued sharpened focus on business and capital excellence,
advancement of our value-based capital projects, consistent delivery against our cost reduction and
cash savings targets and a heightened focus on macro-economic risk mitigations to protect our balance
sheet. These decisive actions were underpinned by a robust business performance from our global assets.
Furthermore, we continue pursuing our zero harm focus, building a resilient organisation for the future
and nurturing our foundation business, while driving value based growth as we consider our future
investment opportunities.""

Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell said:
""Advancing our value based growth strategy continues through our near-term focus on Southern Africa and
North America. Our Lake Charles Chemicals Project in the United States is now 64% complete, and remains
on track for start-up of the first units in the second half of 2018. The fundamental drivers for this investment
remain sound, and will enable Sasol's continued growth in a low feedstock cost region. In Mozambique,
we remain committed to our growth plans and will continue to partner with the country's government
and other stakeholders on projects that will help stimulate socio-economic growth.  We are confident that
the economics to develop the Production Sharing Agreement license area remain positive, with four wells
completed, as part of our drilling campaign, already showing promising results.""

Overview*  
Earnings attributable to shareholders for the six months ended 31 December 2016 increased by 19% to
R8,7 billion from R7,3 billion in the prior period. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 38% to
R15,12 and earnings per share (EPS) increased by 19% to R14,21 compared to the prior period. Operating
profit decreased by 8% to R13,7 billion compared to the prior period.
 
Although business performance was mostly in line with our expectations, Sasol's profitability, period on
period, and as reflected in HEPS, was negatively impacted by the following items:
-  The strengthening of the Rand against the US dollar to R13,74 at 31 December 2016 (30 June 2016: R14,71) resulted 
   in translation losses of approximately R1,3 billion on the valuation of the balance sheet, compared to translation 
   gains of R2,6 billion in the prior period (including foreign exchange contracts). The valuation impact of the 
   stronger closing exchange rate for the period under review negatively impacted earnings by approximately 
   R1,46 per share. 
-  The impact of the once-off prolonged strike action at our Secunda mining operations resulted in an
   additional net cost of R1 billion or R1,06 per share.
-  The reversal of a provision of R2,3 billion (US$166 million) or R3,77 per share in the prior period based on a
   favourable ruling received from the Tax Appeal Tribunal in Nigeria relating to the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids
   (EGTL) project.

HEPS, normalised for these once-off adjustments and translation effects, amounted to R18,62 per share,
which is 4% higher compared to normalised HEPS for the prior period of R17,96. 

* All comparisons refer to the prior period for the six months ended 31 December 2015. All references to years 
  refer to the financial year ended 30 June. Any reference to a calendar year is prefaced by the word ""calendar"". 
  Except for earnings attributable to shareholders and the RP cash conservation measures, all numbers are quoted 
  on a pre-tax basis.

We have seen a steady and continued recovery in global oil and product prices during the period under
review. Average Brent crude oil prices moved higher by 2% and since December 2016 have moved to the mid
US$50/bbl range, which will positively impact our results during the second half of 2017. Our refining margins
decreased by 32% to US$8,42/bbl, however, we have seen some recovery since the lows of October 2016
which will positively impact on our results in the second half of 2017. Despite the soft commodity chemical
prices experienced during the first quarter of 2017, we have seen a steady increase in demand and resilient
margins in certain key markets during the second quarter of 2017. Despite the volatile macro-economic
environment, the average margin for our speciality chemicals business remained flat, except for
our ammonia business, where margins were squeezed as a result of oversupply in global markets. 

Overall, Sasol delivered a strong business performance across most of the value chain. Secunda Synfuels'
production volumes increased by 1% and our Eurasian operations increased production volumes by 5% on
the back of stronger demand. Natref's production volumes were down 7% mainly due to plant shutdowns
during the period under review. Normalised sales volumes increased by 11% for our Base Chemicals business
and 2% for our Performance Chemicals business compared to the prior period mainly on the back of stronger
demand and improved plant stability. Liquid fuels sales volumes decreased by 2% due to the Natref planned
shutdowns and more volumes from Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) being allocated to the higher margin
yielding chemical businesses. ORYX GTL achieved an average utilisation rate of 95% with the run-rate of
production in line with our previous market guidance. 

Our Secunda mining operations experienced a challenging six months with the onset of a protected strike
action, which commenced in August 2016, by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union
(AMCU). Notwithstanding a 16% decrease in mining production volumes resulting from the strike action,
Mining continued to deliver our full coal supply commitment to the integrated Sasol value chain through
external coal purchases and increased gas consumption at Secunda Synfuels Operations. The profitability of
the mining business was significantly impacted by the R1 billion net additional cost as a result of the strike.

We continued to drive our cost containment programme and managed cash fixed costs well below inflation
in nominal terms, when compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of inflation, our cash fixed costs,
including the mining strike costs, reduced by 1% in real terms compared to the prior period. The strong cost
performance was achieved by sustainable delivery of our Business Performance Enhancement Programme
(BPEP) and Response Plan (RP).

As part of the BPEP, we delivered sustainable cost savings of R4,9 billion, exceeding our December 2016 exit
run rate target by R0,2 billion. We are confident that we will meet or exceed our targeted sustainable savings
at an exit run rate of R5,4 billion by the end of 2018.

Our comprehensive low oil price RP, focusing on cash conservation to counter a lower-for-much-longer
oil price reality, has continued to yield positive cash savings in line with our 2017 targets, despite margin
contraction and difficulties experienced in placing certain product. The RP realised R17,8 billion of cash savings
for the period. We have increased our full year cash savings target from R22 billion to R26 billion, mainly due
to the reprioritisation of our capital portfolio. The RP places the company in a strong position to operate
profitably within a US$40-50/bbl oil price environment. We expect our sustainable cash cost savings from our
RP to be R2,5 billion by 2019, in addition to the R5,4bn sustainable savings from our BPEP.

The decrease in the effective corporate tax rate from 43,1% to 28,4% was mainly as a result of the R7,4 billion
(CAD665 million) partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets in the prior period. The normalised
effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted investments, remeasurements and once-off items, is 29,2%
compared to 32,9% in the prior period due to additional tax incentives.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R30,2 billion. This includes R17,4 billion
(US$1,2 billion) relating to the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP). We have revised our capital expenditure 
estimate from R75 billion to R66 billion for the full year, largely due to the impact of the stronger rand/US dollar 
exchange rate coupled with our cash conservation initiatives and active management of our capital portfolio.

Our net cash position decreased from R52 billion in June 2016 to R28 billion at 31 December 2016, mainly due
to the funding of the LCCP and the effect of a stronger closing rand/US dollar exchange rate. Loans raised
during the period amounted to R2 billion, mainly for the funding of our growth projects.

During the current financial year, Sasol entered into a number of hedges to mitigate specific financial risks 
and provide protection against unforeseen movements in oil prices, interest rates, currency movements, 
and commodity and final product prices. Approximately 50% of the crude oil exposure was hedged with crude oil 
put options for 2017 at a net price of ~US$49,50/bbl. A total net loss of R515 million (US$37 million) was 
recognised during the period. To manage the exposure to the US dollar, approximately 12% of the rand/US dollar 
exposure was hedged with zero-cost collar instruments at a floor of ~R14,10 for specific periods in 2018. 
A net gain of R283 million (US$20 million) was recognised during the period. Should attractive hedges become 
available in the market at an acceptable cost, we will enter into additional hedges as mitigation against these 
financial risks. 

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 37% to R16,8 billion compared with R26,7 billion in
the prior period. Notwithstanding reduced cash flows, our balance sheet has the capacity to lever up, as
we continue to execute our growth plans and return value to our shareholders. Accordingly, in support of
our funding strategy, gearing increased to 25%, which is consistent with our previous market guidance of
20% to 44%.

To manage the impact of price volatility and the low oil price environment, the Sasol Limited Board (Board)
concluded that our internal gearing ceiling will remain at 44% until the end of 2018. The net debt: EBITDA ratio
is forecasted to be below 2,0 times. We actively manage our capital structure and funding plan to ensure that
we maintain an optimum solvency and liquidity profile.

Our dividend policy is to pay dividends within a dividend cover range based on HEPS. Taking into account the
current volatile macro-economic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation initiative,
the current strength of our balance sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a gross
interim dividend of R4,80 per share (15,8% lower compared to the prior period). The interim dividend cover was
3,2 times at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: 4,3 times). The dividend declared is in accordance with our
dividend cover policy of 2,2x to 2,8x of annual HEPS.

Solid operational performance supported by continued effective cost management 

Operating Business Units 
Mining - uninterrupted supply to Secunda Synfuels Operations, but negatively impacted by
strike action

Operating profit decreased by 35% to R1 534 million compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of the net
additional cost of the strike action of R1 billion at our Secunda mining operations. Normalised operating profit,
excluding the strike cost, increased by 9% mainly due to higher selling prices to SSO and a 35% increase in
export coal prices. Our normalised unit cost of production increased by 13% above inflation compared to the
prior period due to higher depreciation, enablement and utility costs associated with our new mines and
increased maintenance costs.

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) - strong Mozambique operational delivery 
E&PI recorded an operating profit of R204 million compared to an operating loss of R853 million (excluding
the impact of a partial impairment of R7 436 million) in the prior period. Operating profit was positively
impacted by translation gains of R202 million and an 18% decrease in cash fixed costs, underpinned by our
cost containment programme.

Our Mozambican producing operations' operating profit increased from R437 million in the prior period to
R988 million mainly due to a 3% increase in production volumes on the back of increased gas consumption at
SSO and the net positive impact of translation effects of R859 million.

Our Gabon asset recorded a lower operating loss of R41 million compared to a  R512 million operating loss in
the prior period, mainly due to lower depreciation charges and higher sales prices. This was offset by a 23%
decrease in production volumes (after royalties) as a result of the deferral of drilling activities in line with our
RP cash saving initiatives.

Our Canadian shale gas assets in Montney generated an operating loss of R312 million, compared to an
operating loss of R333 million (excluding the impact of a partial impairment of R7 436 million) in the prior
period. Our Canadian gas production volumes increased by 3% compared to the prior period, mainly due to
completion activities on existing wells. There were no drilling rigs in operation during the period.

Strategic Business Units
Performance Chemicals - stronger demand and resilient margins
Operating profit of R4 647 million decreased by 10% compared to the prior period, mainly due to a partial
impairment of R527 million on our US Phenolics business and a significant decrease in global ammonia prices.
Normalising for these effects, operating profit increased by 9%. The increase in operating profit is largely due
to the resilience of margins in our European organics business coupled with increased ethylene sales prices
which positively impacted on the margins of our assets in the US. Production volumes from our European
Operations increased by 5% due to stronger demand.

Total sales volumes increased by 1% compared to the prior period. Normalised sales volumes were up 2%,
after taking into account the ethylene plant shutdown in the US in the prior period and the sale of the US wax
production facility in May 2016. 

Our Fischer-Tropsch Wax Expansion Project (FTWEP) (phase one), which is continuing to ramp up, is replacing
hard wax volumes from the existing facility which has been recently decommissioned. Phase two of the
project is expected to reach beneficial operation by the end of quarter three of 2017 resulting in increased
hard wax production during quarter four of 2017 and 2018. Cash fixed costs in nominal rand terms are 1%
lower compared to the prior period.

Base Chemicals - increased sales volumes due to improved production stability 
Sales volumes increased by 11% mainly as a result of improved production stability after the commissioning of
the C3 Expansion Project in the prior year.

Operating profit, normalised for the effect of remeasurements, once-off items and translation effects on the
valuation of the balance sheet, remained flat in comparison to the prior year. The business managed to deliver
a solid performance by focusing on delivering higher production and sales volumes and managing costs. While
commodity chemical US dollar prices decreased by 6% compared to the prior period, prices have recovered and are 
currently 6,7% higher than the second half of 2016, with this trend expected to continue for at least the 
next six months.

Operating profit decreased by 45% to R1 733 million compared to the prior period and the operating margin
decreased from 19% to 10%. Normalised operating profit for the full financial year is estimated at between
R4,5 billion to R5,5 billion, based on the latest business performance and taking into account a much stronger
rand/US dollar exchange rate*.

* This financial forecast is the responsibility of the directors and in accordance with standard practice, it is 
  noted that this information has not been reviewed and reported on by the company's auditors.

Energy - Strong Synfuels performance, margins under pressure
Operating profit of R5 529 million decreased by R4 732 million or 46% compared to the prior period.
Normalised for the impact of translation effects on the valuation of the balance sheet and other once-off
items, operating profit decreased by 21%. Operating margins were down 4% on a normalised basis. Operating
profit was negatively impacted by a 38% decrease in petrol differentials, a 12% decrease in diesel differentials
and lower liquid fuels sales volumes. In nominal terms, we reduced our cash fixed costs by 2% compared to
the prior period due to our BPEP and RP initiatives and the benefit of increased own electricity generation
at SSO.

Liquid fuel sales volumes decreased by 2% compared to the prior period, mainly due to lower allocated
volumes from SSO, the impact of the Natref plant shutdowns and lower external purchases. Gas sales
volumes were 1% higher compared to the prior period mainly due to higher gas sales to commercial
customers. Our share of power produced at the Central Térmica de Ressano Garcia (CTRG) joint operation in
Mozambique amounted to 334 gigawatt-hours of electricity, 2% higher than the prior period.

The ORYX GTL plant achieved an average utilisation rate of 95% for the period, while maintaining a world-class
safety recordable case rate of zero. Excluding the impact of a once-off tax adjustment at the ORYX GTL plant
in the prior period, our share of profit from joint ventures was 10% higher compared to the prior period.
In Nigeria, the extended EGTL turnaround maintenance programme is scheduled to be completed during the
first quarter of the 2017 calendar year followed by a planned ramp-up in plant production to design capacity.

Advancing projects to enable future growth  
We are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline:

-  Growing our footprint in North America 

   -  Overall construction on the LCCP continues on all fronts, with most engineering and procurement
      activities nearing completion during the period. Total capital spent amounts to US$6,0 billion, and the
      overall project completion is 64%. The total forecasted capital cost for the project remains within the
      approved US$11 billion budget and approved schedule. The project's contingency which, measured
      against industry norms for this stage of project completion, is still considered sufficient to effectively
      complete the project to beneficial operation (BO) within the US$11 billion budget. Although unplanned
      event-driven risks may still impact the execution and cost of the project, we are confident that the
      remaining construction, procurement, execution and business readiness risks can be managed within
      the budget as a result of these changes. We still consider the LCCP to be a value-based investment
      that will return sustainable value to our shareholders for many years into the future. The project
      returns are still forecast to be above our weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

   -  Construction of our 50% joint venture high-density polyethylene plant with Ineos Olefins and
      Polymers USA is more than 90% complete and is on track for mechanical completion by the
      middle of the 2017 calendar year. The plant will be the largest bi-modal high density polyethylene
      (HDPE) manufacturing facility in the US (470 kt per annum) and will produce some of the most cost
      competitive performance resins based on InnoveneTM S technology. We continue to work with the
      operator (our joint venture partner) to manage construction delays that have mainly resulted from
      adverse weather conditions and poor craft labour productivity. Together with our partner, we have
      successfully approached the market and attained a favourable reduction in the financing rate for the
      remaining term of the facility.  The project economics remain strong and returns are currently above
      WACC despite the project's cost increase. The market conditions for start-up continue to be favourable
      with low feedstock cost and strong polyethylene market demand projected in 2017.

-  Focusing on our asset base in Southern Africa 

   -  Our strategic R14,0 billion mine replacement programme, which will ensure uninterrupted coal
      supply to SSO in order to support Sasol's strategy to operate its southern African facilities until
      2050, is nearing completion. The total programme is expected to be completed below budget and
      within schedule. The Shondoni colliery achieved BO, within budget, during April 2016 and will be
      fully completed during the second half of the 2017 calendar year. Phase 2 of the Impumelelo colliery
      project for R0,9 billion commenced during the first half of the 2016 calendar year and is on track to be
      completed within budget, late in the 2019 calendar year.

   -  The expansion of our FTWEP facility in Sasolburg is progressing well. BO for phase two is on track for
      the end of the third quarter of 2017. The project economics for this project remain sound. The total
      project cost for both phases is estimated at R13,5 billion.

   -  The Loop Line 2 project on the Mozambique to Secunda Pipeline (MSP) reached BO ahead of schedule
      on 2 November 2016 at a total project cost below budget, while delivering a safety recordable case
      rate of zero. Loop Line 2 will increase the MSP's available annual gas transportation capacity from
      169,4 bscf to 191 bscf and renders a return in line with our investment hurdle rate. 

   -  The first phase of the development of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) licence area remains
      on budget and schedule. To date, four wells have been drilled and completed, two gas wells in the
      Temane G8 reservoir and two oil wells in the Inhassoro G6 reservoir. Drilling results have been in line
      with expectations. The third oil well (or fifth well) was spudded in early February 2017. In addition,
      as part of the PSA programme, the first onshore Mozambique 3D seismic programme has been
      successfully undertaken.

Maintaining our focus on sustainable value creation

We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the period:

-  Safety remains a top priority for Sasol. Regrettably, we did experience the loss of three of our colleagues
   during the period. Our thoughts remain with these colleagues' families and friends. Our safety RCR for
   employees and service providers, excluding illnesses, improved to 0,27 at 31 December 2016 (0,32 as at
   31 December 2015). We retain our focus on safety and strive for zero harm.

-  During the period, we invested R471 million in skills development and socioeconomic development, which
   includes our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa
   programme focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the
   Secunda and Sasolburg regions. Since 2013, we have invested R618 million, of which R21 million was spent
   in Secunda and Sasolburg during the period. A further R68 million is planned for the remainder of 2017.
   The total planned Ikusasa investment amounts to R800 million, with the remaining R114 million to be
   spent by 2020.

-  While we support the transition to a lower carbon economy, we are concerned that the proposed carbon
   tax in South Africa will diminish the country's competitiveness. It also cannot address the structural issues
   that lie at the heart of the country's carbon intensity. The proposed design of the carbon tax creates
   substantial regulatory and investment uncertainty as there is insufficient clarity relating to the phases
   of the tax proposed in the draft carbon tax bill, especially post 2020. This is exacerbated by the fact
   that the carbon tax is not aligned with the carbon budget system which is currently in the trial phase of
   implementation. Sasol continues to engage with the South African Government on the carbon tax issue.

-  To ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, Sasol applied for
   certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance timeframes.
   We have received decisions on our postponement applications from the National Air Quality Officer, which,
   while aligned with our requests, imposed stretched targets in terms of our atmospheric emission licences.
   In some cases shorter postponement were granted and further applications are under way to extend
   compliance timeframes in line with our committed roadmaps. Our R3,3 billion volatile organic compound
   abatement programme remains on track to achieve our targeted reductions of volatile organic compounds
   emissions by 2020.

-  We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response in accordance with our key
   performance indicators. Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally for the six months ended
   31 December 2016 were 33,8 million tons compared to 34,5 million tons for the prior period. Our GHG
   emissions intensity (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of production) increased to 3,71
   compared to 3,68 at June 2016 as a result of lower production (due to planned shutdowns). GHG targets in
   South Africa are being developed in conjunction with the South African government's process for setting
   carbon budgets.

-  Our improvement in utility Energy Intensity Index (EII) marginally increased above our internal target
   of 1% improvement for the period to 2% for our operations in South Africa. Including our international
   operations, we improved our EII by 1,8% from the previous financial year.

-  During the period, we paid R15,4 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South African Government.
   Sasol remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South Africa, contributing significantly to the
   country's economy.

-  In 2016, in terms of the Department of Trade and Industry's revised Codes of Good Practice, our B-BBEE
   contributor status declined to level 8 from level 4. We view B-BBEE in South Africa as a business
   imperative and have embarked on a project to realise the targets set to improve our rating by 2020.

Profit outlook* - strong production performance and cost reductions to continue 

The current economic climate remains volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign exchange movements
are outside our control and may impact on our results, our focus remains firmly on managing factors within
our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial risk
management and cash conservation.

We expect an overall strong operational performance for 2017, with:
-  Liquid fuels sales volumes for the Energy business in southern Africa to be approximately 61 million
   barrels;
-  Base Chemicals sales volumes to be between 4% to 6% higher than the prior year, with US dollar product
   prices recovering;
-  Performance Chemicals sales volumes to be between 1% to 2% higher, with average margins for the
   business remaining resilient; 
-  An average utilisation rate at ORYX GTL in Qatar of above 90% for the remainder of the financial year; 
-  Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line with SA PPI;
-  The RP cash flow contribution to range between R22 billion and R26 billion;
-  BPEP cash cost savings to achieve an annual run rate of R5,4 billion by 2018;
-  Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R66 billion for 2017 and R60 billion in 2018 as we
   progress with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result of
   exchange rate volatility;
-  Our balance sheet gearing up to a level of between 30% and 35%, with net debt:EBITDA being managed to
   below 2,0 times; 
-  Average Brent crude oil prices expected to remain between US$50/bbl and US$55/bbl; and
-  Ongoing rand/US dollar volatility due to various factors, including the pending outcome of the next review
   of the South African sovereign credit rating and capital inflows.

producers, including Sasol. The Competition Commission is conducting an investigation into Sasol's South
African polymer business, and it is finalising a market inquiry in the South African LPG market. We continue
to interact and co-operate with the South African Commission in respect of the subject matter of current
applications brought by Sasol, as well as in the areas that are subject to the Commission's investigations. 
To the extent appropriate, further announcements will be made in future.

Declaration of cash dividend number 75
An interim gross cash dividend of South African 480,00 cents per ordinary share (31 December 2015 - 570,00 cents 
per ordinary share) has been declared for the six months ended 31 December 2016. The interim cash dividend is
payable on the ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and
solvency of the company, as well as capital remaining after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support
the current operations. The dividend has been declared out of retained earnings (income reserves). With effect 
from 22 February 2017, the South African dividend withholding tax rate is 20%. At the declaration date, there 
are 651 389 516 ordinary (including 8 809 886 treasury shares), 25 547 081 preferred ordinary and 
2 838 565 Sasol BEE ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to ordinary shareholders who 
are not exempt from the dividend withholding tax, is 384,00 cents per share, while the dividend amount payable 
to ordinary shareholders who are exempt from dividend withholding tax is 480,00 cents per share.

*  The impact of a stronger Rand at 31 December 2016 (R13,74/US$, R14,45/EUR) resulted in the translation loss recognised
   in other comprehensive income. At 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2016, the weaker Rand (R15,48/US$, R16,81/EUR and 
   R14,71/US$, R16,33/EUR, respectively) resulted in significant translation gains recognised in other comprehensive income 
   in the prior periods.
** Includes the impact of a R116 million (31 December 2015 - Rnil; 30 June 2016 - R97 million) reclassification to profit 
   and loss, relating to the interest rate swap. A gain of R2 billion (US$145 million) was recognised in other comprehensive 
   income during the period as a result of the significant decrease in the liability related to the interest rate swap, 
   which occurred due to the interest rate curves trading significantly higher than at 30 June 2016.

The reader is referred to the definitions contained in the 2016 Sasol Limited financial statements.

Basis of preparation 
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 31 December 2016 have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 34, Interim Financial
Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and
Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements
of the Companies Act of South Africa, 2008, as amended, and the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the disclosure required for
complete annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared on a
going-concern basis. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the Company is sufficient to
support the current operations for the next 12 months.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
historic cost convention except that certain items, including derivative instruments, liabilities for cash-
settled share-based payment schemes, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available-
for-sale financial assets, are stated at fair value.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in South African rand, which is Sasol
Limited's functional and presentation currency.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements appearing in this announcement are the
responsibility of the directors. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. Paul Victor CA(SA), Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for this
set of condensed consolidated interim financial statements and has supervised the preparation thereof in
conjunction with the Senior Vice-President: Financial Control Services, Brenda Baijnath CA(SA).

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these summarised consolidated interim financial
statements are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the consolidated annual financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.

Related party transactions
The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an arm's
length basis at market rates with related parties.

Significant events and transactions since 30 June 2016
In accordance with IAS34, Interim Financial Reporting, we have included an explanation of events and
transactions which are significant to obtain an understanding of the changes in our financial position and
performance since 30 June 2016 in the financial results overview.

Financial instruments
Fair value
Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined unless the instrument is listed in an active
market. Where possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below represents significant financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date,
or for which fair value is disclosed at 31 December 2016. The US dollar bond, interest rate swap, crude oil
put options, zero-cost foreign exchange collars and coal swaps were considered to be significant financial
instruments based on the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the fact that
these instruments are traded in an active market. The calculation of fair value requires various inputs into
the valuation methodologies used. The source of the inputs used affects the reliability and accuracy of the
valuations. Significant inputs have been classified into the hierarchical levels in line with IFRS 13.

Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or indirectly).
Level 3    Inputs for the asset or liability that are unobservable.

Trading statement for the six months ended 31 December 2016

Sasol´s earnings per share (EPS) for the six months ended
31 December 2016 are expected to increase by between 12% and 22%
(approximating R1,44 to R2,63 per share) compared to the 2016
financial half year (prior period) EPS of R11,97. Headline
earnings per share (HEPS) for the same period are expected to
decrease by between 34% and 44% (approximating R8,26 to R10,68
per share) from the prior period HEPS of R24,28.

Overall, Sasol delivered a strong business performance across
most of the value chain. Secunda Synfuels’ production volumes
increased by 1% and our Eurasian operations increased production
volumes by 8% on the back of stronger product demand. Natref’s
production volumes were down 7% mainly due to planned shutdowns
during the period under review. Normalised sales volumes
increased by 11% for our Base Chemicals business and 2% for our
Performance Chemicals business compared to the prior period
mainly on the back of stronger demand, higher chemical margins
and improved plant stability. Liquid fuels sales volumes
decreased by 2% due to the Natref planned shutdowns and more
volumes allocated to the higher margin yielding chemical
businesses. ORYX GTL achieved a utilization rate of 95% with the
run-rate of production in line with previous market guidance
provided. A detailed production summary and key business
performance metrics for the first half of the 2017 financial
year for all our businesses are available on our website,
www.sasol.com.

We have seen a steady and continued recovery in global oil and
product prices during the period under review. Normalised cash
fixed costs continued to trend well within inflation for the
period under review. HEPS was however negatively impacted by the
following items:

*   Although the average rand/US dollar exchange rate weakened by
    3% to R13,99 during the period under review, the closing
    rand/US dollar exchange rate, however, strengthened to R13,74
    at 31 December 2016 (30 June 2016 – R14,71) resulting in
    translation losses of approximately R1,3 billion on the
    valuation of the balance sheet compared to translation gains
    of R2,6 billion, which includes foreign exchange contracts,
    recognised in the prior period. The valuation impact of the
    stronger closing exchange rate for the period under review
    negatively impacted earnings by approximately R1,46 per
    share;
*   The impact of labour actions at our Secunda mining
    operations, during the six month period, resulted in a 16%
    decrease in mining production volumes and significantly
    higher once-off costs to ensure a continuous supply of coal
    to our Secunda Synfuels Operations. The additional net cost
    associated with the labour action is estimated at
    approximately R1 billion or R1,06 per share; and
*   Once-off items in the prior year of R2,3 billion or R3,77 per
    share relating mainly to the reversal of the Escravos GTL
    provision.

Our results for the first half of the 2017 financial year may be
further affected by any adjustments resulting from our half
year-end closure process. This may result in a change in the
estimated earnings noted above. This trading statement only
deals with the comparison to the first half of the 2016
financial year.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's
external auditors. Sasol's financial results for the six months
ended 31 December 2016 will be announced on Monday,
27 February 2017.

Hedging of financial risks

Sasol has a board-approved policy with respect to hedging of financial risks, which
allows the Company to mitigate specific risks and provide protection against
unforeseen movements in interest rates, currency movements, commodity and final
product prices.

During the course of the 2017 financial year, Sasol has entered into a number of
hedges to mitigate specific financial risks. In particular, we have entered into
hedges against the downside risk in the crude oil price to increase the stability
and predictability of our cash flows.

Sasol has entered into oil put options, for the second quarter of the financial
year ending 30 June 2017 (October 2016 to December 2016), which provide the Company
with an average Brent crude oil price floor of US$48,68 per barrel (net of costs)
for approximately 7,6 million barrels. Sasol has also entered into put options for
quarter three and a part of quarter four of financial year 2017 which provide the
Company with an average Brent crude oil price floor of US$47,06 per barrel (net of
costs) for approximately 16,8 million barrels.

We are currently reviewing other commodity and currency hedges and should we enter
into material hedges, an appropriate announcement will be made.

Overview

In 2016, we continued to adapt to a tough operating environment created by the further dramatic drop
in global oil and commodity prices. We have seen oil prices drop to as low as US$27 per barrel (/bbl) in
January 2016 and somewhat recovering to US$48/bbl by June 2016. As anticipated, commodity chemical
prices also followed the declining trend of global oil prices.

The work we have undertaken since 2012 to reposition Sasol and sustainably reduce our cost base proved
invaluable, as it allowed us to sustainably withstand a lower for much longer oil price environment. We have
further intensified and increased the targets of our low oil price Response Plan (RP) to make our business
even more resilient in the short-term, without compromising on safety and the operational integrity of our
operations. The current low oil price environment has however, as expected, impacted our financial results, as
well as those of our competitors.

While global oil prices are beyond our control, we have performed strongly on the factors within our
control. We delivered a solid set of production volumes across most of the value chain, contained cost
increases to well below inflation and heightened our focus on the delivery of capital projects.

Notwithstanding the uncertain global markets and volatile macroeconomic environment, under our new
leadership, given the strength of our diversified asset base and high performance culture, we will continue
to deliver maximum sustainable value to our shareholders.

Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers, Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell say:

""We are excited to be taking over as Sasol's Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers. We have been
working together over the last six months to clearly define how we will lead Sasol, address the challenges
the company is facing and pursue the exciting opportunities ahead. 

Sasol's global operations continue to perform well, with our Secunda Operations reporting record production
volumes. Our cost reduction and cash savings initiatives are exceeding their targets, which places us on a
sound footing as we gear up our balance sheet to complete the world-scale, company-changing investment
in Louisiana in the US.

Although the capital expenditure for our Lake Charles Chemicals Project has increased, we remain confident
that the fundamental drivers for this investment are sound. The cost and schedule review process, which
was completed in August 2016, has set a solid platform for the continued execution of this project. In
Mozambique, we continue to advance our growth projects to further develop our footprint in that region. We
look forward to building on Sasol's past successes, as we lead the company forward and continue to grow in
both Southern Africa and North America. 

In the medium-term, we will continue to focus on pursuing zero harm, building a resilient organisation for
the future, nurturing our foundation businesses, delivering sustainable growth and clarifying our future
investment opportunities.""

Financial results overview* 

Earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2016 decreased by 55% to R13,2 billion from
R29,7 billion in the prior year. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 17% to R41,40 and earnings
per share (EPS) decreased by 56% to R21,66 compared to the prior year. 

Operating profit of R24,2 billion decreased by 48% compared to the prior year on the back of challenging
and highly volatile global markets. Average Brent crude oil prices moved dramatically lower by 41% compared
to the prior year (average dated Brent was US$43/bbl for the year ended 30 June 2016 compared with
US$73/bbl in the prior year). Although commodity chemical prices were lower due to depressed oil prices,
there was still strong demand and robust margins in certain key markets. The average basket of commodity
chemical prices decreased by 22% compared to a 41% decrease in oil. However, the average margin for
our speciality chemicals business remained resilient compared to the prior year. The effect of lower oil
and commodity chemical prices was partly offset by a 27% weaker average rand/US dollar exchange rate
(R14,52/US$ for the year ended 30 June 2016 compared with R11,45/US$ in the prior year). On average, the
rand/bbl oil price of R630 was 25% lower compared to the prior year.

* All comparisons refer to the prior year ended 30 June 2015. Except for earnings attributable to shareholders 
  and the RP cash conservation measures, all numbers are quoted on a pre-tax basis.

The highlights of our operational performance can be summarised as follows:

-  Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) increased production volumes by 1%, or 97 kilo tons (kt), compared to
   the prior year, to a record 7,8 million tons;

-  Production volumes at our Eurasian Operations, increased by 4% compared to the prior year; 

-  Total liquid fuels production for the Energy business increased by 1% (0,6 million barrels) compared to
   the prior year due to higher total production volumes by SSO, continued stable operations at the Natref
   Operations and a greater portion of SSO's volumes being utilised by the Energy business as a result of
   planned commissioning activities associated with the C3 Expansion Project;

-  The average utilisation rate of our ORYX GTL facility in Qatar was impacted by a planned extended
   statutory shutdown in the third quarter of the financial year. Subsequent to the shutdown, utilisation
   rates averaged above 100% of nameplate capacity, enabling us to achieve an overall utilisation rate of
   81%, which is in line with previous market guidance provided;

-  Secunda Chemical Operations' production volumes were 1% higher than in the prior year;

-  Despite the largest planned statutory shutdown since its inception, Sasolburg Operations' production
   volumes remained in line with the prior year. The planned extended statutory shutdown resulted in a 21%
   decrease in ammonia production compared to the prior year. This was partly offset by the slightly slower
   than planned ramp-up of our FTWEP facility which contributed 8 kt per annum of additional hard wax 
   production during the year. Normalised production volumes for the Sasolburg site increased by 2%;

-  Sales volumes from our Base Chemicals business decreased by 8% as a result of a planned extended
   shutdown to enable the commissioning activities of the C3 Expansion Project, subdued demand for
   explosives and fertilizers and a planned stock build. Normalised sales volumes decreased by 2,6% on a 
   comparable basis; and

-  Sales volumes from our Performance Chemicals business, normalised for the planned shutdowns at our
   Sasolburg facilities and ethylene plant in North America, increased by 1,8% compared to the prior year.

We continued to drive our cost containment programme and held cash fixed costs flat in nominal terms
compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of inflation, exchange rates and a reduction in once-
off costs, our cash fixed costs reduced by 8,1% in real terms compared to the prior year. The strong cost
performance was achieved by an accelerated sustainable delivery of our Business Performance Enhancement
Programme (BPEP) and RP.
 
Given a lower for much longer oil price environment, we have revised our company-wide BPEP to achieve
sustainable savings at an exit run rate of R5,4 billion by the end of the 2018 financial year. In 2016, we
delivered actual sustainable cost savings of R4,5 billion, exceeding our exit run rate target of R4,3 billion. Cost
trends are still forecasted to track South African producers' price index (SA PPI) from the 2017 financial year.
Implementation costs amounted to R278 million for the year compared to R1,9 billion in the prior year.
 
Our comprehensive RP, focusing on cash conservation in reaction to the lower for much longer oil price
environment, has continued to yield positive cash savings in line with our 2016 financial year targets, despite
margin contraction and difficulties experienced in placing product. The RP realised R28 billion of cash savings
for the year and exceeded the upper end of our original 2016 financial target of cash savings of R16 billion
by R12 billion. The RP places the company in a strong position to operate profitably within a US$40-50/bbl
oil price environment. During the year, we updated and extended the scope of the RP to at least the 2018
financial year to ensure continued balance sheet strength and earnings resilience at notably lower oil price
scenarios. We also increased the target from R30 billion to R50 billion to between R65 billion and R75 billion.
Most of the savings will be delivered from the current RP work streams. We expect our sustainable cash cost
savings to increase to R2,5 billion by the 2019 financial year, up R1 billion from the previous market guidance
provided of R1,5 billion.

Labour transitioning processes relating to the BPEP and RP were concluded during 2016 and we expect
our full time equivalent sustainable headcount, excluding our growth projects, to remain at approximately
30 000, a 15% decrease from the 2013 base of approximately 35 400. In South Africa, we have concluded wage 
negotiations within the Petroleum and Industrial Chemical sectors. Negotiations with the Mining sector were
successfully concluded with four of the five unions. Negotiations with the Association of Mineworkers and 
Construction Union (AMCU) are continuing.

Sasol's profitability was impacted by the following notable once-off and significant items:

-  a net remeasurement items expense of R12,9 billion compared to a R0,8 billion expense in the prior year.
   These items relate mainly to partial impairments of our low density polyethylene cash generating unit
   in the United States (US) of R956 million (US$65 million) and our share in the Montney shale gas asset of R9,9 billion
   (CAD880 million) due to a further deterioration of conditions in the North American gas market resulting
   in a decline in forecasted natural gas prices. We expect the low gas price environment to continue in the
   short to medium-term;

-  a cash-settled share-based payment charge to the income statement of R371 million compared to a credit
   of R1,4 billion in the prior year. The credit in the prior year was largely due to a 29% decrease in the share
   price in financial year 2015; and

-  the reversal of a provision of R2,3 billion (US$166 million) based on a favourable ruling received from the
   Tax Appeal Tribunal in Nigeria relating to the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (EGTL) project. 

The increase in the effective corporate tax rate from 31,7% to 36,6% was mainly as a result of the R9,9 billion
(CAD880 million) partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets which was partially offset by the
recognition of a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset on the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in
Mozambique of R945 million. The normalised effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted investments,
remeasurement items and once-off items, is 28,2% compared to 33,0% in the prior year, which is in line with
our previous market guidance.

The valuation of our assets and liabilities were significantly impacted by the weaker rand/US dollar exchange
rate, resulting in higher translation effects. Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, of R70,4 billion,
is below our market guidance of R74 billion largely due to our cash conservation initiatives and actively
managing the capital portfolio. This includes R42,4 billion (US$2,9 billion) relating to the Lake Charles
Chemicals Project (LCCP).

Loans raised during the year amounted to R37 billion, mainly for the funding of the LCCP. Our net cash
position remained favourable and decreased marginally by 2%, from R53 billion in June 2015 to R52 billion
as at 30 June 2016, driven largely by our cash conservation initiatives and the impact of the favourable
rand/US dollar translation effect. 

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by only 12% to R54,7 billion compared with R61,8 billion in
the prior year, despite an average 25% decrease in Rand oil prices. Notwithstanding reduced cash flows, our 
balance sheet has the capacity to lever up, as we continue to execute our growth plans and return value to our 
shareholders. Although our gearing increased to 14,6% compared to an ungeared 2,8% in the prior year, it remains 
below our previous market guidance of 20% to 40%, mainly as a result of a stronger than anticipated rand/US dollar
exchange rate and delayed capital expenditure on a number of projects, including the LCCP. To manage the impact
of price volatility and the lower for longer oil price environment, the Sasol Limited board of directors (Board)
temporarily lifted our internal gearing ceiling to 44%  until the end of the 2018 financial year. 
The net debt: EBTIDA ratio is forecasted to be below 2,0 times. We actively manage our capital structure and
funding plan to ensure that we maintain an optimum solvency and liquidity profile.

Our dividend policy is to pay dividends within a dividend cover range based on HEPS. Taking into account the
current volatile macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation initiative, the
current strength of our balance sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared a final gross
dividend of R9,10 per share (21% lower compared to the prior year). The final dividend cover was 2,8 times at
30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: 2,7 times).

Solid operational performance supported by continued effective cost management

Operating Business Units

Mining – continued stable operations and unit cost below inflation  

Operating profit increased by 9% to R4 739 million compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of
meaningful contributions from the BPEP and RP levers. Normalised unit costs of production were contained
to 5% below inflation for the second consecutive year. Our Syferfontein colliery produced a South African
record of 11 million tons of production by an underground mine in a financial year. Export coal volumes
decreased by 6% to 3,2 million tons and continued to benefit from the weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate. 

Exploration and Production International – strong Mozambique operations delivery, however rest of
business negatively impacted by low oil and gas prices

Exploration and Production International (E&PI) recorded an operating loss of R11 714 million compared to an
operating loss of R3 170 million in the prior year. Excluding the partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas
operations of R9 882 million (CAD880 million), our E&PI business recorded a loss of R1 832 million.

Our Mozambican operations recorded a profit of R1 128 million compared to a profit of R1 847 million
in the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to translation losses of R673 million. Production volumes
increased by 5% as a result of our efforts to debottleneck the production facility, coupled with the increase
in gas transportation capacity to 169 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) and a full volume offtake by our 
joint electricity operations in Mozambique.

The lower oil price had a significant impact on our Gabon asset resulting in a loss of R994 million compared to
a R1 124 million loss in the prior year, which included the partial impairment of the asset of R1 331 million. The
new development wells which were brought on line during the financial year resulted in a 16% higher average
of 18 824 barrels of oil production per day (on a gross basis) when compared to 16 284 barrels in the prior year. 

Our Canadian shale gas asset in Montney generated an operating loss of R10 957 million, including a partial
impairment of R9 882 million. Excluding the effect of the partial impairment, the loss decreased to R1 075
million compared to R1 153 million in the prior year, mainly due to a lower depreciation rate. Our Canadian
gas production volumes were 5% lower compared to the prior year due to reduced development activities,
driven by lower gas prices. In order to manage the shale gas asset through the low gas price environment, we
concluded an agreement with our partner, Progress Energy, to settle the outstanding funding commitment
of R4 160 million (CAD380 million) and reduce the pace of appraisal, development and drilling activities. An
18-month reduced work programme was approved in June 2016.

Despite the impact of lower gas prices and weaker oil prices affecting the profitability of the business, E&PI
contributed R5,1 billion to Sasol's cash conservation initiatives during the year through reduced capital cash
flow and exploration spend and cash fixed cost savings. 

Strategic Business Units

Performance Chemicals – continued business resilience in a low oil price environment

Operating profit of R11 276 million decreased by 11% compared to the prior year mainly as a result of the
R2 021 million FTWEP impairment reversal in the prior year. Normalising for this impact, operating profit
increased by 5%. Our operating margin reflects the full annual depreciation charge being recognised on
FTWEP, while the project is still ramping up to full production. The increase in operating profit is largely as a
result of the weaker rand coupled with the resilience of the margins in our European surfactants and alcohols
businesses, negated by lower ethylene prices which negatively impacted the margins of our assets in the
US. Production volumes in our Eurasian Operations increased by 4%, while production volumes at our US
Operations remained flat compared to the prior year.

Total sales volumes decreased marginally by 1% compared to the prior year, as a result of planned shutdowns
at our ethylene plant in North America and our production facilities in Sasolburg, and reduced demand for
oilfield chemicals. The decrease in wax and ammonia sales volumes were compensated by an increase of 4%
in organic sales volumes. Normalised sales volumes were up by 1,8%. Normalised cash fixed costs decreased
by 5,2%, in nominal terms, mainly as a result of BPEP and RP initiatives. 

Base Chemicals – margin pressure partly relieved by improved cost performance

Operating profit decreased by 56% to R4 486 million compared to the prior year, and the operating
margin decreased from 26% in the prior year to 13%. Excluding the partial impairment of our low density
polyethylene cash generating unit in the US of R956 million (US$65 million) and R537 million impairment of
our methyl isobutyl ketone business in Sasolburg, and other once-off items, operating profit decreased by
33% to R5 979 million compared to the prior year.

Sales volumes were down by 8% as a result of a planned extended shutdown to enable commissioning
activities associated with the C3 Expansion Project, subdued demand for explosives and fertilizers and
a planned stock build. Normalised sales volumes were down by 2,6%, of which 1% relates to the planned stock 
build. A 22% decrease in our basket of commodity chemical prices was partly negated by the weaker rand/US dollar 
exchange rate. In nominal terms, we reduced our cash fixed costs by 1,5% compared to the prior year, mainly as 
a result of benefits achieved from the BPEP and RP initiatives and a refinement of our cost transfer allocation 
methodology between SBUs. 

Energy – record production volumes and solid cost performance, margins under some pressure

Operating profit of R14 069 million decreased by R8 457 million or 38% compared to the prior year despite a
41% reduction in crude oil prices. Operating margins held firm at 22%, mainly as a result of record production
volumes, higher liquid fuels sales through higher yielding marketing channels, the weaker rand/US dollar
exchange rate and contributions from the BPEP and RP initiatives. Normalised cash fixed costs remained flat
in nominal terms.

The total production of refined product increased by 1% at both SSO and Natref Operations compared to the
prior year. Sales volumes, however, remained flat on the back of challenging market and trading conditions
experienced during the first half of the financial year, driven by lower demand for liquid fuels in Southern
Africa, specifically in the agricultural, mining and manufacturing sectors. Gas sales volumes were 1% higher
compared to the prior year, mainly due to higher methane-rich gas sales to commercial customers. Our share
of the Central Térmica de Ressano Garcia (CTRG) joint operation in Mozambique delivered 653 gigawatt-
hours of electricity.

As a result of the attractive returns generated by Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd over many years, in February 2016 our
black economic empowerment partner, Tshwarisano LFB (which holds 25% of the shares of Sasol Oil (Pty)
Ltd), settled the last remaining portion of its debt relating to its equity shareholding. This represents the
realisation of one of our key objectives over many years to deliver on transformation in the liquid fuels industry.

Energy's share of losses from equity accounted investments of R19 million, declined by R1 442 million
compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower global oil prices. The ORYX GTL facility achieved an average
utilisation rate of 81%, while maintaining a world class safety recordable case rate of 0,0. In Nigeria, the EGTL
plant is still in its ramp-up phase and working towards stable operation to maximise diesel and naphtha
production. A ramp-up in production volumes is expected following the planned shutdown that will occur
during the first half of the 2017 financial year.

During February 2016, in light of the current economic environment, we decided to review our long-term
strategic interest in the Uzbekistan Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) investment. As a result, in April 2016, we decided to
withdraw from our equity participation in the project. This resulted in a net loss of R563 million.

Focusing on the LCCP in the US

Overall construction on the LCCP continues on all fronts, with most engineering activities nearing completion
and procurement well advanced. At 30 June 2016, the capital expenditure was US$4,8 billion, and the
overall project completion was around 50%.

A detailed review on the LCCP confirmed that the total capital cost for the project is expected to be
US$11 billion, which includes site infrastructure and utility improvements. This is an increase of US$2,1 billion
from the original estimate at the time of final investment decision (FID) in October 2014. This estimate
includes a contingency, which measured against industry norms for this stage of project completion, is
considered sufficient to effectively take the project to beneficial operation (BO) within the revised cost
estimate. The schedule has not been impacted by the increase in cost estimate.

The US$2,1 billion capital cost increase is mostly attributable to the following factors, in an approximately
equal proportion:

-  a significant increase in site and civil costs, 50% more weather day delays and much lower field
   productivity;

-  an increase in the home office and construction costs of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction and
   Management Contractor (EPCM); and

-  an increase in labour costs and lump-sum contracts placed at higher rates than estimated.

Notwithstanding these challenges, various other savings opportunities have been identified and are being
implemented to mitigate the increase in the overall capital cost estimate. With the project now over 50%
complete, several changes have been, or are in the process of being, implemented which are intended to
ensure that the project has a good probability of being completed within the updated cost and schedule
guidance. These actions address the root causes of process weaknesses identified during the detailed review
process and include improved productivity and construction readiness that will be achieved through focused
risk management processes, improved phasing of engineering, cost-effective mobilisation of resources
and synchronised workface planning, improved change management practices and key project leadership
personnel changes.

Although unplanned event-driven risks may still impact the execution and cost of the project, we are
confident that the remaining construction, procurement, execution and business readiness risks can be
managed within the estimate as a result of these changes.

Even though the expected capital expenditure for LCCP has increased, we do not expect this to result in the
company exceeding its self-imposed gearing targets. Our funding strategy has not changed as a result of
the higher estimated capital expenditure and the project will continue to be funded from existing facilities
and ongoing group cash flow. Despite the lower expected returns, we still consider the LCCP to be a sound
investment that will return value to our shareholders for many years into the future. Further details are
available in the Investor Fact Sheet on the Sasol website, www.sasol.com.

Advancing other projects to enable future growth

We are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline:

-  Focusing on our asset base in Southern Africa:

   -  Our strategic R14,0 billion mine replacement programme, which will ensure uninterrupted coal supply
      to SSO in order to support Sasol's strategy to operate its Southern African facilities until 2050, is
      nearing completion. The Impumelelo colliery achieved BO during October 2015, within budget. The
      Shondoni colliery achieved BO, within budget, during April 2016.
   
   -  We completed the Secunda growth programme below budget, with actual spend of R13,8 billion. The
      completed projects ensured the full realisation of the envisaged volume and electricity benefits.
   
   -  The expansion of our FT Wax facility in Sasolburg is progressing well. BO for phase two is on track for
      the first half of the 2017 calendar year. The total project cost for both phases remains unchanged at
      R13,6 billion.

   -  Construction of the R2,7 billion Loop Line 2 project on the Mozambique to Secunda Pipeline (MSP) has
      progressed well, following the Final Investment Decision taken during August 2015. Loop Line 2 will
      increase the MSP's annual gas transportation capacity from 169,4 bscf to 191,0 bscf. BO is expected
      to be reached during the first quarter of the 2017 calendar year. The project is on schedule and within
      budget.

   -  As part of Sasol's efforts to grow its interest in Mozambique, a Field Development Plan (FDP)
      was submitted to the Mozambican regulatory authorities in February 2015 for the first phase of
      development of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) licence area. The PSA FDP was approved
      by the Government of Mozambique on 26 January 2016. The first phase of the PSA licence area
      development consists of an integrated oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gas project adjacent
      to the Petroleum Production Agreement area. We also received approval from the Government of
      Mozambique, in January 2016, to develop a fifth train at the Central Processing Facility to process
      additional gas from the PSA licence area. The total estimated project cost for tranche one of the first
      phase of the PSA licence area and the fifth train is estimated at US$1,4 billion. The project is in its early
      stages of execution with the drilling rig proceeding with the 13 well drilling programme.

-  Growing our footprint in North America:

   - Construction of our 50% joint venture high-density polyethylene plant with Ineos Olefins and Polymers USA 
     continues to progress, and is on track for mechanical completion early in the 2017 calendar year.
     Upon completion, the plant will be the largest bi-modal high density polyethylene (HDPE) manufacturing facility 
     in the US with a nameplate capacity of 470 kt annually. Our current approved capital is US$299 million (Sasol share), 
     however, the operator (our joint venture partner) is experiencing more cost and schedule pressure in delivering 
     the project. We continue to work with our joint venture partner to manage these pressures on the project 
     and an update will be provided at the mid-year results announcement. The start-up is also coming at a more opportune 
     time as market conditions remain favourable due to lower feedstock costs along with the premium margins associated 
     with bi-modal resins.

Maintaining our focus on sustainable value creation 

We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the year:

-  Safety remains a top priority for Sasol. Regrettably, we did however experience the loss of two of our
   colleagues during the financial year. Our thoughts remain with these colleagues' families and friends. Our
   safety RCR for employees and service providers, excluding illnesses, improved to 0,29 at 30 June 2016
   (0,32 as at 30 June 2015). We have increased our focus on safety and strive for zero harm.

-  During the year, we invested R1,2 billion in skills development and socioeconomic development, which
   includes our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training programmes. The Ikusasa
   programme focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure, and safety and security in the
   Secunda and Sasolburg regions. We invested R50 million in Secunda and R34 million in Sasolburg during
   the year, with a further R89 million planned for 2017. The total planned Ikusasa investment amounts to
   R800 million.

-  As part of our commitment to communities and the Ikusasa programme, we distributed over 100 new 
   bursaries and scholarships in South Africa, Mozambique and the US. We held the Sasol Techno X expo in 
   South Africa hosting 22 000 learners from 300 schools; invested in artisan training benefitting 60 young 
   people in Mozambique and South Africa; upgraded 3 clinics and constructed 2 new clinics in South Africa and
   Mozambique; upgraded 4 sewer reticulation systems in South Africa; and installed a new electrical
   substation in Secunda. In the US, we initiated monthly certification workshops to enable the local
   community to access business opportunities.

-  While we support the transition to a lower carbon economy, we are concerned that the proposed carbon
   tax in South Africa will diminish the country's competitiveness. It also cannot address the structural
   issues that lie at the heart of the country's greenhouse gas intensity. The proposed design of the carbon
   tax creates substantial regulatory and investment uncertainty as there is insufficient clarity relating to
   the phases of the tax proposed in the draft carbon tax bill, especially post 2020. This is exacerbated by
   the fact that the carbon tax is not aligned with the carbon budget system which is currently in the trial
   phase of implementation. Sasol continues to engage with the South African Government on the carbon
   tax issue.

-  To ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, Sasol applied for
   certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance timeframes. We
   have received decisions on our postponement applications from the National Air Quality Officer, which,
   while aligned with our requests, imposed stretched targets in terms of our atmospheric emission licences.
   Our R2,8 billion volatile organic compound abatement programme remains on track to achieve our
   targeted reductions of volatile organic compounds emissions by 2020.

-  We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response in accordance with our key
   performance indicators. Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally reduced marginally to
   69,3 million tons compared to 69,8 million tons in the prior year. Our GHG emissions intensity (measured
   in carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of production) increased to 3,68 compared to 3,58 (restated) in
   the prior year. GHG targets in South Africa are being developed in conjunction with the South African
   government's process for setting carbon budgets.

-  The 2016 utility Energy Intensity Index (EII) for our operations in South Africa improved by 0,7% from the
   previous year. In accordance with the new National Energy Efficiency Strategy for 2030, Sasol's 2015 fiscal
   year result will be the new baseline for measuring the next 15 years' energy efficiency performance. For
   the 2016 financial year, we excelled beyond our internal target of sustaining the final performance under
   the voluntary Energy Efficiency Accord which came to an end in 2015, demonstrating our commitment to
   continued energy efficiency.

-  During the year, we paid R36,8 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South African government. Sasol
   remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in South Africa, contributing significantly to the country's economy.

-  In 2016, in terms of the Department of Trade and Industry's revised Codes of Good Practice, our B-BBEE
   contributor status declined to level 8 from level 4. We view B-BBEE in South Africa as a business
   imperative and have embarked on a project to realise the goals envisaged by the revised codes by 2020.

Profit outlook* – solid production performance and cost reductions to continue

The current economic climate remains volatile and uncertain. While the outcome of the United Kingdom
referendum, regarding its exit of the European Union, adds a further element of uncertainty and downside
risk to the global economic outlook, we expect moderate global growth to be maintained, with advanced
economies generally performing better than commodity- and oil-exporting nations. In the short-term, high
oil inventory levels are expected to continue weighing on the market, but as more evidence emerges of lower
non-OPEC production, the oil price cycle is likely to turn higher. The extent and timing of this upturn remains
unpredictable. Although the rand showed some resilience in recent months, it is believed that the currency
still faces a number of near-term depreciation risks as the possibility for a sovereign credit downgrade has
not been eliminated, domestic growth prospects remain challenging, and emerging market sentiment is still
fragile. As oil price and foreign exchange movements are outside our control, our focus remains firmly on
managing factors within our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, project execution, effective
capital allocation and cash conservation.

We expect an overall strong operational performance for the 2017 financial year, with:

-  Liquid fuels sales volumes for the Energy SBU in Southern Africa to be approximately 61 million barrels;

-  Base Chemicals and Performance Chemicals sales volumes to be higher than the prior year; 

-  A higher average utilisation rate at ORYX GTL in Qatar of approximately 90%; 

-  Improved utilisation rate at EGTL in Nigeria due to a steady ramp-up;

-  Normalised cash fixed costs to remain in line with SA PPI;

-  The RP cash flow contribution to range between R15 billion and R20 billion;

-  BPEP cash cost savings to achieve an annual run rate of R5,4 billion by financial year 2018;

-  Capital expenditure, including capital accruals, of R75 billion for 2017 and R60 billion in 2018 as we
   progress with the execution of our growth plan and strategy. The LCCP capital spend market guidance has
   been provided in the Investor Fact Sheet available on our website at www.sasol.com. Capital estimates
   may change as a result of exchange rate volatility;

-  Our balance sheet gearing up to a level of between 25% and 35%; 

-  Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$40 and US$50; and

-  Ongoing rand/US dollar volatility due to various factors, including the pending outcome of the next review
   of the South African sovereign credit rating and increased capital inflows resulting from investors seeking higher 
   yields globally, including South Africa.

  standard practice, it is noted that this information has not been reviewed and reported on by the company's auditors.  

Disposal of a business

In April 2016, we decided to withdraw from our equity participation in the Uzbekistan Gas-to-Liquids (GTL)
project, resulting in a loss of R563 million. 

Subsequent events

In August 2016, Sasol completed its detailed review of the LCCP, and confirmed that a high degree of certainty
exists over the capital cost estimated at US$11 billion. The LCCP is more than 50% complete, and after the
implementation of improved change management practices and key project leadership personnel changes,
management remains confident that the project is a sound strategic investment that will return value to our shareholders.

Competition law compliance

The South African Competition Commission is conducting continued proceedings against various petroleum
products producers, including Sasol. The Competition Commission is conducting an investigation into Sasol's
South African polymer business, and it is finalising a market inquiry in the South African LPG market. We
continue to interact and co-operate with the South African Commission in respect of the subject matter of
current leniency applications brought by Sasol, as well as in the areas that are subject to the Commission's
investigations. To the extent appropriate, further announcements will be made in future.

Appointment of Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers and change in directors

Mr David Constable resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer on 30 June 2016. Mr Bongani Nqwababa
and Mr Stephen Cornell were appointed Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers of the company, and Mr
Paul Victor as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director, with effect from 1 July 2016. On 4 December 2015,
Prof Jürgen Schrempp retired as a Director and Mr Henk Dijkgraaf was appointed as Lead Independent
Director. Mr Manuel Cuambe was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 June 2016. The company 
hereby announces that Ms Nolitha Fakude will resign as Executive Director and Executive Vice President: Strategy 
and Sustainability with effect from 31 December 2016.

Publication of 2016 Annual Financial Statements and supplementary information
 
The annual financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2016, prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, have been posted, together with other additional information for analysts, on the

Declaration of cash dividend number 74

A final gross cash dividend of South African 910,00 cents per ordinary share has been declared for the financial
year ended 30 June 2016. The cash dividend is payable on the ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary
shares. The Board is satisfied that the liquidity and solvency of the company, as well as capital remaining
after payment of the dividend is sufficient to support the current operations. The dividend has been declared
out of retained earnings (income reserves). The South African dividend withholding tax rate is 15%. At the
declaration date, there are 651 389 516 ordinary (including 8 809 886 treasury shares), 25 547 081 Sasol 
preferred ordinary and 2 838 565 Sasol BEE ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to 
shareholders who are not exempt from the dividend withholding tax, is 773,50 cents per share, while the 
dividend amount payable to shareholders who are exempt from dividend withholding tax is 910,00 cents per share.

Basis of preparation 

The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited's
(JSE) Listing Requirements for summary financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies
Act applicable to summary financial statements. The JSE requires summary financial statements to be
prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements
of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain
the information required by IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The summarised consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosure required for complete
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. These summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the historic cost convention except that certain items, including derivative instruments, liabilities
for cash-settled share-based payment schemes, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and
available-for-sale financial assets, are stated at fair value. The summarised consolidated financial statements
are presented in South African rand, which is Sasol Limited's functional and presentation currency. The
accounting policies applied in the preparation of these summarised consolidated financial statements are in
terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the consolidated annual financial statements for the
year ended 30 June 2016. The summarised consolidated financial statements appearing in this announcement
are the responsibility of the directors. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the
summarised consolidated financial statements. Paul Victor CA(SA), Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for
this set of summarised consolidated financial statements and has supervised the preparation thereof in
conjunction with the Senior Vice President: Financial Control Services, Brenda Baijnath CA(SA).

Related party transactions

The group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions on an
arm's length basis at market rates with related parties. 

Financial Instruments

Fair value

The group does not hold any financial instruments traded in an active market, except for the investment
in listed equity instruments. Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined below. Where
possible, inputs are based on quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair value hierarchy 

The following table is provided representing the assets and liabilities measured at fair value at reporting date,
or for which fair value is disclosed at 30 June 2016. The calculation of fair value requires various inputs into
the valuation methodologies used. The source of the inputs used affects the reliability and accuracy of the
valuations. Significant inputs have been classified into the hierarchical levels in line with IFRS 13, Fair Value
Measurement, as shown below:

Level 1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or indirectly).
Level 3     Inputs for the asset or liability that are unobservable.

Outcome of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project review

On 6 June 2016, Sasol announced the preliminary findings of
the detailed review of the Lake Charles Chemical Project
(LCCP), which was initiated in March 2016. The review has been
completed, and involved a verification of the details and
quantities of approximately 60 000 individual line items,
based on actual costs, detailed engineering, benchmarking
against other projects as well as actual field construction
productivity factors. These factors were then combined with
the updated execution strategy to prepare an updated project
cost and schedule. An independent third party review of the
estimate has also been carried out.

The LCCP consists of a world-scale 1,5 million ton per year
ethane cracker, and six downstream chemical units – two large
polymers plants (low-density and linear low-density
polyethylene) and an ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plant,
which together will consume around two thirds of the ethylene
produced by the cracker; and three smaller, higher-value
derivative plants, which will produce specialty alcohols,
ethoxylates and other products. The project is under
construction near Lake Charles, Louisiana in the USA, adjacent
to Sasol’s existing chemical operations.

The detailed review has confirmed that the total capital cost
for the project is expected to be US$11 billion, which
includes site infrastructure and utility improvements. This is
an increase of $2,1 billion from the original estimate at the
time of final investment decision (FID) in October 2014. This
estimate includes a contingency, which measured against
industry norms for this stage of project completion, we
consider being sufficient to effectively take the project to
beneficial operation within the revised cost estimate. At 30
June 2016, the capital expenditure to date on LCCP was $4,8
billion, and the overall project completion was around 50%.
The schedule for LCCP remains the same as communicated on 6
June 2016. The first unit, the linear low-density polyethylene
unit, is expected to achieve beneficial operation in the
second half of calendar year 2018, which will be followed by
the ethane cracker and ethylene oxide and mono ethylene glycol
units later that year, with the low-density polyethylene unit
shortly thereafter. This will result in over 80% of the total
output from LCCP reaching beneficial operation by early 2019.
The remaining derivative units will reach beneficial operation
by the second half of 2019.

An investor fact sheet for the LCCP has been compiled, which
contains more granular information pertaining to the outcome
of the project review as well as updated capital cost, cash
flow, schedule execution, key project assumptions and other
relevant project information. The investor fact sheet is
posted under the LCCP tab in the Investor Centre section of
the Sasol website, www.sasol.com. Please note that any forward
looking information contained in this investor fact sheet has
not been reviewed or reported on by Sasol’s external auditors.

The detailed review process has confirmed that the $2,1
billion capital cost increase is mostly attributable to the
following factors, in an approximately equal proportion:

  *   a significant increase in site and civil costs due to
      much more ground works required to establish the site
      compared to what was estimated at FID as a result of
      poorer than anticipated subsurface conditions, 50 % more
      weather day delays over the site construction period
      compared to the average norm, and much lower field
      productivity resulting from a conscious decision to
      proceed with out-of-sequence site preparation activities
      while waiting for a variation of permit conditions to be
      granted. Site and civil works are now substantially
      complete;

  *   an increase in the home office and construction costs of
      the Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Management
      Contractor (EPCm) mainly as a result of a increase in
      contractor wage rates compared to what were assumed at
      FID, lower engineering productivity, and an increase in
      contractor engineering hours as a result of the increased
      material quantities; and
  *   an increase in labour costs as a result of higher
      quantities of material for installation, the decision to
      change to a higher-skilled and thus higher cost crew mix
      to enable planned labour productivity improvements for
      the remainder of the project, and lump-sum contracts
      placed at higher rates than estimated.

Notwithstanding these challenges, various other savings
opportunities have been identified and are being implemented
to mitigate the increase in the overall capital cost estimate.

With the project now over 50% complete, several changes have
been, or are in the process of being, implemented which are
intended to ensure that the project has a good probability of
being completed within the updated capital cost estimate of
$11 billion. Mitigation actions to ensure successful project
delivery, amongst others, include improved productivity and
construction readiness that will be achieved through focused
risk management processes, improved phasing of engineering,
cost-effective mobilisation of resources and synchronised
workface planning; improved change management practices; and
key project leadership personnel changes.

Although unplanned event-driven risks may still impact the
execution and cost of the project, we are confident that the
remaining construction, procurement, execution and business
readiness risks can be managed within the estimate as a result
of these changes.

Even though the expected capital expenditure for LCCP has
increased, we do not expect this to result in the Company
exceeding its self-imposed gearing targets. Details of the
project’s updated funding requirements have been included in
the LCCP investor fact sheet. Sasol will be publishing its
2016 financial year results on 12 September 2016, and will
provide an update on the group’s gearing levels and funding
plans at that time. The cash savings that have been achieved
from the Company’s low oil price Response Plan, and the cost
savings resulting from the Business Performance Enhancement
Programme, are both well ahead of previously communicated
targets.

The expected returns from the LCCP have also been updated,
taking into account our updated oil, natural gas and
petrochemical price forecasts as well as the revised cost and
schedule resulting from the review process. On an unlevered
basis, the returns from LCCP are expected to be slightly above
the Company’s US dollar weighted average cost of capital of
8%, although below the returns expected at the time of FID in
October 2014. We still consider the LCCP to be a sound
strategic investment that will return value to our
shareholders for many years into the future. Key project
assumptions, value contribution development and sensitivities
have been included in the LCCP investor fact sheet.

An impairment review, in conjunction with the preparation of
our annual financial statements, has been completed as a
result of the changes in macro-economic assumptions as well as
the expected increase in the LCCP capital cost estimate. In
terms of International Financial Reporting Standards, the
derivative units are separately tested for impairment. An
impairment of $65 million has been recognised for our 2016
financial year pertaining to the low-density polyethylene
unit.

The Chairman of the Sasol Limited Board of directors, Dr
Mandla Gantsho, said “The Lake Charles Chemicals Project is an
important part of Sasol’s prudent growth strategy, and the
substantial increase in the estimated capital cost has been an
issue of concern. The detailed project review was therefore
critical. We have taken decisive action to address the issues
raised and have learned lessons for the benefit of future
projects. This project still represents a world-scale
chemicals facility, based on a sustainable feedstock cost
advantage, and remains a value accretive pillar of our future
business.""

Sasol will be hosting a conference call at 15:00 South African
time (09:00 Eastern time) on 24 August 2016 to discuss this
announcement, which will be webcast via Sasol’s website

Optimisation of Annual Financial Statements - SENS Announcement

Dear Stakeholder,

Since the implementation of our new operating model in 2014, we have
optimised and integrated our operations along a single value chain and
streamlined our processes and ways of working. To reflect the new
operating model and bring greater focus and increased simplicity to
how Sasol is structured and managed, we have overhauled our Annual
Financial Statements (AFS) to better reflect the way the business is
managed and improve shareholder accessibility and understanding of our
financial results. We have also purposefully focused on the disclosure
of material items to assist with clarity, as well as removing
duplicate disclosures.

The new structure of the AFS will align with the Report of the Group
Chief Financial Officer, and together will provide a full overview of
the results, in the context of our business strategy, while enabling
more effective analysis of the Group’s performance. This change in the
AFS is also in line with global trends in financial reporting, which
have been signaled over recent months by industry bodies and
authorities to improve financial reporting in simpler, more accessible
formats for shareholders.

The AFS has been re-organised and will be presented along the
following focus areas:

   - Earnings – focuses on earnings generated from our operations and
     taxation;
   - Sources of Capital – funding our business through equity and
     debt;
   - Capital allocation and utilisation – investments and effective
     capital management to fuel future growth;
   - Provisions and reserves; and
   - Other disclosures – financial risk management and mandatory
     disclosures required by the regulators.

Simultaneously, we are also implementing an Early Reporting project
with the objective of releasing our 2017 financial results two weeks
earlier into the market. The streamlined AFS will assist us in meeting
the earlier reporting timelines and integrate the Analyst Book into
one publication.

A template with the restructured AFS has been developed to assist
shareholders and readers to familiarise themselves with the new
format, prior to publication in September 2016. This unaudited
template is available for download from our Investor Centre on the
Company’s website at http://www.sasol.com/investor-
centre/reporting/annual-financial-statements/new-template

Important to note is that the template is subject to change as we
finalise the results for financial year 2016. The template includes
previously disclosed financial information pertaining to financial
years 2014 and 2015. The AFS for financial year 2016 will be available
in this format when we release our results early in September 2016.

Queries and further questions regarding the new and optimised
structure of the Annual Financial Statements shown in the template,
can be directed to Sasol Investor Relations at

Preliminary findings of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project
review

In March 2016, Sasol announced that it would be undertaking a
detailed review of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP),
after deciding to pace the execution of the project to support
the Company’s low oil price Response Plan. At that time, there
were early indications that the overall end-of-job cost was
under pressure, and since the project engineering was at an
advanced stage, sufficient information was available to
proceed with a detailed project review.

The LCCP consists of a world-scale 1,5 million ton per year
ethane cracker, and six downstream chemical projects – two
large polymers plants (low-density and linear low-density
polyethylene) and an ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plant,
which together will consume around two thirds of the ethylene
produced by the cracker; and three smaller, higher-value
derivative plants, which will produce speciality alcohols,
ethoxylates and other products. The project is under
construction near Lake Charles, Louisiana in the USA, adjacent
to Sasol’s current chemical operations.

A preliminary finding from the ongoing detailed LCCP review is
that the expected total capital expenditure for the project
could increase up to US$11 billion, including site
infrastructure and utility improvements. This estimate
includes a sufficient contingency to effectively manage the
project to beneficial operation. While the detailed review is
still in progress, current indications are that the estimated
capital expenditure increase is mostly due to construction
delays caused by higher-than-expected rainfall, higher labour
costs, certain of the lump-sum bid contract prices being
higher than originally estimated, as well as quantities of
bulk materials being in excess of those included in the
original estimate.
In addition, the slower rate of capital spend until June 2018,
due to Sasol’s low oil price Response Plan, has resulted in an
extended project schedule and contributed to further project
cost increases, which have been partially offset by
productivity benefits due to improved phasing of engineering
and construction activities. As of 30 April 2016, the capital
expenditure to date on LCCP is US$4,5 billion, and the overall
project completion has progressed beyond 40%.

It is, however, important to emphasise that no material or
unexpected scope changes to the project have taken place.
Overall construction on the project continues on all fronts,
with most engineering activities nearing completion and
procurement well advanced.

As the review progresses and additional information becomes
available, management is setting firm targets and objectives
for the project team in order to minimise the capital
expenditure and optimise the overall project schedule. It is,
however, expected that the ethane cracker will achieve
beneficial operation in the second half of calendar year 2018,
which will enable around 80% of the total output from LCCP to
reach beneficial operation later in 2018 and early 2019. The
remaining volumes from the other derivative units will reach
beneficial operation by the second half of 2019.

The expected returns for the project have reduced due to
changes in long-term price assumptions and the higher capital
estimates, and are now expected to be around Sasol’s weighted
average cost of capital, compared to returns approximating
hurdle rate at the time of Final Investment Decision in
October 2014. The increase in the estimated LCCP capital cost
and extended schedule will reduce the expected project returns
by approximately the same amount as the Company’s lower long-
term price assumptions.

Although the capital expenditure for LCCP is expected to
increase, Sasol does not expect this to result in the Company
exceeding its self-imposed gearing targets. The Company is
continuing with its previously announced low oil price
Response Plan, and will manage its balance sheet to
incorporate the current estimated capital expenditure. The
funding strategy has not changed as a result of the higher
capital expenditure estimates. The project will continue to be
funded from existing facilities and ongoing group cash flow.
The detailed LCCP review is expected to be completed during
the third quarter of 2016, and further details will be
communicated together with Sasol’s annual results announcement
on 12 September 2016.

Sasol will be hosting a conference call at 14:00 South African

this announcement, which will be webcast via Sasol’s website

Trading statement for the financial year ending 30 June 2016

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are
required to publish a trading statement as soon as they are
satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the
financial results for the period to be reported will differ by
at least 20% from the financial results for the previous
corresponding period.

Sasol´s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the financial
year ending 30 June 2016 are expected to decrease by between 10%
and 30% (approximating R4,98 to R14,93 per share) compared to
the 2015 financial year (comparable period) HEPS of R49,76.
Earnings per share (EPS) for the same period are expected to
decrease by between 53% and 73% (approximating R25,82 to R35,56
per share) from the comparable period EPS of R48,71.

The volatile macroeconomic environment, in particular lower
crude oil prices, has had a significant impact on earnings. EPS
was further impacted by the R7,4 billion (CAD665 million)
impairment of our share in the Montney shale gas asset
recognised in December 2015. Due to a further decline of natural
gas prices in North America, we will recognise an additional
impairment of approximately R4,1 billion (CAD340 million),
resulting in a total impairment of R11,5 billion. This
impairment contributed to a 39% decrease of EPS.

We expect production volumes and cost reductions to be better
than our previous guidance. Further details on our operational
and financial performance will be provided in a trading update
in early August 2016.
The current volatile market conditions may however further
impact our results, particularly changes in oil, product prices
and movements in the rand/dollar exchange rate.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's
external auditors. Sasol's financial results for the financial
year ending 30 June 2016 will be announced on Monday, 12
September 2016.

Overview*
Steering through volatile markets 
We continued to maintain momentum by focusing on factors within our control, and delivered a strong set of 
production volumes across most of the value chain, despite the turbulent macroeconomic environment.
The first half of the 2016 financial year was characterised by a further steep decline in international oil
and commodity chemical prices, driven mainly by global economic uncertainty in certain key markets and
softer demand. Oil prices decreased by 47%, given oil supply concerns and a lack of clear signals from the
Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in rebalancing the global oil market. Commodity chemical
prices were also lower due to depressed oil prices and poor demand in some key markets. The average
basket of commodity chemical prices, however, only decreased by 23% in comparison to the 47% decrease
in oil prices. Margins for speciality chemicals remained resilient, despite ongoing market volatility. The rand/
US dollar exchange rate, on the other hand, weakened by 24% due to negative market sentiment over the
South African economy and dollar strength compared to most emerging market currencies. The weaker rand
provided a partial buffer against lower oil and commodity chemical prices.

Importantly, we also achieved much higher sustainable cost savings than forecasted from our Business Performance
Enhancement Programme (BPEP). Our low oil price Response Plan (RP) achieved actual cash conservation
benefits ahead of our internal targets. We have updated the scope and extended our RP targets through to the
2018 financial year in anticipation of a lower oil price environment. 

Maintaining momentum
President and Chief Executive Officer, David E. Constable says:
""The decisive actions taken to reposition Sasol through our Business Performance Enhancement Programme,
and our low oil price Response Plan, place the organisation in a good position to maintain a strong
operational performance, despite the challenging and volatile energy landscape. Given a 'lower-for-much-
longer' oil price scenario, we have intensified and extended the scope of our Response Plan, by derisking and
rephasing certain projects, while prioritising capital for the advancement of our growth projects in Southern
Africa and the United States (US).

Over the next three months, my successors and I will continue to work through a detailed handover plan to
ensure a smooth leadership transition.  I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to my Sasol colleagues,
the members of the Sasol Limited Board and our business partners who, through their performance,
dedication and commitment, have ensured that we continue to deliver shareholder value for the benefit of all
our stakeholders.""

Financial results overview
Earnings attributable to shareholders for the six months ended 31 December 2015 decreased by 63% to
R7,3 billion from R19,5 billion in the prior period. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 24% to
R24,28, and earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 63% to R11,97 compared to the prior period. 

Profit from operations of R14,9 billion decreased by 50%, compared to the prior period on the back of
challenging and highly volatile global markets. Average Brent crude oil prices moved dramatically lower
by 47% compared to the prior period (average dated Brent was US$47 per barrel (/b) for the six months
ended 31 December 2015 compared to US$89/b in the prior period). Furthermore, the price of our basket
of commodity chemical prices declined by 23% compared to the prior period. The impact of lower oil
and commodity chemical prices was partly offset by a 24% weaker average rand/US dollar exchange rate
(R13,62/US$ for the six months ended 31 December 2015 compared with R10,99/US$ in the prior period).
The average margin for our speciality chemicals remained resilient compared to the prior period.

Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to deliver a strong operational
performance, with increased production volumes and cost increases contained to well below inflation.

The highlights of our operational performance can be summarised as follows:
-  Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) production volumes increased by 3% (1 million barrels) compared to
   the prior period;
-  Total liquid fuels production for the Energy Business increased by 4% (1,1 million barrels) compared to the
   prior period, as a result of a higher portion of SSO's volumes being utilised by the Energy Business;
-  The ORYX GTL facility continued to deliver a solid performance, with an average utilisation rate of 90% for
   the period;
-  Secunda Chemicals and Sasolburg Operations' production volumes remained in line with the prior period.
   The increase in volumes from our Fischer-Tropsch Wax Expansion Project (FTWEP) was offset by lower
   polypropylene (C3) volumes, due to planned commissioning activities associated with the C3 Expansion
   Project;
-  Sales volumes for the Base Chemicals Business decreased by 13%, given lower C3 volumes available as
   a result of the commissioning of the C3 Expansion Project and softer demand for certain commodity
   chemical products; and
-  Sales volumes from our Performance Chemicals Business, normalised for the planned shutdown at our
   ethylene plant in North America, remained consistent with the prior period.

In addition, Sasol's profitability was further impacted by the following notable once-off and significant items:
-  net remeasurement items expense of R7,6 billion compared to a R0,2 billion expense in the prior
   period. These items relate mainly to a partial impairment of our share in the Montney shale gas asset
   of R7,4 billion (CAD665 million), due to a further deterioration of conditions in the North American gas
   market resulting in a 16% decline in forecasted natural gas prices. The impairment reduces the carrying
   value of the asset to approximately CAD559 million. This asset remains highly sensitive to changes in
   the gas price and accordingly, we estimate that a 5% change in the gas price may result in a change of
   CAD255 million (approximately R2,9 billion) in the recoverable amount of the asset;
-  a cash-settled share-based payment charge to the income statement of R0,4 billion compared to a credit
   of R2,9 billion in the prior period; and
-  the reversal of a provision of R2,3 billion (US$166 million) based on a favourable ruling received from the
   Tax Appeal Tribunal in Nigeria relating to the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (EGTL) investment. The Nigerian
   Federal Inland Revenue Service has appealed the decision. The outcome of the appeal process is uncertain,
   and a possible obligation may arise as a result of any future proceedings. At this time, the value of any
   potential future obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.

We continued to drive our cost containment programme and reduced our cash fixed costs by 4,5% in nominal
terms compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of inflation, exchange rates and once-off costs, our
cash fixed costs reduced by an exceptional 8,4%. This was achieved by an accelerated sustainable delivery of
our BPEP and RP programmes.

Our company-wide BPEP, which is aimed at delivering sustainable cost savings of R4,3 billion by the end of the 
2016 financial year, is nearing its completion. We delivered actual cost savings up to 31 December 2015
of R3,1 billion, which are on track to meet our savings target forecast of R4,0 billion, at an annual 
exit run rate of R4,3 billion by the end of financial year 2016. Implementation costs amounted to R132 million 
for the period compared to R1,9 billion for the 2015 financial year. Given an ongoing low oil price
environment, we have revised our BPEP savings target to achieve sustainable savings at an exit run rate of
R5 billion by the end of the 2017 financial year. Cost trends are still forecast to track SA PPI from the 
2017 financial year.

Our comprehensive RP, focusing on cash conservation to counter the lower-for-longer oil price environment,
has continued to yield positive cash savings in line with our 2016 financial year targets, despite margin
contraction and difficulties in placing product in the market. The RP realised R10,8 billion in cash savings for
the period, and we anticipate achieving the upper end of our 2016 financial year guided range of R10 billion
to R16 billion. The RP places Sasol in a strong position to operate profitably within a US$45-50/b oil price
environment. However, against the backdrop of a US$30/b oil price, we updated and extended the scope
of the RP to run through at least to the end of the 2018 financial year, ensuring continued balance sheet
strength and earnings resilience at notably lower oil price scenarios. We also increased the cash savings
target range from R30 billion to R50 billion to between R65 billion and R75 billion. Most of the benefits will
be delivered from the existing RP work streams. In addition, we expect our sustainable cash cost savings to
increase to R1,5 billion by the 2019 financial year, up R500 million from the previous guidance. 

Our full time equivalent sustainable headcount reduction as a result of the BPEP amounts to approximately 9,2% 
or 3 092 employees through voluntary separations, voluntary early retirements and natural attrition, and nearly 
23% or 13 000 service provider employees. Implementation of the RP has also resulted in headcount reductions, 
not all of which will be sustainable in the longer term, from organisational structure refinements and the freezing 
of non-critical vacancies. These reductions amount to approximately an additional 5,3% or 1 798 employees, 
which amounts to a total headcount reduction of 14,3% or 4 900 full time equivalents.

The increase in the effective corporate tax rate from 31,8% to 43,1% was mainly as a result of the R7,4 billion
(CAD665 million) partial impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets, partly offset by the reversal of a
provision of R2,3 billion (US$166 million) based on a favourable ruling received from the Tax Appeal Tribunal in
Nigeria relating to the EGTL Project. The normalised effective tax rate of 32,9% increased by 0,3% compared
to the prior period. The approval of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in Mozambique will have a
positive impact on our effective tax rate; however, the amount will be dependent on the gas price. A lower
gas price will result in fewer reserves being recognised and a decrease in future taxable income. The impact of
the PSA Project will be confirmed in our year-end results, since the approval was only granted after the half
year-end close.

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 21% to R26,7 billion compared with R34,0 billion in the prior 
period. Despite reduced cash flows, our balance sheet has the capacity to lever up as we continue to execute our 
growth plans and return value to shareholders. To manage the volatility and a 'lower-for-much-longer' oil price 
environment, the Sasol Limited board of directors (Board) temporarily lifted our internal gearing ceiling to 44% 
until the end of the 2018 financial year. 

Our assets and liabilities were significantly impacted by the weaker average rand/US dollar exchange rate, resulting 
in higher than expected translation differences. Actual capital expenditure during the period amounted to R33,6 billion. 
Loans raised during the period amounted to R19,2 billion, mainly for the funding of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project. 
Our net cash position increased by 15%, from R53 billion in June 2015 to R61 billion as at 31 December 2015, driven 
largely by our cash conservation initiatives and the favourable impact of the rand/US dollar translation effects.

Our dividend policy is a dividend cover range based on HEPS. Taking into account the current volatile
macroeconomic environment, capital investment plans, our cash conservation initiative, the current strength
of our balance sheet, and the dividend cover range, the Board has declared an interim dividend of R5,70 per 
share (18,6% lower compared to the prior period). The interim dividend cover was 4,3 times at 31 December 2015 
(31 December 2014: 4,6 times).

* All comparisons refer to the prior period for the six months ended 31 December 2014. Except for earnings 
  attributable to shareholders and the RP cash conservation measures, all numbers are quoted on a pre-tax basis.

Strong operational performance supported by continued effective cost management

Operating Business Units

Mining – stable operations with cash unit costs below inflation 
Profit from operations increased by 5% to R2 359 million compared to the prior period, mainly as a result of
meaningful contributions from the BPEP and RP levers, and stable mining operations. Normalised mining unit
costs of production were contained to 4% below inflation. Export coal volumes remained flat and this market
continued to benefit from the weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate, which was partially negated by lower
dollar-based coal prices.
 
Exploration and Production International – negatively impacted by low oil and gas prices
Exploration and Production International (E&PI) recorded a loss from operations of R8 289 million compared
to a loss from operations of R1 748 million in the prior period. Excluding the partial impairment of our
Canadian shale gas operations of R7 436 million (CAD665 million), our E&PI businesses recorded a loss of
R853 million.

Our Mozambican operations recorded a profit of R437 million compared to R930 million in the prior
period. The decrease mainly relates to translation losses of R608 million. Production volumes increased by
8% as a result of our efforts to debottleneck the production facility, coupled with a full volume offtake by our
joint electricity operations in Mozambique. The lower oil price had a significant impact on our Gabon assets
resulting in a loss of R512 million compared to R1 144 million in the prior period, which included the partial
impairment of the asset of R1 331 million. Oil production in Gabon was 26% higher than the prior period and
averaged 19 100 barrels of oil per day.

Our Canadian shale gas assets generated a loss from operations of R7 769 million, including an impairment
of R7 436 million. Excluding the effect of the impairment, the loss decreased to R333 million compared to
R584 million in the prior period, mainly due to a lower depreciation rate. Our Canadian gas volumes were
lower compared to the prior period due to reduced development activities, driven by lower oil and gas prices.

Despite the impact of lower gas prices and weaker oil prices affecting the profitability of the business, E&PI
were able to contribute more than R2,7 billion to Sasol's cash conservation initiatives during the current
period through reduced capital cash flow, a cutback in exploration activities and increased cash fixed cost
savings. As a result of the 'lower-for-much-longer' oil and gas prices, further cash conservation initiatives are
being considered and will be communicated to the market once confirmed.

Strategic Business Units
Energy – record production volumes and solid cost performance while margins under some pressure
Profit from operations of R10 261 million decreased by R4 557 million or 31% compared to the prior
period despite a 47% decrease in oil prices. Operating margins held firm at 31%, mainly as a result of record
production levels, favourable product differentials and contributions from the BPEP and RP initiatives.
Normalised cash fixed costs remained flat in nominal terms.

In Southern Africa, our Energy Strategic Business Unit's (SBU) profitability was enhanced by a 6% increase
in refined product volumes from SSO and a 1% increase in production volumes from our Natref operations
compared with the prior period. A weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate and higher refining margins further
mitigated the impact of the 47% decrease in oil prices for the period under review. Sales volumes, on the
other hand, decreased by 1% on the back of difficult market and trading conditions experienced in December
2015, driven by lower demand for liquid fuels in Southern Africa. Lower working capital levels are forecast by
the end of the 2016 financial year. 

Gas sales were 3% higher compared to the prior period, mainly due to higher methane-rich gas sales to
commercial customers. Our share of the Central Térmica de Ressano Garcia joint operation in Mozambique
delivered 327 858 megawatt-hours of electricity.

The Energy SBU's share of profit from equity accounted investments of R409 million was R887 million
or 68% lower than in the prior period. This was primarily due to lower oil prices for the period. The ORYX
GTL plant achieved an average utilisation rate of 90%, while maintaining a world class safety RCR of 0,0.
In Nigeria, the EGTL plant continues to steadily ramp up towards design capacity.

In light of the current economic environment, in February 2016, we decided to review our long-term strategic
interest in the Uzbekistan GTL investment. The review is expected to be completed in the second half
of the 2016 financial year.

Base Chemicals – margin pressure partly relieved by a solid cost performance
Profit from operations decreased by 45% to R3 178 million compared to the prior period and the operating
margin decreased by 8% to 19%. Sales volumes were down by 13% as a result of an extended planned
shutdown to enable commissioning activities associated with the C3 Expansion Project, as well as softer
demand for certain commodity chemical products. A 23% decrease in our basket of commodity chemical
prices was partly negated by the weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate. Cash fixed costs decreased by 11%
in nominal terms, mainly as a result of significant benefits achieved from the BPEP and RP initiatives and a
refinement of our cost transfer allocation methodology between SBUs.

Performance Chemicals – normalised sales volumes flat coupled with resilient average gross margins
Profit from operations of R5 161 million decreased by 30% compared to the prior period mainly as a result of
the R1 336 million FTWEP impairment reversal in the prior period. Our operating margin was under pressure
due to depreciation being recognised on FTWEP for the full period, while the project is still ramping up to
full production. Profit from operations on a normalised basis decreased by 15%. This decrease is largely as
a result of lower US ethylene prices which negatively impacted the profitability of our assets in the US. Our
margins in the surfactant and alcohol business, however, remained very resilient when compared to the crude
oil price over the same period. Production volumes in our Eurasian Operations increased by 5% while our US
Operations reported a 12% decrease in production as a result of a planned shutdown. Total sales volumes
decreased marginally by 1% compared to the prior period, as a result of reduced demand for oilfield chemicals
and the planned shutdown at our ethylene plant in North America. Normalised cash fixed costs were
maintained well below inflation as a result of BPEP and RP activities.

Advancing projects to enable future growth
We are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline:
-  Focusing on our Operating Business Units (OBUs) which secure our feedstock supply:
   –  The establishment of the Impumelelo and Shondoni collieries, which are part of our Mining OBU's
      R14,0 billion mine replacement programme, will ensure uninterrupted coal supply to SSO. The
      Impumelelo colliery achieved beneficial operation (BO) during October 2015, within budget, despite
      various project delays. The development of the Shondoni colliery continues to progress steadily and
      we expect to achieve BO, within budget, during the first half of the 2016 calendar year.

   –  In January 2016, we obtained approval from the Mozambique Council of Ministers for a Field
      Development Plan that will see further hydrocarbon resources developed to support our Southern
      Africa growth drivers. The first phase of the PSA licence area development proposes an integrated
      oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gas project adjacent to the Petroleum Production Agreement
      area. To expand our operations in Mozambique, we also received approval from the Government of
      Mozambique, in January 2016, to develop a fifth train at the Central Processing Facility to process
      additional gas from the PSA licence area. The total project cost for tranche one of the first phase of the
      PSA licence area and the fifth train is estimated at US$1,4 billion.

-  Progressing our growth projects within our Strategic Business Units (SBUs):
   Expanding our asset base in South Africa
   –  The R14,2 billion Secunda growth programme is nearing completion with 17 of the 19 projects achieving
      BO. The completed projects ensured the full realisation of the envisaged volume and electricity
      benefits. The remaining two projects are smaller environmental enablers and are expected to reach BO
      during the first half of the 2016 calendar year.

   –  The expansion of our wax facility in Sasolburg is progressing well, with phase one achieving BO during
      May 2015. BO for phase two is on track to take place during the first half of the 2017 calendar year. The
      total project cost for both phases remains unchanged at R13,6 billion.
   Growing our interest in Mozambique
   –  The final investment decision was taken to progress with the R2,7 billion Loop Line 2 Project on the
      Mozambique to Secunda pipeline, during August 2015. This will increase gas transportation capacity
      from 169,4 bscf to 191 bscf. BO is expected to be reached during the second half of the 2016 calendar
      year.
   Growing our footprint in North America
   –  The Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) is progressing. The engineering and procurement are at an advanced stage 
      and site construction, mostly civil related, has fully commenced. We had some initial challenges associated with 
      ground work due to the very heavy rainfall in 2015 and the regulatory need to relocate a small waterway. Cost control 
      remains a primary focus for the team. Given the uncertain economic environment, we have taken a decision to pace the 
      execution of the LCCP to support the Response Plan. This shift in schedule will also give us the opportunity to further 
      optimise field efficiency. Our current view is that BO of some smaller derivative units will move into calendar year 2019 
      and the overall end-of-job project cost estimate will remain under pressure. A detailed review of the project cost and 
      schedule is underway and likely to be completed by mid-calendar year 2016.

   –  Construction of our 50% joint venture high-density polyethylene plant with Ineos Olefins & 
      Polymers USA continues to make good progress, and is on track for completion in the second half of the 2016
      calendar year. Upon completion, the plant will be the largest HDPE manufacturing facility in the US and
      is expected to produce 470 kilotons annually. We continue to work with our joint venture partner to 
      manage cost pressures as our initial estimates indicate a possible 5% to 10% increase to the original
      end-of-job cost.
   
   –  In response to the lower gas market price, we have agreed with our partner, Progress Energy, to reduce
      drilling activities and capital expenditure in Canada. In terms of the annual work programme, we
      expect to spend CAD382 million in the next calendar year, of which CAD161 million relates to the carry
      obligation. Further evaluation is currently underway with the optimisation of the capital spend being
      considered. 

Maintaining our focus on sustainable value creation 
We continued to deliver on our broader sustainability and community contributions during the period:
-  Safety remains a top priority for Sasol. Our operations continue to make steady progress in the reduction
   of process safety incidents. The safety incident RCR for employees and service providers globally,
   excluding illnesses, remained stable at 0,32 for the first six months of the year when compared to the
   previous year (0,32 as at 30 June 2015). As at 31 December 2015, our workforce worked 15 months without
   a fatality.
-  For the six months ended 31 December 2015, we paid R18,1 billion in direct and indirect taxes to the South
   African government. Sasol remains one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, contributing
   significantly to the local economy.
-  During the period, we invested R394 million in skills development and socio-economic development,
   which includes investments in our Ikusasa programme, bursaries, learnerships and artisan training
   programmes. As part of our commitment to the communities in which we operate, our Ikusasa
   programme focuses on education, health and wellbeing, infrastructure and safety and security in the
   Secunda and Sasolburg regions.
-  While we support the transition to a lower carbon economy, we are concerned that the proposed
   carbon tax does not address the structural issues that lie at the heart of the country's greenhouse
   gas intensity. The proposed design of the carbon tax creates substantial regulatory and investment
   uncertainty as there is insufficient clarity relating to the phases of the tax proposed in the draft carbon
   tax bill, especially post 2020. In our view, South Africa needs appropriate incentives to invest in new, more
   energy efficient processes and projects that will improve our energy security and maintain our global
   competitiveness. Sasol continues to engage with the South African Government on the carbon tax issue.
-  To ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, Sasol applied for
   certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance timeframes. We
   have received decisions on our postponement applications from the National Air Quality Officer, which,
   while aligned with our requests, imposed stretched targets in terms of our atmospheric emission licences.
   Our R2,8 billion abatement programme remains on track to achieve our targeted reductions of volatile
   organic compound emissions by 2020.
-  We continue to measure our comprehensive climate change response through our key performance
   indicators. For our South African operations, we are in the final stages of concluding carbon budgets
   which we will be required to support for the next five years. We continue to investigate and implement
   actions to further reduce our emissions.
-  Following the excellent utility energy efficiency improvement for our operations in South Africa in 2015,
   we have set the objective to sustain the same level of performance for the 2016 financial year, using the
   2015 financial year performance as the new baseline. The Energy Intensity Index for our South African
   operations is slightly above target for the six months ended 31 December 2015, following the September
   2015 planned shutdowns. Notwithstanding, we are confident that we will meet our 2016 target. 
-  We view broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) in South Africa as a business imperative
   and our commitment to transformation has seen us record strong BBBEE contributor status ratings.
   Our level 4 BBBEE contributor status is currently being evaluated and we expect this to decline after the
   Department of Trade and Industry's revised Codes of Good Practice came into effect during the 2015
   financial year. We have embarked on a project to re-assess our BBBEE strategies and adhere to the new
   requirements.
-  In February 2016, we declared an interim dividend of R356 million to our BEE partner, Tshwarisano LFB
   Investment (Pty) Ltd, which holds a 25% shareholding in Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd. We are proud to announce
   that, based on the attractive returns generated by Sasol Oil (Pty) Ltd, the debt relating to our BEE
   partner's equity shareholding has been settled. We remain committed to deliver sustainable returns to all
   our stakeholders. 

Competition law compliance
On 5 June 2014, the South African Competition Tribunal (the Tribunal) released its decision relating to Sasol
Polymers' pricing of propylene and polypropylene. In its decision, the Tribunal found against Sasol Polymers
in relation to the pricing of both propylene and polypropylene, for the period in question. Sasol appealed the
Tribunal's ruling to the Competition Appeal Court (CAC). On 17 June 2015, the CAC upheld Sasol's appeal and
set aside the decision of the Tribunal. The Competition Commission sought leave to appeal the matter to the
Constitutional Court, however, on 17 November 2015 the Constitutional Court refused such leave to appeal,
bringing this matter to an end.

Separately, the Competition Commission is conducting investigations into some of the industries in
which Sasol operates, including the petroleum and polymer industries, and has initiated a market inquiry
in the South African LPG market. We continue to cooperate with the Competition Commission in these
investigations. To the extent appropriate, further announcements will be made in future.

Profit outlook* – solid production performance and cost reductions to continue
The current economic environment remains volatile and very uncertain. Our expectation is for ongoing
moderate global growth, where growth in advanced economies mitigates the negative growth impact of
some emerging markets and commodity exporting nations. Oil prices are currently subject to sentiment
driven volatility and while some fundamentals indicate that the oil industry cycle is poised to turn, it remains
difficult to determine when this will happen. The rand continues to face a number of depreciation risks,
including a relatively strong US dollar, weak domestic growth prospects, negative emerging market sentiment
and policy uncertainty. As oil price and foreign exchange movements are outside our control, our focus
remains firmly on managing factors within our control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective
capital allocation and cash conservation.

We expect an overall strong production performance for the 2016 financial year, with:
-  Liquid fuels product volumes for the Energy SBU in Southern Africa to be approximately 60 million barrels;
-  Base Chemicals sales volumes to be lower than the prior year, with margins remaining under pressure;
-  Performance Chemicals sales volumes to be slightly lower than the prior year, with average margins for
   the business remaining resilient;
-  A lower average utilisation rate at ORYX GTL in Qatar of approximately 80% of nameplate capacity due to
   an extended statutory shutdown; 
-  A higher average utilisation rate at EGTL in Nigeria due to a steady ramp up;
-  Normalised cash fixed costs to continue to trend below SA PPI;
-  The RP cash flow contribution to range between R10 billion and R16 billion;
-  BPEP cash cost savings to achieve an annual run rate of R4,3 billion by the end of the current financial
   year;
-  Capital expenditure of R74 billion for 2016 and R73 billion in 2017 as we progress with the execution of our
   growth plan and strategy. Capital estimates may change as a result of exchange rate volatility;
-  Our balance sheet gearing up to a level of between 20% and 30%; 
-  Average Brent crude oil prices to remain between US$25 and US$40; and
-  Ongoing rand/US dollar volatility due to various factors, including the pending outcome of the credit
   review of the South African sovereign credit rating.

Appointment of Joint-Chief Executive Officers and change in directors
As previously announced, Mr David E. Constable will step down as President and Chief Executive Officer
on 30 June 2016. On 11 December 2015, Sasol announced the appointment of Mr Bongani Nqwababa and
Mr Stephen Cornell as Joint-Chief Executive Officers of the Company, and Mr Paul Victor as Chief Financial
Officer and Executive Director, with effect from 1 July 2016. On 4 December 2015, Prof Jürgen Schrempp retired
as a Director and Mr Henk Dijkgraaf was appointed as Lead Independent Director.

Declaration of cash dividend number 73
An interim gross cash dividend of South African 570,00 cents per ordinary share (31 December 2014 – 700,00
cents per ordinary share) has been declared for the six months ended 31 December 2015. The interim cash
dividend is payable on the ordinary shares and the Sasol BEE ordinary shares. The Board is satisfied that the 
liquidity and solvency of the Company, as well as capital remaining after payment of the interim cash dividend 
is sufficient to support the current operations. The dividend has been declared out of retained earnings 
(income reserves). The South African dividend withholding tax rate is 15%. At the declaration date, there are 
651 389 516 ordinary (including 8 809 886 treasury shares), 25 547 081 Sasol preferred ordinary and 2 838 565 
Sasol BEE ordinary shares in issue. The net dividend amount payable to shareholders who are not exempt from 
the dividend withholding tax, is 484,50 cents per share, while the dividend amount payable to shareholders who 
are exempt from dividend withholding tax is 570,00 cents per share.

(1) In addition to these costs, an additional R36 million (December 2014 – R108 million; June 2015 – R224 million) of internal
    resources was allocated to the project, bringing the total spend for the period to R132 million (December 2014 –
    R1 473 million; June 2015 – R1 906 million).
(2) December 2014 and June 2015 includes a share-based payment expense of R280 million relating to the partial refinancing
    of the Sasol Inzalo transaction.
(3) The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets (R7,4 billion),
    partially offset by the reversal of the provision of R2,3 billion in respect of EGTL.
(4) The total number of employees includes permanent and non-permanent employees and the group's share of employees
    within joint operations, but excludes contractors, equity accounted joint ventures' and associates' employees.

Significant events and transactions since 30 June 2015

Significant Financial Instruments
Fair value
Valuation techniques and assumptions utilised for the purpose of calculating fair value
Fair value is determined using valuation techniques as outlined below. Where possible, inputs are based on
quoted prices and other market determined variables.

Fair Value hierarchy
The following table is provided representing the significant financial instruments measured at fair value at
reporting date, or for which fair value is disclosed at 31 December 2015. The US$ bond and the interest rate
swap were considered to be significant financial instruments for the group based on the amounts recognised
in the statement of financial position and the fact that these instruments are traded in an active market. The
calculation of fair value requires various inputs into the valuation methodologies used. The source of the
inputs used affects the reliability and accuracy of the valuations. Significant inputs have been classified into
the hierarchical levels in line with IFRS 13, as shown below:

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (directly or indirectly).

Trading statement for the six months ended 31 December 2015

The first half of the 2016 financial year was characterised by a
continued strong business performance across most of the value
chain. Our business performance was however negatively impacted
by challenging and highly volatile global markets, marked by a
steep decline in global oil and commodity chemical prices,
partly offset by a weaker Rand exchange rate.

Sasol´s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months
ended 31 December 2015 are expected to decrease by between 23%
and 28% (approximating R7,36 to R8,96 per share) compared to the
2015 financial half year (comparable period) HEPS of R32,00.
Earnings per share (EPS) for the same period are expected to
decrease by between 62% and 67% (approximating R19,86 to R21,47
per share) from the comparable period EPS of R32,04. On a
normalised basis, excluding the impact of once-off items such as
net impairment charges and the share-based payment expense, EPS
are expected to decrease by between 8% and 13% (approximating
R2,17 to R3,53 per share).

The Group’s profitability was adversely impacted by a 47% lower
average Brent crude oil price (average dated Brent was
US$47/barrel(b) for the six months ended 31 December 2015
compared to US$89/b in the comparable period). Further, the
price of our basket of commodity chemicals declined by 23%
compared with the comparable period. The effect of lower oil and
commodity chemical prices was partly offset by a 24% weaker
average rand/US dollar exchange rate (average rand/US dollar
exchange rate was R13,62 for the six months ended 31 December
2015 compared to R10,99 in the comparable period). The average
margin for our speciality chemicals remained resilient and in
line with the comparable period.

Notwithstanding the tough macroeconomic environment, we
continued to focus on factors within our control by delivering a
strong operational performance across our global integrated
value chain. The highlights of our operational performance were:

 - Secunda Synfuels operations increased production volumes by
   3% compared to the comparable period.
 - Total liquid fuels production for the Energy business
   increased by 4% compared to the comparable period as a result
   of a higher portion of Synfuels volumes being utilised by the
   Energy business. Sales volumes for the Energy business
   decreased by 1% compared to the comparable period on the back
   of difficult market and trading conditions experienced in
   December 2015, driven by lower demand for liquid fuels in
   Southern Africa.
 - The ORYX GTL facility continued to deliver a solid
   performance, with an average utilisation rate of 90% for the
   period.
 - Secunda Chemicals and Sasolburg operations’ production
   volumes remained in line with the comparable period. The
   increase in volumes from our Fischer-Tropsch Wax Expansion
   Project was offset by lower C3 volumes as a result of planned
   commissioning activities associated with the C3 Expansion
   Project.
 - Sales volumes for the Base Chemicals business decreased by
   13% due to lower C3 volumes available as a result of
   commissioning the C3 Expansion Project and softer demand for
   some commodity chemical products.
 - Sales volumes from our Performance Chemicals business,
   normalised for the planned shutdown at our ethylene plant in
   North America, remained on par with the comparable period.

A detailed production summary and key business performance
metrics for the first half of the 2016 financial year for all
our businesses are available on our website, www.sasol.com.

Our company-wide Business Performance Enhancement Programme
aimed at delivering sustainable cost savings of R4,3 billion by
the end of financial year 2016, continues to progress very well,
and we are on track to exceed our sustainable cost savings
target for the current financial year. These efforts resulted
in increases in normalised cash fixed costs continuing to trend
well below inflation for the period.

Our comprehensive Response Plan focussed on cash conservation,
in reaction to the lower-for-longer oil price environment, has
continued to yield cash savings in line with our 2016 financial
year targets. The Response Plan positioned the company well
within a US$45-50/b oil price environment. We are currently
assessing the implications of the latest developments in the
external macroeconomic environment on the scope of our Response
Plan and will communicate further details regarding the
potential update of our Response Plan targets in our results
announcement on 7 March 2016.

In addition, Sasol’s profitability was further impacted by the
following once-off items:

 - A net remeasurement charge of R7,6 billion for the first half
   of the 2016 financial year compared to a R0,2 billion expense
   in the comparable period. This mainly relates to a partial
   impairment of our share in the Montney shale gas asset of R7,4
   billion (CAD665 million) due to a further deterioration of
   conditions in the North American gas market resulting in a 16%
   decline in forecasted natural gas prices. The impairment had a
   negative impact on the effective tax rate for the group. This
   asset remains highly sensitive to changes in the gas price. We
   estimate that a 5% change in the gas price may result in a
   change of CAD255 million (approximately R2,9 billion) in the
   recoverable amount of the asset.
 - A cash-settled share-based payment charge of R0,4 billion
   compared to a credit of R2,9 billion for the comparable
   period.
 - The positive impact from the reversal of a tax provision of
   R2,3 billion (US$166 million) based on a favourable ruling
   received from the Tax Appeal Tribunal in Nigeria relating to
   the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (EGTL) project. The reversal of
   the provision reduced the effective tax rate for the group.

Our results for the first half of the 2016 financial year may be
further affected by any adjustments resulting from our half-
year-end closure process. This may result in a change in the
estimated earnings noted above. This trading statement only
deals with the comparison to the first half of the 2015
financial year. Guidance will be provided on the expected full
2016 financial year’s results when there is a reasonable degree
of certainty in this regard. We expect that there will be a
further negative impact on our results for the remainder of the
2016 financial year due to lower oil and commodity chemical
prices.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's
external auditors. Sasol's financial results for the six months
ended 31 December 2015 will be announced on Monday, 7 March
