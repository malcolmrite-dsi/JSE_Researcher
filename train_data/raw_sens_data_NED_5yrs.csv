CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE

Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) press release
on 24 November 2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group. Moody’s downgraded the long-term local and
foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited from Ba1 to Ba2. The outlook on all the bank’s long-
term deposit ratings and long-term issuer ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody's decision on 20 November 2020 to downgrade the Government of
South Africa’s long-term foreign currency and local currency issuer ratings from Ba1 to Ba2, and
maintain the negative outlook. The South African sovereign ratings act as a ceiling and the rating of
domestic banks cannot be above that of the sovereign.

The Moody’s press release stated: ‘Today’s rating actions on the five South African banks reflect (i) the
deterioration in the creditworthiness of the South African sovereign, as indicated by the downgrade of
the Government of South Africa’s issuer rating to Ba2 from Ba1. The weakening in the sovereign’s credit
profile has direct implications for banks given their significant holding of sovereign securities on their
balance sheets; and (ii) the gradual weakening of the banks’ standalone credit profile as the coronavirus
pandemic exacerbates an already challenging operating environment in South Africa.’

Moody’s further noted that: ‘More positively, the rating agency expects the South African banks to
continue to maintain solid capital buffers, along with sound funding and liquidity. Systemwide gross
loans to deposit ratio was also healthy at 89%.’

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Long-term local currency deposit rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Ba1 to Ba2,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Long-term foreign currency deposit rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Ba1 to Ba2,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Counterparty Risk Rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from Baa3/P-3 to Ba1/NP.
    -   Senior Unsecured MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded from (P)Ba1 to (P)Ba2.

The Moody’s downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial
impact on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is not expected to have any significant
impact on the group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and
raising most of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between
foreign denominated funding and foreign denominated assets. As noted in our Nedbank Group voluntary
trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2020, released on 29 October 2020, ‘The group
remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and above board approved minimum targets
and well above all regulatory requirements.’

NEDBANK GROUP VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30
SEPTEMBER 2020

In line with the JSE Limited’s letter to issuers regarding effective communication to investors during the
Covid-19 pandemic wherein they highlighted the importance of providing more regular and detailed
communication to the market during uncertain times, the following Nedbank Group voluntary trading
update for the nine months ended 30 September 2020 (9M 2020) is shared with investors.

The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns as well as financial market volatility in late March
2020 were extreme events and the negative impact of these on the group’s client base remains evident
and is expected to continue for some time. The economic environment in the third quarter of 2020 (Q3
2020) improved when compared to the second quarter of 2020 (Q2 2020), as evident in macroeconomic
indicators and high frequency data from our transactional banking channels. Industry turnover data
recorded on our point of sale devices and digital channels in Q3 2020 illustrates an ongoing recovery
as lockdown levels eased, with turnover levels in September 2020 at 98% of March 2020 levels and an
increase of 3% compared to the month of September in 2019. This compared to the April 2020 low at
47% of March 2020 levels (46% down on the month of April 2019).

In the group’s interim results announcement, released on 26 August 2020, we noted that our focus at
this time is primarily on the health and safety of our staff and clients and serving and supporting clients
in good standing in managing their finances through this difficult period. While it is still too early to draw
final conclusions given the risk of a second round of infections, Covid-19 infection rates in staff peaked
in mid-July and are trending downwards. In support of our clients in this difficult economic environment,
in the period up to 30 September 2020, we have approved and concluded more than 400 thousand loan
restructures qualifying under SARB Directive 3/2020 (D3) amounting to more than R121bn and paid out
R1,1bn under the SA Government’s SME Loan Guarantee scheme and in so doing have helped our
clients to better manage their cashflows through the crisis. Our IT systems remain stable and the
Managed Evolution technology strategy on track despite the lockdown. The launch of market-leading
digital solutions has resulted in an increase in digital usage and a 9% yoy increase in digitally active
clients to over 1,9m.

Financial performance
The financial performance of the group improved in Q3 2020 when compared to Q2 2020, primarily
driven by lower impairments in the quarter as the extent of forward looking IFRS 9 macro-model
adjustments and judgmental overlays booked in Q2 2020 did not repeat.

Average interest earning banking assets growth slowed to around mid-single digits, down from the 8,2%
reported in H1 2020. In RBB, gross loans and advances growth increased to around 3%, up from the
1% reported in H1 2020. Retail loan application volumes have recorded a full recovery to above pre-
lockdown levels across all major products, in part driven by pent up demand given the impact of
lockdown on home loans and vehicle finance, and in part by the 300 bps lower interest rates. The higher
growth in RBB was achieved notwithstanding loan approval rates that are lower than pre-crisis levels.
In CIB, gross banking loan and advances growth slowed from the 10% growth reported in H1 2020
primarily as a number of clients that accessed committed liquidity facilities at the height of the crisis
repaid their loans, and as we continued to optimise the portfolio.

Deposit growth remained robust and well ahead of growth in loans and advances.

Net interest income (NII) growth for 9M 2020 decreased from the 1% growth reported for the six months
to 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) as overall loan growth slowed and the group’s net interest margin (NIM)
contracted slightly to just below the 330 bps reported in H1 2020. The decline in NII in Q3 2020 was
less than we expected but is in line with our full year 2020 guidance range of between 0% and -5%.
While lower endowment income continued to put pressure on NIM due to the run rate impact of the 300
bps interest rate cuts to date, asset pricing improved, particularly in the secured lending (home loans,
vehicle finance and commercial property) and corporate lending portfolios.

Impairment growth for 9M 2020 remained elevated but was lower than the 202% reported in H1 2020,
supporting a credit loss ratio (CLR) that decreased from 194 bps in H1 2020 to within our 2020 full year
guidance range of between 150 bps to 185 bps. The reduction was supported by lower CLRs across
CIB, RBB and Nedbank Africa Regions, while Nedbank Wealth’s CLR remained flat on June 2020.

-   In CIB, impairments for Q3 2020 decreased compared to Q2 2020 as the R1bn forward looking
    IFRS 9 macro-economic overlay in Q2 2020 did not repeat. More clients migrated to Stage 3 loans
    and appropriate impairments were raised, and D3 loans increased to R32bn, slightly up from the
    R30,5bn reported in H1 2020. An update to the group’s macro-economic forecasts resulting in a
    larger GDP growth decline for 2020 (-9,2%) compared to the (-7,0%) forecast in June 2020, has not
    had a material impact on CIB’s impairments as the lower levels of exposure at default (EAD) had
    an offsetting impact. The commercial property portfolio continues to perform well and the underlying
    rental collections by listed clients continued to improve (94% in August 2020, up from 88% in July
    2020 and the low of 67% in April 2020).
-   In RBB, impairments for Q3 2020 reduced compared to Q2 2020. Impairments in Q3 2020 reflect
    the impact of D3 loans migrating to Stage 2 due to payment holiday renewals, as well as an increase
    in Stage 3 loans. 90% of the R79bn D3 loans extended in RBB have matured (lapsed) with 66%
    having resumed their monthly payment, 5% were one or more payments in arrears and 19% have
    been extended/renewed. 10% of D3 loans have not yet matured. Of the 71% of loans that matured
    and were not renewed, 93% are paying their instalments. As at 30 September 2020 R23bn (6% of
    RBB loans and advance) were classified as D3 loans, a reduction from R78bn (21,5% of RBB loans
    and advances) at 30 June 2020. Non-D3 loan repayments continue to perform ahead of our
    expectations given the positive impact of the 300 bps reduction in interest rates ytd.
-   The group’s total coverage ratio increased from the 2,95% reported at H1 2020 to 3,2%, driven by
    an increase in Stage 2 coverage from 4,7% in H1 2020 to 6,0% as a result of additional D3
    extension-related overlays in RBB and a reduction in Stage 2 CIB clients with low coverage that
    repaid and/or cured, and therefore moved to Stage 1.
-   While impairment trends are encouraging, risks associated with D3 and D7 restructured loans in
    RBB, as well as watchlist clients in CIB remain elevated and are closely monitored. A D3 loan is a
    restructured loan categorised under SARB Directive 3 of 2020 providing payment relief to qualifying
    borrowers that are temporarily affected by Covid-19 and were up to date with their payments at 29
    February 2020. A D7 loan is a distressed restructure categorised under SARB Directive 7 of 2015,
    classified as defaulted (Stage 3) and has to be kept in default for at least six months until the new
    loan agreement can be considered cured.

Non-interest revenue growth for 9M 2020 decreased when compared to the decline of 5% reported in
H1 2020, in line with our expectations and our full year 2020 guidance range of between -7% to -11%.

-   Commission and fees reduced by less than the 9% decline reported in H1 2020 as the easing of
    lockdown restrictions to level one and two has been beneficial. Client transactional activity across
    our branches, as well as on our digital channels, ATMs and POS devices increased when compared
    to April, May and June 2020, but remained below March 2020 levels. Digital penetration increased
    further to 26% (H1 2020: 25% digitally active clients as a percentage of total clients). Retail main-
    banked clients increased 4,5% from the 2,65m reported in H1 2020 as transactional activity levels
    improved, while CIB recorded 25 primary-banked client wins ytd (H1 2020: 22).
-   Insurance income continued to decline given higher levels of credit life claims which we expect to
    peak in H2 2020.
-   Trading income growth remains strong but has slowed, as expected, with declining levels of volatility
    and volumes.
-   Private equity income recorded an improvement from the R765m loss reported at interims as market
    valuations stabilised in Q3 2020, but downward pressures on underlying investee companies are
    still evident.
-   A portion of the fair value gains reported in H1 2020 continued to unwind in line with our
    expectations.

Expenses continued to be well managed in response to the more challenging environment through lower
variable costs and diligent cost management and the decline in expenses for 9M 2020 was in line with
our full year 2020 guidance range of between -1% and -4%, and lower than the 1% decline reported in
H1 2020.

Associate income of R222m, relating to Nedbank Group’s 21% shareholding in ETI for 9M 2020 (9M
2019: R561m), has been recognised. This includes accounting for associate income from our share of
ETI’s Q4 2019 and H1 2020 attributable profits (a quarter in arrear) of R458m, as well as our share of
the ETI’s 2019 restatement of R236m which was reflected in our half year results.

As a result of the group’s improved financial performance in Q3 2020, the ROE for 9M 2020 increased
when compared to the 4,8% reported in H1 2020. NAV per share increased 4%, up from the 2% increase
reported at H1 2020.

Outlook
SA Q2 GDP of -51% annualised q-o-q (-17,1% yoy), was slightly worse than expected, given a greater
deterioration of economic activity during lockdown. Over the first half of 2020, the economy contracted
8,7% yoy. As a result, our Nedbank Group Economic Unit’s SA GDP forecast for 2020 has been revised
down from -7,0% to -9,2% while our 2021 forecast increased slightly to 2,5% (from our previous 2,2%
forecast). The SA Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan announced by President Ramaphosa,
contains many practical initiatives which together should improve the underlying investment
environment and unlock greater job creation and faster economic growth. Much now depends on how
quickly the specific measures proposed in the plan can be implemented.

The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) delivered by the Minister of Finance on 28
October 2020 had no surprises and few new insights. SA’s debt trajectory is, however, substantially
worse than reflected in the Supplementary Budget. The MTBPS reiterates the need to make difficult
choices to stabilise debt, stressing that failing to do so could lead to a fiscal crisis. The fiscal policy path
presented will be a further drag on SA’s recovery, with higher taxes and spending constraints likely to
weigh on incomes, earnings and growth.

The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies are material and continuously evolving. As a
result, the impact on the banking industry and Nedbank Group’s results in 2020 remains uncertain. As
noted in our H1 2020 disclosures, full-year HEPS and EPS are expected to decline by more than 20%
when compared to the 12-month period ended 31 December 2019 (HEPS: 2 605 cents, EPS: 2 500
cents). As at 30 September 2020 this guidance remains unchanged. A further trading statement will be
issued in Q1 2021 to provide more specific guidance ranges once there is reasonable certainty regarding
the extent of the decline and the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges.

The group’s pre-close call is scheduled for the first week of December 2020 and further details will be
provided in due course.

Nedbank Group Chief Executive, Mike Brown, noted: ‘While these are very challenging times, we are
well prepared to respond to and manage the risks that have emerged. We have strong, capable and
experienced management teams in place to navigate our way through these headwinds and emerge
stronger and more competitive on the other side. The past eight months have been a difficult period and
we thank our dedicated staff for continuing to support and deliver to our clients, communities and all our
stakeholders. The group remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and above board-
approved minimum targets and well above all regulatory requirements. Our current guidance for all the
key 2020 performance metrics, as outlined in our 2020 interim results announcement on 26 August
2020, remains intact. The group’s Basel III disclosures as at 30 September 2020 will be released in
November 2020.’

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this voluntary trading update has
not been reviewed or reported on by the Nedbank Group´s auditors.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX
MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT

In a period of unprecedented health, economic and social challenges that
have impacted our staff and our clients, Nedbank Group remained profitable
and open for business, with capital and liquidity ratios within board-
approved targets and well above all prudential requirements.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on individuals, families,
businesses, societies and countries in what is becoming known as the Great
Lockdown Crisis (GLC). Unfortunately, as a result of consistently weak
economic growth and an unsustainable fiscal position, the SA economy
entered this crisis in a more challenging position than it did entering the
Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The impact of the pandemic and the GLC has
resulted in a revision of our 2020 SA GDP growth forecast to a contraction
of 7,0%, with the second quarter expected to be most impacted and the Q2
GDP in SA forecast expected to decrease by more than 40%. By contrast, SA
banks are in a more resilient position than they were during the GFC, with
loan growth going into the GLC being more prudent, impairment coverage
ratios being higher, funding tenor being longer and capital levels being
stronger than they were during the GFC.

At Nedbank our primary focus since the crisis started has been on
resilience: ensuring the health and safety of our staff and clients;
invoking business continuity plans; ensuring IT systems stability;
supporting our clients in managing their finances through this very
difficult period; and managing liquidity, credit risk, capital and
discretionary costs closely. We have provided payment relief to our
qualifying clients in good standing on R119bn of loans under PA D3/2020,
reduced various fees, and launched digital innovations to assist our
clients during the lockdown, including the Avo app and Tap on Phone
payments functionality. Throughout the crisis we have maintained a strong
balance sheet, evident in a tier 1 capital ratio of 11,7% and CET1 ratio
of 10,6% at 30 June 2020, as well as a strong liquidity profile. Both
ratios are above board-approved minimum targets and well above all
regulatory requirements. The Covid-19 health crisis morphed quickly into an
economic crisis and is currently escalating to become a social crisis due
to, among other things, increases in already unacceptable levels of
unemployment. As Nedbank, we are committed to making a difference in this
difficult environment and deliver on our purpose to use our financial
expertise to do good for our clients and society.

Nedbank Group’s HE in the six months to 30 June 2020 declined by 69% to
R2,1bn, impacted by a significant increase in the impairment charge,
including a provision build from forward-looking IFRS-9 macro-model
adjustments and judgemental overlays for anticipated Covid-19-related
impacts and expected job losses, in total amounting to R2,9bn. In addition,
H1 was impacted by the effect of lower interest rates on endowment income
(NII) and a decrease in NIR as a result of lower client transactional
activity in Q2 2020 and negative revaluations to unrealised private-equity
investments driven by lower listed market prices and increases in
cost of equity. Expenses were well managed and declined on the prior
period.

Forecasting in the current environment is complex and estimates are subject
to a much higher level of forecast risk than usual, but we are hopeful that
the worst impacts of Covid-19 and the GLC are behind us and that
impairments in the second half will be lower than in the first half and
client activity will continue to increase off a low base. Our focus in the
second half of 2020 will remain on resilience as we reintegrate business
functions in a phased manner, including delivering market-leading client
experiences and innovative digital solutions, supporting our clients, and
optimising on costs, while managing credit risks and maintaining resilient
capital and liquidity ratios and remaining on high alert for subsequent
waves of infection.

We thank our 29 000 dedicated staffmembers who have been observing the
Covid-19 health protocols and supporting our clients and the economy during
this difficult period. We also extend our deepest condolences to the
families and friends of the five Nedbank staffmembers who have passed away
as a result of Covid-19 and related illnesses.

NEDBANK GROUP AND NEDBANK: CHANGES TO CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

Shareholders are advised that Raisibe Morathi has resigned as the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO) and executive director on the Nedbank Group and Nedbank Boards with effect from
30 September 2020. She will remain employed by Nedbank until the end of October to
ensure an orderly handover. Raisibe has been CFO since September 2009 and is a highly
regarded professional, internally and externally. The Boards accept her resignation with
regret, but wish her every success in her future career aspirations.

In accordance with Nedbank Group’s executive succession plan and after a process overseen
by a panel of non-executive directors, Mike Davis, currently Group Executive: Balance Sheet
Management (BSM) and an existing member of Group Exco has been appointed as CFO-
designate with immediate effect, and as the Group’s Chief Financial Officer and to the Group’s
Boards on 1 October 2020.

Mike Davis (BCom(Hons), DipAcc, CA(SA), AMP) was appointed as Group Executive of BSM
and to the Group Executive Committee on 1 January 2015. He has significant industrywide
experience in finance, asset and liability management and capital management, having worked
in financial services for over 20 years. Mike is the current deputy-chairperson of the Nedbank
CFO Forum and has strong relationships within Nedbank and with shareholders and the
broader investment community and has consistently been part of the group’s results
roadshows and investor engagements.

Mike Brown, Chief Executive, said ‘It has been a privilege to work alongside Raisibe and whilst
we are disappointed that she has decided to pursue new opportunities outside of the Group,
we thank her for her valued contribution to Nedbank over the past decade. We will miss her
and wish her well in her future. I am thankful that in the current environment we were able to
make an immediate appointment into this important position and am confident Mike Davis will
seamlessly step into the role.’

Raisibe Morathi, outgoing CFO, said ‘I wish to thank the Board of Nedbank for the opportunity
afforded to me over the last several years, the experience gained is truly invaluable. It is in that
context that this is a moment of mixed emotions, sad to leave all my friends and colleagues at
Nedbank whilst also looking forward to opening a new chapter in my career. I remain a true
Nedbank loyalist whose connection as a client of 26 years will continue well beyond this period
and I congratulate Mike Davis and wish him well in the role, with full confidence that he will do
well.”

Nedbank Group Chairman, Vassi Naidoo, thanked Raisibe for her years of excellent service
to Nedbank as CFO and a member of Group Exco and the Nedbank Boards, and wished her
well in her future career aspirations.

UPDATED NEDBANK GROUP TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30
JUNE 2020 AND NOTIFICATION THAT NO INTERIM ORDINARY DIVIDEND WILL BE DECLARED

As advised in the SENS announcement released ahead of our AGM on 22 May 2020, the Nedbank
Group’s performance in the first quarter to 31 March 2020 already reflected the impact of a difficult
macroeconomic environment in SA and in our African operations. The Covid-19 pandemic and
subsequent lockdowns, as well as financial market volatility in late March 2020 were extreme events
and the negative impacts of these on the group’s client base became more evident in April 2020 and
was expected to continue.

In the same SENS announcement of 22 May 2020 we noted that year on year advances growth was
high single digits, supported by wholesale clients drawing on available facilities and with retail lending
slowing as demand for new retail loans stalled during the lockdown. The group’s net interest margin had
decreased from the 2019 level as a result of the endowment impact from lower interest rates and
impairments rose steeply in April 2020 primarily as a result of the negative impact of forward-looking
IFRS 9 macro-model adjustments. Client transactional activity had slowed as the lockdown commenced
and trading income had grown strongly, benefitting from increased market volatility.

We highlighted at our AGM in May 2020 that our focus at this time was primarily on the health and safety
of our staff and clients and serving and supporting clients in good standing in managing their finances
through this difficult period. While it is still too early to draw final conclusions, Covid-19 infection rates in
staff appear to have peaked in July and are trending downwards. Unfortunately five staffmembers have
passed away from Covid-19 and related illnesses and we extend our deepest condolences to their
families and friends. In support of our clients and as a result of the economy, in the period up to 30 June
2020, we have approved and concluded loan restructures qualifying under SARB Directive 3/2020 for
over 375 000 eligible clients amounting to R119bn and in so doing have helped our clients to better
manage their cashflows through the crisis.

The largest impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the group’s financial performance in the six months to
30 June 2020 has been a significant increase in the impairment or expected credit loss charge, including
forward-looking IFRS 9 macro-model adjustments and judgmental overlays for anticipated Covid-19
related impacts and estimates of future job losses, as well as increases in impairments on Stage 3
advances. The combined macro-model adjustments and judgmental overlays amounted to R2,9bn for
the period (across stages 1, 2 and 3), with the annualised credit loss ratio to June 2020 increasing to
just over 1,9%. Given the annualisation impact of the IFRS 9 forward-looking macro-model adjustments
and judgemental overlays, the full year credit loss ratio to December 2020 is currently expected to be
lower than June 2020, but above the levels of the global financial crisis (1,52%). NII to 30 June 2020
grew in low single digits and was impacted by lower endowment income as a result of interest rates cuts
and a slowdown in advances growth since Q1. NIR had showed positive growth in Q1 2020, but by the
end of Q2 2020 NIR in H1 2020 had decreased by mid-single digits when compared to H1 2019, largely
as a result of lower client transactional activity in lockdown and negative revaluations to unrealised
private equity investments driven by lower listed market prices and increases in the cost of equity. These
impacts were partially offset by very strong trading income growth given increased market volatility. With
the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, client transactional activity in May and June improved from
the lows in April, but remained below March levels. Expenses were tightly controlled with overall
expenses slightly lower than H1 2019.

Our primary focus since the crisis started has been on resilience: ensuring the health and safety of our
staff and clients, invoking business continuity plans, ensuring IT systems stability, supporting our clients
in managing their finances through this difficult period and closely managing liquidity, credit risk, capital
and discretionary costs.

As at 30 June 2020, the group’s balance sheet remained strong with capital and liquidity ratios above
board-approved minimum targets and well above all regulatory requirements. Notwithstanding this, in
line with SARB Guidance Note 4/2020, the board deemed it appropriate not to declare an interim
ordinary dividend (Nedbank Group) for the period ended 30 June 2020. The Nedbank Limited preference
share dividend is still expected to be declared as preference shares are not impacted by this guidance
note.

Trading statement update

released on 22 May 2020 where shareholders were advised that headline earnings per share (HEPS)
and earnings per share (EPS) for the six month period ending 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) were expected
to be more than 20% lower than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS:
1 435 cents, H1 2019 EPS: 1 419 cents), the board now has reasonable certainty regarding the extent
of the decline and therefore the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges are as follows:

-   HEPS for H1 2020 is expected to be between 67% and 72% lower than the comparative period,
    resulting in a range of between 474 cents and 402 cents per share.
-   EPS for H1 2020 is expected to be between 79% and 84% lower than the comparative period,
    resulting in a range of between 298 cents and 227 cents per share.

The difference between the HEPS and EPS ranges is primarily attributed to an additional R750m
impairment the group has raised against the carrying value of its investment in Ecobank Transnational
Incorporated to reflect the more difficult trading environment expected in the period ahead, particularly
in Nigeria. While various scenarios supported a value-in-use calculation above the carrying value of our
investment, in the current environment giving more weight to downside scenarios resulted in the
additional impairment.

H1 2020 results announcement
Nedbank Group’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 will be released on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service on 26 August 2020 and will also be available on the group’s website:
nedbankgroup.co.za.

While these are very challenging times, Nedbank Group is well prepared to respond to and manage the
risks that have emerged. We have strong, capable and experienced management teams in place to
navigate our way through these headwinds and emerge stronger and more competitive on the other
side. The group remains profitable and capital and liquidity ratios are strong and in full compliance with
all prudential regulatory requirements.

We thank our 29 000 dedicated staffmembers who have been observing the Covid-19 health protocols
and supporting our clients and the economy during this difficult period.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading statement has not been
reviewed or reported on by Nedbank Group´s auditors.

NEDBANK GROUP VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR Q1 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT
FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2020

Trading update

On 29 April 2020 Nedbank Group hosted a webcast where management updated the investment
community on the progress made in responding to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic. We highlighted that
our primary focus at this time is on the health and safety of our staff and serving and providing support
for clients in managing their finances through this difficult period. We have pivoted our strategy to
increase our focus on resilience so that we can continue to support our clients through these challenges
– this means we have increased our focus on managing liquidity, capital, market and credit risk alongside
ongoing scenario modelling and stress testing, and an increased focus on costs.

As noted in the Nedbank Group SENS announcement on 14 April 2020, given the uncertain
environment, we have withdrawn our 2020 financial guidance and at the same time noted that our
medium and long-term targets are under review. Our 2020 financial guidance was based on our
economic forecasts completed in January 2020 and at that stage we expected SA GDP growth for 2020
to be 0.7% and interest rates to be flat over the year. Economic forecasts today are materially different
from January 2020. While forecasting in the current environment is complex and subject to a much
higher degree of forecast risk than usual, in April 2020 the Nedbank Economic Unit revised their forecast
of SA GDP growth for 2020 to -7,0%. After the cumulative 225 bps of interest rate cuts up to April 2020,
the SARB MPC cut interest rates by a further 50 bps in May 2020.

The Nedbank Group’s performance in the first quarter to 31 March 2020 (‘the Period’) reflects the impact
of a difficult macroeconomic environment in SA and in our African operations. While the initial impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown emerged in March and financial market volatility in
late March was extreme, impacts on our client base became more evident in April 2020 and are expected
to continue.

Loan and advances growth in the Period for Nedbank Group was high single digits (year on year). In
CIB growth was just above double digits driven primarily by wholesale term loans and commercial
property finance as we supported clients in good standing to draw down on existing credit facilities as
they prepared for the uncertainty ahead and foreign currency loans increased as a result of Rand
depreciation. In April, similar trends continued.

In RBB, loans and advances growth in the Period was just above mid-single digits (year on year) driven
by growth in personal loans and vehicle finance. During April 2020, retail lending growth slowed
significantly as demand for new home loans and vehicle finance stalled and card balances reduced,
affected by the lockdown and consequential restrictions. Overdrafts increased as we supported our
SMEs and Business Banking clients.

Deposits in the Period continued to grow ahead of loans and advances. In this environment bank funding
profiles shortened across the industry as term-maturity deposits rolled down with depositors having a
lower propensity to term out new deposits into future maturity dates. Towards the end April 2020
depositors’ appetite for tenure improved as market confidence returned, resulting in a lengthening of
bank funding profiles.

Net interest income for the Period increased by mid-single digits when compared to Q1 2019,
underpinned by the strong advances growth. The group’s net interest margin (NIM) decreased from the
2019 level of 3,52%, primarily as a result of the endowment impact from lower interest rates. The
negative impact of lower interest rates on NIM continued into April 2020.

Impairments increased and the group’s credit loss ratio for the Period was in the top half of the through-
the-cycle target range of 60-100 bps. In April 2020, impairments rose steeply driven primarily by the
negative impact of the forward looking IFRS 9 macro-factor models on portfolio impairments based on
our current best estimates of the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. We will continue to review and
refine these macro-factor models over time and related portfolio impairment estimates. Stage 3
impairments increased across the group.

SARB Directive 3/2020 applies to the restructuring of loans that were in good standing at 29 February
2020 to enable these clients to better manage cashflows through the lockdown. As at the end of April
2020 we had proactively approved and concluded restructures for eligible clients amounting to
approximately R81bn (CIB: R34,0bn, RBB: R42,0bn and Nedbank Wealth: R4,6bn). To date Nedbank
has assisted more than 225 000 clients (out of a total credit active client base of approximately 2,5m)
with debt relief across our product range, including home loans, vehicle and asset finance, personal
loans, loans to SMEs and credit cards.

Non-interest revenue growth in the Period was in low single digits as flat commission and fee growth
was offset by solid trading income growth across all asset classes, as well as fair value increases in the
centre due to the large unexpected interest rate cuts. From the end of March 2020 and into April, client
transactional activity slowed materially as the lockdown commenced and this was particularly evident in
lower consumer activity and spend across sectors most impacted by the lockdown such as tourism and
travel, hospitality and transport. Generally lower levels of spending and related cash transactions also
negatively impacted NIR. Trading income in April grew strongly benefiting from increased market
volatility.

Expenses continued to be well managed in response to the more challenging environment. The group’s
ongoing digital transformation has proven beneficial during the lockdown and we continue to invest in
our Managed Evolution technology programmes. The group’s cost-to-income ratio (excluding associate
income) improved year on year as expenses grew more slowly than revenues and the JAWS ratio
(revenue growth less expense growth), excluding associate income, was positive in the Period as well
as year to date April 2020 (both including and excluding associate income).


An associate loss of R108m, relating to the Nedbank Group’s 21% shareholding in ETI for the period
ended 31 March 2020, has been recognised. This includes accounting for ETI’s Q4 2019 associate
income (a quarter in arrear), as well as Nedbank’s share of the $79,5m restatement of ETI’s 2018 income
statement for interest accruals on oil market exposures that had to be reversed in terms of Central Bank
of Nigeria regulations as disclosed by ETI in their 2019 results announcement on 24 March 2020. The
impact of the restatement was a R236m reduction in Nedbank’s associate income in Q1 2020. Excluding
accounting for this ETI restatement, Q1 2020 associate income relating to ETI was R128m (Q1 2019:
R191m).

Following regulatory approvals, the sale of Nedbank Malawi and the transaction to increase our
shareholding in Banco Ùnico were both completed in Q1 2020 as planned.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS) for
the six month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower than the reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS: 1 435 cents, H1 2019 EPS: 1 419 cents). A
further trading statement will be issued in order to provide specific guidance once there is reasonable
certainty regarding the extent of the decline and the relevant HEPS and EPS ranges. Nedbank Group’s
results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 are currently expected to be released on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service during the month of August 2020. The specific date is being finalised and will
be communicated to shareholders in due course.

The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and lower oil prices on economies are material and evolving. As
a result, the impact on the banking industry and Nedbank Group’s results in 2020 remains uncertain.
We will update investors on our revised 2020 financial guidance and medium to long-term prospects
once we have more clarity.

While these are very challenging times, Nedbank Group is well prepared to respond to and manage the
risks that are emerging. We have strong and experienced management teams in place to navigate our
way through these challenging times and emerge stronger and more competitive on the other side. The
group continues to be profitable and capital and liquidity metrics remained strong and in full compliance
with all prudential regulatory requirements. At 31 March 2020 Nedbank Group reported a CET1 capital
adequacy ratio of 10,9% after accounting for the 2019 final dividend (Q1 2019: 11,2%), Liquidity
Coverage Ratio of 110% (Q1 2019: 108%) and Net Stable Funding Ratio of 110% (Q1 2019: 106%).

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank Group´s auditors.

VESTING OF SHARES TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED OFFICERS: 2017 MATCHED SHARE SCHEME

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors and prescribed officers of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2017 voluntary bonus share
scheme (VBSS). This is not classified as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

In terms of the VBSS, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax bonus (less any amount already deferred under
Nedbank Group’s compulsory bonus deferral scheme) could be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would
then be committed into the Matched Share Scheme for a period of three years. Alternatively, the employee could
commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus
less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these
shares at any time prior to the end of the deferral period, which would cancel their participation in the scheme in
respect of those shares and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares owned by them committed into the VBSS but no rights to
dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the requisite Matched Shares are
delivered to the Participant at the end of the three year period.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person continued in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date would be matched
on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2017 to 2019 was met.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY STANDARD AND POOR’S
Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) press release on 7 May
2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank Limited, the 100%-
owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group.


S&P downgraded the long-term issuer foreign-currency credit rating on Nedbank Limited to BB- from
BB and affirmed the B short-term rating. The outlook is stable. S&P affirmed the zaAA long-term and
zaA-1+ short-term South Africa national scale rating of Nedbank Limited.


In line with historic trends, the downgrade on the South African banks was expected and follows S&P's
decision on 29 April 2020 to downgrade its long-term foreign-currency sovereign credit rating on the
Republic of South Africa to BB- from BB and affirm the B short-term foreign-currency sovereign credit
rating. The outlook is stable. S&P noted that: ‘We do not rate financial institutions in South Africa above
the foreign currency sovereign ratings, given the direct and indirect impact that sovereign distress would
have on domestic banks' operations. As a result, we are taking various rating actions on South Africa-
based institutions.’ S&P further noted that: ‘Positively, the South African Reserve Bank’s support
measures will support the stability of the financial and banking sector.’ and that ‘The stable industry risk
trend reflects early adoption of global best practices, effective and proactive regulation and supervision,
and good capitalization’.


The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Lowered the long-term issuer foreign-currency rating to ‘BB-‘ from ‘BB’ and noted the outlook
        as stable
    -   Affirmed the ‘B’ for the short-term foreign-currency rating
    -   Affirmed the ‘zaAA’ long-term national scale rating
    -   Affirmed the 'zaA-1+' short-term national scale rating


The S&P downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial impact
on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital ratios
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is expected to have a small impact on the
group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and raising most
of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between foreign
denominated funding and foreign denominated assets.

NO CHANGE STATEMENT

The Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited annual financial statements contain no changes to

Shareholders are advised that these documents were approved by the board of Nedbank
Group on 2 March 2020 and thus contain disclosures and statements based on the economic
conditions that existed at 2 March 2020 as required by International Financial Reporting
Standards. However, material changes in market conditions have since occurred as a result
of the Covid-19 pandemic that emerged in SA during March 2020 and the sovereign
downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch. Shareholders should refer to the information contained in
our Integrated Report to obtain initial insights into our current understanding of the impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic on Nedbank Group.

WITHDRAWAL OF NEDBANK GROUP 2020 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE

In recent weeks a combination of the rapid escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Moody’s and
Fitch downgrades of the SA sovereign credit ratings have combined to place unprecedented challenges
on the South African economy.

Given the developments stated above, there has been a material change in market conditions and the
economic outlook in the countries where we operate. It is difficult to accurately predict the progression
and duration of the Covid-19 pandemic globally and in South Africa, our predominant market, as well as
the residual risks when the lockdowns are lifted. As a result, it is not possible, at this stage, to accurately
predict the economic outcomes of the virus and the impact these will have on the banking outlook.

As part of our 2019 annual results announcement on 3 March 2020, Nedbank Group provided financial
guidance for 2020 and a series of medium to long-term targets. This financial guidance and related
medium to long-term targets were highlighted as being based on our macroeconomic forecasts
formulated in January 2020 and subsequently disclosed in our 2019 annual results announcement.
Given the rapid escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the material changes to the economic outlook
since 3 March 2020, these macroeconomic forecasts are no longer valid. As a result, shareholders are
herewith advised that Nedbank Group’s 2020 financial guidance as provided in our annual results
announcement on 3 March 2020, has been withdrawn and our medium and long-term targets are under
review.

This withdrawal of guidance for 2020 is in line with similar announcements made recently by many
companies on the JSE. We will continue to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and will provide
appropriate disclosures and updates when sufficient clarity and certainty exists.

The Nedbank Group board and management support the lockdown actions taken by governments in
the markets where we have operations. As determined by the respective governments, Nedbank’s
banking and financial services have remained open during the lockdowns to ensure clients can continue
to receive essential services. Our primary focus is to keep our staff safe and to support our clients in
managing their finances through this difficult period, while maintaining our responsibilities to all our
stakeholders.

In March we established a Group Executive Steering Committee to oversee all our Covid-19 related
actions and risk management processes. This committee reports to the Nedbank Group Board and is
supported by a Covid-19 Pandemic Steering Committee, focusing on operational matters including the
safety of our staff and managing business continuity plans; a Liquidity Steering Committee focusing on
maintaining our strong liquidity profile; and a Credit Steering Committee overseeing the management of
credit risks and the support that is being provided to clients in good standing.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank
Group’s auditors. Shareholders are further advised that this is not a trading statement as per paragraph
3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

UPDATE ON THE NEDBANK GROUP FINAL 2019 DIVIDEND IN CONTEXT OF THE SARB
GUIDANCE NOTE G4/2020

Nedbank Group notes the SARB’s guidance note G4/2020: “Recommendations on the distribution of
dividends on ordinary shares and payment of cash bonuses to executive officers and material risk
takers, in light of the negative economic impact of the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic and
the temporary regulatory capital relief provided by the Prudential Authority” and we are supportive of the
guidance. We also refer shareholders to the explanations provided by the Deputy Governor of the SA
Reserve Bank in this regard during a teleconference he hosted with analysts and investors at 9:30 am
on Tuesday, 7 April 2020.

Our current assessment of the guidance note and related explanations is that it distinguishes between
those dividends that are already declared and as a result the relevant legal requirements that the
guidance note refers to (ie S46 of the Companies Act) are therefore applicable; and those future
declarations and related distributions that are expected not to take place while the Covid-19 pandemic
uncertainty continues.

As a result of this assessment, Nedbank Group currently expects that the 2019 final dividend of 695
cents per ordinary share will be paid on Monday, 20 April 2020, in accordance with the declaration
announcement made on 3 March 2020. Future dividend declarations and related distributions will be
impacted for so long as the guidance note is applicable. Management and the Board are consulting their
advisors and monitoring evolving developments in this regard and will make further announcements as
necessary.

Nedbank Group remains well capitalised with a strong liquidity profile.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by Nedbank
Group’s auditors.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, PRESCRIBED OFFICERS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2020 COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEMES

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following information is
disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors, prescribed officers and the company secretary of Nedbank
Group and Nedbank Limited.

The following shares have been committed by the executive directors, prescribed officers and the company secretary
to the 2020 Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)     in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme, deferred bonus amounts are invested in the Matched Share
        Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee resign and not be classified as a good
        leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank
        Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results come to light during the deferral
        period. In these instances, the employee also forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount
        subject to forfeiture;

(b)     in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax bonus (less any
        amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme set out above) can be used to acquire
        shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into the Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the
        employee can commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s
        total after-tax bonus less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme. The
        employee can dispose of these shares at any time prior to the vesting date, which will cancel their
        participation in the scheme in respect of those shares, and will render them ineligible to qualify for any
        matching of shares.

The date of the transactions (off-market) was 31 March 2020 (the inception date) and the value of the shares was
determined using a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 23 March 2020 and 25 March
2020.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person has remained in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date may be matched on a
one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2020 to 2022 is met.

For executive directors, prescribed officers (and all other members of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee), the
performance condition of the Nedbank matched share scheme was extended to 100%, ie. 100% of the shares held in
the trust on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis only if the predetermined company performance
target for the period 2020 to 2022 is met and if the person has remained in the employ of the company throughout
the vesting period.

VESTING OF SHARES TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED OFFICERS: 2017 COMPULSORY BONUS SHARE
SCHEME (CBSS)

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors and prescribed officers of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2017 CBSS. This is not classified
as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

In terms of the CBSS, compulsory deferred bonus amounts could be invested in the Matched Share Scheme for a
period of three years. The deferred amount would be forfeited should the employee resign before the end of the
deferral period and not be classified as a good leaver, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank
Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral period.
In these instances, the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares owned by them committed into the CBSS but no rights to
dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the requisite Matched Shares are
delivered to the Participant at the end of the three-year period.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person continued in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date would be matched
on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2017 to 2019 was met.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE
Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) press release
on 31 March 2020 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group.

Moody’s downgraded the long-term local currency and foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank
Limited to ba1 from baa3. The outlook on all the bank’s long-term deposit ratings and long-term issuer
ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody's decision on 27 March 2020 to downgrade the Government of South
Africa’s long-term foreign currency and local currency issuer ratings to Ba1 from Baa3, and retain the
outlook as negative. The South African sovereign ratings act as a ceiling and the rating of banks cannot
be above that of the sovereign.

The Moody’s press release stated: ‘Moody’s downgraded the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of
Nedbank Limited to Ba1 from Baa3 primarily as a result of the increasingly difficult operating conditions,
and our expectation that the bank’s profitability and asset quality metrics will deteriorate over the next
12 months. However, Nedbank's BCA of Ba1 continues to reflect the bank's solid local franchise and
material investments in digitisation and information technology and its resilient capitalisation (a reported
Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11,5%, as of December 2019). Nedbank’s asset quality metrics
deteriorated only marginally over 2019 with NPLs rising to 3,6% as of December-end 2019 from 3,5%
as of December-end 2018.’

Moody’s further noted that: ‘The negative outlook of the South African banks' ratings reflects our
expectation that the weak economic environment will increase the downside risks for bank’s credit
profiles. The challenging operating environment will translate to higher impairments for the banks;
exerting negative pressure on revenues and testing the resilient performance they have demonstrated
in recent years. However, Moody's does not anticipate that the asset quality deterioration will materially
compromise banks’ capitalisation. The negative outlook on the bank is aligned with the outlook on the
sovereign rating, which reflects downside risks around economic growth and fiscal metrics, that could
lead to an even more rapid and sizeable increase in the debt burden, further lowering debt affordability
and potentially weakening South Africa’s access to funding’.

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Long-term local currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Long-term foreign currency deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3,
        outlook remains negative.
    -   Counterparty Risk Rating of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to Baa3/P-3 from Baa2/P-2.
    -   Senior Unsecured MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to (P)Ba1 from (P)Baa3.
    -   Subordinate MTN of Nedbank Limited: Downgraded to (P)Ba2 from (P)Ba1.

The Moody’s downgrade, taken in isolation of any other matters, is expected to have an immaterial
impact on Nedbank Group’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and therefore the impact on regulatory capital
is also expected to be immaterial. In addition, the downgrade is expected to have a small impact on the
group’s cost of funds over time, as a result of the group being largely domiciled in SA and raising most
of its deposits and funding in the closed rand system, with very little mismatch between foreign
denominated funding and foreign denominated assets.

The prescribed officers and the company secretary are now entitled to 52,4% of the restricted shares
allocated with performance-based vesting criteria on 15 March 2017, and 100% of the restricted

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Good strategic and operational progress and solid franchise fundamentals,
but financial performance below expectations

In 2019 SA economic growth was much slower than expected as recessionary-
like conditions prevailed. This was mainly due to severe and frequent power
outages, the unsustainable fiscal trajectory and ongoing policy
uncertainty, combined with a deteriorating global outlook. Under these
difficult domestic conditions, company profits and household finances
deteriorated during the year, resulting in subdued credit demand, lower
transactional volume growth and rising defaults in the SA banking industry.

In this environment Nedbank Group's financial performance was below
expectations as headline earnings declined 7,3% to R12,5bn and the group
produced an ROE (excluding goodwill) of 16,0%. In addition to the
challenging environment, headline earnings were impacted by additional
items in the second half of the year, including hyperinflation in Zimbabwe
(R142m headline earnings impact) and the raising of impairments against
recoverability of recognised intercompany legacy debt (R44m), the exercise
of an option that will increase our shareholding in Banco Unico (R140m)
from 50% plus one share to approximately 87,5% (subject to regulatory
approval), the revaluing of a number of private equity investments as the
underlying investee company performance was weaker and public market
multiples declined (R238m), and the increase in impairments to just above
the midpoint of our target range of 60 bps to 100 bps as a result of
increased impairments raised on certain CIB watchlist items and an increase
in the central impairment. This was partially offset by good cost
management due to the ongoing benefits from optimisation of processes and
operations as part of our digital journey, and as a result our cost-to-
income ratio improved from 57,2% to 56,5%.

We continued to make good strategic and operational progress throughout the
year and produced solid balance sheet growth with advances up 7,2% and
deposits growing 9,5%. A key focus was the operational rollout of our
digital onboarding capability for individuals visiting branches and using
the Money app and online banking, alongside our ability to sell current
accounts and personal loans digitally, as well as pilots for cards,
investment products and overdrafts. In addition, we launched our refreshed
loyalty and rewards programme together with various market-leading digital
innovations. As our clients began to experience the value from our digital
journey and improved service levels, Nedbank ended the year as the only SA
bank to have improved its net promoter score (NPS) and on client
satisfaction metrics became the second highest-rated bank in SA.

SA's economic growth prospects remain subdued, undermined by persistent
energy constraints, weak government finances and slow progress on
structural reforms combined with a weaker outlook for global growth. In
this difficult SA macroeconomic environment, where we currently forecast
GDP growth in 2020 to be only 0,7%, and given our 2019 base, our guidance
for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2020 is to be around
nominal GDP growth. Our medium- to long-term financial targets for ROE
(excluding goodwill) and the cost-to-income ratio in 2020 were communicated
to the market in early 2018, when GDP growth was forecast to be materially
higher than what has transpired and as a result credit growth and interest
rates (endowment impact) were also forecast to be higher than what took
place. To reflect the deterioration in these metrics since 2018 we have
revised the timelines for achievement of these medium- to long-term
financial targets to be more reflective of the current weaker economic
environment, which we expect to persist. For ROE (now including goodwill),
our medium-term target (two to three years) is now greater than 17% and our
long-term target (five or more years) is greater than cost of equity plus
4%. For the cost-to-income ratio we are now targeting less than 53% in the
medium term and less than 50% in the long term as our digital journey
matures and enables ongoing efficiencies.

NEDBANK GROUP EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP APPOINTMENTS

Nedbank Group announces that Brian Kennedy (59), Group Managing Executive:
Nedbank Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB), reaches the mandatory retirement
age of 60 next month and retires on 31 March 2020 after more than 24 years at
Nedbank. Brian led the Capital Markets business in Nedbank following the merger
with BoE in 2003 and in November of that year was appointed to the Group
Executive Committee (Group Exco), with the mandate to develop the investment
banking franchise known as Nedbank Capital. During his tenure, Brian has been
actively involved in the design and execution of innovative solutions for top
corporates and parastatals in SA and across Africa as well as attracting top
investment banking talent to Nedbank. He has been instrumental in developing and
driving strategy, culture and new business initiatives as well as overseeing the
merger of Nedbank Capital with Nedbank Corporate in 2015 to create the client
centric integrated investment banking franchise now known as Nedbank CIB.

Following an extensive internal and external process, we are pleased to announce
that Anél Bosman (53) has been appointed to succeed Brian as the Group Managing
Executive: Nedbank CIB and as a member of Group Exco with effect from 1 April
2020, reporting to the Chief Executive, Mike Brown. Anél obtained her BCom
(Econometrics) (Hons) (Cum Laude) from the University of Johannesburg in 1988
and a M.Phil (Economics) from the University of Cambridge in 1990. Anél has had
an 18 year career at Nedbank CIB and its predecessors and this will facilitate a
seamless transition. She started her career at Nedbank as a trader, heading up the
Multi-disciplinary desk and was then appointed as the Head of Risk for Nedbank
Capital from 2005 to 2010.

After a short period as CFO and Head of Strategy for Nedbank Capital, she was
appointed as the Chief Operating Officer for the cluster in 2011. In 2015, Anél was
appointed as Managing Executive for Nedbank CIB Markets, with responsibility for all
trading activities in Nedbank as well as wholesale funding. Over the last five years,
this business has grown earnings consistently, increased market presence by
investing in talent and technology across various asset classes and has established
a strong market franchise.

Given Nedbank’s ongoing focus on growth opportunities on the African continent, Dr
Terence Sibiya (50), Managing Executive: Nedbank Africa Regions, has been
appointed as a member of Group Exco with effect from 1 April 2020 (subject to
regulatory approval) and will report to Chief Executive, Mike Brown. Prior to starting
his current role in 2018, Terence was the Managing Executive: Client Coverage in
Nedbank CIB. Before joining Nedbank in 2011, Terence was the Executive and
Head of Power, Infrastructure, Construction, Oil, Gas & Renewable Energy in the
Corporate and Investment Banking Division of the Standard Bank Group.

Terence holds a B.Sc (Information and Decision Systems) from Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, USA; Masters and Doctoral degrees in Instructional Systems
Design and Information Technology from the University of Pittsburgh in the USA; as
well as an Advanced Management Programme qualification from Duke University.

Mike Brown, Chief Executive, and the rest of the Group Exco wish to thank Brian for
his valuable contribution to Nedbank Group, and look forward to working with Anél
and Terence.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE DISPOSAL OF NEDBANK MALAWI LIMITED (""NEDBANK MALAWI"")

Nedbank Group refers shareholders to the market announcement by Frankfurt-listed fintech and African
banking group, MyBucks S.A. (""MyBucks"").

Nedbank Group and Nedgroup Investments Africa (together, ""Nedbank"") have agreed to dispose of, and
MyBucks Banking Corporation Limited (""MyBucks Malawi"") has agreed to acquire, in one composite,
indivisible transaction, 100% of the issued shares of Nedbank Malawi and the cession and delegation of a
term loan from Nedbank Limited to Nedbank Malawi (the ""Disposal""). MyBucks Malawi is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of MyBucks.

The Disposal is subject to suspensive conditions that are standard for a transaction of this nature. The
Disposal has been approved by the Reserve Bank of Malawi and is still subject to the approval from the
relevant competition authority, being the Common Market of East and Southern Africa.

The Disposal follows a strategic review by Nedbank Group. As at 30 June 2019, Nedbank Malawi contributed
less than 0,1% to Nedbank Group's headline earnings and total assets and its market share in Malawi was
approximately 1%.

Nedbank Group remains committed to grow its operations in SADC, explore opportunities in East Africa, and
strengthen its strategic alliance with Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (underpinned by a 21%
shareholding) in Central and West Africa.

About Nedbank Malawi
Nedbank Malawi currently has 11 branches in various cities in Malawi with just short of 42,000 customers,
which it services through three divisions: Retail, Small and Medium Enterprises and Wholesale / Treasury.

About MyBucks
MyBucks S.A. is a company domiciled in Luxembourg that delivers financial services through technology.
MyBucks operates in six African countries through its brands GetBucks, GetSure, MBC, and Opportunity
Bank. The Group offers credit, banking solutions and insurance products to customers.

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY STANDARD AND POOR'S

Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) press release on 26
November 2019 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group. S&P has affirmed the  BB/B' long- and short-
term global scale ratings of Nedbank Limited and changed its outlook from stable to negative. At the
same time, S&P lowered their long-term national scale ratings on Nedbank Limited, and affirmed their
'zaA-1+' short-term national scale ratings on the entity.

This rating action follows S&P's decision on 22 November 2019 to revise its outlook on South Africa
from stable to negative. S&P noted that:  We do not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the
foreign currency sovereign ratings, due to the direct and indirect impacts a sovereign distress would
have on banks' operations. That said, we acknowledge that, amid challenging macro and industry
changes, South Africa's banking performance has been fairly resilient. We expect sector-wide
pressure on revenues but broadly, stable earnings as banks continue to streamline costs'.

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -   Affirmed the  BB/B' long- and short-term global scale ratings and changed its outlook from
        stable to negative
    -   Lowered the long-term national scale ratings from  zaAA+' to  zaAA'
    -   Affirmed the 'zaA-1+' short-term national scale ratings

CREDIT RATINGS ACTION BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE

Shareholders and noteholders are referred to the Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) press release
on 5 November 2019 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank
Limited, the 100%-owned subsidiary of Nedbank Group. Moody's has affirmed the Baa3 long-term
deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited and changed its outlook from stable to negative.

This rating action follows Moody's decision on 1 November 2019 to affirm South Africa's issuer rating
of Baa3 but change its outlook from stable to negative. Moody's noted that:  The affirmation of the
banks' ratings captures their resilient financial profiles so far despite South Africa's challenging
operating environment. The five South African banks have improved their liquidity metrics and
maintained robust risk management frameworks, limiting the negative implications of a persistently low
growth environment. Moody's expects banks' profitability and capital metrics to remain stable over the
next 12 months.' and  The negative outlook of the banks' ratings is primarily driven by the negative
outlook on the South African government's issuer rating given banks' high stocks of government debt
securities, held as part of their liquidity requirements, that links their credit profiles to that of the
government.'

The specific rating changes for Nedbank Limited are as follows:
    -    Long-term deposit ratings of Nedbank Limited: Affirmed Baa3, outlook changed from stable to
         negative.

UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

Good strategic and operational progress and a resilient financial
performance in a difficult environment

The SA economy performed worse than expected in the first six months of
2019 and our forecast for SA GDP growth for 2019 has been revised down from
1,3% to 0,5%. Significantly more urgency is required with the
implementation of structural reforms to stem the economic and fiscal
deterioration currently being experienced in the SA economy. If we are
unable to do this, all the hard work done on maintaining our last
investment grade rating from Moody's will be in vain, at great cost to all
South Africans as a result of higher inflation and higher interest rates,
as well as lower growth and lower levels of employment than would otherwise
have been the case.

The group's financial performance was resilient as headline earnings
increased 2,6% to R6,9bn and we produced an ROE (excluding goodwill) of
17,9%. Revenue growth was ahead of cost growth, resulting in
preprovisioning operating-profit growth of 7,0% and the cost-to-income
ratio improving to 55,4%. As expected, impairments increased off the low
prior-year base and the CLR to within the bottom half of our through-the-
cycle target range. We maintained a strong balance sheet with a CET1 ratio
of 11,3% and a strong liquidity profile. The interim dividend per share
increased by 3,6% to 720 cents per share.

A key milestone in our Managed Evolution digital journey, to position
Nedbank as a market-leading digital bank, was reached in June 2019 as we
operationalised a new and materially faster digital onboarding capability
for individual clients in all our branches, alongside the ability to sell
both a current account and personal loan digitally. Initial client feedback
has been excellent, and we remain hard at work to deliver a similar
capability for juristic client onboarding as well as the first release of
an exciting new loyalty and rewards programme in the second half of 2019.
We continued to grow main-banked clients across all our business clusters,
underpinning solid NIR growth.

In support of our purpose of using our financial expertise to do good, we
continue to play a leading role in contributing to society and the
environment. We enabled more than 3 300 new job opportunities for
previously unemployed youth as we activated our commitment to invest 1,5%
of our SA net profit after tax in the Youth Employment Service (YES)
initiative, we achieved level 1 BBBEE contributor status under the new
Amended Financial Sector Code and we became SA's first commercial bank to
launch a green bond on the JSE.

In the context of slower-than-expected SA GDP growth we have slightly
revised our guidance for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for
2019 to around nominal GDP growth (from previously greater than or equal to
nominal GDP growth).

DIRECTORS

The boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank (‘the Companies') are pleased to announce the
appointment of Professor Tshilidzi Marwala as an independent non-executive director with effect from
27 May 2019.

In terms of the Nedbank Group Board Continuity Programme, the boards of the Companies had
previously identified the need to strengthen its Cyber, Digital, Technology and Innovation skills.
Having followed a very detailed and comprehensive succession process, the boards concluded that
Professor Marwala's skills and experience in the aforementioned areas would be of great benefit.

Professor Marwala is an accomplished scholar with multi-disciplinary research interests that include
the theory and application of artificial intelligence to engineering, computer science, finance, social
science and medicine. He has an extensive track record in human capacity development and has
published 15 books in artificial intelligence. Professor Marwala is the Vice Chancellor and Principal of
the University of Johannesburg and prior to this he was the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research and
Internationalisation and Executive Dean of Engineering and the Built Environment both at the
University of Johannesburg. He was recently appointed as Deputy Chair of the Presidential
Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Vassi Naidoo, Chairman of Nedbank Group, welcomed Prof Marwala to the boards and said: ‘We look
forward to Tshilidzi's contribution on the Boards, and his extensive experience in IT will greatly
complement Nedbank Group's strategic push in digital across our businesses'.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2019 COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEMES

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following information is
disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors and the company secretary of Nedbank Group and Nedbank
Limited.

The following shares have been committed by the executive directors and the company secretary to the 2019
Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)     in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme, deferred bonus amounts can be invested in the Matched
        Share Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee resign and not be classified as a
        good leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the
        Nedbank Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results come to light during
        the deferral period. In these instances, the employee also forgoes the right to matching on the deferred
        bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)     in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme, up to 50% of an employee's total after-tax bonus (less any
        amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme set out above) can be used to acquire
        shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into the Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the
        employee can commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee's
        total after-tax bonus less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus share scheme. The
        employee can dispose of these shares at any time prior to the vesting date, which will cancel their
        participation in the scheme in respect of those shares, and will render them ineligible to qualify for any
        matching of shares.

The date of the transactions (off-market) was 31 March 2019 (the inception date) and the value of the shares was
determined using a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 22 March 2019 and 26 March
2019.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant's portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person has remained in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date may be matched on a
one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2019 to 2021 is met.

For executive directors (and all members of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee), the performance condition of
the Nedbank matched share scheme was extended to 100%, ie. 100% of the shares held in the trust on vesting date
may be matched on a one-for-one basis only if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2019 to
2021 is met.

VESTING OF SHARES TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS: 2016 MATCHED SHARE SCHEME

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2016 Matched Share Scheme.
This is not classified as a ‘dealing' in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

(a)     In terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme (CBSS), compulsory deferred bonus amounts could be
        invested in the Matched Share Scheme for a period of three years. The deferred amount would be forfeited
        should the employee resign before the end of the deferral period and not be classified as a good leaver, as
        well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material irregularities or
        misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral period. In these instances, the
        employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)     In terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme (VBSS), up to 50% of an employee's total after-tax bonus (less
        any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set out above) could be used to
        acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would then be committed into the Matched Share Scheme for a
        period of three years. Alternatively, the employee could commit shares already owned by them up to an
        equivalent amount of 50% of the employee's total after-tax bonus less any amount already deferred under
        the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these shares at any time prior to the
        end of the deferral period, which would cancel their participation in the scheme in respect of those shares
        and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares owned by them committed into the Matched Share
Scheme but no rights to dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the
requisite Matched Shares are delivered to the Participant at the end of the three year period.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in trust in
respect of the participant's portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person continued in the employ
of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held on vesting date would be matched
on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target for the period 2016 to 2018 was met.

Preliminary Audited Results
for the year ended 31 December 2018

A year of achievement across a broad front

In 2018 Nedbank Group seamlessly concluded the process of managed separation
from Old Mutual and delivered a resilient financial performance, boosted by the
ongoing turnaround in our share of associate income from ETI. Headline earnings
increased 14,5% to R13,5bn and ROE (excluding goodwill) improved from 16,4%
to 17,9%. Revenue growth accelerated in the second half of the year and, as
expected, impairments increased gradually, reflecting excellent risk management
and a high-quality book. We maintained a strong balance sheet, as evident in our
IFRS 9 fully phased-in CET1 ratio of 11,7% (which includes the 34 bps impact from
the odd-lot offer completed in December 2018), our strong liquidity profile and the
total dividend per share increasing by 10,1%. Total assets exceeded R1 trillion for the
first time.

We made excellent progress on a number of client satisfaction measures as
we continued to focus on delivery of market-leading client value propositions
supported by our investments in technology, digital platforms and our people. This
was evident in the Nedbank Money app™ receiving the highest client satisfaction
ratings among SA banking apps on iOS devices, our Nedbank Private Wealth app
being rated second best globally by Cutter Associates International Research, and
our Net Promoter Score improving the most among SA banks in 2018. Our progress
in 2018 enabled us to grow our market share of main-banked clients across all our
business clusters, underpinning solid NIR growth. Our strategic enablers, including
ongoing technology investments through our managed evolution programme, our
people, our culture and our brand continue to create a more client-focused, agile,
competitive and digital Nedbank. The innovations we plan to launch during 2019 are
expected to result in another step change in client experiences, enabling ongoing
revenue growth and efficiencies over time.

Our focus on sustainable transformation has resulted in Nedbank achieving level
1 BBBEE contributor status under the new Amended Financial Sector Code, having
been at level 2 for the past 10 years.

From the low base in the SA economy in 2018 we anticipate a slow improvement
in business and consumer confidence, and economic and credit growth in the year
ahead. These assumptions, along with ongoing delivery on our strategy, support our
current guidance for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2019 to be at
or above nominal GDP growth.

2018 results commentary 

BANKING AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
Global economic growth was relatively strong in 2018, although
easing towards the end of the year, impacted by nervousness
in financial markets, higher US interest rates and a decline in
global trade volumes due to increased protectionism among
the world's largest economies. US growth remained robust,
driven mainly by rising business and consumer confidence on
the back of job creation and substantial tax relief. The pace of
activity elsewhere in the developed world slowed noticeably,
impacted by increased political turmoil, poor fiscal discipline
and unsustainable public debt burdens. Performance among
emerging and developing economies diverged significantly as
the year progressed. China's growth slowed, contributing to
a relapse in certain commodity prices, which placed renewed
pressure on the exports of many commodity-producing
countries. Developing countries with high levels of
dollar-denominated debt and low foreign currency reserves
were hardest hit, as debt-service costs increased due to rising
US interest rates and a strong US dollar, triggering capital flight
and causing currency corrections and higher inflation rates.
These global circumstances caused some central banks to hike
interest rates despite deteriorating economic conditions.

While the SA economy recorded a technical recession in the first
half of 2018, real GDP growth for the year recovered to 0,7%.
Although the pace of the recovery remained modest, given the
very low base, the improvement was relatively widespread, with
most major industries recording mild output growth, driven by
firmer domestic spending and stronger exports.

Consumer spending picked up in the second half, but household
finances remain fragile due to high unemployment, subdued
income growth, lower net wealth levels and higher indirect
taxes as a result of the VAT increase. Consumer spending was
largely financed through increased borrowing, with bank credit
extended to households increasing gradually throughout the
year.  

In contrast to the gradual improvement in economic growth,
the slump in fixed investment activity deepened. Capital
outlays by private sector and state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) declined further, while growth in capital expenditure
by government slowed. Consequently, growth in loans to
companies was slow.

Inflation drifted higher for much of 2018, driven by the surge
in fuel prices earlier in the year and higher tariffs on electricity,
water and other services. The inflation outlook has since
improved significantly due to sharp declines in fuel prices
– the result of the reduction in global oil prices, coupled with
a steadier rand towards the end of 2018. After a decline of
25 bps in both July 2017 and March 2018, SARB's Monetary
Policy Committee increased the repo rate in November 2018 by
25 bps. In line with expectations of a benign interest rate
cycle we currently anticipate a further two more increases of
25 bps each by the end of 2020.

Banking conditions remained challenging throughout 2018,
with the weak economic environment resulting in subdued
growth across all categories of credit and transactional
banking, although activity picked up in the second half off a
low base as the economy recovered.

REVIEW OF RESULTS
Nedbank Group produced a solid performance in a difficult
domestic macro and political environment. HE increased 14,5%
to R13 495m, boosted by associate income from ETI returning
to profitability, while our managed operations delivered
positive earnings growth. This translated into an increase
in DHEPS of 13,7% to 2 736 cents and an increase in HEPS
of 13,9% to 2 793 cents. As in previous periods, we highlight
our results, both including and excluding ETI (referred to as
managed operations), to provide a better understanding
of the operational performance of the business given the
historic volatility in ETI's results. As previously communicated,
we will revert to group-level reporting in 2019. Our managed
operations produced HE growth of 2,8% to R13 119m, with
slow NII growth, and higher impairments offset by solid NIR
growth and good cost management.

ROE (excluding goodwill) and ROE improved to 17,9% and
16,8% respectively. These ratios benefited from the reduction
in equity of R3,2bn following the day 1 transitional adjustments
in respect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. The implementation of these
IFRS adjustments had an estimated impact of 0,3% on ROE
(excluding goodwill). As ROE is computed on daily average
equity, the odd-lot offer completed in December 2018 would
have had almost no impact on our 2018 ROE, with the positive
impact of this on ROE being more apparent in 2019. Total
assets for the group exceeded the R1 trillion mark for the first
time during 2018. ROA increased 11 bps to 1,33% and return on
RWA increased from 2,28% to 2,40%.

NAV per share of 17 559 cents increased 3,3%. The benefits
from strong growth in earnings were offset by the
day 1 impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (R3,2bn), the odd-lot
offer (R2,0bn), accounting for the anticipated impact of ETI
changing to the NAFEX exchange rate (R361m), and Zimbabwe
currency devaluation estimates (R499m). Excluding these
impacts, NAV per share would have increased by 9,2%.

Our IFRS 9 fully phased-in CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios
of 11,7% and 12,5% respectively, average LCR for the
fourth quarter of 109,4% and an NSFR of 114,0% are all
Basel III-compliant and are a reflection of a strong balance
sheet. On the back of strong earnings growth and our capital
position a final dividend of 720 cents was declared, an increase
of 6,7%. The total dividend per share for the year increased
10,1% to 1 415 cents.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLY TO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Nedbank continues to play an important role in society and in the economy, and we remain committed to delivering on our purpose of
using our financial expertise to do good. We continue to contribute to the wellbeing and growth of the societies in which we operate
by delivering value to our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and society.

For staff 

We currently employ 31 277 staffmembers, and invested
R468m in training and paid salaries and benefits of R17,5bn.
Our bargaining unit staff received annual salary increases
of 7,0% in 2018, ahead of inflation, and with management
and executives receiving lower increases of around 5%, the
blended average staff salaries increased by 5,8%. As part
of our groupwide People 2020 programme aimed at
transforming and aligning our culture and talent with our
strategic objectives, we refreshed our executive management
programmes to be more digitally focused, with more
than 70 senior leaders having participated in immersive
learning experiences (the Executive Business Transformation
programme), with exposure to Silicon Cape, Silicon Savannah
(Kenya) and Silicon Valley (USA). On the back of increased
training spend, we achieved 14,4 points for skills development
under the new amended FSC scorecard, a notable increase
from 12,8 in 2017. We implemented New Ways of Work
(nWoW) practices to transform Nedbank into a more
agile organisation, holistically rethinking the way we work,
communicate and manage talent on our journey to creating
a high-performing culture. More than 1 500 staffmembers
are working according to this new approach and we aim to
increase this number incrementally to support an optimal
agile scaling framework over the 2019 period. Transformation
remains a key imperative to ensure Nedbank remains relevant
in a transforming society and we have continued to focus on
this across all levels at Nedbank, from our board of directors
to all our staffmembers. Currently black representation at
board level is 63%, at executive is 46% and for our total staff
at just more than 78%. Female representation at board level
is 25%, at executive 46% and for total staff at 62%.  

For clients 

We supported our clients by advancing R181bn (2017:
R153bn) of new loans to enable them to finance their homes,
vehicles and education, and to grow their businesses, while
safeguarding R826bn of deposits at competitive rates.
Our clients' access to banking improved through our network
of 1 076 Intelligent Depositor devices and we increased the
total number of digitally focused branches to 363 or 60%
of all outlets. Digitally active and enabled clients grew as
we launched new market-leading digital innovations, such
as MobiMoney, and 70 new services through our apps and
new online banking site. The Nedbank Money app™ has been
downloaded 1,6 million times since its launch in November
2017. Our Net Promoter Score is second-highest among
full-service banks in SA, and under this measure we posted
the largest improvement in client experience of any major
bank in SA last year (up 11% to 37%), while our market
share of main-banked clients in retail increased from 12,7%
to 13,1%. In recognition of the market-leading innovations
and CVPs launched, Nedbank won The International Banker
award for Best Innovation in Retail Banking SA 2018 as
well as The Banker Africa's award for Best Corporate Bank
in SA. Nedgroup Investments was named Offshore
Management Company of the Year for the fourth consecutive
year at the Raging Bull Awards. 

For shareholders

Notwithstanding some market concerns of a potential share
overhang as a result of the Old Mutual managed separation,
Nedbank ended the year as the top-performing SA bank
share, up 7,3%, performing 15,6% above the FINI 15 index and
delivering a TSR of 12,6%. The total dividend declared was up
10,1%. Eligible shareholders who participated in the odd-lot
offer received a 5% premium on the 10-day VWAP of the
Nedbank Group ordinary share at the close of business on
Monday, 3 December 2018, without incurring any transaction
costs or brokerage fees. We significantly expanded our investor
engagement activities ahead of the Old Mutual managed
separation and engaged constructively with the investment
community in over 400 meetings during 2018. At our 51st AGM
all resolutions were passed, with more than 90% of votes
in favour. Following engagements with shareholders and
enhancements to our remuneration practices, we were pleased
that our remuneration policy and disclosures received more than
99% of votes in favour. We continued to ensure transparent,
relevant and timeous reporting and disclosure to shareholders,
and were acknowledged by the Investment Analyst Society
as the leader in corporate reporting in the banking sector and
the Nedbank Group Integrated Report continued to be ranked
in the top tier of JSE-listed companies. Nedbank's valuation
metrics remain attractive with price/earnings and price-to-book
ratios of 9,8 times and 1,6 times respectively and a dividend
yield of 5,0% at 31 December 2018.

For regulators

We attained Basel III requirements ahead of full compliance
timelines, including a strong capital position, achieving a
CET1 ratio of 11,7% (after the fully phased-in day 1 impact of
IFRS 9, the impact of IFRS 15 and the impact of the odd-lot
offer), an average LCR of 109,4% in the fourth quarter of
2018 and an NSFR of 114,0% at December 2018. We have
invested over R100bn in government and public sector
bonds as part of our HQLA requirements and, in doing so,
remain committed to making a meaningful contribution to
the countries in which we operate, thereby appropriately
supporting the funding needs of governments. Cash taxation
contributions of R10,3bn were made relating to direct, indirect,
pay-as-you-earn and other taxation. We continued to work
closely with all our regulators to ensure delivery of the various
regulatory programmes including completion of POPI/privacy
requirements and finalisation of the SA remediation and
thematic sanctions review within anti-money-laundering
(AML), combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) and
sanctions legislation. We implemented IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on
1 January 2018, with a fully phased-in impact of 21 bps on our
CET1 ratio at 1 January 2018, inclusive of our share of ETI's own
transitional IFRS 9 impact. 

For society

We understand that our long-term sustainability and
success are contingent on the degree to which we deliver value
to society. Through the considered development and delivery
of products and services that satisfy societal needs we play
our part to enable a thriving society, create long-term value,
maintain trust and ensure the success of our brand. This is
particularly important in the current context of SA as well as
the broader African continent.

We have adopted the United Nations Sustainable
Developments Goals (SDGs) as a framework for measuring
delivery on our purpose. Key highlights include:

-    Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) – We continue to
     engage with private and public sector stakeholders to
     provide assistance, advisory services and finance to address
     the water challenges facing individuals, businesses and the
     country as a whole. Our financial commitments, in support
     of the WWF, to remove water-sapping invasive alien trees
     around water catchment areas will see the release of an
     additional one billion litres of water annually.

-    Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) – We closed a
     further 12 renewable-energy project deals to the value
     of R13bn under round 4 of the REIPPPP. In all projects
     completed to date Nedbank has arranged and funded a
     total of 42 transactions, underwriting a total of R40bn.
     In 2018 almost R1bn of our lending into property finance
     incorporated the installation of solar power. In 2018 we
     undertook not to provide new project financing or other
     forms of asset-specific financing where the proceeds would
     be used to develop a new coal-fired power plant, regardless
     of country or technology. This commitment extends to
     round 1 of SA's Coal Baseload Procurement Programme.

-    Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) – We
     launched the Nedbank Stokvel Account to provide safe, easy
     and effective ways for groups of individuals to pool their
     savings and grow their money collectively. Since its launch
     it has attracted over 1 600 stokvel groups with more than
     48 000 members. 

-    Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9) – We
     participated in the US$50m ECIC-backed facility to the
     Nacala Railway Corridor and Port Project in Mozambique
     and Malawi. The project is a key regional infrastructure
     initiative providing a significant socioeconomic benefit to
     the region. We promote innovation through our corporate
     sponsorships of Startupbootcamp AfriTech (SA) and the Plug
     and Play fintech based in San Francisco. These programmes
     assist us to identify the top technology disruptors globally
     and across the African continent for both our own and our
     clients' benefit.

-    Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) – We introduced, in
     partnership with Ecobank, a crossborder remittance solution
     that allows people living and working in SA to transfer money
     instantly to friends and families in 33 countries across Africa.

-    Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) – We
     disbursed R1,2bn towards the development of new
     affordable-housing in commercial-property finance, and
     almost R1bn in home loans. Funding of R4,8bn was provided
     for the construction of buildings that conform to green
     building standards.

-    In our own operations:
     -  Through  our support of the WWF-SA Water Balance
        Programme, which removes alien-invasive, water-hungry
        trees from our strategic water source areas. We are
        effectively a net-zero operation water user.

     -  We  increased our BBBEE contributor status to
        level 1 measured under the Amended Financial Sector
        Code (FSC), gazetted in terms of section 9(1) of the
        BBBEE Act, 53 of 2003, and have now maintained
        level 2 or higher for 10 consecutive years.

     -  We invested R124m in socioeconomic development, with
        more than 50% allocated to education.

     -  A total of 78% of our procurement spend was used to
        support local SA business, up from 75% in 2017.

-    We continued to participate in the CEO Initiative, working
     with government, business and labour towards a more
     inclusive SA society. We have been part of the leadership
     team in the credit ratings workstream, have committed
     R20m to the R1,5bn SME Fund and will become a participant
     in the Youth Employment Service, in which we, as corporate
     SA, aim to provide internship opportunities for more than
     one million South Africans. For Nedbank, starting during
     2019, this is estimated to translate into an annual cost equal
     to approximately 1,5% of net profit after tax (SA business),
     supporting more than 3 000 youth through internal or
     sponsored placements. 

-    Our #VaxTheNation initiative served as a call to action
     for all South Africans to get involved and make access
     to vaccinations a reality. Over 430 000 people have
     been vaccinated since December 2018, leaving a lasting
     impact as we support the most vulnerable people in society.

CLUSTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Nedbank's managed operations generated HE growth of
2,8% to R13 119m and delivered an ROE (excluding goodwill) of
17,7%. It should be noted that in this disclosure format of our
results all costs are allocated to managed operations and no
apportionment is made to the ETI result.

CIB grew HE by 6,3% to R6,7bn, while delivering an attractive
ROE of 20,0%. HE growth was underpinned by a very strong
18,9% growth in NIR. Growth in banking advances was slow, but
increased in the latter part of the year. Credit quality remained
excellent through proactive risk management resulting from
close monitoring and management of exposures to stressed
sectors of the economy, such as construction and cement, as
well as certain SOEs.

HE in RBB increased by 1,5% to R5,4bn, which was negatively
impacted by the higher levels of coverage on new business as
a result of the introduction of IFRS 9 and changes to loyalty
scheme accounting due to IFRS 15 – these reduced HE growth
by 4,9%. The ROE at 18,9% was well above the group's cost of
equity. The growth momentum of Retail advances has been
maintained and the CLR was flat, reflecting a high-quality
portfolio and remaining below the TTC target range. Underlying
transactional NIR growth was solid, supported by the 6,9%
growth in main-banked client numbers. Low expense growth
reflects the ongoing benefit of optimising processes and
operations, including headcount reductions of 698, largely
through natural attrition.

Nedbank Wealth grew HE 6,1% to R1,1bn and maintained an
attractive ROE of 26,8%. These results were attributable
to solid performances in Insurance and the international Wealth
Management business, muted growth in Asset Management
and a decline in earnings in the local Wealth Management
business. 

RoA's HE increased strongly as our share of associate
income from our investment in ETI returned to profitability.
Our RoA subsidiaries also grew HE strongly as benefits
emerge from the recent investments we have made in the
franchises as a platform to create scale. During the year
we also benefited from impairment recoveries. The difficult
environment in Zimbabwe resulted in a judgemental
negative FCTR adjustment to equity of R755m before minorities
(R499m after minorities) as we anticipated possible impacts on
Nedbank's NAV from exchange rate movements in Zimbabwe.
No income statement changes were made in 2018 as these are
not material, and we policy clarification from regulators.

The performance in the Centre reflects the impact of central
provision releases in the prior year of R252m after tax (none in
2018) and fair-value gains of R199m after tax in 2017 largely
not repeated in 2018. On the back of IFRS 9 changes, we
implemented a central macro fair-value hedge accounting
solution in 2018 that will result in lower accounting volatility
in NIR on our hedged portfolios in future. A postretirement
medical aid (PRMA) credit amounting to R180m after tax was
recorded in the first half of the year and the balance of the
credit of a similar amount after tax is expected to be realised
in 2019 when the restructure of the scheme is complete. Final
costs of R77m relating to the managed separation were
recorded in 2018 (cumulative costs since 2016 were R142m).

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Growth in key lines of the statement of comprehensive
income was impacted by the implementation of IFRS 9 and
IFRS 15 accounting changes effective 1 January 2018 without
any restatement of the 2017 comparative numbers. After
the adoption of IFRS 9: (a) suspended interest on the
non-recoverable portion of the specific defaulted book is no
longer recognised as NII, with full impairments previously being
raised; (b) higher levels of portfolio provisions are raised on
new loans compared with IAS 39; and (c) certain initiation fees
previously recognised as NIR are now amortised to NII through
the effective-interest-rate method. Under IFRS 15 costs of our
rewards programme were previously recognised as an expense,
but are now recognised as a reduction in NIR.  

Net interest income
NII increased 4,3% to R28 819m, ahead of AIEBA growth of
3,6%. AIEBA grew 0,8% in the first half of the year and 2,8%
in the second half. AIEBA growth adjusted for IFRS opening
balance changes was 4,0%.  

NIM at 3,65% increased from 3,62% recorded in 2017 and is in
line with our guidance. This increase was driven primarily by a
4 bps improvement in asset pricing as well as asset mix benefits
as retail advances grew faster than wholesale advances.
These were offset by a 2 bps negative endowment impact as
the average prime interest rate declined from 10,4% in 2017 to
10,1% in 2018. IFRS changes had a net nil impact on NIM, as a
negative 4 bps impact of IFRS 9 suspended interest was offset
by a positive impact of the IFRS 9 initiation fee. 
Impairments charge on loans and advances

Impairments increased 11,6% to R3 688m and the CLR increased
4 bps to 0,53% as RBB advances - which attract a higher
CLR – grew faster than CIB advances. The CLR benefited from
recoveries of accounts previously provided for in CIB and RoA.
The implementation of IFRS 9 also impacted the treatment of
suspended interest and resulted in the extension of the point of
writeoff. The low CLR continues to be a reflection of Nedbank's
selective advances growth strategy and the high quality of the
portfolio across all our businesses.  

Impairments in CIB decreased marginally from the previous
year, with its CLR at 4 bps remaining below the TTC target
of 15 to 45 bps. The CIB CLR is a reflection of a high-quality
book, settlements that enabled the reversal of historic
impairment provisions, a proactive restructure process and
positive traction with the rehabilitation of distressed clients.
Specific impairments are individually determined in CIB
and are dependent on the value of the security we hold for
each exposure. Altogether 71% of specific impairments are
concentrated in approximately 10 counters. 

RBB impairments increased by 6,5% to R3,4bn and include the
impact of IFRS 9, with increases in provision requirements of
R322m on the performing book being offset by reductions in
provisions of R374m due to the revised treatment of interest on
impaired financial advances.

The group's central provision remains unchanged from 2017 at
R150m. This provision is held for risks that may have occurred
but are likely to emerge only in the future and relate to, inter
alia, the macroeconomic environment, including Zimbabwe,
and SOEs. In RBB overlays of R281m were released as the
risks provided against have either been built into our detailed
IFRS 9 models or reassessed. A total of R69m of overlays remain
in RBB, while CIB raised R144m of overlays (relating to risks not
adequately reflected in our IFRS 9 models). These are supportive
of our prudent provisioning approach, which is reflected in total
postwriteoff recoveries of previously fully provided accounts
totalling R1 271m (2017: R1 224m).

Defaulted advances rose 28,9% to R25,2bn, inclusive of a R1,9bn
increase attributable to an extension of our point of writeoff
in RBB to comply prospectively with IFRS 9. On a like-for-like
basis defaulted advances rose 19,4% and increases were evident
across all clusters. The weakened economic environment
placed additional stress on certain specific wholesale counters,
especially within the construction and cement industries. In RBB,
under IFRS 9, a loan is now written off when the group has no
reasonable expectations of recovering the asset partially or in
its entirety. The change in the point of writeoff has resulted in a
R97m reduction in the impairment charge, while increasing our
specific coverage and defaulted advances ratios.

Stage 1 and 2 (portfolio) coverage ratio increased from 0,70%
at 31 December 2017 (under IAS 39) to 0,93% on 1 January 2018,
reflecting the IFRS 9 day 1 impact. The decline to 0,88% at
December 2018 was primarily driven by some stressed clients
in CIB moving into default (stage 3) and the overlay releases
in RBB. Stage 3 (specific) coverage ratio increased from 36,2%
(under IAS 39) to 39,3% on 1 January 2018. Over the course of
2018 stage 3 coverage declined to 36,8%, primarily due to the
change in the defaulted-portfolio mix. RBB stage 3 coverage
increased to 46,0% from 42,5% as a result of higher defaults
caused by the extension of the point of writeoff (as mentioned
before). Stage 3 coverage for CIB decreased to 11,6% from
21,9% due to the successful restructure and repayment of a
few large exposures with higher coverage. Nedbank considers
the coverage ratios appropriate, given the higher proportion
of wholesale lending, compared with the mix of its peers,
high recovery rates and the collateralised nature of the
commercial-mortgages portfolio, with low loan-to-value ratios.

Non-interest revenue 
NIR growth of 7,9% to R25 976m is a reflection of solid gains in
main-banked clients across our retail and wholesale businesses
in SA and the rest of Africa. In addition, NIR growth benefited

from a strong performance in Global Markets and the
finalisation of the round 4 renewable-energy transactions after
several years of delay. This was partially offset by the negative
impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, as well as weaker business
and consumer confidence, lower equity markets and ongoing
subdued levels of client transactional activity.  

-    Commission and fee income grew 6,5% to R18 279m.
     RBB reported good underlying transactional NIR growth,
     supported by solid main-banked client growth across
     entry-level, middle-market, professional and small-business
     client segments. CIB delivered strong growth benefiting
     from the closure of round 4 renewable-energy transactions
     in the second half of 2018 and increased levels of investment
     banking activity.

-    Insurance income increased 6,2% to R1 859m, supported by
     a lower-claims experience in homeowner's cover due to the
     absence of catastrophic weather events experienced in
     relation to the previous year and funeral reserve releases
     owing to lower new-business strain and higher lapses. 

-    Trading income grew strongly by 13,6% to R4 429m,
     supported by growth in equities and debt trading and
     finalisation of the round 4 renewable-energy deals, including
     hedging activities.

-    Private-equity income was marginally down to R697m as
     realisations decreased, partially offset by lower unrealised
     valuation losses. 

Expenses
Expenses grew 6,1% to R31 632m. In the second half of 2018 cost
growth increased due to higher levels of amortisation,
managed-separation costs, STI alignment to earnings growth
and the non-repeat of the PRMA credit recorded in the first
half of 2018. An additional credit from the PRMA, which we
previously anticipated to finalise in the second half of 2018, is
now expected in 2019. The underlying movements included:

-    Staff-related costs increasing at 5,6%, following:
     -  an average annual salary increase of 5,8% and a
        reduction in staff numbers by 610 since December 2017;

     -  a 9,9% increase in STIs in line with the group's financial
        performance and 22,0% increase in LTIs, as expected
        vesting rates have increased as a result of improved
        yoy performance against the group's corporate
        performance targets; and

     -  a settlement with our staff with regard to PRMA
        obligations and benefits, resulting in a provisional pretax
        credit of R250m, recorded in the first half of 2018, in
        respect of a reversal of actuarially estimated liabilities
        previously raised. 

-    Computer-processing costs increasing 11,5% to R4 341m,
     driven by increases in software amortisation and incremental
     software licence costs and higher volumes, offset by reduced
     network-related costs as a result of efficiency savings. 

-    Fees and insurance increasing 11,3% as a result of
     managed-separation costs, association fees driven
     by card-related volume increases and fees related to
     digital innovations.

-    Other cost lines being well managed, with increases below
     inflation, and reflecting the cumulative benefits of R680m
     from implementing our target operating model. 

The group's growth in expenses of 6,1% was below total revenue
and associate income growth of 8,8%, resulting in a positive
JAWS ratio of 2,7% and an efficiency ratio of 57,2%, compared
with 58,6% in the December 2017. The JAWS ratio in managed
operations (inclusive of ETI-related expenses) was -0,1%.

Earnings from associates
Associate income of R608m relating to ETI was the result of ETI
reporting four consecutive quarters of attributable profit from
the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, in line
with our policy of accounting for our share of ETI's attributable
earnings a quarter in arrear. The total effect of ETI on the
group's HE was a profit of R375m, including the R233m impact
of funding costs. 

Accounting for associate income, together with Nedbank's
share of ETI's other comprehensive income and movements in
Nedbank's FCTR and our share of ETI's own IFRS 9 transitional
adjustment, resulted in the carrying value of the group's
strategic investment in ETI decreasing from R3,3bn at
31 December 2017 to R3,2bn at 31 December 2018. This
amount includes a R361m FCTR adjustment to account
for the anticipated impact of ETI changing from using the
official Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate to the
NAFEX exchange rate in translating the results of its Nigerian
operations to US dollars, as announced by ETI in December
2018. ETI's listed share price decreased 17,7% during 2018, which
resulted in the market value of the group's investment in ETI
decreasing to R3,5bn at 31 December 2018, using the official
CBN exchange rate (307 naira:US$) and R2,9bn based on the
NAFEX exchange rate (364 naira:US$). The market value of our
investment at 28 February 2019, based on the NAFEX exchange
rate, was R2,8bn.

In line with IFRS requirements the R1bn impairment provision
recognised by Nedbank against its investment in ETI at
31 December 2016 was reviewed at 31 December 2018 and
management determined that there were no indicators of
further impairment. Our value-in-use computation supports the
current carrying value of our investment. We have observed an
improvement in ETI's recent financial performance, but this is
not yet considered to be a sufficient indicator to release the
full impairment provision or part thereof. Our position will be
reassessed again at 30 June 2019 and at year-end.

A R97m associate loss (2017: R96m loss) was incurred due to
losses from an associate, which is the cash-processing supplier
to the four large banks.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION  
Capital
The group remains well capitalised at levels significantly above
the minimum regulatory requirements. The CET1 ratio of 11,7%
is a reflection of organic capital generation, offset by the
payment of cash dividends to shareholders, 11,1% growth in
RWA, ongoing investment in software development costs as
part of the group's Managed Evolution programme, accounting
for the full impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 and
IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 (R1,2bn), the impact of the odd-lot
offer concluded in December 2018 (R2,0bn) and the impact of
the ETI NAFEX revaluation.

The total tier 1 CAR was positively impacted by the issuance of
an additional tier 1 instrument of R750m at improved pricing
of JIBAR plus 464 bps, compared with the previous R600m
issuance at JIBAR plus 565 bps (30 June 2017). This was offset
by the further grandfathering of old-style preference shares
(R531m) in January 2018 in line with the Basel III transitional
arrangements. The total CAR was further impacted by the
redemption of R3,0bn tier 2 capital instruments (NED 13 and

    minimum requirements.

Funding and liquidity
Optimising our funding profile and mix, and maintaining a
strong liquidity position, remain a priority for the group.

The group's three-month average long-term funding ratio was
26,5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, supported by growth in
Nedbank Retail Savings Bonds of R5,0bn to R29,9bn  and the
successful capital market issuances of R4,9bn senior unsecured
debt and R4,5bn tier 2 capital. 

The group's December 2018 quarterly average LCR of 109,4%
exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%
effective from 1 January 2019, representing the end of the Basel
III LCR phase-in from a minimum regulatory requirement of
60% in 2015, which has been increased by 10% a year to reach
100% in 2019. To ensure ongoing compliance Nedbank maintains
appropriate operational buffers designed to absorb seasonal
and cyclical volatility in the LCR.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA increased by 17,7%
to a December 2018 quarterly average of R162,7bn. Looking
forward, growth in the HQLA portfolio will be more aligned with
balance sheet growth, without the incremental HQLA growth
requirements that have emanated from the LCR phase-in
of minimum regulatory requirements since 2015. The HQLA
portfolio, taken together with Nedbank's portfolio of other
sources of quick liquidity, resulted in total available sources of
quick liquidity of R213,3bn, representing 20,4% of total assets. 
Nedbank exceeded the minimum NSFR regulatory requirement
of 100% effective from 1 January 2018 and reported a
December 2018 ratio of 114,0%. 

Loans and advances
Loans and advances increased by 3,7% to R736,3bn, driven by
solid growth in RBB and an increase in CIB banking advances
during the second half of the year. This was partially offset by
a decline in trading advances and short-dated lending in CIB
as well as the IFRS day 1 impact of R3,2bn. Banking advances
grew 5,6%, excluding the increase in impairments due to
implementation of IFRS 9.

(3)  Consolidation adjustments.

RBB loans and advances grew 7,1% to R326,8bn, supported by
growth across all asset classes in line with our risk appetite
and prudent origination strategies. Loans and advances was
negatively impacted by the IFRS 9 transitional day 1 changes.
Business Banking grew advances 11,8%, due to an increase in
new-loan payouts and higher utilisation of existing facilities.
MFC (vehicle finance) advances increased by 7,9% as business
volumes remained robust despite a muted new-vehicle sales
market. Unsecured Lending grew 6,6% as a result of product
and process enhancements driving increased take up. After the
IFRS 9 day 1 transitional impact, Unsecured Lending grew 9,7%,
marginally ahead of the market. Card advances decreased
1,8%, impacted by an increase in impairments as a result of
IFRS 9 transitional day 1 changes. Underlying card growth, as
reflected in gross advances, was 4,8%. Residential-mortgage
loans grew 3,9%, in line with the overall market.

CIB loans and advances grew 0,7% to R358,6bn. The banking
book increased 3,1%, driven by a strong pipeline conversion and
as early repayments decreased in the second half of the year.
Commercial mortgages increased 1,4% to R135,0bn, impacted
by increased competition and muted industry growth.
The CPF portfolio contains good-quality collateralised assets
with low loan-to-value ratios and is managed by a highly
experienced property finance team. Trading advances declined
24,6%, largely as a result of a reduction in reverse repurchase
agreements as traders freed up cash to deploy into government
bonds and other securities in order to hedge new client-related
bond futures positions. 

Deposits
Deposits grew 7,0% to R825,8bn, with total funding-related
liabilities increasing 7,1% to R881,4bn, while the loan-to-deposit
ratio improved to 89,2%.

In line with Nedbank's objective of tilting towards a greater
proportion of Basel III-friendly deposits, RBB through the active
management of its franchise has grown retail and commercial
deposits 9,2% to R322,5bn. CIB grew deposits 2,8% as we
shifted away from more-expensive structured-note issuances
towards lower-cost NCD funding, housed in the Centre where
deposits grew 15,8%. Wealth and RoA grew deposits 12,6% and
4,8% respectively.

During the 12 months to December 2018 Nedbank reduced its
reliance on short-term wholesale funding through proportionally
higher levels of growth in commercial deposits. Growth in
transactional current-account and cash management deposits
of 6,9% contributed positively towards the strategic objective
of growing Nedbank's transactional-deposit franchise,
while the increases in fixed deposits and NCDs of 16,7% and
16,0% respectively resulted in a strong funding profile and
consequently a strong balance sheet position.

Group strategic focus
During 2018 we continued to focus on delivering on our five
strategic focus areas that are designed to drive sustainable
earnings growth and improve returns on equity. We made
excellent progress in delivering market-leading CVPs and
digital innovations, which were acknowledged by improved
client satisfaction ratings and various industry awards. This
focus enabled us to grow revenues and unlock operating
efficiencies. Our strategic enablers – which include technology
investments (with our Managed Evolution IT strategy and Digital
Fast Lane (DFL) as key components), our people, our culture and
our brand – are delivered through our target operating model
and by embracing nWoW. This is enabling us to create a more
client-focused, agile, competitive and digital Nedbank.

-    Delivering innovative market-leading client experiences 
     -  The  Nedbank Money app™, which makes banking more
        convenient for our retail clients, has been downloaded
        1,6 million times, with more than 435 000 clients having
        used it actively since November 2017. The Nedbank
        Private Wealth app ranked second best globally by Cutter
        Associates International Research, an improvement from
        seventh in 2017. These achievements are the result of our
        DFL approach of continuously enhancing functionality
        and adopting the global gold standard. Client ratings
        for iOS and Android Nedbank apps are at the top end of
        SA banking peers. Towards the end of 2018 we launched
        MobiMoney, which allows clients to receive and send
        money, buy airtime and electricity from a cellphone and
        withdraw money at a Nedbank ATM – all without a formal
        bank account. In 2018 we processed on average R8,4bn of
        third-party payments per month on all digital channels for
        our retail clients.

     -  Unlocked.Me, a new CVP for the youth segment, was
        launched at the start of 2018. Its first release included our
        first lifestyle marketplace (www.unlocked.me) and a new
        account for students and young adults. The marketplace
        recorded a reach of more than 12,5 million unique
        impressions across social media and the web. 

     -  We  launched our new Stokvel Account, which offers
        members of stokvels up to 10% discount at our retail
        partners, burial benefits of R10 000 a member for only
        R15 a month, zero transaction fees and good interest
        rates. Since its launch the product has attracted
        over 1 600 stokvel groups, representing more than
        48 000 members.

     -  As  far as our integrated channels are concerned, we
        have converted 60% of our outlets to new-image digital
        branches to date, and our investment in distribution
        channels over the next three years (until 2021) will result
        in 80% of our retail clients being exposed to the new
        digitally focused branch formats and self-service offerings.
        The introduction of new channels such as chatbots and
        robo-advisors will continue to enhance client experience
        and increase the efficiencies of our contact centre and
        web-servicing capabilities.

     -  As a result of the abovementioned innovations and ongoing
        focus on improving client service, in the Consulta survey
        Nedbank has seen the largest increase in NPS scores
        among all banks in SA, increasing 11% to 37%.

     -  Nedbank Insurance was the first-to-market insurer in SA to
        have chatbot functionality, and we have made significant
        strides in remaining ahead through delivering live-agent
        service functionality and funeral-quoting capabilities.

     -  Nedgroup Investments'robo-advisor and chatbot was
        named The Banker's Tech Project of the Year in the category
        Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and was a finalist in the
        Gartner Eye on Innovation Awards.

     -  With  the foundations put in place through Managed
        Evolution (our system and technology platform
        transformation), digital enhancements and nWoW we are
        delivering ongoing benefits and enhanced client service.
        In 2019 we will bring further exciting digital innovations
        to market to enhance client experiences and drive
        efficiencies. Some of these innovations include the ability
        to sell an unsecured loan bundled with a transactional
        account; simplified client onboarding with convenient,
        FICA-compliant account opening; a new and exciting
        loyalty and rewards solution; and the further rollout of
        chatbots, robo-advisors and software robots (robotic
        process automation).

-    Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than
     the market

     -  Our  SA retail main-banked client numbers have
        grown by 6,9% to 3,0 million, driven largely by growth
        in the entry-level, middle-market, professional and
        small-business segments and supporting solid underlying
        retail transactional NIR growth. The 2018 Consulta survey
        estimated Nedbank's share of main-banked clients at
        13,1%, up from 12,7% in 2017, as we aim to reach a share
        of more than 15% by 2020. In addition, Business Banking's
        market share increased from 19% in 2017 to 22% in 2018,
        the highest market share gain across all business banks as
        measured by the 2018 KPI Research Business Electronic
        Banking and Tracking Study.

     -  Our  SADC businesses grew their client base by 4,8% to
        352 921, supporting NIR growth of 21,0% as the newly
        launched products and digital innovations started
        delivering benefits.

     -  Our integrated model in CIB enabled deeper client
        penetration and increased cross-sell, resulting in
        30 primary-bank client wins in the last year. This
        supported NIR growth in CIB of 18,9%.

-    Being operationally excellent in all we do 
     -  Cost   discipline is an imperative as we balance investment
        with growth. We have ongoing initiatives to optimise
        our cost base. These include the reduction of our core
        systems from 250 to 114 since the inception of the
        Managed Evolution programme, and we are well on our
        way to reaching a target end-state of less than 60 core
        systems by 2020. The rationalisation, standardisation and
        simplification of core banking operating systems enable
        reduced infrastructure, support and maintenance costs,
        as well as reduced complexity and increased agility in
        adopting new innovations. The time and cost of bringing
        new products and services to market have been reduced
        significantly as many of the foundational capabilities are
        built into our onboarding and servicing programmes.
        Investments in various foundational IT programmes are
        either complete or nearing completion and we expect IT
        cashflow spend to peak in 2019 and capitalised IT costs
        peaking just above R9bn in 2020.

     -  During  2018 new self-servicing functions that were
        previously available in branches or staffed channels only
        were released on the Nedbank Money app™ and the new
        Nedbank Online Banking site, taking the total digital
        servicing functions to 70. This digitisation of services in
        RBB has enabled us to reduce related call centre volumes
        by 15 000 per month in 2018 and branch floor space
        by 32 971 m² to date, and we plan to achieve more than
        45 000 m² of optimisation by 2020 (a revision of our initial
        2020 target of 30 000 m2). Over the past 24 months
        we reduced total headcount by 1 469 (mainly through

        natural attrition) and optimised our staffed points of
        presence by closing 18 branches (while maintaining our
        coverage of the bankable population at 84%). Through
        our Intelligent Depositor devices we now process, monthly,
        more than one million deposits and 300 000 request for
        three-month bank statements, which previously could be
        done only over the counter in a branch. In 2018 these
        devices recycled 75% of all cash, up from 20% in 2015.

     -  We implemented 51 software robots to date (robotic
        process automation) to enhance efficiencies and reduce
        processing errors in administratively intense processes.
        These exclude the 153 temporary software robots used to
        onboard the more than 17 000 VBS Mutual Bank clients.

     -  Our target operating model recorded cumulative savings
        of R680m at December 2018, with the aim of generating
        R1,0bn pretax benefits for Nedbank by 2019 and R1,2bn
        by 2020, as disclosed in an element of our long-term
        incentive scheme.

-    Managing scarce resources to optimise economic outcomes 
     -  We maintained our focus on growing activities that
        generate higher levels of EP, such as transactional
        deposits and transactional-banking revenues.

     -  Our  selective origination of personal loans, home loans
        and commercial-property finance has proactively
        limited downside credit risk in this challenging operating
        climate, enabling a CLR of 0,53%, below the bottom end
        of our TTC target range. At the same time our balance
        sheet metrics remain strong and we continue to deliver
        attractive dividend growth.

     -  During 2018 we embedded our commitment to the United
        Nations SDGs, which will see lending flowing into targeted
        areas that contribute to a better society. To this end our
        renewable-energy funding solutions have seen R22,8bn
        drawn as part of R40bn of commitments across all four
        rounds of renewable energy.

-    Providing our clients with access to the best financial
     services network in Africa

     -  In Central and West Africa ETI remains an important
        strategic investment for Nedbank, providing our clients
        with access to a pan-African transactional banking
        network across 39 countries and Nedbank with access
        to dealflow in those markets. ETI has now reported
        seven consecutive quarters of profit and is making good
        progress on its transactional banking and digital strategy
        and on optimising its cost base. Asset quality and risk
        management remain key priorities for the ETI board
        and executive, and although the movement towards
        risk appetite in the key risk metrics is still expected to
        take a further 12 to 18 months, the credit loss experience
        has improved and management remains committed
        to resolving legacy risk matters. We remain supportive
        of ETI's endeavours to deliver an ROE in excess of its
        COE over time. Economic conditions in West Africa are
        improving and our investment in ETI should continue
        to support Nedbank's earnings growth. We have also
        increased our levels of collaboration, with more than
        100 of our wholesale clients being banked by ETI and
        progress being made in partnering with ETI to expand
        our wealth franchise, collaborating on the pan-African
        remittances product and increasing treasury and trading

     -  In the SADC, where we own, manage and control six
        banks, we continue to build scale and optimise costs.
        Our core banking system, Flexcube, has now been
        implemented in all subsidiaries (excluding Banco Único).
        We launched a number of new digital products and
        reported a 44% increase in banking app transactions
        and a 4,8% increase in client numbers. Asset and
        deposits have grown in line with expectations and
        we have increased our retail profit contribution as
        a share of our overall business. Merchant Bank of
        Central Africa (MBCA) in Zimbabwe was rebranded
        Nedbank Zimbabwe. The difficult environment in
        Zimbabwe resulted in a negative FCTR adjustment
        to equity of R755m before minorities (R499m after
        minorities) as we anticipated possible impacts from
        exchange rate movements. We continue to monitor
        developments in Zimbabwe brought about by currency
        shortages and pressure on the fiscus. 

Old Mutual plc managed separation
The unbundling of Nedbank shares by Old Mutual
Limited (OML), which took place on 15 October 2018,
completed the managed-separation process. OML is now
a strategic minority shareholder owning 19,9% of Nedbank
Group in OML's shareholder funds under the terms of the new
relationship agreement.

As a result of the OML unbundling, Nedbank Group inherited a
significantly larger number of shareholders – increasing from
approximately 20 000 to approximately 500 000 shareholders.
The vast majority of these shareholders held less than
100 Nedbank Group ordinary shares (referred to as odd-lot
holders). An odd-lot offer was approved by shareholders
at a general meeting on 22 November 2018 and closed on
14 December 2018 (the record date of the odd-lot offer).
The price of the odd-lot offer was set at R276,47672 per share
based on a 5% premium to the 10-day VWAP leading up
to 3 December 2018. The odd-lot offer provided eligible holders
with the ability to dispose of their shares on an efficient basis,
and provided liquidity for those shareholders who elected to
sell their holdings or who made no election. For Nedbank Group
this offer reduced the complexity and ongoing administration
costs associated with a significantly larger shareholder base,
including a sizeable number of odd-lot holders. In terms of
the odd-lot offer, Nedbank Group repurchased a total of
7 056 639 Nedbank Group ordinary shares, representing 1,4% of
the total issued ordinary share capital of Nedbank Group for a
total consideration of R2,0bn, and the impact on our CET1 ratio
was 34 bps. The repurchased ordinary shares were cancelled
and delisted on Friday, 21 December 2018, and accordingly the
total issued ordinary shares decreased from 500 239 303 to
493 182 664.

Nedbank Group continues to operate on a business-as-usual
basis and the managed separation had no impact on our
strategy, our day-to-day management or operations, our staff
or our clients. Our engagements with OML are at arm's length
and overseen by independent board structures. OML operates
predominantly in the investment, savings and insurance
industry, which has little overlap with banking, even though
we compete in the areas of wealth and asset management
and personal loans. In addition, our technology systems,
brands and businesses are not integrated. As noted before, our
collaboration to unlock synergies will continue to be underpinned
by OML's strategic shareholding in Nedbank Group and we are
committed to working with OML to deliver ongoing synergistic
benefits while operating at arm's length.

Economic and regulatory outlook
The International Monetary Fund expects global economic
growth to slow slightly from 3,7% in 2018 to 3,5% in 2019 and to
move to 3,6% in 2020. Softer growth is forecast for advanced
countries, at around 2,0% in 2019 and 1,7% in 2020 from 2,3%
in 2018, while growth in emerging and developing economies
are forecast to ease slightly to 4,5% in 2019 from 4,6% in 2018.
Encouragingly, faster growth is expected in sub-Saharan
Africa, where GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 3,5% in
2019 from 2,9% in 2018. 

The SA economy should perform better in 2019 than in 2018.
Exports are forecast to provide most of the momentum,
facilitating some improvement in mining and strengthening the
fragile recovery in manufacturing. However, downside risks have
increased in recent months, given the softer global outlook, low
commodity prices and the threat posed by disease and drought
to agriculture. While President Ramaphosa's efforts to revive
fixed investment should bear some fruit over the medium to
longer term, we expect only a slight increase in fixed investment
in 2019, mainly boosted by the signing of the fourth round of the
REIPPPP in 2018. Unfortunately, the current environment is not
supportive of much higher investment, given spare capacity in
many industries, unreliable electricity supply, high domestic cost
structures, slow progress in delivering policy certainty, the lack
of essential structural reforms and the uncertainties
surrounding the intended scale and scope of land expropriation
without compensation. 

Household incomes and spending are likely to be bolstered
by receding inflation brought about by lower fuel
prices; however, the upside will be contained by limited
job-creation opportunities and stagnant asset prices. Interest
rates are likely to remain on hold for much of 2019 due to the
improved inflation outlook over the next 12 months. Thereafter
inflation is likely to drift higher and in response a slightly
tighter monetary policy stance is expected. This may contain
confidence and consumer spending, but is unlikely to result in
a significant increase in loan defaults. The recent SA budget
highlighted the limited fiscal flexibility that government has and
a further erosion in fiscal strength after the 2018 Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement already pointed to wider deficits
for longer. On balance, GDP growth of about 1,3% and 1,8%
is forecast for 2019 and 2020 respectively. The key downside
risks include government's poor fiscal position, the perilous
state of many SOEs (particularly Eskom), a problematic start
to government's plans to fast-track land reform, uncertainty
around this year's general elections and ultimately the
persistent threat of further sovereign risk ratings downgrades,
particularly by Moody's who is currently the only major ratings
agency to rate SA sovereign debt at investment grade.  

Despite the many challenges faced by the SA economy, the
SA banking system remains sound, liquid and well capitalised.
The operating environment is forecast to improve in
2019 off a low base. A recovery in corporate credit demand
is expected, mainly buoyed by the start of the next phase
of renewable-energy projects and a slight improvement
in fixed-investment activity towards the end of the year.
The gradual recovery in household credit demand is also
forecast to continue throughout 2019, supported by lower
inflation and relatively steady interest rates.

Prospects 
Our guidance on financial performance for the full year 2019 is
currently as follows:

-    Average interest-earning banking assets to grow at upper
     single digits.

-    NIM to be below the 2018 level of 3,65%.

-    CLR to increase to within the bottom end of our target range
     of 60 to 100 bps (under IFRS 9).

-    NIR to grow mid-to-upper single digits.
-    Expenses to increase slightly above mid-single digits.

Given the expectations of a slowly improving SA economy
and ongoing delivery on our strategy, our current guidance for
growth in DHEPS for the full 2019 year is to be at or above
nominal GDP growth.

At the start of 2018 we set ourselves specific 2020 targets
of an ROE (excluding goodwill) of greater than or equal to
18% and a cost-to-income ratio of lower than or equal to
53% as a pathway to ongoing and sustainable improvements
in the key metrics that support shareholder value creation.
Given resilient earnings growth and the impact of IFRS
changes and the odd-lot offer, which reduced equity in 2018,
we are currently more confident that we will meet our ROE
(excluding goodwill) target on a sustainable basis. While we
remain committed to our cost-to-income-ratio target, it has
become more challenging to achieve. This is the result of a
combination of weaker-than-anticipated economic growth,
primarily resulting in slower growth in wholesale advances
and retail transactional activity, lower-than-expected interest
rates; IFRS changes impacting the shape of the income
statement and negatively impacting the cost-to-income
ratio; new costs relating to the Youth Employment Service,
Deposit Insurance and Twin Peaks; and a decision to increase
our investments into platform-related activities in RBB as
we continually evolve our business model to underpin future
growth. Our medium-to-long-term targets have not changed
from what we published in 2018. The current outlook for these
targets in 2019 is as follows:

Board and leadership changes during the period
Nomavuso Mnxasana retired as an independent non-executive
director with effect from the close of Nedbank Group's AGM
on 10 May 2018. Peter Moyo was appointed as a non-executive
director, while Bruce Hemphill stepped down from the Nedbank
Group board, on 11 June 2018. Rob Leith and Ian Gladman
resigned from the board on 15 October 2018 following Old
Mutual Limited's unbundling of its controlling interest in
Nedbank Group, thereby concluding the managed-separation
process. Rob Leith was reappointed as a non-executive director
with effect from 1 January 2019.

Khensani Nobanda was appointed as Group Executive for Group
Marketing and Corporate Affairs on 15 May 2018, and Deborah
Fuller was appointed as Group Executive for Human Resources
on 25 June 2018 following the retirement of Abe Thebyane
on 31 March 2018. Anna Isaac was appointed as Group Chief
Compliance Officer with effect from 1 January 2019 following
the retirement of Thabani Jali. In addition, Jackie Katzin was
appointed Group Company Secretary, effective from the same
date.

Basis of preparation*
Nedbank Group Limited is a company domiciled in SA.
The summary consolidated financial statements of the group
at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 comprise the
company and its subsidiaries (group) and the group's interests
in associates and joint arrangements.

The summary consolidated financial statements and the full set
of consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the supervision of Raisibe Morathi CA(SA), the Group Chief
Financial Officer.

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for preliminary reports, and the requirements
of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial
statements. In terms of the Listings Requirements preliminary
reports have to be prepared in accordance with the framework
concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of
IFRS and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements
as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and also,
as a minimum, to contain the information required by IAS 34:
Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, from
which the summary consolidated financial statements were
derived, are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those used
for the previous annual financial statements, except for changes
arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, as set out in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

IFRS 16: Leases*
IFRS 16 deals with the accounting for leases and replaces
IAS 17 for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2019. The group has elected to apply IFRS 16 retrospectively
using the modified approach. The group will therefore not
restate comparative periods, which will continue to be
presented in terms of IAS 17, with a transitional adjustment
made at 1 January 2019. The implementation of IFRS 16 results
in the recognition of lease liabilities of R4,2bn and right-of-use
assets of R3,2bn, with equity decreasing by approximately
R700m on an after-tax basis. The IAS 17 straight-lining
liability of R125m and the associated deferred tax of R35m
will be reversed against equity. Total equity decreases by
approximately R610m on the adoption of IFRS 16.

Events after the reporting period*
There are no material events after the reporting period to
report on.

The summary consolidated financial statements comprise
the summary consolidated statement of financial position
at 31 December 2018, summary consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, summary consolidated statement of
changes in equity and summary consolidated statement of
cashflows for the year ended 31 December 2018 and selected
explanatory notes, which are indicated by the symbol*.

Audited summary consolidated financial statements –
independent auditors' opinion
The summary consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2018 have been audited by KPMG Inc
and Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified opinion
thereon. The auditors also expressed an unmodified opinion on
the annual consolidated financial statements from which these
summary consolidated financial statements were derived.

Copies of the auditors' report on the summary consolidated
financial statements and of the auditors' report on the annual
consolidated financial statements are available for inspection
at the company's registered office, together with the financial
statements identified in the respective auditors' reports.

The auditors' report does not necessarily report on all of
the information contained in this results announcement.
Shareholders are therefore advised that, to obtain a full
understanding of the nature of the auditors' engagement, they
should obtain a copy of the auditors' report, together with
the accompanying consolidated financial statements, from
Nedbank Group's registered office.

Forward-looking statements
This announcement contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the financial condition and results
of operations of Nedbank Group and its group companies that,
by their nature, involve risk and uncertainty because they relate
to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not
occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include global, national and regional political and economic
conditions; sovereign credit ratings; levels of securities markets;
interest rates; credit or other risks of lending and investment
activities; as well as competitive, regulatory and legal factors.
By consequence, all forward-looking statements have not been
reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.

Final dividend declaration
Notice is hereby given that a final dividend of 720 cents per
ordinary share has been declared, payable to shareholders for
the six months ended 31 December 2018. The dividend has been
declared out of income reserves.

The dividend will be subject to a dividend withholding tax rate of
20% (applicable in SA) or 144 cents per ordinary share, resulting
in a net dividend of 576 cents per ordinary share, unless the
shareholder is exempt from paying dividend tax or is entitled to
a reduced rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.  
Nedbank Group's tax reference number is 9375/082/71/7 and
the number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of declaration
is 493 182 664.

In accordance with the provisions of Strate, the electronic
settlement and custody system used by the JSE, the relevant
dates for the dividend are as follows:

(1) During the year the group reviewed the classification of certain investments on the statement of financial position. As a result of this review the group's
    private-equity investments have been reclassified from investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment
    securities better to reflect the measurement of these investments at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-year balances have been restated by R3 169m
    (2016: R2 357m). The investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements were renamed investments in associate companies.
    The reclassification had no impact on the group's statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity.

(1) Revenue is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest revenue.

Due to the group's strategic investment in ETI being in an associate company that the group does not control, the group's managed
operations exclude ETI-related assets, funding, equity-accounted earnings and associated after-tax funding costs. The chief
operating decisionmaker therefore separately reviews the performance of the group's managed operations and, on this basis,
the total assets are R1 040 667m (2017: R979 994m), total liabilities are R950 406m (2017: R892 919m), revenue is R55 118m (2017:
R52 008m) and headline earnings is R13 119m (2017: R12 762m). ETI forms part of the Nedbank Rest of Africa segment, whose
segmental information on a managed-operations basis include total assets of R34 273m (2017: R34 167m), total liabilities of R28 471m
(2017: R29 186m), revenue of R3 156m (2017: R2 792m) and headline earnings of R326m (2017: R165m).

The group, in the ordinary course of business, enters into transactions that expose it to tax, legal and business risks. Provisions are
made for known liabilities that are expected to materialise. Possible obligations and known liabilities where no reliable estimate can
be made or it is considered improbable that an outflow would result are reported as contingent liabilities. This is in accordance with
IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Limited and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which
cannot currently be foreseen. None of these matters are material in nature.

(1)  The group's investment in ETI is recorded under listed associates.
(2)  During the year the group reviewed the classification of certain investments on the statement of financial position. As a result of this review the group's
     private-equity investments have been reclassified from investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment
     securities better to reflect the measurement of these investments at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-year balances have been restated accordingly
     (R3 169m). The investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements have been renamed investments in associate companies.

Fair-value hierarchy
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the definition of fair value is an
assumption that an entity is a going concern without any intention or need to liquidate, to curtail materially the scale of its operations
or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not, therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced
transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where they exist, they
are used to measure the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if transactions occur with sufficient
volumes and frequencies to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. These quoted prices would generally be classified as
level 1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial instrument is not
active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include reference to the current
fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same in nature, reference to the value of the assets of underlying business,
earnings multiples, a discounted-cashflow analysis and various option pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would
generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy. The determination of whether an instrument is classified
as level 2 or level 3 is dependent on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs in relation to the fair value of the
instrument. Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility, servicing costs,
equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.

The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review protocols for the
independent review and validation of fair values separate from those of the business unit entering into the transaction. The valuation
methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to the fair-value measurement of the financial instruments have been applied in a
manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY
The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the IFRS fair-value hierarchy
as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based (directly or indirectly) on market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the availability of
observable inputs. These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in
the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market, the maturity of market
modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is based on inputs
that are not market-observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of the best information available and
may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities, appropriate proxies or other analytical techniques.
All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

(1) During the year the group reviewed the classification of certain investments on the statement of financial position. As a result of this review the group's private-equity 
    investments have been reclassified from investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment securities better to reflect the 
    measurement of these investments at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-year balances have been restated accordingly (R3 169m).

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE ASSUMPTIONS TO REASONABLE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES
The fair value of financial instruments is, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that include assumptions that are not market-observable. Where these scenarios apply,
the group performs stress testing on the fair value of the relevant instruments. When performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the unobservable-input parameters are chosen so that
they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with the group's approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative
uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable-input parameters and which are classified as level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. However, the
disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY (UNAUDITED)
In terms of the group's policy, transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair-value hierarchy are deemed to have
occurred at the end of the year.

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value for
which fair value is disclosed

Certain financial instruments of the group are not carried at fair value and are measured at amortised cost. The calculation of the
fair value of the financial instruments incorporates the group's best estimate of the value at which the financial assets could be
exchanged, or financial liabilities transferred, between market participants at the measurement date. The group's estimate of what
fair value is does not necessarily represent what it would be able to sell the asset for or transfer the respective financial liability for in
an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The fair values of these respective financial instruments at the reporting date detailed below are estimated only for the purpose of 
IFRS disclosure, as follows:

There have been no significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the fair value of the above instruments during the year.

LOANS AND ADVANCES
Loans and advances that are not recognised at fair value principally comprise variable-rate financial assets. The interest rates on
these variable-rate financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.

Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value of these
loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs. Due to the unique characteristics of the loans and advances
portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposal of such loans and advances, there is no basis
to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an orderly transaction. The group is not currently in
the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and
advances on a forced-sale basis.

For specifically impaired loans and advances the carrying value, as determined after consideration of the group's IFRS 9 expected
credit losses, is considered the best estimate of fair value.

The group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing loans and
advances measured at amortised cost. This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected monthly cashflows
per product type. Future cashflows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be granted to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and maturities. Methodologies and models are updated on a continuous basis for changes in assumptions,
forecasts and modelling techniques. Future forecasts of the group's probability of default (PD) and loss given defaults (LGDs) for the
periods 2019 to 2021 (2017: for periods 2018 to 2020) are based on the latest available internal data and are applied to the projected
cashflows of the first three years. Thereafter, PDs and LGDs are gradually reverted to their long-run averages and are applied to
the remaining projected cashflows. Inputs into the model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances.
The determination of such inputs is highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a
significant change in the determination of the fair value of loans and advances.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER SECURITIES
The fair value of government and other securities is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted-cashflow
analysis (level 3), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES
The fair value of other short-term securities is determined using a discounted-cashflow analysis (level 2).

LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of long-term debt instruments is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted-cashflow analysis
(level 2), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

AMOUNTS OWED TO DEPOSITORS
The amounts owed to depositors principally comprise variable-rate liabilities and hedge-accounted fixed-rate liabilities. The carrying
value of the amounts owed to depositors approximates fair value because the instruments reprice to current market rates at frequent
intervals. In addition, a significant portion of the balance is callable or is short term in nature.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER ASSETS, MANDATORY DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS AND
PROVISIONS AND OTHER LIABILITIES
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and other
liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short term in nature or are
repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.

Definitions

12-month ECL An ECL on a default event expected to occur in the 12 months after the reporting date.

Assets under administration (AUA) (Rm) Market value of assets held in custody on behalf of clients.

Assets under management (AUM) (Rm) Market value of assets managed on behalf of clients.

Common-equity tier 1 (CET1) capital adequacy ratio (%) CET1 regulatory capital, including unappropriated profit, as a percentage of
   total risk-weighted assets.

Coverage (%) On-balance-sheet impairments divided by gross loans and advances. Coverage excludes ECL on off-balance-sheet
    amounts, ECL and gross loans and advances on the FVOCI portfolio, and gross loans and advances classified at FVTPL.

Credit loss ratio (CLR) (% or bps) Impairments charge on loans and advances as a percentage of daily average gross loans and
    advances. Includes the ECL recognised in respect of the off-balance-sheet portion of loans and advances.

Default Default occurs in respect of a particular client in the following instances:
       -    When the bank considers that the client is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the bank in full without the bank having
            recourse to actions such as realising security (if held).

       -    When the client is past due for more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the bank. Overdrafts will be
            considered as being past due if the client has breached an advised limit or has been advised of a limit smaller than the
            current outstanding amount.

       -    In terms of Nedbank's Group Credit Policy, when the client is placed under business rescue in terms of the Companies Act,
            71 of 2008, and when the client requests a restructure of his facilities as a result of financial distress.

Defaulted loans and advances (non-performing defaulted advances) Any advance or group of loans and advances that has triggered
    the Basel III definition of default criteria and is in line with the revised SA banking regulations. For retail portfolios this is
    product-centred and a default would therefore be specific to a client or borrower account (a specific advance). For all other
    portfolios, except specialised lending, it is client- or borrower-centred, meaning that should any transaction within a borrowing
    group default, all transactions within the borrowing group would be treated as having defaulted.

    At a minimum a default is deemed to have occurred where a material obligation is past due for more than 90 days or a client
    has exceeded an advised limit for more than 90 days. A specific impairment is raised against such a credit exposure due to a
    significant perceived decline in the credit quality. 

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares,
     adjusted for potential dilutive ordinary shares.

Dividend cover (times) Headline earnings per share divided by dividend per share.

Economic profit (EP) (Rm) Headline earnings less the cost of equity (total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, less
    goodwill, multiplied by the group's cost-of-equity percentage).

Effective taxation rate (%) Direct taxation as a percentage of profit before direct taxation, excluding non-trading and capital items.

Efficiency ratio (%) Total operating expenses as a percentage of total income, being net interest income, non-interest revenue and
     share of profits or losses from associates and joint arrangements.

Earnings per share (EPS) (cents) Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary
    shares in issue.

Forward-looking economic expectations The impact of forecast macroeconomic expectations in determining SICR and the
    measurement of the ECL.

Gross operating income growth rate less expenses growth rate (JAWS ratio) (%) Measure of the extent to which the total income
    growth rate exceeds the total operating expenses growth rate.

Headline earnings (Rm) The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, excluding specific separately identifiable
   remeasurements, net of related tax and non-controlling interests.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue.

Lifetime ECL An ECL on any default event between the reporting date and the end of the lifetime of the financial asset.

Life insurance embedded value (Rm) The embedded value (EV) of the covered business is the discounted value of the projected future
     after-tax shareholder earnings arising from covered business in force at the valuation date, plus the adjusted net worth.

Life insurance value of new business (Rm) A measure of the value added to a company as a result of writing new business. Value of
     new business (VNB) is calculated as the discounted value, at the valuation date, of projected after-tax shareholder profit from
     covered new business that commenced during the reporting period, net of frictional costs and the cost of non-hedgeable risk
     associated with writing new business, using economic assumptions at the start of the reporting period.

Net asset value (NAV) (Rm) Total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.

Net asset value (NAV) per share (cents) NAV divided by the number of shares in issue, excluding shares held by group entities at the
    end of the period.

Net interest income (NII) to average interest-earning banking assets (AIEBA) (%) NII as a percentage of daily average total assets,
     excluding trading assets. Also called net interest margin (NIM).

Non-interest revenue (NIR) to total income (%) NIR as a percentage of operating income, excluding the impairments charge on loans
    and advances.

Number of shares listed (number) Number of ordinary shares in issue, as listed on the JSE.

Off-balance-sheet exposures Undrawn loan commitments, guarantees and similar arrangements that expose the group to credit risk.

Ordinary dividends declared per share (cents) Total dividends to ordinary shareholders declared in respect of the current period.

Performing defaulted loans and advances (Rm) Loans that would otherwise not be in default, but are classified as defaulted due to
    regulatory requirements, ie directive 7 and the new curing definition.

Portfolio coverage (%) Portfolio impairments in the statement of financial position as a percentage of gross loans and advances,
    excluding defaulted advances.

Portfolio impairments (Rm) Impairment for latent losses inherent in groups of loans and advances that have not yet been
    specifically impaired.

    The standard portfolio represents all the loans and advances that have not been impaired. These loans and advances have not
    yet individually evidenced a loss event, but there are loans and advances in the standard portfolio that may have an impairment
    without the bank being aware of it yet.

    A period of time will elapse between the occurrence of an impairment event and objective evidence of the impairment becoming
    evident. This period is generally known as the emergence period. For each standard portfolio an emergence period is estimated as
    well as the probability of the loss trigger and the loss given events occurring. These estimates are applied to the total exposures
    of the standard portfolio to calculate the portfolio impairment.

Preprovisioning operating profit (PPOP) (Rm) Headline earnings plus direct taxation (excluding taxation on non-trading and capital
    items) plus an impairments charge on loans and advances.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent (Rm) Profit for the period less non-controlling interests pertaining to ordinary
    shareholders, preference shareholders and additional tier 1 capital instrument noteholders.

Profit for the period (Rm) Income statement profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent, before non-controlling
    interests. 

Return on equity (ROE) (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity.

Return on equity (ROE) (excluding goodwill) (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity
    less goodwill.

Return on tangible equity (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity less intangible assets.

Risk-weighted assets (RWA) (Rm) On-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures after applying prescribed risk weightings
     according to the relative risk of the counterparty.

Specific impairments (Rm) Impairment for loans and advances that have been classified as total defaults and specifically impaired,
    net of the present value of estimated recoveries.

Specific coverage (%) Specific impairments in the statement of financial position as a percentage of total defaulted advances.

Stage 1 Financial assets without objective evidence of impairment, for which the credit risk (risk of default) at the reporting date has
    not significantly increased since initial recognition.

Stage 2 Financial assets without objective evidence of impairment, for which the credit risk (risk of default) at the reporting date has
    significantly increased since initial recognition.

Stage 3 Financial assets with objective evidence of impairment.

Tangible net asset value per share (cents) Tangible NAV divided by the number of shares in issue, excluding shares held by group
    entities at the end of the period.

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGES TO THE BOARDS
OF DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

The Boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank (‘the Companies') announce the retirement of
Malcolm Wyman, the Lead Independent Director of the Companies, with effect from the close
of Nedbank Group's Annual General Meeting on Friday, 10 May 2019.

Malcolm joined the Boards in August 2009 and was appointed as the Lead Independent
Director in May 2011. Malcolm reached retirement age as a non-executive director in August
2016, but in his role as Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the Nedbank Group
Related-party Transactions Committee he was requested by the Boards to remain a director
and oversee the completion of Old Mutual plc's Managed Separation (‘MS') strategy. With
the successful completion of the MS process, and having served on the Boards for nine
years in August 2018, Malcolm will retire on 10 May 2019.

Vassi Naidoo, Chairman of the Nedbank Group, expressed his deepest gratitude to Malcolm
for the considerable experience he has brought to bear on the Boards, not only as Lead
Independent Director but also as the Chairman of the Group Directors' Affairs Committee
and previous Chairman of the Group Audit Committee. His wise counsel to the Chairman,
and deep insights into the business of banking, will be missed.

Mpho Makwana will assume the role of Lead Independent Director of the Companies on
Malcolm's retirement.
Mpho Makwana is a distinguished business leader who joined the Nedbank boards in
November 2011. He is an independent director of eNX Group Limited and the Chairman of
ArcelorMittal SA Limited. His vast experience spans various industries including
pharmaceuticals, energy, mining and banking. He is the past Chairman of Eskom Holdings,
where he led the team that ‘kept the lights on' during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He also
serves in various non-profit initiatives, among these as a trustee on the board of the Nelson
Mandela Children's Fund.

Mpho is the Chairman of the Nedbank Group Transformation, Social and Ethics Committee
and was the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee until 2018. He is also a member of
the Group IT Committee, Group Remuneration Committee, Group Directors' Affairs
Committee (‘DAC'), Group Related-Party Transactions Committee (‘GRPTC'), and Group
Risk and Capital Management Committee. Mpho will also assume the roles of Chairman of
the DAC and GRPTC on 10 May 2019.

The Boards congratulate Mr Makwana on this appointment and look forward to his guidance
in ensuring the Boards effectively discharge their governance roles and responsibilities.

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION
OF VASSI NAIDOO FROM NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN TO INDEPENDENT NON-
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN

Shareholders are advised that, with effect from 1 January 2019, Vassi Naidoo will be
classified as an independent non-executive Chairman of Nedbank Group and Nedbank.

Background

Shareholders are referred to the announcement by Old Mutual Limited (‘OML’) on 26
September 2018 regarding the unbundling by OML of a significant portion of OML’s
shareholding in Nedbank Group shares (‘the Unbundling’). OML implemented the
Unbundling on 15 October 2018, through the distribution of approximately 31,73% of the
issued shares of Nedbank Group to OML shareholders, whilst retaining a strategic minority
stake of 19.9% of the issued share capital in Nedbank Group in its shareholder funds to
underpin the continuing relationship and commercial benefits between the two organisations.

With the completion of the unbundling of the majority of OML’s stake in Nedbank Group on
15 October 2018, the OML Board has agreed that it is now appropriate for Vassi Naidoo to
step down from his non-executive directorship of OML with effect from 31 December 2018.

Independence considerations

The Boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank have evaluated all factors that may, or may
reasonably be perceived to, impair Mr Naidoo’s independence once he has stepped down
from the OML board, and are satisfied that in the absence of any changed circumstances,
there are no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect his judgment, and that he
meets the requirements of independence, including those as set out in King IV.

FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE ODD-LOT OFFER


Introduction

Nedbank Group shareholders (""Shareholders"") are referred to the circular (‘Circular’) containing details
of the Odd-lot Offer (‘Odd-lot Offer’) that was posted to Shareholders on Wednesday, 24 October 2018.
Shareholders are further referred to the general meeting of Shareholders (‘General Meeting’) that was
held on Thursday, 22 November 2018 and the subsequent announcement that was released on SENS
on the same day advising that the Odd-lot Offer was approved by Shareholders at the General Meeting.

Unless otherwise indicated, capitalised words and terms contained in this announcement shall bear the
same meanings ascribed thereto in the Circular.


Offer Price

The offer price per Nedbank Group Share in respect of the Odd-lot Offer is R276.47672 (‘Offer Price’)
and has been calculated on the 10-day volume weighted average price of a Nedbank Group ordinary
share on the JSE at the close of business on Monday, 3 December, 2018 being R263.31116 plus a 5%
premium.

If you wish to retain your Nedbank Group Shares you must specifically make an election to do
so. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will automatically be regarded as having
accepted the Odd-lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Nedbank Group Shares to Nedbank
Group and receive the Cash Consideration.


Tax consequences

As set out in the Circular, the Nedbank Group board has resolved that the Odd-lot Offer will be
distributed as a return of capital (paid out of ‘contributed tax capital’ as defined in section 1 of the South
African Income Tax Act). The Cash Consideration will therefore not be regarded as a dividend for South
African income tax purposes.

The Odd-lot Offer may be subject to tax in the relevant jurisdiction of the Odd-lot Holder arising from
the disposal of the Odd-lot Holdings by the Odd-lot Holders who make an election to sell their Odd-lot
Holdings to Nedbank Group or who do not make an election. Annexure 1 to the Circular contains a
summary of the tax consequences for Odd-lot Holders who make an election to sell their Odd-lot
Holdings to Nedbank Group or who do not make an election. Shareholders should, however, seek their
own tax advice.

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGES TO THE BOARDS
OF DIRECTORS

The boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank (‘the Companies’) are pleased to announce the
re-appointment of Mr Rob Leith as a non-executive director with effect from 1 January 2019.

Rob Leith was first appointed to the boards of the Companies on 13 October 2016, shortly
after being appointed as Director of Managed Separation at Old Mutual plc (which was
Nedbank Group’s ultimate holding company at that time).

Rob was one of two board members who stepped down from the Nedbank boards on 15
October 2018 following Old Mutual Limited’s (‘OML’) unbundling of its controlling interest in
Nedbank Group through the distribution of approximately 32% of the total issued share
capital of Nedbank Group to OML’s shareholders, whilst retaining a strategic minority stake
of 19.9% in Nedbank Group in its shareholder funds. These directors’ resignations from the
boards were as a result of the conclusion of this Managed Separation process, and were in
accordance with clause 6.1 of the relationship agreement previously concluded between
OML and Nedbank Group and published on 20 April 2018 on the Nedbank Group website
(www.nedbankgroup.co.za).

In terms of the Nedbank Group Board Continuity Programme, the boards had previously
identified the need to strengthen the investment banking skills on the boards. Having
followed a comprehensive succession process, the boards concluded that Rob Leith’s skills
and experience in both investment banking and the rest of Africa should be retained.

Rob’s prior roles to that of Director of Managed Separation at Old Mutual plc include being
Global Head of Investment Banking and Global Markets of Sberbank CIB, and Head of
Group Strategic Development and Chief Executive of Global Corporate and Investment
Banking at Standard Bank where he played a key role in the development of the group’s
business outside South Africa.

RESULTS OF THE GENERAL MEETING OF NEDBANK GROUP SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE
THE ODD-LOT OFFER

Background

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the Nedbank Group announcement published on SENS
on Monday, 15 October 2018 (‘Odd-lot Offer Announcement’) confirming the board of directors’
decision to proceed with the implementation of an odd-lot offer (‘Odd-lot Offer’) to repurchase Nedbank
Group ordinary shares from shareholders (‘Odd-lot Holders’) holding less than 100 Nedbank Group
ordinary shares (‘Odd-lot Holdings’) at a 5% premium to the 10-day volume weighted average price
of a Nedbank Group ordinary share at the close of business on Monday, 3 December 2018 (‘Offer
Price’).

The Odd-lot Offer will provide Odd-lot Holders with the ability to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings on an
efficient basis and will provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect to sell their Odd-lot Holdings
or who make no election. For Nedbank Group, it will, inter alia, reduce the complexity and ongoing
administrative costs associated with a significantly larger shareholder base.

Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or sell their Odd-lot Holdings at the
Offer Price. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election by 12:00 (SA time) on Friday,
14 December 2018 will automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and
chosen to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings.

Results of the General Meeting

As stated in the Odd-lot Offer announcement, the Odd-lot Offer is subject to Nedbank Group
shareholder approval. Nedbank Group shareholders are advised that the voting results for the general
meeting (‘General Meeting’) of Nedbank Group held today, Thursday, 22 November 2018, were as

In June 2017, the Independent Regulatory Board of Auditors published a rule prescribing that auditors
of public interest entities in South Africa must comply with mandatory audit firm rotation (‘MAFR’),
whereby audit firms shall not serve as the appointed auditor of a public interest entity for more than 10
consecutive years, with effect from 1 April 2023.

The Boards of the Companies and their respective audit committees wish to inform shareholders that,
following a comprehensive tender process, Ernst & Young Incorporated, with Mr Farouk Mohideen as
the designated registered audit partner, has been nominated as their new joint external auditors
effective 8 and 10 May 2019 respectively. These appointments are subject to shareholders’ approval
at the Companies’ annual general meetings on 8 and 10 May 2019, and will commence from the
financial year ending 31 December 2019. As a consequence, KPMG Inc. will rotate off the Companies’
audits on conclusion of its external audit responsibilities for the year ending 31 December 2018,
expected to be at the conclusion of the relevant AGMs.

Ernst & Young will provide its services alongside Deloitte & Touche, who have, as a consequence of
the tender process been nominated to remain the joint external auditor of the Companies, subject to
shareholder approval at the relevant AGMs, until their rotation off the Companies’ audits in line with
MAFR implementation timelines.

DISCLOSURE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIES

Today, Old Mutual Limited (‘OML’) completed the unbundling of the majority of its shareholding in
Nedbank Group (the ‘Unbundling’), which marks the completion of the final step in the managed
separation of the Old Mutual plc group. The OML group has retained (in its shareholder funds) a
strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank Group of 19.9% to underpin the ongoing commercial
relationship between Nedbank Group and OML.

The abovementioned shareholding is held by Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa)
Limited (‘OMLACSA’), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of OML. In order to achieve this
shareholding structure, certain internal transfers of Nedbank Group ordinary shares had to be
undertaken by indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of OML. Where such transfers comprised 5% or more
of the issued ordinary share capital of Nedbank Group, OML advised Nedbank Group thereof.

Accordingly, in compliance with paragraph 3.83 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and Section
122(1) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, shareholders are advised that Nedbank Group has received
formal notification that:

-   Step 1: OMLACSA disposed of 74 740 222 Nedbank Group ordinary shares to Old Mutual Portfolio
    Holdings (SA) Pty Ltd (‘OMPH’), such that the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by
    OMLACSA amounted to 2.04% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary shares, and the total
    beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OMPH amounted to 49.59% of the total issued
    Nedbank Group ordinary shares;
-   Step 2: OMPH disposed of 89 340 242 Nedbank Group ordinary shares to OMLACSA, such that
    the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OMPH amounted to 31.73% of the total issued
    Nedbank Group ordinary shares, and the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by
    OMLACSA amounted to 19.90% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary shares;
-   Step 3: OMPH distributed 158 726 732 Nedbank Group ordinary shares to Old Mutual Group
    Holdings (SA) Ltd (‘OMGH’), such that the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OMPH
    amounted to 0% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary shares, and the total beneficial interest
    in Nedbank Group held by OMGH amounted to 31.73% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary
    shares;
-   Step 4: OMGH distributed 158 726 732 Nedbank Group ordinary shares to OML, such that the total
    beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OMGH amounted to 0% of the total issued Nedbank
    Group ordinary shares, and the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OML amounted
    to 31.73% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary shares; and
-   Step 5: OML distributed 158 726 732 Nedbank Group ordinary shares to OML shareholders in
    terms of the Unbundling, such that the total beneficial interest in Nedbank Group held by OML now
    amounts to 0% of the total issued Nedbank Group ordinary shares.

NEDBANK GROUP TO PROCEED WITH AN ODD-LOT OFFER TO NEDBANK GROUP SHAREHOLDERS
HOLDING LESS THAN 100 NEDBANK GROUP SHARES

Introduction and rationale

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the Nedbank Group announcement published
on SENS on Wednesday, 26 September, 2018 confirming the decision by Old Mutual Limited
('OML') to implement the unbundling of a significant portion of its shareholding in Nedbank
Group to OML shareholders (the 'Unbundling') today, Monday, 15 October, 2018 and Nedbank
Group's intention to implement an odd-lot offer following the Unbundling.

As a result of the Unbundling, Nedbank Group, as of today, has a significantly larger number of
shareholders (increasing from approximately 20 000 to approximately 500 000 shareholders),
of which the vast majority hold less than 100 Nedbank Group ordinary shares ('Odd-lot
Holders'). The aggregate shareholding in Nedbank Group of the Odd-lot Holders is estimated to
be 1,5% of Nedbank Group ordinary shares in issue ('Odd-lot Holdings').

The board of directors of Nedbank Group has resolved to proceed with the implementation
of an odd-lot offer to repurchase the Odd-lot Holdings from the Odd-lot Holders ('Odd-lot
Offer'). The Odd-lot Offer will provide Odd-lot Holders with the ability to dispose of their Odd-
lot Holdings on an efficient basis, and will provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect
to sell their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election. For Nedbank Group it will, inter alia,
reduce the complexity and ongoing administration costs associated with a significantly larger
shareholder base including a sizeable number of Odd-lot Holders.

Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or sell their Odd-lot Holdings at the
Offer Price. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election by 12:00 (SA time) on Friday,
14 December, 2018 will automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and
chosen to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings.

Key terms of the Odd-lot Offer

The Odd-lot Offer will be subject to Nedbank Group shareholder approval ('Shareholder
Approval') in accordance with the timelines set out below.

Should Odd-lot Holders elect to sell their Odd-lot Holdings, or not make an election, Nedbank
Group will implement the Odd-lot Offer at a 5% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted
average price ('VWAP') of a Nedbank Group ordinary share at the close of business on Monday,
3 December, 2018 ('Offer Price'). The Odd-lot Offer is a standard corporate action undertaken
by JSE-listed companies and is permitted in terms of Nedbank Group's memorandum of
incorporation.

Circular and notice of general meeting

For Nedbank Group to implement the Odd-lot Offer, the board is seeking approval from
Nedbank Group shareholders to implement the Odd-lot Offer, and is therefore convening a
general meeting of shareholders ('General Meeting'), to be held in the Indaba Room, Upper
Ground Floor, H Block, Nedbank 135 Rivonia Campus, 135 Rivonia Road, Sandown, Sandton,
2196, on Thursday, 22 November, 2018 at 08:30 (SA time), at which all shareholders will be
entitled to vote on the resolutions required to implement the Odd-lot Offer. A circular ('Circular')
containing details of the Odd-lot Offer, together with a notice of General Meeting, will be
posted to Nedbank Group shareholders on Wednesday, 24 October, 2018.

Odd-lot Offer mechanics

Following receipt of Shareholder Approval, the Odd-lot Offer will open and, if you are an Odd-lot
Holder, you must decide either:
-  to sell your Odd-lot Holding to Nedbank Group at the Offer Price; or
-  to retain your Odd-lot Holding.

If you wish to retain your Nedbank Group ordinary shares, you must specifically make an
election to do so. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will automatically be
regarded as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Nedbank Group
ordinary shares to Nedbank Group and will receive the cash consideration, being the Odd-lot                                            
Holding multiplied by the Offer Price ('Cash consideration').

Notes
1  These salient dates and times are subject to amendment. Any such amendments will be released on SENS.
2  All times quoted are local times in South Africa.
3  Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will automatically be regarded as having
   chosen to sell their Nedbank Group ordinary shares to Nedbank Group and receive the Cash
   Consideration.
4  Shareholders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their Nedbank Group ordinary shares after
   the last day to trade, being Tuesday, 11 December, 2018 to Friday, 14 December, 2018, both dates
   inclusive.

Financial impact of the Odd-lot Offer

The Odd-lot Offer is not expected to have any other significant financial impact on Nedbank
Group. For illustrative purposes, and based on historical information, if Nedbank Group had to
implement the Odd-lot Offer based on:

-  existing Nedbank Group Shareholders who have Odd-lot Holdings of approximately 298 300
   Nedbank Group ordinary shares; and
-  assumed additional Odd-lot Holdings, post the Unbundling, of approximately 7 293 000
   Nedbank Group ordinary shares,

the maximum number of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to be repurchased in terms of the
Odd-lot Offer would amount to 7 591 300 Nedbank Group ordinary shares.

Based on the maximum number of Nedbank Group ordinary shares being repurchased, the
financial impact on Nedbank Group if the Odd-lot Offer is funded in full from existing cash
resources will be as follows:

-  assuming an Offer Price of R276.01 per Nedbank Group ordinary share, which is based
   on the VWAP of a Nedbank Group ordinary share on the JSE over the 10 trading days to
   28 September, 2018, plus a 5% premium, a reduction of Nedbank Group's cash resources
   of R2.095 billion;
-  a reduction of the total equity of Nedbank Group by R2.119 billion (which includes estimated
   expenses relating to the Odd-lot Offer of approximately R24.7 million); and
-  an estimated 40 basis points impact (12.4% to 12.0%) on Nedbank Group's common equity
   tier 1 ratio at 30 June, 2018.

Tax considerations

The Cash Consideration will be distributed as a return of capital by Nedbank Group, and will be
paid out of 'contributed tax capital' as defined in section 1 of the South African Income Tax Act,
58 of 1962, as amended. The Cash Consideration will therefore not be regarded as a dividend for
South African tax purposes, but as proceeds on the disposal of Nedbank Group ordinary shares.

Odd-lot Holders should seek independent advice from appropriate professional advisors about
their tax position and in particular to confirm how the applicable tax legislation applies in their
specific personal circumstances.

UNBUNDLING BY OLD MUTUAL LIMITED OF NEDBANK GROUP SHARES AND NEDBANK
GROUP’S INTENTION TO IMPLEMENT AN ODD-LOT OFFER AFTER THE UNBUNDLING

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the announcement published on SENS today by Old
Mutual Limited (‘OML’) confirming that the conditions precedent to the final step of Old Mutual plc’s
managed separation strategy (‘Managed Separation’), being the distribution of a significant portion of
OML’s shareholding in Nedbank Group to OML shareholders (the ‘Unbundling’), have now been
satisfied. The OML Board has therefore resolved to implement the Unbundling on Monday, 15 October
2018.

Overview of the Unbundling

OML will distribute to its shareholders 158 726 732 Nedbank Group ordinary shares (‘Nedbank
Shares’), comprising 31.73% of the share register at the ‘Unbundling Record Date’, being Friday, 12
October 2018. OML shareholders reflected on the OML register on the Unbundling Record Date will
receive 3.21176 Nedbank Shares for every 100 OML ordinary shares held, as outlined in the
announcement published on SENS today by OML.

Nedbank Group after the Unbundling

After the implementation of the Unbundling, OML will retain a strategic minority shareholding of 19.9%
in Nedbank Group, held through its shareholder funds, which shareholding underpins the ongoing
commercial relationship between the companies. As envisaged since inception, Managed Separation
does not impact the strategy, day-to-day management or operations of Nedbank Group, its staff or
clients and Nedbank Group continues to be an independent entity. The Unbundling will, however, result
in a number of benefits to Nedbank Group and its stakeholders, including its shareholders, which
include, but are not limited to:

     • the increased free-float of Nedbank Shares, resulting in increased liquidity along with a more
         favourable position in relevant indices;
     • the removal of any potential overhang on the Nedbank Group share price as a result of
         Managed Separation; and
     • the continued support of OML through a strategic minority shareholding which will underpin the
         ongoing commercial relationship between the companies.

Nedbank Group looks forward to working with OML in its capacity as a strategic minority shareholder,
based on the terms of the relationship agreement (‘Relationship Agreement’) announced on 20 April
2018. The Relationship Agreement deals with, amongst other things, (i) the commercial basis of the
relationship, (ii) governance processes and OML’s right to nominate one board member to serve on the
Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited Boards, and (iii) the protocols governing any review by OML of
the level of its strategic minority shareholding.

Intention to implement an odd-lot offer following the Unbundling, subject to market conditions
and all requisite approvals being received

It is envisaged that, after the Unbundling, Nedbank Group will have a significantly larger number of
shareholders (increasing from approximately 20 000 to approximately 500 000 shareholders), of which
the vast majority will hold less than 100 Nedbank Shares (‘Odd-lot Holders’). The aggregate
shareholding in Nedbank Group of the Odd-lot Holders is estimated to be 1.3% of Nedbank Group
shares in issue (‘Odd-lot Shares’) and it is therefore Nedbank Group’s intention to consider
implementing an odd-lot offer as soon as practicably possible following the Unbundling. Any final
decision by Nedbank Group to proceed with an odd-lot offer would be subject to market conditions
between today and any final announcement date. Such an odd-lot offer would be subject to shareholder
and other requisite approvals. An odd-lot offer entails Nedbank Group making an offer to eligible Odd-
lot Holders to repurchase their Odd-lot Shares. The proposed odd-lot offer will provide Odd-lot Holders
with the ability to dispose of their Odd-lot Shares on an efficient basis and provide liquidity to the Odd-
lot Holders. Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their shareholding in Nedbank Group. The proposed
odd-lot offer will also reduce the complexity and cost to Nedbank Group of managing a significantly
larger shareholder base. Further details will be communicated to Nedbank Group shareholders in due
course.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

Strong performance in a difficult environment

Nedbank Group delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2018, assisted
by our share of associate income from ETI as it returned to profitability, while our
managed operations delivered positive, but slower, earnings growth in line with
our expectations. Headline earnings of R6,7bn increased 27,0% and ROE (excluding
goodwill) improved to 18,4%. Slow revenue growth and a gradual increase in
impairments were offset by good cost management. We maintained a strong
balance sheet, as evident in our IFRS 9 fully phased-in CET1 ratio of 12,4% and the
interim dividend per share increasing by 13,9%. Total assets exceeded R1 trillion for
the first time.

Nedbank continues to make good progress in delivering market-leading client value
propositions and digital innovations. This focus has enabled us to increase our
total client base to over eight million for the first time, grow revenues and unlock
operating efficiencies. In the second half of 2018 we look forward to the launch
of more exciting innovations for clients. Our strategic enablers, including ongoing
technology investments, our people, our culture and our brand, are creating a more
client-focused, agile, competitive and digital Nedbank. 

Given the strong growth in diluted headline earnings per share in the first half
of 2018, together with expectations of a slowly improving economic outlook
and ongoing delivery on our strategy, our guidance for growth in diluted
headline earnings per share for 2018 remains unchanged, being in line with our
medium-to-long-term target of greater than or equal to GDP plus CPI plus 5%.

2018 interim results commentary

BANKING AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Global economic conditions remained relatively robust in the
first half of 2018, despite persistent geopolitical tensions
and escalating trade disputes. Much of the momentum
came from strong growth in the US, boosted by rising
business and consumer confidence on the back of rapid job
creation and substantial tax relief. Activity elsewhere in the
developed world also expanded, albeit at a slightly softer
pace. The recovery in emerging and developing economies
also continued, with growth in India accelerating and China
proving resilient. This, coupled with firmer commodity prices,
supported the recovery in most commodity-producing
countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. However, the
escalating trade war between the world's largest economies
and the faster-than-expected normalisation of US monetary
policy started to hurt capital flows to emerging markets
during the second quarter, impacting the hardest on those
countries with political and structural vulnerabilities.

The SA economy started 2018 on a weaker note, despite the
generally constructive business sentiment around changes
in the country's political leadership. These changes include,
inter alia, actions taken to restore government's finances to
a more sustainable path, commitments to address policy
uncertainty, initiatives to investigate and root out corruption,
and reform of financially troubled and operationally crippled
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Real GDP declined by
2,2% qoq in the first quarter, but the decline was partly
exaggerated by the high base established towards the end
of 2017, which included the upward revision of 2017 GDP
from 0,9% (expected) to 1,3% (actual). The weakness was
widespread, with sharpest declines recorded in agriculture,
mining, manufacturing and domestic trade. GDP growth on
Q1 2017 was up 0,8%. Consumer spending expanded further,
but at a much slower pace off the high base in 2017. Although
disposable income growth slowed, consumer confidence
improved in the first quarter, interest rates eased further in
March and the gradual recovery in household credit demand
continued. Household debt levels edged up slightly to 71,7% of
disposable income, but remain around levels last recorded early
in 2006.

Inflation increased from low levels as the hikes in VAT, excise
duties and fuel tax rates came into effect in April, but
remained contained and well within the SARB inflation target
range. The rand rallied in early 2018 on the back of optimistic
political, fiscal and ratings expectations. Moody's left both
SA's foreign and local currency debt ratings unchanged at one
notch above subinvestment grade, but changed the country's
ratings outlook from negative to stable. The other major
global rating agencies also left the country's sovereign-debt
ratings unchanged at just below investment grade. Given these
developments, SARB's Monetary Policy Committee cut the repo
rate by 25 basis points in March. However, underlying economic
conditions deteriorated over the second quarter. Fading global
risk appetite for emerging markets resulted in renewed rand
weakness and volatility, while slow progress in returning key
SOEs to operational efficiency and growing political pressure to
address inequality in land ownership, mining rights and access
to healthcare have fuelled increasing policy uncertainty among
investors and companies. Consequently, corporate demand for
credit weakened further in the first half of the year as the slump
in fixed-investment activity persisted. 

REVIEW OF RESULTS
Nedbank produced a strong performance in a domestic
macroeconomic environment that remained challenging and
volatile. HE increased 27,0% to R6 696m, boosted by associate
income from ETI's returning to profitability, while our managed
operations delivered positive, but slower, earnings growth from
a high base. This translated into an increase in DHEPS and
HEPS of 26,3% to 1 361 cents and 1 387 cents respectively, in line
with the 23% to 28% range set out in the trading statement
released on 26 July 2018. As in previous periods, we highlight
our results both including and excluding ETI (referred to as
managed operations) to provide a better understanding of
the operational performance of the business given the historic
volatility in ETI's results and the impact of a challenging SA
operating environment. We will revert to only group-level
reporting in 2019. Our managed operations produced
HE growth of 2,0% to R6 562m, with slow revenue growth and
slightly higher impairments offset by good cost management.

ROE (excluding goodwill) and ROE improved to 18,4% and 17,2%
respectively. ROE (excluding goodwill) in managed operations
was 18,3% and ROE was 17,1%. These ratios benefited from
the reduction in equity following the day one transitional
adjustments in respect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 of R3,2bn. On a
like for like basis excluding IFRS adjustments, ROE (excluding
goodwill) was 17,8% and in managed operations was 17,7%.
Total assets for the group exceeded the R1 trillion mark for the
first time. ROA increased 27 bps to 1,37% and return on RWA
increased from 2,07% to 2,48%.

Our IFRS 9 fully phased-in CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios of 12,4%
and 13,2% respectively, average LCR for the second quarter
of 106,9% and an NSFR of 116,4% are all Basel III-compliant
and are a reflection of a strong balance sheet. On the back of
strong earnings growth and a strong capital position an interim
dividend of 695 cents was declared, an increase of 13,9%.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLY TO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Nedbank continues to play an important role in society and in the economy, 
and we remain committed to delivering on our purpose of using our financial 
expertise to do good and contributing to the societies in which we operate 
by delivering value to our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and society.

For staff
We had 31 592 staffmembers in our employ, invested R270m in training
and paid salaries and benefits of R8,1bn. Our bargaining unit staff received
annual salary increases of 7,0%, ahead of inflation, and the blended average
staff salaries increased by 5,8%. As part of our People 2020 groupwide
programme aimed at transforming and aligning our culture and talent
with our strategic objectives, we refreshed our executive management
programmes to be more digitally focused, with more than 70 senior leaders
having participated in immersive learning experiences (the Executive
Business Transformation programme), with exposure to Silicon Cape,
Silicon Savannah (Kenya) and Silicon Valley. We implemented New Ways
of Work (NWoW) practices to transform Nedbank into a more agile
organisation, holistically rethinking the way we work, communicate and
manage talent on our journey to creating a high-performing culture. More
than 500 staffmembers are working according to this new approach and
we aim to increase this number to over 4 000 by June 2019. Transformation
remains a key imperative to ensure Nedbank remains relevant in a
transforming society and we have continued to focus on this across all
levels at Nedbank, from our board of directors to all our staffmembers.
Currently black representation at board is 59%, at executive is 46% and for
our total staff at more than 78%. Altogether 62% of our staff are female.
In recognition of our progress, Nedbank was recently announced as the
overall winner at the SA Board for People Practices Employment Equity,
Diversity and Transformation Awards.

For clients
We increased our total retail client numbers across the group to
8,0 million, with RBB main-banked clients growing 2,5% to 2,8 million,
supported by a 9,3% increase in main-banked clients in the middle market.
May 2018 BA900 market share data showed Nedbank either maintaining
or increasing its share of lending in home loans, vehicle finance, personal
loans, credit cards and core corporate loans. Similar trends were evident in
household deposits. Our clients' access to banking improved through our
network of 1 034 Intelligent Depositor devices and we increased the total
number of digitally focused branches to 346 or 57% of all outlets. Digitally
active and enabled clients grew as we launched new market-leading digital
innovations, with the new Nedbank Money app™ having been downloaded
one million times since its launch in November 2017. We supported our
clients by advancing R82bn (June 17: R76bn) of new loans in the first half
of 2018 to enable them to finance their homes, vehicles, education and to
grow their businesses. We safeguarded R801bn of deposits at competitive
rates. Our Net Promoter Score is second-highest among full-service
banks in SA. Nedbank's brand value increased 16% yoy and is now ranked
the ninth most valuable brand in SA (from 10th in 2017) as measured by
Brand Finance. In recognition of the market-leading innovations and CVPs
launched, Nedbank recently won the International Banker award for Best
Innovation in Retail Banking SA 2018 as well as the Banker Africas award
for Best Corporate Bank in SA. Nedgroup Investments maintained its
top-three ranking in offshore management companies in SA in the recent
PlexCrown Unit Trust Survey. The business is ranked the fourth-largest
unit trust manager and third-largest offshore unit trust manager in SA.
Nedbank Private Wealth won first place for philanthropic advice in SA in the
annual Euromoney Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey for
the fourth consecutive year. Internationally, Nedbank Private Wealth won
the award for Best UK Private Bank. In July 2018 Nedbank was selected by
SARB and the curator to provide banking services to VBS Mutual Bank's
individual-client depositors who held guaranteed deposits of less than
R100 000, following VBS Mutual Bank being placed under curatorship.
The guaranteed VBS deposit book transferred to Nedbank comprised more
than 17 000 clients and more than R250m in deposits, and we look forward
to serving them as Nedbank clients. Nedbank made use of robotic process
automation (RPA) to open these accounts in a short timeframe and added
additional resources (extended banking hours and mobile units) to cater for
the demand on the ground, specifically in Thohoyandou and Makhado. 

For shareholders
Nedbank's net asset value per share increased 4,7%
to 16 957cents (up 8,8% excluding the impact of
IFRS day-one adjustments), our share price performed
7% above the FINI15 index since the start of 2018 and
the interim dividend was up 13,9%. We expanded our
investor activities ahead of the Old Mutual managed
separation and engaged constructively with the
investment community in over 180 meetings in the
past six months. At our 51st annual general meeting all
resolutions were passed, with more than 90% of votes
in favour. Following constructive engagements with
shareholders and enhancements to our remuneration
practices, we were pleased that our remuneration policy
and disclosures received more than 99% votes in favour.
We continued to ensure transparent, relevant and
timeous reporting and disclosure to shareholders, and
were acknowledged by the Investment Analyst Society
as the leader in corporate reporting in the banking sector
and the Nedbank Group Integrated Report continued
to be ranked in the top tier of JSE-listed companies.
Nedbank's valuation metrics remain attractive, with
price/earnings and price-to-book ratios of 8,9 times and
1,5 times respectively, and a dividend yield of 5,0% at
30 June 2018.

For regulators
We maintained Basel III requirements ahead of full
compliance timelines, including a strong capital position,
achieving a CET1 ratio of 12,4% (after the fully phased-in
day-one impact of IFRS 9 and the impact of IFRS 15), an
average LCR of 106,9% in the second quarter of 2018 and
an NSFR of 116,4% at June 2018. We have invested
over R100bn in government and public sector bonds as
part of our HQLA requirements and, in doing so, remain
committed to making a meaningful contribution to the
countries in which we operate, thereby appropriately
supporting the funding needs of governments. Cash
taxation contributions of R5,7bn were made relating
to direct, indirect, pay-as-you-earn and other taxation.
We continued to work closely with all our regulators
to ensure efficient delivery of the various regulatory
programmes, and implemented IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on
1 January 2018, with a fully phased-in impact of 25 bps
on our CET1 ratio at 1 January 2018, inclusive of the
15 bps arising from our share of ETI's own transitional
IFRS 9 impact.

For society
We understand that our long-term sustainability and
success are contingent on the degree to which we deliver
value to society. We have defined our purpose as 'using
our financial expertise to do good for individuals, families,
businesses and society'. It follows then that it is through
the considered development and delivery of products and
services that satisfy societal needs that we can play our
part to enable a thriving society, create long-term value,
maintain trust and ensure the success of our brand. This
is particularly important in the current context of SA as
well as the broader African continent.

In addition to the R82bn in new loans advanced to clients in
the first half of 2018, evidence of how we have delivered on our
purpose over time includes:

-    A focus on sustainable-development finance that was
     evident in more than R460m of new lending to support
     student accommodation, R3,2bn lent to construct green
     buildings, R19,8bn dispersed for renewable-energy deals and
     R348m to affordable-housing developments. In addition,
     in line with SDG 6 – provision of clean water and sanitation
     – the first half of 2018 has seen increased investment
     alongside our clients, including bond support and debt
     capital management for selected water authorities as well
     as water-focused private-equity acquisitions. In the rest of
     Africa we integrated the market-leading Ecobank money
     transfer product into the Nedbank Money app™, enabling
     the cheapest, most efficient money transfers to more than
     33 countries across Africa.

-    Drought interventions – the 2018 Nedbank Cup final was
     held in Cape Town. As part of the legacy of the tournament
     we pledged a further R2m to remove water-sapping alien
     invasive trees around the water catchment areas that feed
     the six big dams supplying the city. This latest financial
     commitment is aimed at enabling the release of one billion
     litres (one million kilolitres) of water annually. This investment
     bolsters the R47m already invested in 23 national water
     and conservation projects through the WWF Nedbank
     Green Trust over the past five years. Through education and
     reduced consumption in our own buildings, by implementing
     initiatives such as recycling air-conditioning water and
     piloting air-flush toilets, we contributed to the City of Cape
     Town's avoiding the day-zero water crisis.

-    Having maintained our level 2 BBBEE contributor status
     for nine years, now measured under the Amended Financial
     Sector Code (FSC), gazetted in terms of section 9(1) of
     the BBBEE Act, 53 of 2003, effective on 1 December 2017.
     We invested more than R55m in socioeconomic development,
     with more than 50% allocated to education, while 75%
     of our procurement spend was used to support local
     SA business. Although Nedbank has achieved industry
     leadership according to the old FSC, we recognise that the
     Amended FSC, which comprises stricter weighting and
     targets, will lead to an industry rebasing, possibly impacting
     relative competitor positioning in this regard. Leading
     transformation remains a strategic priority for Nedbank,
     as this will enable us to remain relevant and support the
     national agenda by playing a key role in contributing to the
     country's economic growth, and in so doing being conscious
     that the manner in which such contributions are made must
     promote access to economic opportunities and financial
     inclusion to improve the overall standard of living and uplift
     the moral quotient of the country.

-    Continuing to participate in the CEO Initiative, working with
     government, business and labour towards a more inclusive
     SA society. We have been part of the leadership team in the
     credit ratings workstream, have committed R20m to the
     R1,5bn SME Fund and will become a participant in the Youth
     Employment Service, in which we, as corporate SA, aim to
     provide internship opportunities for more than one million
     South Africans. For Nedbank this is estimated to translate
     into a cost of over R150m per annum (on a run rate basis
     from 2019), supporting more than 3 000 youth.

CLUSTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Nedbank's managed operations generated HE growth of 2,0%
to R6 562m and delivered an ROE (excluding goodwill) of 18,3%.

CIB maintained an attractive ROE of above 20% and produced
a solid result, supported by a high-quality advances book and
a low CLR. This was achieved notwithstanding a challenging
environment for growing revenues. Advances growth was
impacted as clients remained cautious in initiating new projects,
and early repayments were high, while trading activity was
strong but slowed in the second quarter of 2018. Credit quality
remained excellent through proactive risk management as we
continued to monitor and manage exposures to stressed sectors
of the economy, such as construction and cement, as well as
certain SOEs.

RBB delivered a solid ROE and an increase in HE ahead of our
expectations, notwithstanding the impact of impairment
overlay releases in the previous year and IFRS changes in the
current year. NII growth was underpinned by solid growth in
advances and strong growth in deposits, offset by a lower
NIM due mainly to the impact of margin compression on
term deposits. Credit losses remained muted, reflecting a
high-quality portfolio. Excluding the impact of IFRS 9 and
15, transactional NIR growth was strong. Lower expense
growth reflects the initial impact of optimising processes and
operations, including headcount reductions as well as some
impacts from IFRS changes.

Nedbank Wealth maintained a strong ROE above 25%
and HE remained steady, despite prevailing economic and
market conditions as well as subdued investor sentiment.
The results were attributable to reasonable performances
in Asset Management, Insurance and Wealth Management
International, offset by a decline in earnings in Wealth
Management locally.

RoA's HE increased strongly off a low base as our share of
associate income from our investment in ETI returned to
profitability. Our SADC subsidiaries also grew HE off a low base
as benefits emerge from the recent investments we have made
in the franchises as a platform to create scale.

In the Centre there were no central provision releases and
fair-value gains were lower than in 2017 as, on the back of
IFRS 9 changes, we had implemented a central macro fair-value
hedge accounting solution that will result in lower accounting
volatility on our hedged portfolios in future. This was offset by a
postretirement medical aid (PRMA) credit amounting to R180m
after tax.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Growth in key lines of the statement of comprehensive
income was impacted by the implementation of IFRS 9 and
IFRS 15 accounting changes effective 1 January 2018 as the
previous year comparatives were not restated. The table
below has been presented to enable a like-for-like comparison
and provides for the following accounting changes. Under
IFRS 9 (a) suspended interest on the non-recoverable portion
of the specific defaulted book is no longer recognised as NII,
with full impairments previously being raised; (b) higher levels
of portfolio provisions are raised on new loans compared
with IAS 39; and (c) initiation fees previously recognised as NIR
are now amortised to NII through the effective-interest-rate
method. Under IFRS 15 costs of our rewards program were
previously recognised as an expense and are now recognised as
a reduction in NIR.

Net interest income
NII increased 3,4% to R14 006m, ahead of AIEBA growth of
0,8%. AIEBA growth adjusted for IFRS opening balance changes
was 1,2%.
  
NIM expansion of 9 bps to 3,67% was driven largely by an
improved asset mix of 5 bps and asset pricing of 4 bps.
The 25 bps interest rate decreases in July 2017 and March
2018 more than offset the volume-related increases in
capital and transactional deposits and resulted in a negative
endowment of 2 bps. IFRS changes had a net nil impact on
NIM, as a negative 4 bps impact of IFRS 9: Suspended interest
was offset by a positive impact of IFRS 9: Initiation fee. HQLA
optimisation added 2 bps to NIM.

Impairments charge on loans and advances
Impairments increased 13,9% to R1 815m. The CLR increased
6 bps to 0,53%, driven by increases in defaults in the CIB
portfolio and the implementation of IFRS 9, which increases
the coverage on new business, mostly in retail portfolios, and
includes impairments on off-balance-sheet exposures. This
was partially offset by the change in treatment of suspended
interest under IFRS 9, which structurally lowers the CLR of both
home loans and personal loans, and lowers the corresponding
interest margin. The low CLR continues to reflect selective
advances growth and the high quality of the portfolio across all
our businesses. 

Impairments in CIB increased from the previous year, but
remained below the TTC target. This was the result of
successful resolutions and settlements that enabled the
reversal of historic impairment provisions, offset by growth in
defaulted advances, given increased stress in some industries.
Impairments are individually determined in CIB and 88%
of specific impairments are concentrated in approximately
10 counters. RBB impairments decreased by 1,7% to R1,7bn as a
result of an improvement in collections, as well as the structural
change in the treatment of suspended interest under IFRS 9,
which reduced both impairments and NII by R181m. Adjusting
for this impact, RBB impairments would have increased
8,9%. In addition, the CLR benefited from the improvement
in macroeconomic assumptions relative to those used in
December 2017. 

Continued proactive collection and resolution strategies within
CIB and RBB contributed to group writeoffs increasing 4,9% to
R2 387m and postwriteoff recoveries increasing 8,8% to R629m.
The group's central provision remains unchanged from year end
at R150m.

Total defaulted advances increased 12,9% to R22,8bn,
representing 3,1% of advances, as the weakened economic
environment placed additional stress on specific wholesale
counters, including the construction and cement industries,
while performing defaults in RBB increased. 

The decrease in specific coverage from 37,2% to 35,2% was due
primarily to the change in the defaulted portfolio mix, with an
increase in CIB defaults. In CIB impairments are considered
on a client-by-client basis based on specific security we hold
and are adequately provided for. RBB's specific coverage
increased to 41,8%, driven by higher coverage on performing
defaulted loans after the IFRS 9 implementation. Nedbank
considers the coverage ratios appropriate given the higher
proportion of wholesale lending, compared with the mix of its
peers, high recovery rates and the collateralised nature of the
commercial-mortgages portfolio, with low loan-to-value ratios.

Portfolio coverage increased from 0,70% at December 2017
(IAS 39 basis) to 0,93% after IFRS 9 day one and 0,91% at
June 2018.

Non-interest revenue 
NIR growth of 4,3% to R12 236m reflects the negative impact
of IFRS 9 and 15, as well as weaker business and consumer
confidence levels in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the
impact of the IFRS accounting changes, NIR increased by 6,6%
on a like-for-like basis from the ongoing progress in delivering on
our transactional banking strategy. 

-    Commission and fee income grew 3,2% to R8 709m.
     RBB reported good underlying transactional NIR growth
     of 8,1% (excluding the impact of IFRS9), supported by
     good main-banked client growth in the middle market,
     professional and small-business client segments.
     CIB delivered solid growth, despite the closure of almost all
     of the round 4 renewable-energy deals being delayed to the
     second half of 2018.

-    Insurance income increased 7,0% to R830m, supported by
     a lower-claims experience in homeowner's cover after the
     catastrophic weather events experienced the previous year,
     as well as the benefit of lower business strain relating to the
     funeral book. This growth was slightly offset by higher lapses
     and lower reserve releases.

-    Trading income increased 4,5% to R2 096m, with strong
     growth in equities and slower growth in debt trading, as
     activity levels among wholesale clients remained muted,
     particularly in the second quarter of the year.

-    Private-equity income, including investment realisations
     in the Commercial Property Finance portfolio and higher
     dividends received, increased 38,3% off a low base to R282m.

Expenses
Expense growth of 2,7% to R14 756m was well below the
inflation rate and below the guidance we provided for the full
2018 year (being growth of mid-single digits), demonstrating
disciplined and careful management of discretionary expenses in
an environment of slow revenue growth as well as benefits from
IFRS. Excluding the pretax PRMA benefit of R250m, expenses
increased by 4,4% and excluding IFRS changes expenses grew by
3,6%. The underlying movements included:

-    Staff-related costs increasing at 3,5%, following:
     -  an average annual salary increase of 5,8% and a
        1 053 reduction in staff numbers since June 2017;
     -  a 10,0% increase in short-term incentives in line with the
        group's financial performance; and
     -  a settlement with our staff with regard to PRMA
        obligations and benefits, resulting in a provisional R250m
        credit in respect of actuarially estimated liabilities
        previously raised.

-    Computer-processing costs increasing 4,5% to R2 218m,
     driven by increases in software amortisation and incremental
     software licence costs, offset by reduced network-related
     costs as a result of efficiency savings. 

-    Other cost lines being well managed, with increases below
     inflation, and reflecting the benefits from implementing our
     new target operating model, as well as efficiencies from the
     adoption of automation and robotics as well as procurement
     savings.

The group's growth in expenses of 2,7% was below total revenue
growth (including associate income) of 9,2%, resulting in a
positive jaws ratio of 6,5% and an efficiency ratio of 55,8%,
compared with 59,3% in the first half of 2017. The jaws ratio in
managed operations was positive at 1,0%.

Earnings from associates
The R207m associate income was largely attributable to
R247m from ETI's profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the
first quarter of 2018, in line with our policy of accounting for
ETI earnings a quarter in arrear. The total effect of ETI on the
group's HE was a profit of R134m, including the R113m impact of
funding costs. 

Accounting for associate income, together with Nedbank's
share of ETI's other comprehensive income and movements
in Nedbank's foreign currency translation reserves and our
share of ETI's own IFRS 9 transitional adjustment, resulted
in the carrying value of the group's strategic investment in
ETI decreasing from R3,3bn at 31 December 2017 to R2,9bn
at 30 June 2018. ETI's listed share price increased by 17,6%
during the first half of 2018, which resulted in the market
value of the group's investment in ETI increasing to R4,6bn at
30 June 2017, using the official Central Bank of Nigeria rate
(305 Naira:US $) and R4,0bn based on the NAFEX rate
(361 Naira:US $, which we use for sensitivity analysis purposes).
While risks remain, it is expected that the actions taken to
improve ETI's financial position and governance, along with
an improving macroeconomic environment, will continue to
drive an improved financial performance in 2018. ETI's results
for the six months to 30 June 2018, released on 19 July 2018,
highlighted the continuing trend of strong earnings growth as
attributable profit increased to US $58m for Q2 2018, with
Nedbank's estimated share though associate income being
R162m (reported in Q3 2018 a quarter in arrear).

In line with IFRS requirements the R1bn impairment provision
recognised at 31 December 2016 was reviewed at 30 June
2018 and management determined that there were no
indicators of further impairment. We observed an improvement
in ETI's recent financial performance, but it is not yet considered
to be a sufficient indicator of sustainable performance to
release the impairment provision or part thereof. Our position
will be reassessed at 31 December 2018. Should ETI continue the
recent trend of delivering increased earnings during the second
half of 2018, there could be sufficient observable indicators at
year-end for the R1bn impairment provision to be decreased or
no longer required.

A R40m associate loss was incurred due to operational losses in
an associate, which is the cash-processing supplier to the four
large banks.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Capital
The group remains well capitalised at levels significantly above
the minimum regulatory requirements. The CET1 ratio of
12,4% is reflective of organic capital generation, offset by 5%
growth in RWA during the period and after accounting for the
full impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on
1 January 2018. The group CET 1 capital ratio was also positively
impacted following a weakening of the rand against the US
dollar during the period. 

The total tier 1 and total CARs decreased as a result of a further
grandfathering of old-style preference shares (R531m) in
January 2018 in line with the Basel III transitional arrangements.
The total CAR was positively impacted by the issuance of
further tier 2 capital of R2,0bn during March 2018.

Funding and liquidity
Optimising our funding profile and maintaining a strong liquidity
position remain a priority for the group.

The group's three-month average long-term funding ratio was
28,4% for the Q2 2018, supported by growth in Nedbank Retail
Savings Bonds of R3,5bn to R28,3bn and the successful capital
market issuances of R2,4bn senior unsecured debt and R2,0bn
tier 2 capital.

The group's June 2018 quarterly average LCR of 106,9%
exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 90% in
2018 and the group maintains appropriate operational buffers
designed to absorb seasonal and cyclical volatility in the LCR.

financial results.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA increased by
7,6% to a June 2018 quarterly average of R148,7bn. The LCR
increased yoy as a result of a marginal increase in HQLA,
while net cash outflows remained fairly constant. The HQLA
portfolio, taken together with our portfolio of other sources of
quick liquidity, resulted in total available sources of quick liquidity
of R203,8bn, representing 20,0% of total assets.

Nedbank exceeded the minimum NSFR regulatory requirement
of 100% effective from 1 January 2018 and reported a June
2018 ratio of 116,4%. The key focus in terms of the NSFR is to
achieve continued compliance in the context of balance sheet
optimisation.

Loans and advances
Loans and advances increased by 0,4% yoy to R712,7bn, driven
by solid growth in RBB, but offset by a decline in trading
advances and short-dated lending in CIB as well as the IFRS
day-one impact of R3,2bn. Excluding the IFRS impact, advances
grew 0,8%.

(3) Intercompany eliminations.

RBB loans and advances grew 6,3% to R315,5bn, supported
by growth across all asset classes in line with risk appetite
and prudent origination strategies. Business Banking grew
advances 9,1%, largely due to an increase in new-loan payouts,
coupled with an increase in client drawdowns of existing
facilities. MFC (vehicle finance) increased advances by 9,2%
as new-business volumes remained robust despite a muted
new-vehicle sales market. Unsecured Lending grew advances
6,2% and we remain comfortable with the quality and overall
performance of the unsecured-lending portfolio based on the
conservative rules we apply to consolidation, restructuring and
term strategies. Card advances decreased 1,3%, reflecting gross
advance growth of 5,3%, offset by an increase in impairments
due to IFRS day-one changes. Home loan advances grew
at below-inflation levels as growth in the overall residential
mortgage market remains muted and Nedbank maintained
market share. 

CIB loans and advances decreased 5,0% yoy to R345,8bn.
The banking book declined slightly due to a combination of
ongoing early repayments, managed selldowns, which allowed
for the diversification of risk, and a decrease in the preference
share book due to less appetite for preference share deals. This
was offset by increased demand for new term loans, as well as
commercial-mortgage loans and advances increasing 4,0% to
R132,2bn. The CPF portfolio contains good-quality collateralised
assets with low loan-to-value ratios, underpinned by a large
secure asset pool and a strong client base, and is managed by
a highly experienced property finance team. Trading advances
declined by 39,7% and includes the result of the choice to
settle more expensive foreign funding, which reduced interbank
foreign placements.

Deposits
Deposits grew 5,0% yoy to R801,2bn, with total funding-related
liabilities increasing 4,4% to R854,8bn, while the loan-to-deposit
ratio improved to 89,0%.

Through the active management of the RBB franchise, deposits
grew 8,8% yoy to R303,8bn, resulting in household deposits
market share remaining at 19,0%. This was supported by
Nedbank's strong market share in household CASA deposits
of 18,0%. Nedbank Wealth and RoA grew deposits by 4,3%
and 11,7% respectively in line with the objective of growing
Basel III-friendly deposits.

During the 12 months to June 2018 Nedbank has successfully
reduced its use of more expensive foreign currency funding in
the general rand funding pool through growth in negotiable
certificates of deposit, structured deposits, fixed deposits and
current and savings accounts. This strategy not only contributed
to the positive management of the long-term funding profile,
but also reduced foreign currency funding reliance.

The positive tilt towards more Basel III-friendly RBB
deposits and the reduction in foreign currency funding through
deliberate growth in negotiable certificates of deposit,
structured deposits and other deposits have contributed
positively to ensuring cost-effective regulatory compliance while
maintaining a strong balance sheet position.

Group strategic focus
During the first six months to 30 June 2018 we continued
to focus on delivering on our five strategic focus areas
that underpin sustainable earnings growth and improving
returns. We made good progress in delivering market-leading
CVPs and digital innovations. This focus enabled Nedbank
to increase its total client base to over eight million for
the first time, grow revenues and unlock operating
efficiencies. Our strategic enablers, including technology
investments (with our Managed Evolution IT strategy and
Digital Fast Lane as key components), our people, our culture
and our brand, are delivered through our target operating model
and by embracing New Ways of Work (NWoW). This is enabling
us to create a more client-focused, agile, competitive and digital
Nedbank.

-    Delivering innovative market-leading client
     experiences. The new Nedbank Money app™, which
     makes banking more convenient for our retail clients,
     has been downloaded one million times, with more than
     400 000 clients having used it since November 2017.
     UNLOCKED.ME, our first lifestyle marketplace proposition
     aimed at the youth, was launched earlier this year. More
     features and functionality on this ecommerce platform
     will be released soon to enable clients to unlock even more
     benefits. We also launched our new Stokvel Account that
     offers members of stokvels up to 10% discount at our
     retail partners, burial benefits of R10 000 a member for
     only R15 a month, zero transaction fees and great interest
     rates. In Nedbank Wealth we piloted geyser telemetry, an
     innovative smart home solution that reduces electricity
     consumption and may prevent resultant damage. Current
     plans include extending the pilot to more than 500 clients.
     As far as our integrated channels are concerned, we have
     converted 57% of our outlets to new-image digital branches
     to date, and our investment in distribution channels over
     the next three years (until 2020) will result in 82% of our
     retail clients being exposed to the new-image branch
     format and self-service offerings. The introduction of
     chatbots and robo-advisors will continue to enhance client
     experience through our contact centre and web-servicing
     capabilities. Nedbank Insurance was the first-to-market
     insurer in SA to have chatbot functionality, and we have
     made significant strides in remaining ahead through
     delivering live-agent service functionality and funeral
     quoting capabilities. Nedgroup Investments won The
     Financial Times Banker Magazine Technology Project award
     in the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics category for our
     robo-advice solution. We are continuing with our NZone
     (digital self-service branch at the Sandton Gautrain station)
     and solar-powered branch (in deep-rural areas such as
     Upper Mncwasa in the Eastern Cape) pilots before extending
     the rollout of these innovative concepts in the future.
     The foundations put in place through Managed Evolution
     (our core systems and technology platform transformation),
     digital enhancements and NWoW are delivering ongoing
     incremental digital benefits and enhanced client service.
     In H2 2018 Nedbank will bring further exciting digital
     innovations to market to enhance client experiences and
     drive efficiencies. Some of these innovations include a
     refreshed internet banking experience in line with our mobile
     banking apps; the ability to sell an unsecured loan bundled
     with a transactional account; simplified client onboarding
     with convenient, FICA-compliant account opening; a new and
     exciting loyalty and rewards solution; and the further rollout
     of chatbots, robo-advisors and software robots (robotic
     process automation). We are also launching MobiMoney,
     which allows clients to receive and send money, buy airtime
     and electricity from a cellphone and withdraw money at a
     Nedbank ATM – all without a formal bank account.

-    Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than
     the market. Nedbank's SA retail franchise grew its total
     client base 1,6% to 7,7 million, with 6,1 million clients having
     a transactional account and 2,8 million main-banked
     clients supporting retail transactional NIR growth of 8,1%
     (excluding IFRS adjustments). Our main-banked client
     numbers have grown yoy by 2,5%, driven largely by growth
     in the middle-market, professional and small-business-client
     segments. The 2017 Consulta Survey estimated Nedbank's
     share of main-banked clients at 12,7%, up from the
     10,1% recorded through the 2015 All Media and Products
     Study Survey (using a similar methodology), as we aim
     to reach a share of more than 15% by 2020. Our SADC
     businesses grew their client base by 6% to 334 000,
     supporting NIR growth of 12%. Our integrated model in CIB
     enabled deeper client penetration and increased cross-sell,
     resulting in 15 primary-bank client wins in the past six
     months.

-    Being operationally excellent in all we do. Cost discipline
     is an imperative in a weak economic environment resulting
     in slower revenue growth. We have ongoing initiatives to
     optimise our cost base. These include the reduction of our
     core systems from 251 to 125 since the inception of the
     Managed Evolution programme, with us being well on our
     way to reaching a target end state of less than 60 core
     systems by 2020, and the reduction of floor space in RBB
     by more than 30 000 m² by 2020, of which 28 828 m² has
     been achieved to date. Good progress was also made with
     our target operating model initiatives, with cumulative
     savings to June 2018 of R512m, with the aim of generating
     R1,2bn pretax benefits for Nedbank by 2020 as disclosed in
     an element of our long-term incentive scheme. Most cost
     initiatives have been identified in RBB, and we delivered
     savings of R337m to June 2018, which includes RBB's
     target operating model savings. Over the past 18 months
     we reduced headcount by 1 154 (mainly through natural
     attrition), optimised our staffed points of presence by
     closing eight branches (while maintaining our coverage of
     the bankable population at 84%). We achieved efficiencies
     through our increased footprint of Intelligent Depositor
     devices, with the recycling of cash at these devices now at
     58% of all cash, from 20% in 2015. During H1 2018, new
     client-servicing functions that were previously only available
     in branches or staffed channels were released on the
     Nedbank Money app™ taking the total servicing functions
     available to 42. The new Nedbank Online banking site was
     also launched during this period, with 31 client-servicing
     functions released. An additional two releases are planned,
     which will increase the total app and web service functions to
     60. We implemented 51 software robots to date (robotic
     process automation) to enhance efficiencies and reduce
     processing errors in administrative-intense processes. These
     exclude the temporary software robots used to onboard the
     more than 17 000 VBS clients. Through our newly adopted
     agile IT development approach and NWoW we have reduced
     the time and cost of bringing new innovations to market.

-    Managing scarce resources to optimise economic outcomes.
     We maintained our focus on growing activities that
     generate higher levels of EP, such as growing transactional
     deposits and increasing transactional banking revenues,
     with commission and fees in RBB (excluding the impact
     of IFRS accounting changes) and CIB up 6,5% and 6,6%
     respectively. Our selective origination of personal loans,
     home loans and commercial-property finance has proactively
     limited downside credit risk in this challenging operating
     climate, enabling a CLR of 0,53%, below the bottom end of
     our TTC target range. At the same time our balance sheet
     metrics remain strong and we continue to deliver attractive
     dividend growth. Nedbank is continually looking for
     opportunities to grow and create value for shareholders and
     in June 2018 has been selected as one of four short-listed
     bidders for Mercantile Bank to proceed to the second phase
     of the process. Any final bid will be evaluated against strict
     strategic, financial and cultural criteria.

-    Providing our clients with access to the best financial
     services network in Africa.

     -  In Central and West Africa, where we have adopted a
        partnership approach, ETI remains an important strategic
        investment for Nedbank, providing our clients with access
        to a pan-African transactional banking network across
        39 countries and Nedbank with access to dealflow in
        Central and West Africa. We have made good progress
        in working with ETI's board and other institutional
        shareholders. ETI reported six consecutive quarters of
        profit and is making good progress on its transactional
        banking and digital strategy and optimising its cost base.
        We remain supportive of ETI's endeavours to deliver an
        ROE in excess of its COE over time. While risk remains,
        economic conditions in Nigeria and other economies in
        West Africa are improving, and ETI should continue to
        provide a strong underpin to Nedbank Group's earnings
        growth in 2018. We have also increased our levels of
        collaboration, with more than 90 of our wholesale
        clients being banked by ETI and progress being made
        in partnering with ETI to expand our wealth franchise,
        collaborating on the pan-African remittances product and
        increasing treasury and trading activities.

     -  In SADC, where we own, manage and control six banks,
        we continue to build scale and optimise costs. Our core
        banking system, Flexcube, has now been implemented in
        all subsidiaries (excluding Banco Único). We continued to
        launch a number of new digital products and reported
        a 146% increase in banking app transactions and a 6%
        increase in client numbers. During the period Merchant
        Bank of Central Africa (MBCA) in Zimbabwe was
        rebranded to Nedbank Zimbabwe.

Old Mutual plc managed separation
Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the
announcements published on 11 March 2016, 28 June 2016,
1 November 2017 and 20 April 2018 relating to Old Mutual plc's
managed separation strategy, which entails, among other
things, the creation of a new South African holding company,
Old Mutual Limited ('OML').

The admission of, and commencement of unconditional dealings
in, the ordinary shares of OML on the JSE as a primary listing
and also on the London Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock
Exchange, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and the Malawi Stock
Exchange took place on 26 June 2018.

Listing of OML is the precursor to the third and final step of
the managed separation and entails the reduction in OML's
shareholding in Nedbank Group through the distribution of
Nedbank Group ordinary shares to OML's shareholders. This
will result in OML, immediately after the implementation of
distribution or unbundling, holding a 19,9% strategic minority
shareholding in Nedbank Group. It is anticipated that the
Nedbank unbundling will take place approximately six months
from the date of the OML listing as mentioned above, and will
allow suitable time for the transition of the OML shareholder
register to an investor base with an SA and emerging-market
focus and mandate. After the unbundling Nedbank Group is
likely to see an increase in the number of its shares held by
emerging-market-mandated index funds, which will adjust
according to the improved Nedbank free float (from about
45% before unbundling to about 80% after unbundling) and a
normalisation of SA institutional shareholding (some of which
are currently underweight on a straight-market-capitalisation
basis given some Nedbank Group holding through the OML
shareholding).

Nedbank Group continues to operate on a business-as-usual
basis and the managed separation will have no impact on our
strategy, our day-to-day management or operations, our staff
or our clients. Our engagements with Old Mutual have been at
arm's length and are overseen by independent board structures.
Old Mutual operates predominantly in the investment, savings
and insurance industry, which has little overlap with banking,
even though we compete in the areas of wealth and asset
management and personal loans. Our technology systems,
brands and businesses have not been integrated. 

As noted before, our collaboration to unlock synergies will
continue to be underpinned by OML's strategic shareholding in
Nedbank Group. We are committed to working with OML to
deliver ongoing synergistic benefits at arm's length.

Economic and regulatory outlook
The International Monetary Fund expects global economic
growth to accelerate to 3,9% in 2018 from 3,7% in 2017, with
advanced countries forecast to grow by 2,5% and emerging and
developing economies by 4,9%. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is
expected to accelerate to 3,3% in 2018 from 2,9% in 2017.

Given SA's poor economic performance in early 2018, Nedbank
Group's current forecast for GDP growth in 2018 is 1,0%,
down from 1,3% in 2017. GDP growth thereafter is forecast
to increase to 1,8% and 2,2% in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
Although inflation is forecast to remain within SARB's inflation
target range, it is likely to drift higher during the rest of the year
and into 2019. The upward pressure on inflation is expected
to emanate from higher food, fuel and electricity prices, as
well as a moderately weaker rand. The rand is forecast to be
volatile as global risk appetite softens on growing concerns over
world growth prospects in light of rising protectionism and the
normalisation of monetary policy in most developed countries.
As a result, domestic interest rates are forecast to remain
unchanged for the remainder of the year, but the risk to the
interest rate outlook has shifted to the upside.

Consumer spending is likely to remain firm, supporting
moderate growth in household credit demand. Faster growth
appears unlikely given that household finances are likely
to be hurt by slower wage growth and higher living costs.
Corporate credit demand will remain subdued, but should
improve modestly off a low base. Continued global growth
and rising commodity prices could eventually translate into
cyclical recoveries in SA's major export-orientated industries.
Some revival is also expected in renewable-energy projects,
but persistent policy uncertainty, particularly around property
expropriation without compensation, the Mining Charter and
the challenging domestic operating environment, will probably
delay a more broad-based recovery in fixed investment.

Government spending should be kept in check by the need to
reduce the budget deficit and contain the rise in government
debt to avoid a further sovereign-ratings downgrade. Progress
with tackling strategic, structural and financial problems at
many state-owned enterprises – and Eskom in particular – is
essential to lift economic growth.

Overall economic conditions in SA should improve off a low base
over the next three years. Despite the many challenges faced by
the SA economy, the SA banking system remains sound, liquid
and well capitalised. 

Prospects
On the back of the group's strong performance in H1 2018 and
developments in the environment, we have updated our
guidance on financial performance currently expected for the
full year 2018 as follows:

-    Average interest-earning banking assets to grow below
     nominal GDP (previously: in line with nominal GDP).
-    NIM to be slightly above the 2017 level of 3,62% (unchanged).
-    CLR to increase, but remain below the bottom of our target
     range of 60 to 100 bps (under IFRS 9) (previously: increase
     into the bottom half of our target range).
-    NIR to grow above mid-single digits (unchanged).
-    Associate income to be positive (ETI associate income
     reported quarterly in arrear) (unchanged).
-    Expenses to increase below mid-single digits (previously:
     increase by mid-single digits).

Given the strong financial performance in the first half of 2018,
together with expectations of a slowly improving economic
outlook and ongoing delivery on our strategy, our guidance for
growth in DHEPS for 2018 remains unchanged, being in line with
our medium-to-long-term target of greater than or equal to
GDP plus CPI plus 5%.

The outlook for our medium-to-long-term targets in 2018 is as
follows, and we remind investors that we have set ourselves
specific 2020 targets of ROE (excluding goodwill) of greater 
than or equal to 18% and cost to income of lower than or equal to 53% as
a pathway to ongoing and sustainable improvements in the key metrics that 
support shareholder value creation.

(1) During the period the group reviewed the classification of certain investments on the statement of financial position. As a result of this review the group's
    private-equity investments have been reclassified from investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment
    securities better to reflect the measurement of these investments at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-period balances have been restated accordingly
    (30 June 2017: R2 642m; 31 December 2017: R3 169m). The investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements were renamed
    investments in associate companies.

Significant accounting policies
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) was issued in July 2014 and has replaced IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement (IAS 39). The standard was effective and was implemented by the group from 1 January 2018. This standard
incorporates amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments [see part (ii)], hedge accounting guidance
and the accounting requirements for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through OCI [see
part (iii)]. The group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9.
For notes disclosures the consequential amendments to IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures have also been applied only to the
current period. Notes disclosures for the comparative period repeat those disclosures made in the previous year. Set out below are
disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the group.

The group's approach to transition is discussed and the resultant net impact on opening reserves on 1 January 2018 is provided in
part (i).

(i) Transition
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the group has elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to
the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition have been recognised in the opening retained
earnings and other reserves at 1 January 2018. The following table illustrates the impact on opening reserves on transition to IFRS 9.
Further information relating to this impact is provided in part (ii) and part (iii).

(ii) Classification and measurement
Financial assets are classified based on:
- the business model within which the financial assets are held and managed; and
- the contractual cashflow characteristics of the financial assets, ie whether the cashflows represent 'solely payments of principal
  and interest'.

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model of which the objective is to hold those assets
for the purpose of collecting contractual cashflows and those cashflows comprise solely payments of principal and interest (ie 'hold to
collect' business model).

Financial assets are measured at FVOCI if they are held within a business model of which the objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cashflows and selling financial assets, and those contractual cashflows comprise solely payments of principal and interest
(ie 'hold to collect and sell' business model). Movements in the carrying amount of these financial assets are taken through OCI,
except for impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses, which are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit
or loss.

The remaining financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). All derivative instruments that are either
financial assets or financial liabilities will continue to be classified as held for trading and measured at FVTPL.
For equity investments that are held neither for trading nor for contingent consideration the group may irrevocably elect to present
subsequent changes in fair value of these equity investments in OCI. Where the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is not reclassified from equity to profit or loss. However, it may be reclassified in equity.
Alternatively, where the group does not make the abovementioned election, fair-value changes are recognised in profit or loss. This
election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. On initial recognition the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset
otherwise meeting the requirements for measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI, as FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The accounting for financial liabilities is largely unchanged, except for financial liabilities designated at FVTPL. Changes in the fair
value of these financial liabilities that are attributable to the group's own credit risk are recognised in OCI. Where the financial liability
is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is not reclassified from equity to profit or loss. However, it
may be reclassified in equity.

On the initial application of IFRS 9 an entity may revoke its previous designation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured
at FVTPL (fair-value option), with the loans being reclassified in amortised cost or FVOCI, depending on the entity's business model
for the asset.

(1) Macro fair-value hedge accounting solution – Nedbank has adopted a macro fair-value hedge accounting solution that accounts for changes in the fair value of

(3) Held for sale (FVTPL) – In light of the business model requirements certain instruments have been reclassified from amortised cost to FVTPL.

On initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 the group elected to revoke the existing designation of R58bn of loans classified
in FVTPL and R60bn of amounts due to depositors classified at FVTPL under the fair-value option of IAS 39, and reclassified the
underlying assets and liabilities in amortised cost.

(iii) Impairments
Impairments in terms of IFRS 9 are determined based on an ECL model, as opposed to an incurred loss model in terms of IAS 39.
The ECL model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt instruments at FVOCI, lease receivables and certain
loan commitments as well as financial guarantee contracts.

Under IFRS 9 loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases:

- twelve-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and
- lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

The group is required to recognise an allowance for either 12-month or lifetime ECLs, depending on whether there has been a
significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Indicators of a SICR in the retail portfolio may include any of
the following:

- Short-term forbearance.
- Direct debit cancellation.
- Extension to the terms granted.
- Previous arrears within the past months.
Indicators of a significant increase in credit risk in the wholesale portfolio may include any of the following:
- Significant increase in the credit spread.
- Significant adverse changes in business, financial and/or economic conditions in which the client operates.
- Actual or expected forbearance or restructuring.
- Significant change in collateral value.
-  Early signs of liquidity and cashflow problems, such as a delay in the servicing of trade creditors/loans.

Measurement of ECLs
The measurement of ECLs reflects a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and the entity's best available
forward-looking information. The abovementioned probability-weighted outcome considers the possibility of a credit loss occurring
and the possibility of no credit loss occurring, even if the possibility of a credit loss occurring is low. Credit losses are measured as the
present value of all cash shortfalls (ie the difference between the cashflows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the
cashflows that the group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

The assessment of the ECL of a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets entails estimations of the likelihood of defaults
occurring and of default correlations between counterparties. The group measures ECL using probability of default (PD), exposure at
default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD). These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of default.
The calculated ECL is then discounted using the original effective interest rate of the financial asset.

The assessment of SICR and the calculation of ECL both incorporate forward-looking information. The group has performed historical
analyses and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and ECL for each portfolio. These economic variables and
their associated impact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial instrument. The group's economics unit provides a forecast of
economic variables and an overview of the economy quarterly or more often if necessary. Significant judgement and estimates are
applied in this process of incorporating forward-looking information into the SICR assessment and ECL calculation.

Credit-impaired financial assets
At each reporting date the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or
more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cashflows of the financial asset have occurred. The group's definition of credit-impaired is aligned to our internal definition
of default.

Presentation of impairment
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets, and the amortised cost is presented on the face of the statement of
financial position.

For debt securities at FVOCI the loss allowance is recognised in OCI, instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.
For off-balance-sheet exposures, such as financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowance is presented in 'Provisions and other liabilities' on the face of the statement of financial position.

(1) Revenue is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest revenue.

Due to the group's strategic investment in ETI being in an associate company that the group does not control, the group's managed
operations exclude ETI-related assets, funding, equity-accounted earnings and associated after-tax funding costs. The Group EXCO
therefore separately reviews the performance of the group's managed operations and, on this basis, the total assets are R1 016 143m
(June 2017: 962 747m; December 2017: R979 994m), total liabilities are R928 122m (June 2017: R880 185m; December 2017: R892 919m),
revenue is R26 398m (June 2017: R25 418m; December 2017: R52 008m) and headline earnings is R6 562m (June 2017: R6 433m;
December 2017: R12 762m). ETI forms part of the Rest of Africa segment, whose segmental information on a managed-operations
basis include total assets of R36 675m (June 2017: R32 540m; December 2017: R34 167m), total liabilities of R31 094m (June 2017:
R27 849m; December 2017: R29 186m), revenue of R1 457m (June 2017: R1 341m; December 2017: R2 792m) and headline earnings of

The group, in the ordinary course of business, enters into transactions that expose it to tax, legal and business risks. Provisions are
made for known liabilities that are expected to materialise. Possible obligations and known liabilities where no reliable estimate can
be made or it is considered improbable that an outflow would result are reported as contingent liabilities. This is in accordance with
IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Limited and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which
cannot be foreseen at present.

Fair-value hierarchy
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the definition of fair value is an
assumption that an entity is a going concern without any intention or need to liquidate, to curtail materially the scale of its operations
or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not, therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced
transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where they exist, they
are used to measure the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if transactions occur with sufficient
volumes and frequencies to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. These quoted prices would generally be classified as level
1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial instrument is not
active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include reference to the current
fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same in nature, reference to the value of the assets of underlying business,
earnings multiples, a discounted-cashflow analysis and various option pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would
generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy. The determination of whether an instrument is classified
as level 2 or level 3 is dependent on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs in relation to the fair value of the
instrument. Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility, servicing costs,
equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.

The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review protocols for the
independent review and validation of fair values separate from those of the business unit entering into the transaction. The valuation
methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to the fair-value measurement of the financial instruments have been applied in a
manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY
The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the IFRS fair-value hierarchy
as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based (directly or indirectly) on market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the availability of
observable inputs. These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in
the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market, the maturity of market
modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is based on inputs
that are not market-observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of the best information available and
may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities, appropriate proxies or other analytical techniques.

All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

(1) During the period the group reviewed the classification of certain investments on the statement of financial position. As a result of this review the group's private-equity investments have been reclassified from investments in private-equity
    associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment securities better to reflect the measurement of these investments at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-period balances have been restated accordingly
    (30 June 2017: R2 642m; 31 December 2017: R3 169m). The investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements have been renamed investments in associate companies.

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE ASSUMPTIONS TO REASONABLE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES
The fair value of financial instruments is, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that include assumptions that are not market-observable. Where these scenarios apply,
the group performs stress testing on the fair value of the relevant instruments. When performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the unobservable-input parameters are chosen so that
they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with the group's approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative
uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable-input parameters and which are classified as level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. However, the
disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

    been reclassified from investments in private-equity associates, associate companies and joint arrangements to investment securities better to reflect the measurement of these investments 
    at fair value. To provide comparability the prior-period balances have been restated accordingly (30 June 2017: R2 642m; 31 December 2017: R3 169m). The investments in private-equity associates,

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY (UNAUDITED)
In terms of the group's policy, transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair-value hierarchy are deemed to have
occurred at the end of the reporting period.

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value for
which fair value is disclosed

Certain financial instruments of the group are not carried at fair value and are measured at amortised cost. The calculation of the
fair value of these financial instruments incorporates the group's best estimate of the value at which these financial assets could be
exchanged, or financial liabilities transferred, between market participants at the measurement date. The group's estimate of what
fair value is does not necessarily represent what it would be able to sell the asset for or transfer the respective financial liability for in
an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The fair values of these respective financial instruments at the reporting date detailed below are estimated only for the purpose of
IFRS disclosure, as follows:

There have been no significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the fair value of the above instruments during
the period.

LOANS AND ADVANCES
Loans and advances that are not recognised at fair value principally comprise variable-rate financial assets. The interest rates on
these variable-rate financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.

Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value of these
loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs. Due to the unique characteristics of the loans and advances
portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposal of such loans and advances, there is no basis
to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an orderly transaction. The group is not currently in
the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and
advances on a forced-sale basis.

For specifically impaired loans and advances the carrying value, as determined after consideration of the group's IFRS 9 expected
credit losses, is considered the best estimate of fair value.

The group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing loans and
advances measured at amortised cost. This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected monthly cashflows
per product type. Future cashflows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be granted to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and maturities. Methodologies and models are updated on a continuous basis for changes in assumptions,
forecasts and modelling techniques. Future forecasts of the group's probability of default (PD) and loss given defaults (LGDs) for the
periods 2019 to 2021 (2017: for periods 2018 to 2020) are based on the latest available internal data and is applied to the projected
cashflows of the first three years. Thereafter, PDs and LGDs are gradually reverted to their long-run averages and are applied to
the remaining projected cashflows. Inputs into the model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances.
The determination of such inputs is highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a
significant change in the determination of the fair value of loans and advances.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER SECURITIES
The fair value of government and other securities is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted-cashflow
analysis (level 2), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES
The fair value of other short-term securities is determined using a discounted-cashflow analysis (level 2).

LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of long-term debt instruments is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted-cashflow analysis
(level 2), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

AMOUNTS OWED TO DEPOSITORS
The amounts owed to depositors principally comprise of variable-rate liabilities. The carrying value of the amounts owed to depositors
approximates fair value because the instruments reprice to current market rates at frequent intervals. In addition, a significant
portion of the balance is callable or is short-term in nature.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER ASSETS, MANDATORY DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS AND
PROVISIONS AND OTHER LIABILITIES
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and other
liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short term in nature or are
repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.

Definitions

Assets under administration (AUA) (Rm) Market value of assets held in custody on behalf of clients.
Assets under management (AUM) (Rm) Market value of assets managed on behalf of clients.

Common-equity tier 1 (CET1) capital adequacy ratio (%) CET1 regulatory capital, including unappropriated profit, as a percentage
of total risk-weighted assets.

Credit loss ratio (CLR) – banking advances (%) Impairments charge on loans and advances in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income as a percentage of daily average gross loans and advances. 

Default Default occurs in respect of a particular client in the following instances:

- When the bank considers that the client is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the bank in full without the bank having
  recourse to actions such as realising security (if held).
- When the client is past due for more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the bank. Overdrafts will be
  considered as being past due if the client has breached an advised limit or has been advised of a limit smaller than the
  current outstanding amount.
- In terms of Nedbank's Group Credit Policy, when the client is placed under business rescue in terms of the Companies Act,
  71 of 2008, and when the client requests a restructure of his facilities as a result of financial distress.

Defaulted loans and advances (non-performing defaulted advances) Any advance or group of loans and advances that has
triggered the Basel III definition of default criteria and is in line with the revised SA banking regulations. For retail portfolios
this is product-centred and a default would therefore be specific to a client or borrower account (a specific advance). For all
other portfolios, except specialised lending, it is client- or borrower-centred, meaning that should any transaction within a
borrowing group default, all transactions within the borrowing group would be treated as having defaulted.

At a minimum a default is deemed to have occurred where a material obligation is past due for more than 90 days or a client
has exceeded an advised limit for more than 90 days. A specific impairment is raised against such a credit exposure due to a
significant perceived decline in the credit quality. 

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary
shares, adjusted for potential dilutive ordinary shares.

Dividend cover (times) Headline earnings per share divided by dividend per share.

Economic profit (EP) (Rm) Headline earnings less the cost of equity (total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, less
goodwill, multiplied by the group's cost-of-equity percentage).

Effective taxation rate (%) Direct taxation as a percentage of profit before direct taxation, excluding non-trading and
capital items.

Efficiency ratio (%) Total operating expenses as a percentage of total income, being net interest income, non-interest revenue and
share of profits or losses from associates and joint arrangements.

Earnings per share (EPS) (cents) Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by the weighted-average number of
ordinary shares in issue.

Gross operating income growth rate less expenses growth rate (jaws ratio) (%) Measure of the extent to which the total income
growth rate exceeds the total operating expenses growth rate.

Headline earnings (Rm) The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, excluding specific separately identifiable
remeasurements, net of related tax and non-controlling interests.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue.

Life insurance embedded value (Rm) The embedded value (EV) of the covered business is the discounted value of the projected
future after-tax shareholder earnings arising from covered business in force at the valuation date, plus the adjusted net worth.

Life insurance value of new business (Rm) A measure of the value added to a company as a result of writing new business. Value of
new business (VNB) is calculated as the discounted value, at the valuation date, of projected after-tax shareholder profit from
covered new business that commenced during the reporting period, net of frictional costs and the cost of non-hedgeable risk
associated with writing new business, using economic assumptions at the start of the reporting period.

Net asset value (NAV) (Rm) Total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.

Net asset value (NAV) per share (cents)  NAV divided by the number of shares in issue, excluding shares held by group entities at
the end of the period.

Net interest income (NII) to average interest-earning banking assets (AIEBA) (%) NII as a percentage of daily average total assets,
excluding trading assets. Also called net interest margin (NIM).

Non-interest revenue (NIR) to total income (%) NIR as a percentage of operating income, excluding the impairments charge on
loans and advances.

Number of shares listed (number)  Number of ordinary shares in issue, as listed on the JSE.

Ordinary dividends declared per share (cents)  Total dividends to ordinary shareholders declared in respect of the current period.
Performing defaulted loans and advances (Rm) Loans that would otherwise not be in default, but are classified as defaulted due to
regulatory requirements, ie directive 7 and the new curing definition.

Portfolio coverage (%) Portfolio impairments in the statement of financial position as a percentage of gross loans and advances,
excluding defaulted advances.

Portfolio impairments (Rm) Impairment for latent losses inherent in groups of loans and advances that have not yet been
specifically impaired. 

The standard portfolio represents all the loans and advances that have not been impaired. These loans and advances have not
yet individually evidenced a loss event, but there are loans and advances in the standard portfolio that may have an impairment
without the bank being aware of it yet.

A period of time will elapse between the occurrence of an impairment event and objective evidence of the impairment
becoming evident. This period is generally known as the emergence period. For each standard portfolio an emergence period is
estimated as well as the probability of the loss trigger and the loss given events occurring. These estimates are applied to the
total exposures of the standard portfolio to calculate the portfolio impairment.

Preprovisioning operating profit (PPOP) (Rm) Headline earnings plus direct taxation plus an impairments charge on loans and
advances.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent (Rm) Profit for the period less non-controlling interests pertaining to ordinary
shareholders, preference shareholders and additional tier 1 capital instrument noteholders.

Profit for the period (Rm) Income statement profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent, before non-controlling
interests. 

Return on equity (ROE) (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity.

Return on equity (ROE) (excluding goodwill) (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity
less goodwill.

Return on tangible equity (%) Headline earnings as a percentage of daily average ordinary shareholders' equity less
intangible assets.

Risk-weighted assets (RWA) (Rm) On-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures after applying prescribed risk weightings
according to the relative risk of the counterparty.

Specific impairments (Rm) Impairment for loans and advances that have been classified as total defaults and specifically impaired,
net of the present value of estimated recoveries.

Specific coverage (%) Specific impairments in the statement of financial position as a percentage of total defaulted advances.
Tangible net asset value (Rm) Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, excluding intangible assets.

Tangible net asset value per share (cents) Tangible net asset value (NAV) divided by the number of shares in issue, excluding shares
held by group entities at the end of the period.

Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) (%) Tier 1 regulatory capital, including unappropriated profit, as a percentage of
total risk-weighted assets.

Total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) (%) Total regulatory capital, including unappropriated profit, as a percentage of
total risk-weighted assets. 

Value in use (VIU) (Rm) The present value of the future cashflows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.

Weighted-average number of shares (number) The weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period listed on
the JSE.

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE ADMISSION OF OLD MUTUAL LIMITED TO THE MAIN
BOARD OF THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the announcements published on 11 March 2016, 28 June
2016, 1 November 2017 and 20 April 2018 relating to Old Mutual plc´s managed separation strategy
(`Managed Separation´), which entails, among other things, the creation of a new South African holding
company, Old Mutual Limited (`OML´).

The admission of, and commencement of unconditional dealings in, the ordinary shares of OML to the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited as a primary listing and also to the London Stock Exchange,
the Namibian Stock Exchange, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and the Malawi Stock Exchange took
place at 9.00 a.m. SAST today, 26 June 2018. For full details, Nedbank Group shareholders are
referred to the announcement published by OML today.

As previously communicated, the admission of OML is the precursor to the third and final step of the
Managed Separation which will entail the reduction of OML´s shareholding in Nedbank Group to a
minority shareholding of 19.9% in Nedbank Group´s ordinary shares, held through OML’s shareholder
funds (`Strategic Minority Shareholding´), through a distribution of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to
OML shareholders on the OML share register at that time (`Nedbank Unbundling´). It is anticipated that
the Nedbank Unbundling will take place approximately six months from the date of the admission of
OML as set out above.

Nedbank Group shareholders will be kept appropriately informed of further developments regarding the
Nedbank Unbundling.

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGES TO THE BOARDS
OF DIRECTORS

The boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited (‘the Companies’) announce the
appointment of Peter Moyo, and simultaneous resignation of Bruce Hemphill, as non-
executive directors of the Companies with effect from 11 June 2018.

In March 2016 Old Mutual plc announced its Managed Separation (‘MS’) strategy, and in
April 2018 Old Mutual plc announced that, subject to shareholder and other approvals, the
MS would be materially completed by the end of 2018, with the listing of Quilter plc on the
LSE on 25 June 2018, followed by the listing of Old Mutual Ltd (‘OML’), which will become
the holding company of the Old Mutual plc, on the JSE on 26 June 2018. The third and final
step in the MS is the proposed unbundling of Nedbank approximately six months after the
implementation of the first two steps, whereby OML intends, subject to certain conditions, to
distribute approximately 32% of the total issued share capital of Nedbank to OML’s
shareholders, whilst retaining a strategic minority stake of 19.9% in Nedbank in its
shareholder funds.

Bruce Hemphill was appointed as the Group Chief Executive of Old Mutual plc on 1
November 2015 and as a non-executive director of the Companies on 25 November 2015.
With MS progressing according to plan, Bruce will be stepping down from the boards of the
Companies with effect from 11 June 2018 and he will be replaced by Peter Moyo who is the
CEO of OML.

Peter is the Chairman of Business Against Crime South Africa (BACSA) and board member
of the Right to Care and Right to Care Health Services and a member of the Advisory Board
of the Stellenbosch University Business School.

Peter is a vastly experienced business leader, he is a former Group CEO of Alexander
Forbes and deputy managing director of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa)
Limited. In terms of board roles, his resume includes, amongst others, being past Chairman
of Vodacom Group Limited and Willis SA (Pty) Ltd, CSC SA (Pty) Ltd, and he has been a
director of Transnet Limited, Liberty Group and Liberty Holdings Limited, and Chairman of
the Audit Committee in the office of the Auditor General.

Mr Vassi Naidoo, Nedbank Group Chairman, welcomed Peter and noted: ‘Peter’s experience
and understanding of the South African and wider financial services industry will be of great
benefit to the Nedbank Group Board including developing the arm’s length commercial
arrangements and good relationship between the Companies and OML.

Vassi also expressed his sincere gratitude to Bruce for his contribution to the Nedbank
Group during his tenure on the boards.

The above board changes do not impact on the current Nedbank Group and Nedbank
Boards diversity targets, which remain as follows:

UPDATE ON NEDBANK GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH 2018 AND
PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS AT 31 MARCH 2018


UPDATE ON THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH 2018
Nedbank Group produced a strong performance for the first three months of the year, underpinned by the return to profitability of Ecobank
Transnational Incorporated (ETI) in their fourth-quarter of 2017 (equity-accounted one quarter in arrear in Nedbank Group’s first quarter of
2018). Managed Operations performed in line with our expectations. While business and consumer confidence levels have improved, the
beneficial impact thereof in the group’s performance to date has largely been limited to improved trading and market-related activities. Credit
demand and transactional activity has remained subdued, but an improvement is expected from the second half of 2018.


Net interest income grew at low- to mid-single-digit levels. The net interest margin (NIM) for the period widened ahead of the full-year 2017
level of 3,62% led by advances and funding mix benefits, as well as improved asset pricing.


The group’s credit loss ratio (CLR) now reported under IFRS 9, increased in line with expectations and was slightly below the lower end of our 60
to 100 bps through-the-cycle target range.


Non-interest revenue grew just above mid-single-digit levels. Commission and fee growth reflects subdued levels of client transactional activity
as well as accounting impacts from IFRS 15, offset by continued cross-sell and gains in clients across our retail and wholesale businesses. In line
with the improved business sentiment, trading and private equity income grew strongly, while insurance income increased off a low base in the
first quarter of 2017.


Disciplined expense management resulted in expenses growing in line with our expectations.


Associate income from the group’s share of ETI’s attributable income is equity-accounted one quarter in arrear, based on ETI’s publicly disclosed
results. In Q1 2018 the group’s share of ETI’s attributable profit of US $16,5m for their fourth quarter in 2017 (announced on 21 March 2018)
was R42m (Q1 2017: R1 203m loss) and in Q2 2018 the group’s share of ETI’s attributable profit of US $77m for their first quarter in 2018
(announced on 23 April 2018) is estimated at R198m (subject to exchange rate movements) (Q2 2017: R142m). As a result, the group’s associate
income relating to ETI for the first six months of 2018 is estimated at R240m (H1 2017: R1 061m loss).


Our earnings guidance for 2018 remains the same as announced on 2 March 2018, where we noted: ‘Reflecting on the impact on the group of
the greater levels of business and consumer confidence evident in the early part of 2018, an improving economic outlook, ongoing delivery on
our strategy and ETI’s returning to sustained levels of profitability, our guidance for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2018 is to
be in line with our medium-to-long-term target of greater than or equal to GDP plus CPI plus 5%.’


Shareholders are advised that the guidance is based on organic earnings and our latest macroeconomic outlook, and have not been reviewed or
reported on by the group’s auditors.

Basel III capital adequacy
Both the group and bank remain well capitalised at levels significantly above the minimum regulatory requirements. The common-equity tier 1
ratios of 12,5% (December 2017: 12,6%) and 12,3% (December 2017: 12,6%), respectively are reflective of organic capital generation and growth
in risk weighted assets during the period and include the full impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. The group CET 1 capital
ratio also decreased marginally following the strengthening of the ZAR against the USD during the period. The total tier 1 and total capital
adequacy ratios were adversely impacted by a further grandfathering of old-style preference shares (R531m) in January 2018 in line with the Basel
III transitional arrangements. The total CARs were positively impacted by the issuance of further new-style tier 2 capital of R2bn during March
2018.

Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
In accordance with the provisions of section 6(6) of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the relevant LCR
disclosure requirements, as set out in Directive 6/2014, Directive 11/2014 and Directive 1/2018.

The LCR aims to ensure that a bank holds an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover total net cash outflows
over a 30-day period under a prescribed stress scenario. Based on the final revisions announced by the Basel Committee the LCR is being phased-
in by 10% each year and will reach a minimum requirement of 100% from 1 January 2019.

    (1) Only banking and/or deposit-taking entities are included and the group data represents an aggregation of the relevant individual net cash outflows and the individual HQLA
        portfolios, where surplus HQLA holdings in excess of the minimum requirement of 90% for 2018 have been excluded from the aggregated HQLA number in the case of all non-SA banking
        entities.
    (2) Unweighted values are calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows).
    (3) Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates (for inflows and outflows).
    (4) Note that total cash outflows less total cash inflows may not be equal to total net cash outflows to the extent that regulatory caps have been applied to cash inflows as specified by the
        regulations.

The group's quarterly average LCR exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 90% applicable in 2018, where the group maintains
appropriate operational buffers designed to absorb seasonal and cyclical volatility in the LCR. Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA
(comprising mainly of government bonds and treasury bills) increased to a quarterly average of R139,5bn, up marginally from December 2017
where the portfolio amounted to R138,2bn. Nedbank will continue to procure additional HQLA to support balance sheet growth and the LCR
phase-in, while maintaining appropriately sized surplus liquid-asset buffers. The lower LCR observed in the current quarter (105,7%), compared
with the previous quarter (116,2%), relates to a business-as-usual seasonal trends observed every year after the December holiday period.

Shareholders are advised that this report has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s auditors.

Conclusion of a relationship agreement between Nedbank Group and Old Mutual Limited and
proposed changes to the Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited boards of directors

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the announcements published by Nedbank Group on
11 March 2016, 28 June 2016 and 1 November 2017 relating to Old Mutual plc’s managed separation
strategy, which entails, among other things, the creation of a new South African holding company, Old
Mutual Limited (‘OML’). OML will retain a minority shareholding of 19,9% (‘Strategic Minority
Shareholding’) in Nedbank Group’s ordinary shares, held through its shareholder funds, after the
implementation of the Old Mutual plc managed separation (‘Managed Separation’).

For full details of the Managed Separation, Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the
announcement published by Old Mutual plc on 20 April 2018.

According to the Old Mutual plc announcement, there are three steps to the finalisation of the
Managed Separation, the third of which is the proposed reduction of OML’s shareholding in Nedbank
Group to the Strategic Minority Shareholding through a distribution of Nedbank Group shares to OML
shareholders on the OML share register at that time (‘Nedbank Unbundling’).

As a consequence of the Managed Separation, and in particular the Nedbank Unbundling, Nedbank
Group and OML have entered into a relationship agreement (‘Relationship Agreement’) to govern
the terms of their relationship upon completion of the Nedbank Unbundling and to replace the historic
relationship agreement between Old Mutual plc and Nedbank Group. A copy of the Relationship
Agreement is available for inspection on Nedbank Group’s website at www.nedbankgroup.co.za and
at Nedbank’s headoffice at 135 Rivonia Road, Sandown, 2196, South Africa.

The Relationship Agreement deals with, among other things, (i) the commercial basis of the
relationship, (ii) governance processes and, in particular, OML’s right to nominate one boardmember
to serve on the Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited boards (‘OML’s Nomination Right’), and (iii)
the protocols governing any review by OML of the level of its Strategic Minority Shareholding. With
specific reference to (ii) above, and to give effect to OML’s Nomination Right, OML and/or Old Mutual
plc will ensure that two of its three nominated non-executive directors serving on the Nedbank Group
and Nedbank Limited boards will resign on or before the date of the Nedbank Unbundling.

It is anticipated that the Nedbank Unbundling will take place approximately six months after the OML
listing. The exact number and value of Nedbank Group shares that each OML shareholder will receive
pursuant to the Nedbank Unbundling will be determined by a number of factors at the time of the
Nedbank Unbundling. Assuming that the expected number of OML shares to be issued immediately
after the OML listing and the current Nedbank Group shares in issue remain constant until the time of
the Nedbank Unbundling, it is expected that OML shareholders will receive approximately three
ordinary shares in Nedbank Group for every 100 OML shares held.

Nedbank Group shareholders will be kept appropriately informed of further developments regarding
the Managed Separation.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2018 COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEMES

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following
information is disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors and the company secretary of
Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

The following shares have been committed by the executive directors and the company secretary to the
2018 Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)     in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme, deferred bonus amounts can be invested in the
        Matched Share Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee resign and not
        be classified as a good leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well as in cases where, in the
        sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial
        results come to light during the deferral period. In these instances, the employee also forgoes the
        right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)     in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax bonus
        (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set out above) can
        be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into the Matched Share
        Scheme. Alternatively, the employee can commit shares already owned by them up to an
        equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus less any amount already
        deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee can dispose of these shares
        at any time prior to the vesting date, which will cancel their participation in the scheme in respect
        of those shares, and will render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

The date of the transactions (off-market) was 31 March 2018 (the inception date) and the value of the
shares was determined using a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 22
March 2018 and 26 March 2018.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in
trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person has
remained in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held
on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target
for the period 2018 to 2020 is met.

VESTING OF SHARES TO DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY: 2015 MATCHED SHARE SCHEME

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to
executive directors and the company secretary of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2015 Matched Share
Scheme. This is not classified as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

(a)     In terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme (CBSS), compulsory deferred bonus amounts
        could be invested in the Matched Share Scheme. The deferred amount would be forfeited should
        the employee resign before the end of the deferral period and not be classified as a good leaver, as
        well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material irregularities or
        misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral period. In these instances,
        the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)     In terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme (VBSS), up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax
        bonus (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set out
        above) could be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would then be committed into the
        Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the employee could commit shares already owned by them
        up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus less any amount already
        deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these
        shares at any time prior to the vesting dates, which would cancel their participation in the scheme
        in respect of those shares and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares committed into the Matched Share Scheme
but no rights to dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the
requisite Matched Shares are delivered to the Participant.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in
trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person
continued in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held
on vesting date would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance
target for the period 2015 to 2017 was met.

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGE TO THE BOARDS OF
DIRECTORS

The boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited (“the Companies”) announce the
retirement of Ms Nomavuso Mnxasana as an independent non-executive director of the
Companies with effect from the close of Nedbank Group’s Annual General Meeting on
Thursday, 10 May 2018.

Nomavuso was appointed to the Companies’ boards in 2008 and has reached the end of her
nine-year term as an independent non-executive director. During her tenure she has chaired
the Group Transformation, Social and Ethics Committee, and has also been a member of the
Group Audit Committee, Group Risk and Capital Management Committee, Group
Remuneration Committee, and Group Directors’ Affairs Committee. Nedbank Group
Chairman, Vassi Naidoo, thanked Nomavuso for her exceptional service and commitment to

DEALING IN SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY SECRETARY: EXERCISE AND SALE OF OPTIONS
GRANTED IN 2012 IN TERMS OF THE NEDBANK EYETHU BLACK EXECUTIVE TRUST

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the
following information is disclosed in respect of the exercise of 39 600 Nedbank Group
ordinary share options and the sale thereof by the Company Secretary of Nedbank Group
and Nedbank Limited (‘Nedbank’).

Background:
In August 2005, Nedbank Group implemented a black economic empowerment transaction,
which was comprised of a number of schemes empowering a broad base of over 500 000
previously disadvantaged beneficiaries. 41 268 130 new ordinary shares in Nedbank Group
were issued for the purposes of this BEE transaction, which at the time equated to
approximately 9.47% of the Company’s issued share capital (post the issue of the shares)
and also equated to black ownership of 11.5% of the value of Nedbank Group’s South
African businesses.

The South African BEE transaction comprised of three groupings, namely:

-   the Black Business Partners Schemes and the Non-Executive Directors Scheme;
-   the Client Schemes and the Community Scheme; and
-   the Employee Schemes (including a Black Executive Scheme, Black Management
    Scheme, Broad-based Employee Scheme and the Evergreen Scheme).

Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust:
The Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust (‘BET’) manages and operates the Black Executive
Scheme referred to above. The trustees of the BET award Nedbank Group shares and grant
options on Nedbank Group shares to qualifying participants for retention and attraction
purposes. The entitlement of such executives to the shares and options is conditional upon
them remaining in the employ of Nedbank Group over the vesting period, during which 33%
of the shares awarded or options granted vest in each of years 4 and 5 and 34% in year 6.
The participants are identified from time to time by the Nedbank Group Remuneration
Committee on the recommendation of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee.

Exercise of options that were awarded to Thabani Jali on 8 March 2012:
20 000 Nedbank Group shares and 60 000 options (with a strike price of R161.88) were

Preliminary audited results for the year ended 31 December 2017 

A solid performance in a volatile and challenging domestic environment

Nedbank continued to create value for all our stakeholders in a challenging political and economic environment. Our
headline earnings of R11,8bn, up 2,8%, reflect a good performance from our managed operations, with headline earnings
growth of 7,8% and a ROE (excluding goodwill) of 18,1%. Slower revenue growth was offset by reduced impairments and good
cost management, while our share of the loss from our associate ETI following its Q4 2016 results decreased in the
second half of the year as the ETI business returned to profitability. 

The achievements of the last few years have provided us with a solid base and we continue delivering on our strategies
and building the capabilities that will enable us to meet the 2020 targets we have now set of an ROE (excluding
goodwill) of greater than or equal to 18% and an efficiency ratio of less than or equal to 53%. We released exciting
digital innovations such as the new Nedbank Money app, the Nedbank Private Wealth app and Karri app, chatbots and
UNLOCKED.ME (an exclusive e-commerce marketplace for millennials) and continued to gain share of transactional banking
clients in both our retail and wholesale businesses. We are actively optimising our cost base, as reflected in cost
growth at 5,1%, and maintained a strong balance sheet as evident in a CET1 ratio of 12,6%, above the top end of our
internal target range. Our strategic enablers are making a difference for our operations and for our clients as we
create a more agile, competitive and digital Nedbank. 

Looking forward, 2018 started with positive changes to SA's political and socioeconomic landscape and brought renewed
prospects for higher levels of inclusive growth. Nedbank is acutely aware of the increased responsibility that we, and
indeed all businesses, have to work alongside government, labour and civil society to play our part in improving the
lives of all South Africans. 

Reflecting on the impact on the group of the greater levels of business and consumer confidence evident in the early
part of 2018, an improving economic outlook, ongoing delivery on our strategy and ETI's returning to sustained levels of
profitability, our guidance for growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2018 is to be in line with our
medium-to-long-term target of greater than or equal to GDP plus CPI plus 5%.

2017 results commentary

Banking and economic environment

Economic growth in developed markets improved, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, supported by accommodative
monetary policies and stronger manufacturing production, and reinforced by increased global trade. Emerging and
developing economies also improved as a consequence of better-than-expected growth in China and higher global commodity
prices. Emerging-market equity and bond markets benefited from increased capital inflows as global investors search for
higher yields.

SA's slow economic recovery continued into the second half of the year, with 2017 GDP growth estimated at 0,9%, driven
mainly by a recovery in agricultural production following good summer rainfall and some improvement in mining production
in response to stronger global demand and firmer international commodity prices. A revival in consumer spending added
further momentum in the second half of 2017 as households benefited from lower inflation and the marginal reduction in
interest rates in July. Despite this recovery and reflective of weak business and consumer confidence, business volumes
in 2017 were generally lower than in the prior year, as evident in client loan applications across multiple products and
in slower client trading activity. 

The pace of economic activity picked up moderately in sub-Saharan Africa, with agricultural and mining output recovering
on the upturn in global demand and international commodity prices, and the prolonged El Niño-induced drought finally
broke in many countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sub-Saharan Africa is expected to record
GDP growth of 2,6% in 2017.   

Domestic inflation averaged 5,3% in 2017, significantly lower than the 6,4% recorded in 2016, brought about mainly by
sharply lower food inflation given the strong summer harvest. Relatively moderate and selective consumer demand coupled
with a resilient rand also helped contain price pressures during the course of the year. After a year of volatile trade
the rand ended 2017 2,5% stronger against the trade-weighted basket of currencies. The largest gains occurred near
year-end as sentiment surged following the election of Mr Cyril Ramaphosa as the new leader of the ruling ANC in
mid-December on expectations of a change in the country's leadership, improved governance and structural reforms that
are likely to support investment and higher levels of inclusive growth.

After cutting the repo rate by 25 bps to 6,75% in July, SARB's Monetary Policy Committee left interest rates unchanged
at both the September and November 2017 policy meetings. The central bank's more cautious approach was driven by
concerns over the upside risk that the rand posed to the inflation outlook at that time. Fears mounted that SA's
rand-denominated sovereign debt ratings could be downgraded to subinvestment grade by all three major rating agencies,
given the escalation in political uncertainty and the sharp deterioration in the country's fiscal position, as set out
in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.

In November 2017 Fitch affirmed the country's BB+ rating with a stable outlook (one notch below investment grade).
Moody's placed SA's Baa3 foreign and local currency ratings on review for downgrade, with the decision to follow the
2018 National Budget in February. However, S&P Global downgraded SA's local currency rating to BB+ (one notch below
investment grade) and our foreign currency rating to BB (two notches below investment grade), while changing the rating
outlook to stable. All three rating agencies highlighted similar concerns, including weaker-than-expected public
finances, weak economic growth, ineffective government spending and policies as well as the paralysing impact of
political infighting and poor governance.

Review of results

Nedbank produced a solid performance in a domestic macro and political environment that has proved volatile and
challenging. Headline earnings, including losses in associate income from ETI of R744m, increased 2,8% to R11 787m. This
translated into an increase in DHEPS of 2,4% to 2 406 cents and an increase in HEPS of 2,2% to 2 452 cents. As in prior
periods, we highlight our results both including and excluding ETI (referred to as managed operations) to provide a
better understanding of the operational performance of the business given the volatility in ETI's results in 2016 and
2017. However, we will revert to group-level reporting in 2019. Our managed operations produced headline earnings growth
of 7,8% to R12 762m, with slower-than-expected revenue growth more than offset by reduced impairments and good cost
management. 

ROE (excluding goodwill) and ROE remained flat at 16,4% and 15,3% respectively. ROE (excluding goodwill) in managed
operations also remained stable at 18,1%. ROA decreased 0,01% to 1,22% and, excluding ETI, ROA in managed operations
improved from 1,29% to 1,33%. Return on RWA increased from 2,23% to 2,30%.

Our CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios of 12,6% and 13,4% respectively, average LCR for the fourth quarter of 116,2% and an
NSFR of above 100%, are all Basel III-compliant and are a reflection of a strong balance sheet. On the back of solid
earnings growth in managed operations and a strong capital position, a final dividend of 675 cents was declared, an
increase of 7,1%. The total dividend per share increased 7,1% to 1 285 cents.

Delivering sustainably to all our stakeholders

Nedbank continues to play an important role in society and in the economy, and we remain committed to delivering on our
purpose of using our financial expertise to do good and contributing to the societies in which we operate by delivering
value to our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and society.

For staff 

We had 31 887 staffmembers in our employ, invested R355m in training and paid salaries and benefits of R16,5bn. As part
of our People 2020 groupwide programme aimed at transforming and aligning our leadership culture and talent to our
strategic objectives, we refreshed our executive management programmes to be more digitally focused. We brought together
500 of our leaders across the group at the Leadership Accelerator to ensure the adoption of new insights that will drive
accelerated levels of change. We are implementing New Ways of Work practices to transform Nedbank into a more agile
organisation, holistically rethinking the way we work, communicate and manage talent on our journey to creating a
high-performing culture. Transformation remains a key imperative and we have continued to focus on this fundamental
change across all levels at Nedbank, from our board of directors to all our staffmembers. Currently black representation
at board level is 61%, at executive level 50% and 78% for our total staff. A total of 62% of our staff is female.

For clients 

Our clients' access to banking improved through our network of 1 003 Intelligent Depositor devices and we increased the
total number of digitally focused new-image branches to 336 or 55% of all outlets. Digitally active and enabled clients
grew as we launched new market-leading digital innovations, with the new Nedbank Money app having been downloaded more
than 300 000 times since its launch in November 2017. We supported our clients by advancing R153bn of new loans in 2017.
Our Net Promoter Score is second-highest among full-service banks in SA. Nedgroup Investments has grown to be the
fifth-largest unit trust manager and fourth-largest offshore unit trust manager in SA, with overall assets under
management growing by 14% to R312bn. Nedgroup Investments has for the third consecutive year maintained its first
position in the 2017 Annual Raging Bull Awards offshore category. 

For shareholders

Nedbank's net asset value per share increased 7,3% to 16 990 cents, with our share price up 7,5% over the year. Our
total dividend increased 7,1%, ahead of growth in HEPS. We engaged constructively with shareholders in over 400 meetings
in the past 12 months, and at our 50th annual general meeting all resolutions were passed, with more than 90% of votes
in favour. We ensure transparent, relevant and timeous reporting and disclosure to shareholders, as acknowledged by the
Nedbank Group Integrated Report having been ranked in the top tier of JSE-listed companies. Nedbank's valuation metrics
remain attractive with price/earnings and price-to-book ratios of 10,4 times and 1,5 times respectively and a dividend
yield of 4,8% at 31 December 2017.

For regulators

We maintained Basel III requirements ahead of full compliance timelines. We improved the group's capital position,
achieving a CET1 ratio of 12,6%, strengthened the average LCR ratio to 116,2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and
maintained an NSFR of above 100%, positioning us well for the compliance date of 1 January 2018. We have invested over
R100bn in government and public sector bonds as part of our HQLA requirements and, in doing so, remain committed to
making a meaningful contribution to the countries in which we operate, thereby appropriately supporting the funding
needs of governments. Cash taxation contributions of R9,8bn were made relating to direct, indirect, pay-as-you-earn and
other taxation, increasing from R8,9bn in 2016. We continued to work closely with all our regulators to ensure efficient
delivery of the various regulatory programmes, and implemented IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018, with an estimated
impact of less than 20 bps on our CET1 ratio at 1 January 2018.

For society

We understand that our long-term success is contingent on the degree to which we deliver value to society. We have
defined our purpose as ‘using our financial expertise to do good for individuals, families, businesses and society'. It
follows then that it is through the considered development and delivery of products and services that satisfy societal
needs that we can enable a thriving society, create long-term value, maintain trust and ensure the success of our brand.
This is particularly important in the current context of SA.

In addition to the R66bn made available to retail clients in new loans and advances in 2017, evidence of how we have
delivered on our purpose includes:

     - A focus on sustainable-development finance that was evident in more than R1,1bn of new lending to support student
       accommodation, R1,3bn lent to construct green buildings, R18,4bn dispersed for renewable-energy deals and R863m to
       affordable-housing developments. 

     - Having maintained our level 2 broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) contributor status for nine years, as
       well as in 2017 when the Amended Financial Sector Code (FSC), gazetted in terms of section 9(1) of the BBBEE Act,
       53 of 2003, came into effect on 1 December 2017. We invested R168m in socioeconomic development, with more than
       50% allocated to education and 75% of our procurement spend used to support local SA business. While Nedbank has
       achieved industry leadership based on the old FSC, we recognise that the Amended FSC, which comprises stricter
       weighting, higher targets and higher thresholds, will lead to an industry rebasing and as a result possibly lower
       BBBEE levels in future.

     - Water efforts focused on support for drought-impacted clients and national relief efforts as well as our own
       internal reduction initiatives. 

     - Continuing to participate in the CEO Initiative, working with government, business and labour towards a more
       inclusive SA society. We committed R20m to the R1,5bn SME Fund and will become one of the first participants in
       the Youth Employment Scheme, in which we, as corporate SA, aim to provide internship opportunities for more than
       one million South Africans.

It was pleasing to have some of our efforts to build a thriving society recognised by external bodies. These included
being recognised as the winner at the 2017 Independent Top Empowered Companies Awards (in conjunction with Business
Report, Empowerdex and Intellidex), being included as a member of the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate A-list
(recognition for efforts to address climate change) and being the only African company among the top 20 in the global
2017 Thomson Reuters Diversity and Inclusion Index, which is informed by environmental, social and governance outcomes.

Cluster financial performance 

Nedbank's managed operations generated headline earnings growth of 7,8% to R12 762m and delivered an ROE (excluding
goodwill) of 18,1%. CIB and Wealth were impacted the most by the challenging operating environment, RBB made a strong
earnings contribution and RoA subsidiaries delivered an improved performance off a low base.

CIB maintained an attractive ROE of above 20% and produced solid results, driven by lower credit losses and good expense
management. Revenue lines were affected by slowing economic activity as clients postponed projects and borrowed and
transacted less. Early repayments and managed settlements, together with slower drawdowns resulted in weaker advances
growth, although the pipelines remained stable. Credit quality remained strong through proactive risk management as we
continued to monitor stressed sectors of the economy, such as certain areas in retail and certain state-owned
enterprises, closely.

RBB delivered an improved ROE and good headline earnings growth, underpinned by solid transactional NIR growth, lower
impairments and expense growth, and achieved PPOP growth of 4,0%. NII was underpinned by solid growth in advances and
strong growth in deposits, offset by a lower NIM due in part to the impact of prime–JIBAR squeeze. Lower expense growth
reflects the initial impact of optimising processes and operations, including headcount reductions. 

Nedbank Wealth maintained an attractive ROE, although headline earnings were impacted by subdued markets and negative
investor sentiment, further compounded by entropic weather conditions and the strengthening rand, as well the once-off
profit from the sale of our Visa share in the 2016 base.

RoA headline earnings were negatively impacted by the fourth-quarter 2016 ETI associate loss accounted for quarterly in
arrear. The loss was reported on in our interim results and was followed by subsequent quarterly profits from ETI up to
30 September 2017. Our subsidiaries grew headline earnings off a low base, supported by the consolidation of Banco Único
(included for three months in 2016), notwithstanding continued investment in infrastructure, systems and skills.

The improvement in the Centre was largely due to the R350m release from the central provision, of which R150m was in the
first half of the year, and fair-value gains on certain hedging portfolios.

Financial performance 

Net interest income

NII increased 4,5% to R27 624m, ahead of average interest-earning banking asset growth of 2,2% (adjusted for the removal
of the liquid-asset portfolio). 

NIM expansion of 8 bps to 3,62% (2016: 3,54% rebased) was largely driven by an endowment benefit of 5 bps and improved
asset mix changes of 8 bps. Asset pricing pressure, in part due to the NCA interest rate caps, the narrowing of the
prime–JIBAR spread and the increased cost associated with enhancing the funding profile each reduced NIM by 2 bps. 

Impairments charge on loans and advances 

Impairments decreased by 27,5% to R3 304m. The CLR declined by 0,19% to 0,49%, driven by lower specific impairments
mostly from resolutions and settlements in CIB. The decrease in impairments reflects the quality of the portfolio across
all our businesses and we have specific coverage ratios levels of 36,2%. 

Impairments in CIB declined by 82,4% to R193m, driven by lower specific impairments relating largely to resolutions of
historic client matters. Impairments are individually determined in CIB and 84% of impairments are concentrated in
approximately 10 counters. RBB impairments declined by 1,2% to R3,2bn as a result of ongoing lower risk origination
strategies and an improvement in collections. The decrease in unsecured lending and home loan CLRs reflects the benefits
of historic selective origination improving the quality of the book over time and the release of additional impairment
overlays previously raised for risks and events that did not materialise. Continued proactive collection and resolution
strategies within CIB and RBB contributed to group writeoffs decreasing 6,0% to R4 675m and postwriteoff recoveries
increasing 5,8% to R1 224m. 

The group's central provision decreased to R150m (from R500m at 31 December 2016 and R350m in June 2017) as a result of
risks that had previously been identified but had not materialised. The balance is retained for prudency in a volatile
macroeconomic environment. Excluding the central provision release, the group CLR would have been 0,54%. 

CLR (%)   Banking advances (%)   2017   2016  TTC target ranges

Group                    100,0   0,49   0,68          0,60–1,00

All business units successfully applied selective origination strategies that enabled an overall derisking of the
advances portfolio, leading to defaulted advances remaining flat at R19,6bn. Lower defaulted advances in CIB resulting
from positive client resolutions were offset by increased defaulted advances in RBB.

The decrease in specific coverage from 37,4% to 36,2% was primarily due to lower specific coverage in RBB as well as
increased resolutions of various client issues in CIB resulting in lower specific impairments. The lower coverage
reflects increased performing defaults in RBB and the recovery success in CIB. Nedbank considers the coverage ratios
appropriate given the higher proportion of wholesale lending, compared with the mix of its peers, high recovery rates
and the collateralised nature of the commercial-mortgages portfolio, with low loan-to-value ratios.

Portfolio coverage increased marginally from 0,69% to 0,70%, reflecting the offsetting effects of higher portfolio
impairments due to stronger advances growth in RBB and the reduction of the central provision and RBB overlays.

Non-interest revenue

NIR growth of 2,4% to R24 063m reflects the impact of weak business and consumer confidence levels. 

- Commission and fee income grew 4,0% to R17 355m. RBB reported good transactional NIR growth of 6,0%,
  notwithstanding an increasing number of clients who are transacting within fixed-rate bundles and spending less.
  CIB experienced lower corporate activity off a high base the previous year. 

- Insurance income decreased 9,3% to R1 566m as a result of an abnormal number of significant weather-related
  claims, lower homeowner's cover and credit life volumes, and an increase in lapses.

- Trading income increased 3,7% to R3 900m, given muted activity levels among wholesale clients, particularly in the
  second half of the year, and avoidance of the potential negative impacts in markets around event risks such as
  political changes and credit rating downgrades. 

- Private-equity income, including positive realisations in the Commercial Property Finance portfolio, decreased
  23,7% to R708m, given the high base in the comparative period. 

Expenses

Expense growth of 5,1% to R29 812m was below inflation and in line with the guidance we provided for the full 2017 year
(being growth of mid-single digits), demonstrating disciplined and careful management of discretionary expenses in an
environment of slower revenue growth. The underlying movements included: 

- Staff-related costs increasing at a slower rate of 6,5%, following:

 - an average annual salary increase of 6,5% and a 859 reduction in staff numbers since December 2016; and

 - a 0,1% decrease in short-term incentives. 

- Computer-processing costs increasing 3,8% to R4 201m off a higher base the previous year.

- Fees and insurance costs being 7,8% higher at R3 277m, due mostly to additional regulatory-related costs.

The group's growth in expenses exceeded total revenue growth (including associate loss) of 2,1% (3,2% in managed
operations), resulting in a negative JAWS ratio of 3,0% and an efficiency ratio of 58,6%, compared with 56,9% in 2016.
Excluding associate income, our efficiency ratio was 57,8%. Expense growth, excluding RoA where we continued to invest
in distribution, technology and new-product rollouts, was 4,3%.

Earnings from associates

The loss of R838m in earnings from associates was attributed largely to ETI's loss of R1 203m in the fourth quarter of
2016 (announced on 18 April 2017), partly offset by the profit of R459m reported by ETI for the nine months to 30
September 2017, in line with our policy of accounting for ETI earnings a quarter in arrear. The total effect of ETI on
the group's headline earnings was a loss of R975m, including the R321m impact of funding costs. 

Accounting for this associate loss, together with Nedbank's share of ETI's other comprehensive income and movements in
Nedbank's foreign currency translation reserves, resulted in the carrying value of the group's strategic investment in
ETI declining from R4,0bn at 31 December 2016 to R3,3bn at 31 December 2017. Since the introduction of the new foreign
exchange regime by the Central Bank of Nigeria on 21 April 2017, confidence has improved and the Nigerian banking index
has increased by 73%. In line with this ETI's quoted share price – albeit illiquid – increased by 65% during 2017 which
resulted in the market value of the group's investment in ETI increasing during the year to R3,6bn at 31 December 2017
and R4,1bn at 28 February 2018. While risks remain, the actions taken to improve ETI's financial position and
governance, along with an improving macroeconomic environment, is expected to drive an improved financial performance
from ETI in 2018.

As required by IFRS, the R1bn impairment provision recognised at 31 December 2016 was reviewed at 31 December 2017 and
it was determined that currently no change to the provision was required.

A R96m associate loss was incurred due to operational losses in an associate, which is the cash-processing supplier to
the four large banks. 

Statement of financial position

Capital

The group continued to strengthen its capital position, with our CET1 ratio of 12,6% now above the top end of our
internal target range of 10,5–12,5%, following organic capital generation through earnings growth, lower asset growth
and some RWA optimisation.

In the current environment of slower advances growth, capital generation has been stronger following lower credit RWA
growth and continued refinement of Basel models. This was partially offset by the impact of the rand strengthening at
the back end of 2017, which adversely impacted foreign currency translation reserves and led to higher credit valuation
adjustment RWA. Higher levels of equity exposure resulted in increased equity RWA. As a result overall RWA increased
3,7% to R528,2bn.

The group's tier 1 ratio improved to 13,4% and includes the issuance of R600m of new-style additional tier 1 capital
instruments during the year, offsetting the progressive grandfathering of old-style perpetual preference shares as we
transition towards end-state Basel III requirements. The group's total capital ratio has improved to 15,5% and includes
the issuance of R2,5bn of new-style tier 2 capital instruments during the year, partially offsetting the redemption of
R3,0bn in old-style tier 2 capital instruments.

(1) The Basel III regulatory requirements are being phased in between 2013 and 2019, and exclude any idiosyncratic or 
    systemically important bank minimum requirements.

Funding and liquidity 

Optimising our funding profile and maintaining a strong liquidity position remain a priority for the group, especially
in the current environment. 

The group's three-month average long-term funding ratio was 27,0% for the fourth quarter of 2017, supported by growth in
Nedbank Retail Savings Bonds of R5,7bn to R24,9bn and the successful capital market issuances of R3,5bn senior unsecured
debt, R2,5bn new-style tier 2 debt and R1,0bn in securitisation notes. 

The group's quarterly average LCR of 116,2% exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 80% in 2017 and 90% effective
from 1 January 2018. The group maintains appropriate operational buffers designed to absorb seasonal and cyclical
volatility in the LCR.

Further details on the LCR are available in the table section of the Securities Exchange News Service (SENS)
announcement.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA increased by 0,6% to a quarterly average of R138,2bn. Notwithstanding the low
growth in HQLA, the LCR still increased yoy as a result of a decrease in LCR net cash outflows attributable to a
positive tilt in our deposit mix towards proportionally more Basel III-friendly deposits in the form of RBB and Wealth
deposits together with market share gains in commercial deposits. The HQLA portfolio, taken together with our portfolio
of other sources of quick-liquidity, resulted in total available sources of quick liquidity of R195,4bn, representing
19,9% of total assets.

Nedbank has maintained the NSFR at above 100% on a pro forma basis and is compliant with the minimum regulatory
requirements that are effective from 1 January 2018. 

Loans and advances

Loans and advances increased by 0,5% to R710,3bn, driven by solid growth in RBB offset by a decline in term and other
loans in CIB.

(4) Intercompany eliminations.

RBB loans and advances grew 5,3% to R305,2bn, with MFC (vehicle finance) increasing by 8,6% as new-business volumes
improved despite the contracting vehicle sales market. RBB's growth was achieved across all asset classes by increasing
the contribution from lower-risk clients in line with risk appetite and prudent origination strategies. We take comfort
in the quality and overall performance of the unsecured-lending portfolio based on the conservative rules we apply to
consolidation, restructuring and term strategies. Home loans grew at below-inflation levels, but market share was
maintained. 

CIB loans and advances decreased 3,8% to R356,0bn due to a combination of unexpected early repayments and managed
selldowns, which allowed for the diversification of risk. Demand for new loans was weak as a result of muted client
capital expenditure in a competitive market in the subdued economic climate. Commercial-mortgage loans and advances grew
by 6,5% to R161,6bn, maintaining our leading share of the SA market. The portfolio contains good-quality collateralised
assets with low LTVs, underpinned by a large secure asset pool and a strong client base, and is managed by a highly
experienced property finance team.

Deposits

Deposits grew 1,3% to R771,6bn, with total funding-related liabilities increasing 1,2% to R823,2bn, while the
loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 92,1%.

Through the active management of the RBB franchise, deposits grew 8,5% to R295,3bn, resulting in household deposits
market share gains increasing yoy to 18,9% from 18,7%, supported by Nedbank's strong market share in household current
account deposits of 19,1%. Through the growth in current accounts, savings and fixed deposits and other structured
deposits Nedbank has successfully reduced the proportion of funding from negotiable certificates of deposit as well as
more expensive foreign currency funding used in the general rand funding pool.

This positive tilt towards more Basel III-friendly deposits achieved across RBB, Nedbank Wealth and RoA and through
market share gains in commercial deposits has resulted in lower HQLA and long-term funding requirements as well as a
stronger LCR in terms of ensuring cost-effective regulatory compliance and a strong balance sheet position. 

Group strategic focus

During 2017 we continued to focus on delivering on our five strategic focus areas designed to make Nedbank a more agile,
competitive and digital bank, and underpin sustainable earnings growth and improving returns. 

     - Delivering innovative market-leading client experiences. We launched various market-leading innovations such as
       the new Nedbank Private Wealth mobile app. This was one of the first products delivered through our Digital Fast
       Lane capability. It ranked joint sixth in the global Mobile Apps for Wealth Management 2017 survey and was placed
       third among 600 apps in the Best Enterprise Solution category at the MTN Business App of the Year Awards. The new
       Nedbank Money app, which makes banking more convenient for our retail clients, was downloaded more than 300 000
       times since November 2017. We launched UNLOCKED.ME, an exclusive e-commerce marketplace for millennials. Karri,
       our mobile payment app that enables users to make cash-free payments for school activities quickly, securely and
       hassle-free, has been rolled out to more than 100 schools across the country. In Nedbank Wealth we piloted geyser
       telemetry, an innovative smart home solution that reduces electricity consumption. As far as our integrated
       channels are concerned, we have converted 55% of our outlets to new-image branches to date, and our investment in
       distribution channels over the next three years (until 2020) will result in 73% of our retail clients being
       exposed to the new-image branch format and self-service offerings. The introduction of chatbots and robo-advisors
       will continue to enhance client experiences through our contact centre and web-servicing capabilities. We launched
       NZone, our digital self-service branch at the Sandton Gautrain station, as well as Africa's first solar-powered
       branch to enable banking in deep-rural communities. The foundations put in place through Managed Evolution (our
       core systems and technology platform transformation), digital enhancements and New Ways of Work will lead to
       ongoing incremental digital benefits and enhanced client service. In 2018 Nedbank will bring further exciting
       digital innovations to market to enhance client experiences and drive efficiencies. Some of these include a
       refreshed internet banking experience in line with our mobile banking apps, the ability to sell an unsecured loan
       bundled with a transactional account, simplified client onboarding with convenient, FICA-compliant account opening
       from your couch, a new and exciting loyalty and rewards solution, and further rollout of chatbots, robo-advisors
       and software robots (robotic process automation). 

     - Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than the market. Nedbank's RBB franchise grew its total client
       base 1,6% to 7,5 million, with 6,0 million clients having a transactional account and 2,8 million main-banked
       clients supporting retail transactional NIR growth of 6,0%. Our main-banked client numbers remained flat as slower
       transactional activity caused some of our existing clients to fall outside our main-banked definition,
       particularly in the youth segment, while the middle-market, professional and small business client segments
       continued to increase. The newly launched Consulta survey estimates Nedbank's share of main-banked clients at
       12,7%, up from the 10,1% recorded through the 2015 AMPS survey (using a similar methodology) as we aim to reach a
       share of more than 15% by 2020. Our integrated model in CIB enabled deeper client penetration and increased
       cross-sell, resulting in 26 primary-bank client wins in 2017. 

     - Being operationally excellent in all we do. Cost discipline is an imperative in an environment of slower revenue
       growth. We have ongoing initiatives to ensure this, such as having reduced our core systems from 251 to 129 since
       inception of the Managed Evolution programme, with us being well on our way to reaching a target end state of less
       than 60 core systems by 2020; and the reduction of floor space in RBB by more than 30 000 m² by 2020; of which 24
       485 m² has been achieved to date. We worked with our sister companies in the Old Mutual Group to deliver synergies
       of just in excess of R1bn, R393m of which accrued to Nedbank. Good progress was also made with our target
       operating model (TOM) initiatives, which aim at generating R1,0bn pretax benefits for Nedbank by 2019 (and R1,2bn
       by 2020) and are linked to our long-term incentive scheme. Most cost initiatives have been identified in RBB and
       we delivered savings of R621m in 2017, which includes TOM savings. During the year we reduced headcount by 859
       (mostly through natural attrition), optimised our staffed points of presence by closing 32 inretailer and 53
       personal-loan outlets (while maintaining our coverage of the bankable population at 84%). We achieved efficiencies
       through the recycling of cash through our increased footprint of Intelligent Depositor devices. Four
       client-servicing functions, previously only accessible through branches, as well as the new Nedbank Money app were
       launched during the fourth quarter of 2017, while another 33 are planned for deployment across our digital
       channels by March 2018. We implemented 50 software robots (robotic process automation) to enhance efficiencies and
       reduce processing errors in administrative-intense processes, with more than 200 planned for rollout in 2018. 

     - Managing scarce resources to optimise economic outcomes. We maintained our focus on growing activities that
       generate higher levels of EP, such as growing transactional deposits and increasing transactional banking
       revenues, with commission and fees in RBB up 5,3%, and achieved earnings growth of 6,9% in RBB and 5,0% in CIB.
       Our selective origination of personal loans, home loans and commercial-property finance has proactively limited
       downside risk in this challenging operating climate, enabling a CLR of 0,49%, below the bottom end of our TTC
       target range. At the same time our balance sheet metrics remain strong and we continue to deliver dividend growth
       above the rate of HEPS growth.

     - Providing our clients with access to the best financial services network in Africa.

       - In Central and West Africa ETI remains an important strategic investment for Nedbank, providing our clients with
         access to a pan-African transactional banking network across 39 countries and Nedbank with access to dealflow in
         Central and West Africa. We have made good progress in working with ETI's board and other institutional
         shareholders to strengthen its board and management. We have increased our board representation and our
         involvement in the group as Brian Kennedy joined Mfundo Nkuhlu on ETI's board. Mfundo was appointed Chair of the
         ETI Risk Committee and Brian was appointed to the Remuneration and Audit Committees. Risk management practices are
         being enhanced and the audit of ETI's 2017 interim results provides comfort that the risk of another
         fourth-quarter loss as in 2015 and 2016 has decreased. We are pleased that ETI reported a profit for the nine
         months to 30 September 2017. We remain supportive of ETI's endeavours to deliver an ROE in excess of its COE over
         time. While risk remains, economic conditions in Nigeria and other economies in West Africa are improving and ETI
         should provide a strong underpin to Nedbank Group's earnings growth in 2018.

       - In SADC we continue to build scale and optimise costs. Our core banking system, Flexcube, which was successfully
         rolled out in Namibia in 2016, was also implemented in Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in 2017 and we plan to roll
         it out in Zimbabwe during 2018. We also launched a number of new digital products and we continue to grow our
         distribution footprint. As a result, clients increased 14% and online digital activations were up 22%. The
         acquisition of a majority stake in Banco Único in 2016 continued to deliver value and positioned Nedbank well to
         leverage off higher levels of economic growth in Mozambique. In 2018 we will rebrand MBCA in Zimbabwe to Nedbank
         while completing the last of our core banking system implementations in our subsidiaries. 

Old Mutual plc managed separation

On 1 November 2017 Old Mutual plc announced that the strategic minority shareholding to be retained in Nedbank Group by
Old Mutual Limited (OML) to underpin the ongoing commercial relationship between the companies has been agreed at 19,9%
of the total Nedbank Group ordinary shares in issue, as held by shareholder funds. This followed the 11 March 2016
announcement by Old Mutual plc about the Old Mutual managed separation, and the subsequent communication on 25 May 2017
in which Old Mutual plc stated that the new SA holding company, to be named OML, would retain a strategic minority
shareholding in Nedbank Group after the implementation of the managed separation. The 19,9% shareholding will be held by
OML, which will have a primary listing on JSE Limited and a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange. OML will be
listed at the earliest opportunity in 2018, following the publication of Old Mutual plc's 2017 full-year results.

The decrease in OML's shareholding in Nedbank Group will be achieved through the unbundling of Nedbank Group ordinary
shares to OML's shareholders. This will result in OML, immediately after the implementation of unbundling, holding a
19,9% strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank Group. The unbundling will occur at an appropriate time and in an
orderly manner, after the listing of OML and allowing suitable time for the transition of the OML shareholder register
to an investor base with an SA and emerging-market focus and mandate. After the unbundling, Nedbank Group is likely to
see an increase in the number of its shares held by emerging-market-mandated index funds, which will adjust according to
the improved free float (from about 45% before unbundling to about 80% after unbundling) and a normalisation of SA
institutional shareholding (some of which are currently underweight on a straight-market-capitalisation basis given some
Nedbank Group holding through the Old Mutual plc shareholding). As part of this process Nedbank Group will continue to
market itself as an attractive investment for local and international investors.

Nedbank Group will continue business as usual and the managed separation will have no impact on our strategy, our
day-to-day management or operations, our staff and our clients. Our engagements have been at arm's length and overseen
by independent board structures. Old Mutual operates predominantly in the investment, savings and insurance industry,
which has little overlap with banking, even though we compete in the areas of wealth and asset management and personal
loans. Our technology systems, brands and businesses have not been integrated.

As noted before, our collaboration with Old Mutual to unlock synergies by the end of 2017 was successful. Future
synergies will continue to be underpinned by OML's strategic shareholding in Nedbank Group. We are fully committed to
working with OML to deliver ongoing synergistic benefits at arm's length.

Economic and regulatory outlook

While structural challenges remain, 2018 has started with renewed optimism that these will be addressed and that
improving business and consumer confidence should lead to a cyclical upturn off a low base. The SA economy is forecast
to grow about 1,6% in 2018 as a resilient world economy and relatively firm international commodity prices are expected
to provide further support to domestic production and exports. Business and consumer confidence should also improve from
very weak levels in 2017, boosted by newly elected SA President Ramaphosa's promises to restore good governance, take
immediate action against corruption and state capture, and make changes to many cabinet portfolios. Moderate growth in
consumer spending and credit are forecast for 2018, while fixed investment, as well as government consumption and
capital expenditure, is forecast to remain subdued. 

The recovery in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to gather pace in 2018, underpinned by the ongoing global commodity price
upswing as well as improved government finances and structural reforms in some African countries. The International
Monetary Fund expects sub-Saharan Africa to grow faster at 3,4% this year. 

Domestic inflation is forecast to recede moderately in the early part of 2018, before edging higher towards the end of
the year, averaging about 5,1% over the year as a whole. Early in the year a stronger rand, coupled with easing food and
fuel prices, should help contain inflation off the higher base that prevailed at the start of 2017. The rand remains the
key risk to the inflation outlook. High expectations of political, policy and fiscal reforms have been built into the
rand's recent rally. If the new ANC leadership fails to deliver, especially on the fiscal concerns, SA still runs the
risk of being downgraded to universal subinvestment grade status, which could place the rand under pressure and alter
the inflation outlook for the year. Given these uncertainties, the anticipated rise in US interest rates, the gradual
tapering of quantitative easing programmes by other major central banks and the expected upturn in the domestic
inflation cycle towards year-end, the SARB's Monetary Policy Committee is forecast to keep interest rates unchanged at
current levels throughout 2018 and into 2019. 

Fitch indicated that a failure to implement credible fiscal consolidation and any further economic deterioration could
trigger another rating downgrade. S&P will act if both the economy and standards of public governance weaken further,
while Moody's will downgrade the country if the measures to address the fiscal funding gap lack credibility or the
chosen structural reforms fail to encourage investment and growth.

Overall economic conditions should improve off a low base and, despite the many challenges faced by the SA economy, the
SA banking system remains sound, liquid and well capitalised. 

Prospects

Our guidance on financial performance for the full year 2018 is currently as follows: 

- Average interest-earning banking assets to grow in line with nominal GDP.

- NIM to be slightly above the 2017 level of 3,62%. 

- CLR to increase into the bottom half of our target range of 60 to 100 bps (under IFRS 9).

- NIR to grow above mid-single digits.

- Associate income to be positive (ETI associate income reported quarterly in arrear).

- Expenses to increase by mid-single digits.

Given the loss in associate income from ETI in the 2017 base and continued delivery on the Nedbank strategy, our
financial guidance is for growth in DHEPS for the full 2018 year to be in line with our medium-to-long-term target of
greater than or equal to GDP + the consumer price index + 5%.

The outlook for our medium-to-long-term targets in 2018 is as follows, and we have now set ourselves specific 2020
targets of ROE (excluding goodwill) of greater than or equal to 18% and cost to income of lower than or equal to 53% as
a pathway to ongoing and sustainable improvements in the key metrics that support shareholder value creation.

Board and leadership changes during the period

Tom Boardman and David Adomakoh resigned from the board as independent non-executive directors with effect from the end
of Nedbank Group's Annual General Meeting on Thursday, 18 May 2017.

Neo Dongwana and Linda Manzini were appointed as independent non-executive directors of the group with effect from 1
June 2017 and Hubert Brody with effect from 1 July 2017.

Thulani Sibeko, Group Executive of Group Marketing, Communications and Corporate Affairs, resigned with effect from 27
June 2017. In October 2017 Abe Thebyane, Group Executive of Human Resources, announced his early retirement, to be
effective on the appointment of a suitable successor to ensure a seamless handover of responsibilities. These positions
are expected to be filled in the first half of 2018.

Basis of preparation*

Nedbank Group Limited is a company domiciled in SA. The summary consolidated financial statements of the group at and
for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (‘group') and the group's interests in
associates and joint arrangements.

The summary consolidated financial statements comprise the summary consolidated statement of financial position at 31
December 2017, summary consolidated statement of comprehensive income, summary consolidated statement of changes in
equity and summary consolidated statement of cashflows for the year ended 31 December 2017 and selected explanatory
notes, which are indicated by the symbol*. The summary consolidated financial statements and the full set of
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of Raisibe Morathi CA(SA), the Chief
Financial Officer.

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial
statements. In terms of the Listings Requirements preliminary reports have to be prepared in accordance with the
framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards
Council and also, as a minimum, to contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The
accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, from which the summary
consolidated financial statements were derived, are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with the accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements. 

IFRS 9 Financial instruments*

IFRS 9 is effective and will be implemented by the group from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and sets out the
updated requirements for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. These requirements specifically deal
with the classification and measurement of financial instruments, measurement of impairment losses based on an expected
credit loss model, and closer alignment between hedge accounting and risk management practices. 

As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the group has elected not to restate comparative figures. Any
adjustments to the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition will be
recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at 1 January 2018. The group has elected to continue to
apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9. 

The estimates below are based on accounting policies, assumptions, judgements and estimation techniques, which will be
regularly reviewed and assessed during the year in preparation for the financial statements for the year ending 31
December 2018.

Classification and measurement* 

The group has implemented the following on adoption of IFRS 9:

- Revocation of the fair value through profit or loss designation for certain loans and advances, amounts owed to
  depositors and long-term debt instruments to facilitate the implementation of macro fair-value hedge accounting of
  interest rate risk and hedge accounting of inflation risk. It is anticipated that the aforementioned changes will
  reduce accounting volatility experienced with respect to fair value through profit or loss accounting.

- Reclassification of certain loans from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income and fair
  value through profit or loss to align with the business-model-driven classifications of IFRS 9.

- Review of the effective interest rate calculation for certain loans based on the additional guidance provided in
  IFRS 9. 

The implementation of the above IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements decreased reserves at 1 January 2018
by approximately R200m. 

Impairment*

The IFRS 9 impairment implementation progressed during 2017. The following were the main areas of focus for 2017:

- Finalisation of the IFRS 9 impairment model methodology.

- Implementation of an IT framework facilitating efficient model execution and management.

- Development, build and testing of IFRS 9 impairment models with respect to a substantial portion of the group's
  portfolios, leveraging off the aforementioned IT framework.

- Documentation and implementation of the relevant control environment and related governance processes.

The following areas will continue to receive the required attention as the implementation of IFRS 9 progresses during
the 2018 financial reporting period:

- Further refinement of certain models.

- Finalisation of the interim and year-end reporting and disclosure frameworks.

- Observing local and international industry trends with respect to IFRS 9 adoption.

The implementation of the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model requires increases in balance sheet impairments at 1 January
2018 of approximately R3,2bn, with reserves decreasing by approximately R2,3bn on an after-tax basis.

IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers*

IFRS 15 replaces all existing revenue requirements in IFRS and applies to all revenue arising from contracts with
clients, unless the contracts are in the scope of the standards on leases, insurance contracts and financial
instruments. The standard is effective and will be implemented by the group from 1 January 2018.

The group has concluded that the loyalty points awarded to clients are accounted for as consideration payable to clients
in terms of new IFRS 15 guidance. The standard requires revenue to be decreased by the amount of consideration expected
to be paid to clients, with this amount recognised as a liability until payment is effected. The liability for the
amount expected to be paid to clients under the loyalty programme increased by approximately R300m on 1 January 2018 due
to the application of IFRS 15 requirements. Reserves at 1 January 2018 decreased by approximately R216m on an after-tax
basis.

Events after the reporting period*

There are no material events after the reporting period to report on.

Audited summary consolidated financial statements – independent auditors' opinion

The summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been audited by KPMG Inc and
Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditors also expressed an unmodified opinion on the
annual consolidated financial statements from which these summary consolidated financial statements were derived. 

The copies of the auditors' report on the summary consolidated financial statements and of the auditors' report on the
annual consolidated financial statements are available for inspection at the company's registered office, together with
the financial statements identified in the respective auditors' reports.

The auditors' report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this results announcement.
Shareholders are therefore advised that, to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditors' engagement, they
should obtain a copy of the auditors' report, together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements, from
Nedbank Group's registered office.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition and results of
operations of Nedbank Group and its group companies that, by their nature, involve risk and uncertainty because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include global, national and regional
political and economic conditions; levels of securities markets; interest rates; credit or other risks of lending and
investment activities; as well as competitive, regulatory and legal factors. By consequence, all forward-looking
statements have not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.

Final dividend declaration 

Notice is hereby given that a final dividend of 675 cents per ordinary share has been declared, payable to shareholders
for the six months ended 31 December 2017. The dividend has been declared out of income reserves.

share, resulting in a net dividend of 540 cents per ordinary share, unless the shareholder is exempt from paying
dividend tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.  

Nedbank Group's tax reference number is 9375/082/71/7 and the number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of

Due to the group's strategic investment in ETI being in an associate company that the group does not control, the
group's managed operations exclude ETI-related assets, funding, equity-accounted earnings and associated after-tax
funding costs. The chief operating decisionmaker therefore separately reviews the performance of the group's managed
operations and, on this basis, the total assets are R979 994m (2016: R962 044m), total liabilities are R892 919m (2016:
R884 199m), revenue is R52 008m (2016: R50 275m) and headline earnings is R12 762m (2016: R11 839m). ETI forms part of
the Rest of Africa segment, whose segmental information on a managed operations basis include total assets of R34 167m
(2016: R32 211m), total liabilities of R29 186m (2016: R28 135m), revenue of R2 792m (2016: R2 236m) and headline

Fair-value hierarchy

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the
transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the
definition of fair value is an assumption that an entity is a going concern without any intention or need to liquidate,
to curtail materially the scale of its operations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not,
therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed
sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where
they exist, they are used to measure the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if
transactions occur with sufficient volumes and frequencies to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. These
quoted prices would generally be classified as level 1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial
instrument is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques
include reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same in nature, reference to
the value of the assets of underlying business, earnings multiples, discounted-cashflow analysis and various option
pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms
of the fair-value hierarchy. The determination of whether an instrument is classified as level 2 or level 3 is dependent
on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs in relation to the fair value of the instrument.
Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility, servicing
costs, equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.

The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review
protocols for the independent review and validation of fair values separate from the business unit entering into the
transaction. The valuation methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to the fair-value measurement of the financial
instruments have been applied in a manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY

The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the IFRS
fair-value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the
measurement date.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based (directly or indirectly) on market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the
availability of observable inputs. These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include
the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in
the market, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is
based on inputs that are not market-observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on
the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of
the best information available and may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities, appropriate proxies
or other analytical techniques.

All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE ASSUMPTIONS TO REASONABLE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES

The fair-value measurement of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques
that include assumptions that are not market- observable. Where these scenarios apply, the group performs stress testing
on the fair value of the relevant instruments. In performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the
unobservable-input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with
the group's approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to illustrate the potential impact of
the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on
unobservable-input parameters and which are classified as level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. However, the disclosure
is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY (AUDITED)

In terms of the group's policy, transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair-value hierarchy are deemed
to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.  

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value for which fair value is disclosed

Certain financial instruments of the group are not carried at fair value, including those categorised as held to
maturity, loans and receivables and financial liabilities at amortised cost. The calculation of the fair value of these
financial instruments incorporates the group's best estimate of the value at which these financial assets could be
exchanged, or financial liabilities transferred, between market participants at the measurement date. The group's
estimate of what fair value is does not necessarily represent what it would be able to sell the asset for or transfer
the respective financial liability for in an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The fair values of these respective financial instruments at the reporting date detailed below are estimated only for
the purpose of IFRS disclosure, as follows:

(1) Loans and advances of R13 581m were included in the previous year as held-for-trading assets, whereas these instruments were classified and measured as financial
    assets at amortised cost. Loans and advances of R3 339m were included in the previous year as designated at fair value through profit or loss, whereas these
    instruments were classified and measured as financial assets at amortised cost. Accordingly, the held-for-trading, designated at fair value through profit or
    loss and financial assets at amortised cost categories have been restated to reflect the correct classification.

There have been no significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the fair value of the above instruments
during the year.

Loans and advances  

Loans and advances that are not recognised at fair value principally comprise variable-rate financial assets. The
interest rates on these variable-rate financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.

Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value
of these loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs. Due to the unique characteristics of the
loans and advances portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposal of such
loans and advances, there is no basis to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an
orderly transaction. The group is not currently in the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances
and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and advances on a forced-sale basis.

For specifically impaired loans and advances the carrying value, as determined after consideration of the group's IAS 39
credit impairments, is considered the best estimate of fair value.

The group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing
loans and advances measured at amortised cost. This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected
monthly cashflows per product type. Future cashflows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be
granted to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities. Methodologies and models are updated on a continuous
basis for changes in assumptions, forecasts and modelling techniques. Future forecasts of the group's probability of
default (PDs) and loss given defaults (LGDs) for periods 2018 to 2020 (2016: for periods 2017 to 2019) are based on the
latest available internal data and is applied to the first three years' projected cashflows. Thereafter, PDs and LGDs
are gradually reverted to their long-run averages and are applied to the remaining projected cashflows. Inputs into the
model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances. The determination of such inputs is
highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a significant change in the
determination of the fair value of loans and advances.

Government and other securities

The fair value of government and other securities is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted
cashflow analysis (level 2), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive. 

Other short-term securities

The fair value of other short-term securities is determined using a discounted-cashflow analysis (level 2). 

Long-term debt instruments

The fair value of long-term debt instruments is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or
discounted-cashflow analysis (level 2) where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

Amounts owed to depositors

The amounts owed to depositors principally comprise of variable-rate liabilities.  The carrying value of the amounts
owed to depositors approximates fair value because the instruments reprice to current market rates at frequent
intervals.  In addition, a significant portion of the balance is callable or is short term in nature.

Cash and cash equivalents, other assets, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and other liabilities

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and
other liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short
term in nature or are repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.

The figures above reflect a simple average of daily observations over the quarter ending December 2017 for Nedbank
Limited and the simple average of the month-end values at 31 October 2017, 30 November 2017 and 31 December 2017 for all
non-SA banking entities, based on regulatory submissions to SARB.  This section on the liquidity coverage ratio has not
been audited or reviewed by the group's auditors. 

Definitions

Assets under administration (AUA) (Rm) Market value of assets held in custody on behalf of clients.

Assets under management (AUM) (Rm) Market value of assets managed on behalf of clients.

Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital adequacy ratio (%) CET1 regulatory capital, including unappropriated profit, as a
percentage of total risk-weighted assets.

Credit loss ratio (CLR) - banking advances (%) Impairments charge on loans and advances in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income as a percentage of daily average gross loans and advances. 

Default Default occurs in respect of a particular client in the following instances:

     - When the bank considers that the client is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the bank in full without the
       bank having recourse to actions such as realising security (if held).

     - When the client is past due for more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the bank. Overdrafts will
       be considered as being past due if the client has breached an advised limit or has been advised of a limit smaller
       than the current outstanding amount.

     - In terms of Nedbank's Group Credit Policy, when the client is placed under business rescue in terms of the
       Companies Act, 71 of 2008, and when the client requests a restructure of his facilities as a result of financial
       distress.

Defaulted loans and advances (non-performing defaulted advances) Any advance or group of loans and advances that has
triggered the Basel III definition of default criteria and is in line with the revised SA banking regulations. For
retail portfolios this is product-centred and a default would therefore be specific to a client or borrower account (a
specific advance). For all other portfolios, except specialised lending, it is client- or borrower-centred, meaning that
should any transaction within a borrowing group default, all transactions within the borrowing group would be treated as
having defaulted. 

At a minimum a default is deemed to have occurred where a material obligation is past due for more than 90 days or a
client has exceeded an advised limit for more than 90 days. A specific impairment is raised against such a credit
exposure due to a significant perceived decline in the credit quality. 

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary
shares, adjusted for potential dilutive ordinary shares.

Dividend cover (times) Headline earnings per share divided by dividend per share.

Economic profit (EP) (Rm) Headline earnings less the cost of equity (total equity attributable to equity holders of the
parent, less goodwill, multiplied by the group's cost-of-equity percentage).

Effective taxation rate (%) Direct taxation as a percentage of profit before direct taxation, excluding non-trading and
capital items.

Efficiency ratio (%) Total operating expenses as a percentage of total income, being net interest income, non-interest
revenue and share of profits or losses from associates and joint arrangements.

Earnings per share (EPS) (cents) Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares in issue.

Gross operating income growth rate less expenses growth rate (JAWS ratio) (%) Measure of the extent to which the total
income growth rate exceeds the total operating expenses growth rate.

Headline earnings (Rm) The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, excluding specific separately
identifiable remeasurements, net of related tax and non-controlling interests.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) (cents) Headline earnings divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares
in issue.

Life insurance embedded value (Rm) The embedded value (EV) of the covered business is the discounted value of the
projected future after-tax shareholder earnings arising from covered business in force at the valuation date, plus the
adjusted net worth.

Life insurance value of new business (Rm) A measure of the value added to a company as a result of writing new business.
Value of new business (VNB) is calculated as the discounted value, at the valuation date, of projected after-tax
shareholder profit from covered new business that commenced during the reporting period, net of frictional costs and the
cost of non-hedgeable risk associated with writing new business, using economic assumptions at the start of the
reporting period.

Net asset value (NAV) (Rm) Total equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.

Net asset value (NAV) per share (cents)  NAV divided by the number of shares in issue, excluding shares held by group
entities at the end of the period.

Net interest income (NII) to average interest-earning banking assets (AIEBA) (%) NII as a percentage of daily average
total assets, excluding trading assets. Also called net interest margin (NIM).

Non-interest revenue (NIR) to total income (%) NIR as a percentage of operating income, excluding the impairments charge
on loans and advances.

Number of shares listed (number)  Number of ordinary shares in issue, as listed on the JSE.

Ordinary dividends declared per share (cents)  Total dividends to ordinary shareholders declared in respect of the
current period.

Performing defaulted loans and advances (Rm) Loans that would otherwise not be in default, but are classified as
defaulted due to regulatory requirements, ie directive 7 and the new curing definition.

Portfolio coverage (%) Portfolio impairments in the statement of financial position as a percentage of gross loans and
advances, excluding defaulted advances.

Portfolio impairments (Rm) Impairment for latent losses inherent in groups of loans and advances that have not yet been
specifically impaired.

The standard portfolio represents all the loans and advances that have not been impaired. These loans and advances have
not yet individually evidenced a loss event, but there are loans and advances in the standard portfolio that may have an
impairment without the bank being aware of it yet. 

A period of time will elapse between the occurrence of an impairment event and objective evidence of the impairment
becoming evident. This period is generally known as the emergence period. For each standard portfolio an emergence

Pillar 3 Basel III capital adequacy, leverage and liquidity ratios at 30 September 2017
This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure covers the operations of Nedbank Group Limited (group) as well as Nedbank Limited (bank) and complies with
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
Directive 11 of 2015.

Basel III capital adequacy
Both the group and bank remain well capitalised at levels significantly above the minimum regulatory requirements. The common-equity tier 1
ratios of 12,1% (2016: 11,5%) and 11,9% (2016: 10,9%), respectively, are reflective of organic capital generation after taking into account the
payment of dividends to shareholders and growth in risk weighted assets during the period. The group and bank’s total capital adequacy ratios
reduced as a result of the redemption of R2,0bn old-style tier 2 notes in July 2017.

The following table sets out the regulatory capital and capital ratios at 30 September 2017:
                                                                                            Nedbank Group                Nedbank Limited

Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
In accordance with the provisions of section 6(6) of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the relevant LCR
disclosure requirements, as set out in Directive 6 of 2014 and Directive 11 of 2014.

The LCR aims to ensure that a bank holds an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover total net cash outflows
over a 30-day period under a prescribed stress scenario. Based on the final revisions announced by the Basel Committee, the LCR is being
phased-in by an increase of 10% each year and will reach a minimum requirement of 100% by 1 January 2019.

The figures below reflect the simple average of daily observations over the quarter ending 30 September 2017 for Nedbank Limited and the
simple average of the month-end values at 31 July 2017, 31 August 2017 and 30 September 2017 for all non-SA banking entities. The figures are
based on the regulatory submissions to SARB.

UPDATE ON QUANTUM OF STRATEGIC MINORITY SHAREHOLDING IN NEDBANK GROUP TO BE
HELD BY OLD MUTUAL LIMITED

Old Mutual plc today announced that the strategic minority shareholding to
be retained in Nedbank Group to underpin the ongoing commercial
relationship between the companies has been agreed at 19,9%.

This follows the announcement by Old Mutual plc on the Old Mutual Managed
Separation (“Managed Separation”) on 11 March 2016, and the subsequent
communication on 25 May 2017, in which Old Mutual plc stated that the new
South African holding company, to be named Old Mutual Limited (“OML”),
would retain a strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank Group post the
implementation of the Managed Separation.

The 19,9% shareholding will be held by OML, which will have a primary
listing on the JSE and a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange.
OML will be listed on both exchanges at the earliest opportunity in 2018
following the publication of Old Mutual plc’s 2017 full-year results
announcement.

As previously announced, the decrease in OML’s shareholding in Nedbank
Group to 19,9% will be achieved through the distribution of the balance of
OML’s majority shareholding in Nedbank Group to its shareholders, at an
appropriate time and in an orderly manner, post the listing of OML. OML
does not intend to sell any part of its shareholding in Nedbank Group to a
new strategic investor.

Nedbank Group shareholders will be kept appropriately informed of further
developments regarding the Managed Separation.

    Eurobond offerings.

The key highlights of the cooperation are as follows:
-   Preferred partners in managing capital markets services in South Africa and select markets in sub-
    Saharan Africa;
-   Combines Nedbank CIB’s local primary markets expertise and strong client franchise in both the
    corporate and public sectors with Deutsche Bank’s South African equities and global capital markets
    distribution platform; and
-   Broadens client reach through local and international capital markets access, offering relevant,
    innovative solutions based on global best practice.

customised solutions”.

Alasdair Warren, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Corporate Finance EMEA and Co-Head of Corporate &
Investment Bank EMEA, said: “Deutsche Bank has a proud 25-year history in South Africa. Through
our cooperation with Nedbank, we aim to broaden our franchise, further underlining our commitment to
both the country and the region”.

Condensed consolidated interim financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 

Nedbank Group continues to create value for all our stakeholders in a challenging political and economic environment and
increased our interim dividend by 7,0% to 610 cents per share. Our headline earnings of R5,3bn, being 2,9% down on our
2016 first-half performance, is best understood through two lenses: 

- Our managed operations produced a solid result, with headline earnings growth of 6,7% and an improved ROE
  (excluding goodwill) of 18,9%, as slower revenue growth was offset by reduced impairments and good cost
  management. 
- The group's performance was negatively impacted by our share of the loss from our associate ETI (as announced on 18
  April 2017), which decreased the 6,7% growth in headline earnings in managed operations to an overall 2,9%
  reduction in headline earnings. While risks remain, the outlook for ETI is improving. 

The strategies implemented over the past few years in preparation for a tougher economic environment have positioned the
group well for the recessionary conditions and the sovereign-credit-ratings downgrade that followed President Zuma’s
cabinet reshuffle. Capital generation and liquidity levels are strong and we have a banking franchise underpinned by
7,9m clients, 2,7m of whom are main-banked clients. Our advances book is of a high quality and we have built excellent
collection capabilities. In addition, in an environment of slower revenue growth, and as we accelerate the delivery of
our digital products, we are intensifying our focus on cost-efficiencies to create investment capacity and to improve
efficiency ratios. We aim to create a more agile, competitive and digital Nedbank. 

In the context of a challenging political and economic environment, our guidance for growth in diluted headline earnings
per share for 2017 is for this measure to be positive, but less than or equal to growth in nominal GDP.

2017 interim results commentary

Banking and economic environment

Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic growth in developed markets improved, supported by accommodative
monetary policies as well as manufacturing and trade activity gaining momentum. Emerging and developing economies also
improved as a consequence of growth in China, a recovery in global commodity prices and increased capital inflows as
global investors search for higher yields.

Against previous expectations of an improved economic environment in 2017, SA entered a technical economic recession,
with GDP contracting by 0,3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 0,7% in the first quarter of 2017. The weakness in the
economy was widespread, with the manufacturing, utilities and domestic trade sectors all declining sharply. Consumers
were placed under increased financial pressure as unemployment rates rose to a historic high of 27,7%. This, combined
with the contraction in real disposable income and household consumption expenditure, led to a slowdown in household
credit demand as households reduced debt levels, reflected in the debt-to-disposable income shrinking to 73,2%. In
addition, credit demand was impacted as government fiscal policy focused on stabilising the budget deficit.

Confidence levels declined to new lows following President Zuma's cabinet reshuffle on 31 March 2017, which triggered a
sovereign-ratings downgrade by three international rating agencies. Standard & Poor's Global Ratings downgraded SA's
foreign currency debt to subinvestment grade, but retained the local currency rating at investment grade. Fitch
downgraded the country's foreign and local currency rating to subinvestment grade. Moody's also downgraded SA's
sovereign risk ratings to one notch above subinvestment grade. Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's placed the country on
a negative ratings outlook.  

While the current levels of political and economic uncertainty persist, there is heightened risk of further sovereign
downgrades of the local currency debt to below investment grade and the resultant exclusion from the Citibank World
Government Bond Index would have negative consequences for the SA economy. 

Review of results

Nedbank produced a resilient performance in a macro environment that has proved to be more challenging than expected.
Our managed operations produced headline earnings growth of 6,7% to R6 433m (June 2016: R6 030m), driven by slower
revenue growth, reduced impairments and good cost management. 

Headline earnings, including our share of the loss from ETI of R1 162m (June 2016: R603m loss), decreased by 2,9% to R5
271m (June 2016: R5 427m). 

This translated into a decrease in DHEPS of 3,7% to 1 078 cents (June 2016: 1 119 cents) and a decrease in HEPS of 3,3%
to 1 098 cents (June 2016: 1 135 cents). Excluding ETI, DHEPS increased by 5,9% to 1 316 cents (June 2016: 1 243 cents).

ROE (excluding goodwill) and ROE decreased to 15,1% (June 2016: 15,7%) and 14,0% (June 2016: 14,6%) respectively. ROE
(excluding goodwill and ETI) improved from 18,4% to 18,9%. The ROA decreased to 1,10% (June 2016: 1,19%). Excluding ETI,
ROA improved from 1,32% to 1,35%.

Our CET1 capital ratio of 12,3% (June 2016: 11,6%), average LCR for the second quarter of 104,6% (June 2016: 93,1%) and
an NSFR of above 100% on a pro forma basis, are all Basel III-compliant and are a reflection of a strong balance sheet. 

Delivering sustainably to all our stakeholders

Nedbank plays an important role in the economy and we remain committed to contributing to the societies in which we
operate by delivering value to our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and communities.

For staff 

We employ 32 349 staffmembers, invested R137m in training and paid salaries and benefits of R7,8bn. Successful
engagements were held as part of our People 2020 groupwide programme aimed at transforming and aligning our leadership
culture and talent to our strategic objectives. We refreshed our executive management programme to be more digitally
focused and brought together 500 of our leaders across the group at the Leadership Accelerator to ensure the adoption of
new insights that will drive accelerated levels of change. Transformation remains key to human capital development and
we continued to focus on this fundamental change across all levels at Nedbank, from our board of directors to all our
staffmembers. Currently, black representation at board level is 61,1%, at executive level 50,0% and our total staff at
77,1%. In addition, 62,4% of our total staff are female.  

For clients 

Our clients’ access to banking was improved through our network of 843 Intelligent Depositors and we increased the total
number of digitally focused new-image branches to 303. Digitally active and enabled clients grew strongly, increasing
the value of Nedbank App Suite™ transactions by 68,0% to R18,6bn. Nedbank Contact Centre client service will shortly be
enhanced by voice biometrics and multimedia functionality that have been successfully piloted. We increased our total
RBB client numbers to 7,5m with main-banked clients decreasing 0,3%, driven by the youth client segment that declined by
6,4% as slower transactional activity caused existing clients to fall out of our main-banked definition, while
middle-market main-banked clients increased slightly by 0,5% and Retail Relationship Banking clients increased by 5,1%.
We supported our clients by advancing R76,0bn (June 2016: R74,8bn) of new loans in the first six months of the year,
including R39,1bn to RBB clients and R12,4bn to small and medium enterprises and Business Banking clients, as well as
R719m of funding for affordable-housing projects to CIB clients. Nedgroup Investments has grown to be the fifth-largest
unit trust manager and fourth-largest offshore unit trust manager in SA, with overall assets under management growing by
15,2% to R295,3bn (June 2016: R256,3bn). It has maintained its top-three ranking among asset management companies over
the past nine years, together with first position in the offshore category for the second consecutive year in the recent
quarterly PlexCrown Unit Trust survey, as well as winning in the Offshore Management Company of the Year category for
the third consecutive year, while Nedbank Private Wealth was ranked third overall in the Intellidex Top Private Banks
and Wealth Managers survey. 

For shareholders

Nedbank's net asset value per share increased to 16 200 cents (June 2016: 15 826 cents), with our share price up by
12,0% since June 2016. Our interim dividend is largely based on the performance of our managed operations and increased
by 7,0%, ahead of growth in HEPS. We engaged constructively with shareholders in over 388 meetings in the past 12
months, and at our 50th annual general meeting all resolutions were passed, with more than 90% of votes in favour. We
ensure transparent, relevant and timeous reporting and disclosure to shareholders, as acknowledged by Nedbank's
Integrated Report having been ranked in the top tier of JSE-listed companies. 

For regulators

We maintained Basel III requirements ahead of full compliance timelines, achieving a CET1 ratio of 12,3%, an average
long-term funding ratio of 33,1% and an average LCR ratio of 104,6% in the second quarter of 2017. We have invested over
R100bn in government and public sector bonds as part of our HQLA requirements and, in doing so, remain committed to
making a meaningful contribution to the countries in which we operate, thereby supporting the funding needs of
government. Cash taxation contributions of R5,5bn were made relating to direct, indirect, pay-as-you-earn and other
taxation. We continued to work closely with all regulators to ensure efficient delivery of the various regulatory
programmes, including our IFRS 9 parallel run, which is progressing well. 

For communities

Nedbank contributes to society in multiple ways. We continued to participate in the CEO Initiative, working with
government, business and labour towards a more inclusive SA society. At the parliamentary presentation on transformation
in March 2017 Nedbank was recognised as a leader in transformation within the financial services industry. This was
affirmed by the group maintaining our level 2 BBBEE contributor status for the eighth consecutive year. Since 2012 we
have contributed over R700m to socioeconomic development, with more than 50% allocated to education. We supported local
businesses and the SA economy by sourcing 75% of our procurement locally. Our Fair Share 2030 strategy has enabled more
than R745m of new lending to support student accommodation and we have disbursed R14,9bn for renewable-energy deals to
date. In line with our new brand payoff line 'see money differently' and our purpose to use our financial expertise to
do good for individuals, families, businesses and society, we have supported consumer financial education for 135 815
individuals. This year we also proudly celebrated the 10th year as title sponsor of the Nedbank Cup, which is the only
cup competition in SA that addresses football development through the inclusion of professional and amateur teams. 

Cluster financial performance 

Nedbank's managed operations generated headline earnings growth of 6,7% to R6 433m (June 2016: R6 030m) and delivered an
ROE of 17,6% with good earnings contributions from CIB and RBB.

(1)   ROE (including goodwill) 14,0% (June 2016: 14,6%).

CIB maintained an attractive ROE of above 20% and produced solid results, underpinned by improved credit losses.
Although both revenue lines were affected by slowing economic activity, NIR growth was also impacted by a high base.
Early repayments, coupled with slower drawdowns, resulted in weaker advances growth although the pipeline remained
stable.  

RBB delivered an improved ROE and good headline earnings growth, underpinned by solid NIR growth and lower impairments
and expense growth. As a result PPOP was up 3,1%, which is indicative of a growing franchise. NII benefited from
improved volumes and mix changes in both advances and deposits, offset by margin compression largely due to the impact
of the prime - JIBAR squeeze. NIR growth was supported by quality transactional income and card revenue. 

Nedbank Wealth’s decrease in headline earnings reflects a difficult first half, with good performances in Wealth
Management and Asset Management, which were offset by a weaker performance in Insurance due to the impact of higher
weather-related claims, an increase in lapses, as well as lower volumes. Nedbank Wealth’s offshore businesses were also
impacted by the strengthening of the rand.

RoA's earnings were negatively impacted by the loss from our associate ETI as a result of its fourth-quarter 2016 loss
(previously announced on 18 April 2017) and its first-quarter 2017 profit (previously announced on 27 April 2017), in
line with our policy of accounting for ETI earnings a quarter in arrear. The RoA subsidiaries grew headline earnings off
a low base, benefiting from the first-time consolidation of Banco Único, while continued investment in the franchise and
technology systems has led to strong client gains.

The increase in the Centre was largely due to fair-value gains on the underlying hedging portfolios.

Financial performance 

Net interest income

NII increased by 4,0% to R13 548m (June 2016: R13 028m), ahead of average interest-earning banking asset growth of 2,4%.

NIM expansion of 6 bps to 3,58% (June 2016: 3,52% rebased) was largely driven by an endowment benefit of 9 bps and
improved asset mix change of 6 bps, offset by asset pricing pressure of 5 bps and the narrowing of the prime-JIBAR
spread costing 4 bps. 

Impairments charge on loans and advances

Impairments decreased by 27,9% to R1 594m (June 2016: R2 211m), underpinned by a quality portfolio across all clusters.
The lower CLR of 0,47% (June 2016: 0,67%) largely relates to the improvement in CIB's CLR.  

In CIB impairments are individually determined and 86% of impairments are concentrated in approximately 10 counters.
During the period the positive resolution and rerating of some counters led to the release of specific and portfolio
impairments. Overall the improvement in CIB's CLR was driven by recoveries from Commercial Property Finance and improved
commodity prices. RBB's lower CLR represents the underlying mix effect of personal loans and home loans continuing to
improve, and MFC and Card increasing in line with expectations. Furthermore, in RBB some of the additional overlays that
were previously raised for event risks, such as drought in certain geographies and a possible deterioration in secured
lending to higher-risk clients who also have a personal loan, were released as these risks have not materialised and the
related portfolio provisions can no longer be justified. Continued prudence in provisioning and a proactive collections
strategy contributed to higher levels of postwriteoff recoveries at R578m (June 2016: R564m).

Total defaulted advances increased by 9,5% to R20 190m (June 2015: R18 437m), mostly driven by MFC and Card in RBB,
partly offset by the improvement in CIB as well as the effect of SARB directive 7 and new curing definition, reported at
31 December 2016, resulting in loans previously shown as performing being reclassified as defaulted. Defaulted advances,
excluding these 'performing defaulted advances' increased by 0,3% to R16 608m (June 2016: R16 556m).

The specific coverage ratio of 37,2% (June 2016: 36,2%) reflects the changing mix across all our portfolios and includes
the increase in CIB’s specific coverage to 24,6% (June 2016: 14,8%) along with RBB's lower specific coverage of 41,1%
(June 2016: 44,6%). RBB's coverage ratio is in line with the 41,1% level reported at December 2016 and, excluding
performing defaulted advances, RBB's specific coverage was maintained at 49,6% (June 2016: 49,7%).

The reduction in the portfolio coverage ratio to 0,65% (June 2016: 0,71%) mostly relates to RBB’s additional overlays
decreasing to R409m (June 2016: R701m). The central portfolio provision decreased from R500m at 31 December 2016 to
R350m (June 2016: R350m). This provision is being maintained for, inter alia, the effect of the potential ratings
downgrade of the local currency and stressed sectors such as resources, cement, construction and retailers remaining
under pressure. We continue to monitor asset quality closely for any material evidence of the effect of the sovereign
downgrades and the recession.  

Non-interest revenue

NIR growth of 3,3% to R11 730m (June 2016: R11 357m) reflects a resilient performance. The underlying movements relate
to:

- Commission and fee income growth of 3,1% to R8 436m (June 2016: R8 185m), as weak business and consumer confidence
  levels negatively affected transactional activity in CIB and led to lower volumes in RBB where an increasing
  number of clients also transacted within fixed-rate bundles. 
- Insurance income decreasing 15,7% to R776m (June 2016: R921m) as a result of significant weather-related claims,
  lower homeowner's cover and credit life volumes, and an increase in lapses.
- Trading income increasing 13,3% to R2 006m (June 2016: R1 771m) from good performance in the markets business as
  volatility levels remain elevated. 
- Private-equity income reducing to R203m (June 2016: R432m) relative to the high base in the comparative period,
  which included positive realisations in the Commercial Property Finance portfolio. 

Expenses

Expense growth of 5,0% to R14 369m (June 2016: R13 686m) was below inflation and below the guidance we provided for the
full 2017 year (being growth of mid-to-upper single digits), demonstrating disciplined and careful management of
discretionary expenses in an environment of slowing revenue growth. Overall, growth was largely driven by our
investments for transactional banking strategies of R265m and the consolidation of Banco Único of R147m, partly offset
by efficiencies of R342m. The underlying movements included: 

- Staff-related costs increasing at a slower rate of 3,6%, following-
- 8,4% growth in remuneration and other staff costs, including an average annual salary increase of 6,5% and a
  reduction in staff numbers since December 2016; and
- a 7,6% decrease in short- and long-term incentives. 
- Computer-processing costs increasing 6,9% to R2 121m off a higher base in the prior year. 
- Fees and insurance costs being 12,7% higher at R1 557m, due mostly to additional regulatory-related costs.

The group's growth in expenses exceeded total revenue growth of 3,7%, resulting in a negative jaws ratio of 1,7% (June
2016: 1,7% positive) and an efficiency ratio of 56,5% (June 2016: 55,6%) for managed operations. Expense growth,
excluding the RoA, was 3,4%.

Earnings from associates

The loss of R1 053m (June 2016: R431m loss) in earnings from associates was attributed largely to ETI's loss of R1 203m
in the fourth quarter of 2016 (announced on 18 April 2017), partly offset by the profit of R142m reported by ETI for the
first quarter of 2017 (announced on 27 April 2017), in line with our policy of accounting for ETI earnings a quarter in
arrear. The effect of ETI's loss on the group's headline earnings was R1 162m, including the R101m impact of funding
costs. 

Accounting for this associate loss, together with Nedbank’s share of ETI's other comprehensive income and Nedbank’s
foreign currency translation reserve, reduced the carrying value of the group's strategic investment in ETI from R4,0bn
on 31 December 2016 to R3,1bn at 30 June 2017. Since the introduction of the new foreign exchange regime by the Central
Bank of Nigeria on 21 April 2017, confidence has improved and the Nigerian equity market has increased by 31%. In line
with this the market value of the group's investment in ETI, based on its quoted share price - albeit in illiquid
markets, increased to R3,0bn on 30 June 2017 and R3,7bn on 28 July 2017. While risks remain, we believe the outlook for
ETI is improving.

As required by IFRS, the R1bn impairment provision recognised at 31 December 2016 was reviewed at 30 June 2017 and it
was determined that no change to the provision is required. A similar review will be performed at our 2017 financial
year-end.

ETI remains a strategic investment for Nedbank, providing our clients with a pan-African transactional banking network
across 39 countries and access to dealflow in Central and West Africa. We have made good progress in working with ETI's
board and other institutional shareholders to strengthen their board and management. Institutional shareholder
representation on ETI's board has increased and Nedbank has two appointees. Subject to regulatory approval, Brian
Kennedy will join Mfundo Nkuhlu on ETI's board. Mfundo has recently been nominated to become Chair of the ETI Risk
Committee. We remain supportive of ETI's endeavours of delivering an ROE in excess of its COE in due course.

Statement of financial position 

Capital 

The group continued to strengthen its capital position, with our CET1 ratio at 12,3% (June 2016: 11,6%) now close to the
top end of our internal target range, following organic capital generation through earnings.

In the current environment of slower advances growth, capital generation has been stronger following low credit RWA
growth, a decrease in trading market RWA due to foreign exchange movements and the decline in the threshold deduction
given the decrease in the carrying value of ETI. 

In addition to lower RWA growth, we continue to identify RWA optimisation initiatives that will support the industry
implementation of the new Standardised Approach for counterparty credit risk that becomes effective later this year. 

The group's tier 1 ratio improved to 13,2% (June 2016: 12,5%) and includes the issuance of R1,1bn of new-style
additional tier 1 capital instruments during the last 12 months, offsetting the progressive grandfathering of perpetual
preference shares as we transition towards end-state Basel III requirements. The group's total capital ratio improved to
15,7% (June 2016: 14,5%) and includes the issuance of R4,5bn of new-style tier 2 capital instruments that more than
offsets the redemption of US$100m in old-style tier 2 capital instruments during the last 12 months.

Funding and liquidity 

Optimising our funding profile and maintaining a strong liquidity position remain priorities for the group in the
current environment.  

The group's three-month average long-term funding ratio improved to 33,1% for the second quarter of 2017 (June 2016:
30,9%), supported by growth in Nedbank Retail Savings Bonds of R3,1bn to R22,3bn and the successful capital markets
issuance of R3,5bn of senior unsecured debt, R2,5bn of tier 2 debt and R1,0bn of securitisation. Our funding profile
benefited from our above-average market share in the medium-to-longer-term wholesale funding buckets, which reduced our
LCR HQLA requirements, positively impacting the all-in cost of wholesale funding. 

The group's quarterly average LCR of 104,6% (June 2016: 93,1%) exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 80% in
2017 and 90% from 1 January 2018. To absorb the seasonal and cyclical volatility in the LCR the group maintains
appropriate operational buffers.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA increased to a quarterly average of R144,6bn (June 2016: R127,1bn). Together
with our portfolio of other quick-liquidity sources, the total available sources of quick liquidity amounted to R190,0bn
(June 2016: R167,7bn), representing 19,7% of total assets.

Nedbank has maintained the NSFR at above 100% on a pro forma basis and is already compliant with the minimum regulatory
requirements that will be effective on 1 January 2018. The remaining key focus areas relating to the NSFR are finalising
a number of minor interpretational matters and ensuring that compliance is achieved in the context of balance sheet
optimisation. 

Loans and advances

Loans and advances increased 2,4% to R709,9bn (June 2016: R693,3bn), driven by improved growth across the retail banking
portfolios.

(4) Intercompany eliminations

Advances growth in CIB was flat, with commercial-mortgage advances increasing 8,3%. Our leading market share in
commercial mortgages continued to be underpinned by a strong client base and a large, secure asset pool. In contrast,
term loans decreased 5,8% due to weak business confidence levels resulting in drawdowns being delayed, as well as early
repayments of loans. Excluding the impact of the stronger USD/ZAR exchange rate on the foreign lending book, total CIB
advances growth was 2,6%. 

RBB grew advances across all key categories with MFC and Card increasing 6,6% and 6,7%, respectively, while Home Loans
and Personal Loans grew at below-inflation levels. Business Banking advances growth remained flat, owing to slower
drawdowns as many clients continue to manage their cashflows more carefully and delay investment decisions. 

Growth in advances in the RoA Cluster was largely due to the inclusion of Banco Único, which contributed R2,5bn to the
advances portfolio. On a like-for-like basis advances growth was flat due to muted economic growth in the rest of the
SADC countries.

Deposits

Deposits grew 2,8% to R762,7bn (June 2016: R741,7bn), with total liabilities increasing 2,1% to R881,2bn (June 2016:
R863,3bn). The loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 93,1% (June 2016: 93,5%).

Active management of our deposit and transactional banking franchise resulted in RBB deposits growing strongly by 8,8%
to R279,3bn (June 2016: R256,7bn), contributing to market share gains in household deposits to 19,1% (June 2016: 18,6%)
and current accounts to 19,4% (June 2016: 19,1%). Growth in current accounts of 8,3% and fixed deposits of 9,2% was
driven by the success of investment products such as our Tax-free Savings Account, Green Savings Bond and 12-month
Fixed Deposits, as part of our strategy to grow Basel III-friendly deposits.

Good growth was recorded in other key deposit categories, including call accounts and term deposits of 6,3% and cash
management of 5,4%, while foreign currency liabilities decreased by 17,9%. This was predominantly driven by a reduction
in expensive foreign currency funding used in the general rand funding pool. The balance of foreign funding is closely
matched to foreign currency assets and the mismatch is negligible. 

Group strategic focus

The group continued to focus on delivering on our five strategic focus areas designed to make Nedbank a more agile,
competitive and digital bank. 

- Delivering innovative market-leading client experiences. Our personal loans digital sales application was rolled
  out during the period and we plan to launch our refreshed retail and wealth banking apps, and new Travel Card and
  Investments Online products, among others, in the second half of 2017. Digitally enabled and active retail clients
  grew strongly, driving up the value of Nedbank App Suite™ transactions 68% to R18,6bn. To date 48% of our outlets
  have been converted to new-image branches and our investment in distribution channels over the next four years
  (2017 to 2020) will result in 82% of our retail clients being exposed to the new-image branch format and
  self-service offerings. Nedbank’s retail integrated channels won the Best Smart Branch Project in Africa award at
  The Asian Banker Technology Innovation Awards ceremony. Nedbank Private Wealth's mobile app has been rated Gold
  Standard in a McKinsey review that compared the client experience of SA bank’s mobile applications for both visual
  presentation and functionality.
- Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than the market. Nedbank's RBB franchise maintained a total
  client base of 7,5m, with 2,7m main-banked clients translating into retail transactional NIR growth of 5,2%. Our
  main-banked clients decreased by 0,3%, with the youth client segment declining by 6,4% as slower transactional
  activity caused existing clients to fall out of our main-banked definition, while the middle-market and Retail
  Relationship Banking client segments increased by 0,5% and 5,1%, respectively. Transactional banking progress was
  also reflected in market share gains in household and current-account deposit market share gains to 19,1% and
  19,4% respectively. The CIB integrated model enabled deeper client penetration and increased cross-sell,
  generating 12 primary-bank client wins year to date and increased dealflow into the markets business, supporting
  13,3% growth in trading income. 
- Being operationally excellent in all we do. Cost discipline in an environment of slower revenue growth remains an
  imperative, with ongoing initiatives such as reducing our core systems by 113 to 138 from 251 since inception and
  we are well on our way to reaching 60; and the reduction of floor space in RBB by 30 000 m² by 2020, of which 24
  819 m² has been achieved since 2014. We continued to remain on track for the delivery of Old Mutual Group's target
  of R1,0bn pretax run rate synergies, of which approximately 30% should accrue to Nedbank by the end of 2017. Good
  progress was also made with our target operating model initiatives, which aims to generate R1,0bn pretax benefits
  for Nedbank by 2019. The majority of the cost initiatives have been identified in RBB, which will contribute
  approximately 40% of the benefits. RBB has established a transformation office to track and monitor the delivery
  of 221 initiatives across the five broad areas of credit, distribution, operational excellence, simplification and
  procurement. Approximately 30% of the synergies will be from cost optimisation in Shared Services through the
  removal of duplicative service functions, cost-efficiencies from marketing and improving the RoA operating model.
  The remaining 30% will be achieved through revenue opportunities from data-driven intelligence, new digital
  technologies and innovation integration that is being accelerated through our Digital Fast Lane initiative. 
- Managing scarce resources to optimise economic outcomes. We maintained our focus on growing activities that
  generate higher levels of EP, such as growing transactional deposits, with current accounts up 8,3%; increasing
  transactional banking activity, with commission and fees in RBB up 5,2%; and achieving earnings growth of 7,3% in
  RBB and 6,9% in CIB. Our selective origination of personal loans, home loans and commercial-property finance has
  proactively limited downside risk in this challenging operating climate, enabling a CLR of 47 bps, below the
  bottom end of our TTC target range. At the same time our balance sheet metrics remain strong and we continue to
  deliver dividend growth above the rate of HEPS growth. 
- Providing our clients with access to the best financial services network in Africa.
- In Central and West Africa, ETI remains a strategic investment. Working together, Nedbank and ETI assisted a
  number of SA-based corporates with currency solutions in a challenging Nigerian market. We have strengthened our
  board representation and have increased our involvement in the group. In April 2017 ETI proposed a
  convertible-bond issue of up to US$400m at a conversion price of US$0,06, with an interest rate of 6,46% above
  LIBOR. US$200m of this issue was used to establish a resolution vehicle for the more effective management of
  capital and ringfencing of its legacy loans in Nigeria to improve transparency of the NPLs and turnaround the
  Nigerian business. The remaining US$200m was for the debt restructure of the maturity profile of the ETI holding
  company balance sheet. Nedbank did not participate in the issue as it did not meet our internal hurdle rates.
  However, the convertible bond is anticipated to be fully subscribed and underwritten. We are pleased that ETI
  reported a profit for the first quarter of 2017 and that the market value of Nedbank's investment in ETI at 30
  June 2017, based on its quoted share price - albeit in illiquid markets, had increased by 24,9% since 31 December
  2016 to R3,0bn, in line with our carrying value of R3,1bn. While risk remains, economic conditions in Nigeria and
  the outlook for ETI are improving.
- In SADC and East Africa we are building scale and optimising costs. Our core banking system, Flexcube, has now
  been successfully rolled out in four countries, we launched a number of new digital products and we continue to
  grow our distribution footprint. 

Old Mutual plc managed separation

OM plc announced on 25 May 2017 that it intends to list a new SA holding company on the JSE with a secondary listing on
the LSE, which will be named Old Mutual Limited and will initially comprise Old Mutual Emerging Markets, the group's
Nedbank shareholding, as well as OM plc, which will become a subsidiary of Old Mutual Limited. The managed separation is
expected to be materially complete by the end of 2018 and the listing of Old Mutual Limited is anticipated to take place
at the earliest opportunity in 2018, following OM plc’s 2017 full-year results announcement.

The subsequent distribution of a significant proportion of the shareholding in Nedbank from Old Mutual Limited will
follow in due course at an appropriate time, and in an orderly manner, as previously announced. Old Mutual Limited will
retain an appropriate strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank to underpin the ongoing commercial relationship.

For Nedbank it is business as usual and OM plc's decision will have no impact on the strategy, the day-to-day management
or operations, nor our staff and clients. Our engagements have been at arm’s length, overseen by independent board
structures. OM plc operates predominantly in the investment, savings and insurance industry, which has little overlap
with banking, however we compete in the areas of wealth and asset management and personal loans. Our technology systems,
brands and businesses have not been integrated.

Our collaboration with OM plc to unlock R1,0bn of synergies by the end of 2017 from the OM plc businesses in SA, remains
on track and will continue to be underpinned by Old Mutual Limited's strategic shareholding of Nedbank Group. We are
fully committed to working with Old Mutual Limited to deliver ongoing synergistic benefits on an arm’s length basis.

Economic outlook

The International Monetary Fund currently expects global economic growth to improve to 3,5% in 2017, with advanced
countries growing at 2,0% and emerging and developing economies by 4,5%. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to
accelerate to 2,1% in 2017 from 1,4% in 2016. 

Given SA's weaker-than-expected growth in the first half, Nedbank Group's current forecast for growth in 2017 is 0,6%,
with risk to growth on the downside. Inflation is expected to be contained within SARB’s inflation target range and, as
a result, interest rates could decline by a further 25 bps in September, following the 25 bps rate cut in July 2017.

Much depends on how the political and policy landscapes unfold in the period to December 2017, and the implications
thereof for the country's sovereign risk ratings. With sovereign risk ratings remaining unchanged, the end of the
drought, a stronger world economy and marginally firmer commodity prices should support cyclical recoveries in
export-orientated industries, particularly agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Corporate credit demand should benefit
from recoveries in these sectors, but the risk remains that long-term investments could be delayed by continued
political and policy uncertainty, low confidence and challenging operating conditions.

Households will remain vulnerable, with job losses more prevalent and lower prospects of wage growth. Household credit
demand is anticipated to remain subdued as consumers postpone buying new homes and vehicles, and instead save and/or
reduce debt levels. 

Government spending should be kept in check by the need to reduce the budget deficit and contain the rise in government
debt to avoid a further sovereign-ratings downgrade. In this regard improved management of state-owned enterprises is
necessary.

Despite the many challenges faced by the SA economy, the SA banking system remains sound, liquid and well capitalised.
This strength was once again acknowledged by the World Economic Forum, which ranked SA banks at second highest for
soundness of banks, and by Standard & Poor’s, which stated in its report published on 19 July 2017 that there are good
governance and transparency across the SA financial system, that regulation is in line with international best
practices, and that SA banks have top-tier banking stability and risk management. This creates low credit losses and
strong profitability with low levels of external banking sector debt. The risk of short-term concentrated funding is
mitigated by the closed SA rand system.

Prospects

In light of the weak economic outlook in SA we have revised our guidance on financial performance for the full year 2017
as follows: 

- Average interest-earning banking assets to grow below nominal GDP growth.
- NIM to be slightly above the 2016 rebased level of 3,54%. 
- CLR to increase from the level of 47 bps in the first half of 2017 towards the bottom end of our target range of
  60 to 100 bps.
- NIR, excluding fair-value adjustments, to grow at mid-single digits.
- Associate loss to be lower than the loss reported in the first half of 2017 (ETI associate income reported
  quarterly in arrear).
- Expenses to increase by mid-single digit levels.

Our financial guidance is for growth in DHEPS for the full 2017 year to be positive, but less than or equal to growth in
nominal GDP (consumer price index plus GDP growth). This has been revised from the guidance we provided at 28 February
2017 of growth in DHEPS for the full 2017 year to be greater than growth in nominal GDP.

The outlook for our medium-to-long-term targets in 2017 is as follows:

Board and leadership changes during the period

Tom Boardman and David Adomakoh resigned from the board as independent non-executive directors with effect from the end
of Nedbank Group's annual general meeting on Thursday, 18 May 2017.

Neo Dongwana and Linda Manzini were appointed as independent non-executive directors of the group with effect from 1
June 2017 and Hubert Brody with effect from 1 July 2017. 

Thulani Sibeko, Group Executive of Group Marketing, Communications and Corporate Affairs, resigned with effect from 27
June 2017. We have a deep pool of talent in Nedbank and the process to identify Thulani's replacement is well underway. 

Basis of preparation*

Nedbank Group Limited is a company domiciled in SA. The reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial results of the
group at and for the period ended 30 June 2017 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (the 'group') and the group's
interests in associates and joint arrangements.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial
position at 30 June 2017, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated statement of
changes in equity and condensed consolidated statement of cashflows for the six months ended 30 June 2017 and selected
explanatory notes, which are indicated by the symbol*.  The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have
been prepared under the supervision of Raisibe Morathi CA (SA), the Chief Financial Officer.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the
requirements of the Companies Act (Act No 71 of 2008) of South Africa. The accounting policies applied in the
preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those of the previous annual financial statements. 

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The group is required to adopt IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39, addressing the classification and
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, the measurement of impairment provisions for amortised cost
and fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets and introduces more of a risk-management focus to the
hedge-accounting model.  

IFRS 9 is expected to impact the group’s balance sheet provisions and classification of certain of the group's financial
assets. The group does not expect the classification and measurement requirements to have a significant impact on the
group's financial position; however, this is subject to the business models in existence at 1 January 2018. From 1
January 2018 the group will recognise fair-value gains or losses due to changes in the group's own credit risk for
financial liabilities it designates as at fair value through profit or loss to be presented in other comprehensive
income. However, the group does not expect to change the manner in which it calculates these fair-value gains or losses
due to changes in the group's own credit risk, which it has previously disclosed in its financial statements.

The group's IFRS 9 parallel run is progressing well and we continue to expect that the transitional increase in balance
sheet provisions on 1 January 2018 will not have a significant impact on our capital adequacy levels, because the
increase in balance sheet provisions will be partially offset by a decrease in the excess of downturn expected loss over
IAS 39 provisions regulatory deduction from CET1 capital. The group's excess of downturn expected loss over IAS 39
provisions regulatory deduction at 30 June 2017 was R1,9bn (December 2016: R1,5bn).

The group is considering its accounting policy choice as to whether to continue IAS 39 hedge accounting or to move to
the new IFRS 9 hedge-accounting model. This accounting policy choice is not expected to have a significant impact on the
group's existing fair-value hedges; however, the group may replace its current accounting practice to designate
financial assets and financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss because of the accounting mismatch
that arises from its economic hedging activities with IAS 39 or IFRS 9 hedge accounting.

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, the group plans not to restate its comparative financial statements.
Accordingly, the transitional increase in balance sheet provisions and classification and measurement changes will be
recognised, net of related taxation, in equity at 1 January 2018.  

Events after the reporting period*

There are no material events after the reporting period to report on.

Reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial statements  - independent auditors' conclusion

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017 have been reviewed by KPMG Inc
and Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified review conclusion thereon.

The auditors' review report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this interim results
announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the
auditors' engagement, they should obtain a copy of the auditors' report, together with the accompanying financial
information, from Nedbank Group's registered office.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition and results of
operations of Nedbank Group and its group companies that, by their nature, involve risk and uncertainty because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include global, national and regional
political and economic conditions; levels of securities markets; interest rates; credit or other risks of lending and
investment activities; as well as competitive and regulatory factors. By consequence, all forward-looking statements
have not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.

Interim dividend declaration 

Notice is hereby given that an interim dividend of 610 cents per ordinary share has been declared, payable to
shareholders for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The dividend has been declared out of income reserves. 

The dividend will be subject to a dividend withholding tax rate of 20% (applicable in SA) or 122 cents per ordinary
share, resulting in a net dividend of 488 cents per ordinary share, unless the shareholder is exempt from paying
dividend tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement. The dividend withholding
tax rate increased from 15% to 20% on 22 February 2017.

Nedbank Group's tax reference number is 9375/082/71/7 and the number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of
declaration is 498 108 914.

In accordance with the provisions of Strate, the electronic settlement and custody system used by the JSE, the relevant
dates for the dividend are as follows:

Event                                               Date

SPECIFIC REPURCHASE OF NEDBANK GROUP ORDINARY SHARES

1 Introduction and background

  In line with Nedbank Group's long-standing commitment to transformation, the Company
  introduced Nedbank Group's Namibian broad-based black economic empowerment
  ('BEE') transaction in 2006 ('the Namibian BEE Transaction'). The Namibian BEE
  Transaction facilitated broad-based black Namibian ownership equating to 11,13% of the
  then value of NedNamibia Holdings Limited ('NedNamibia Holdings'). The Namibian BEE
  Transaction was designed to accelerate operational transformation, extending to
  employment equity, client acquisition and strategies for underserved markets, to benefit a
  broad base of black Namibians throughout the country, including employees,
  entrepreneurs and communities.

  The Namibian BEE Transaction was implemented before the finalisation of the Namibian
  Financial Sector Charter of 2009 as part of a proactive, industry-led initiative to transform
  the financial services sector. It was based on Nedbank Group's comprehensive,
  overarching approach to transformation in alignment with principles of Nedbank Group's
  South African BEE transaction approved by shareholders in 2005.

  The introduction of broad-based black Namibian ownership into NedNamibia Holdings in
  2006 was effected by the issue of new Nedbank Group ordinary shares ('Shares') to
  various black stakeholders, including among others:

   -   strategic business partners comprising Central Consortium SPV Three Investments
       Proprietary Limited ('Central Consortium SPV'), Coastal Consortium SPV Three
       Investments Proprietary Limited ('Manmar SPV') and the Northern Empowerment
       SPV Three Investments Proprietary Limited ('Northern Empowerment Investments
       SPV') (collectively 'the Strategic Business Partner SPVs');
   -   strategic community partners comprising the Southern Consortium SPV Three
       Investments Proprietary Limited ('Churches SPV') and the Eastern Consortium SPV
       Three Investments Proprietary Limited ('WAD SPV') (collectively 'the Strategic
       Community Partner SPVs');
   -   an education trust, being the Old Mutual and Nedbank Namibia Education Trust
       ('Education Trust'); and
   -   the NedNamibia Holdings Discretionary Trust ('NedNamibia Holdings Discretionary
       Trust') in support of future long-term strategic initiatives.

  The Strategic Business Partner SPVs, the Strategic Community Partner SPVs, the
  Education Trust and the NedNamibia Holdings Discretionary Trust are collectively
  referred to as 'External Stakeholder SPVs'.
  
  This announcement outlines various transactions that will result in the rationalisation of
  the External Stakeholder SPVs in accordance with the constitutional documents of the
  Namibian BEE Transaction. The rationalisation will include the winding up of existing
  schemes that have reached their maturity dates and will result in the realisation of value
  for various BEE stakeholders.

2 Specific Repurchase

  As part of the process of terminating components of the original Namibian BEE
  Transaction, Nedbank Group will repurchase a number of Shares held by the External
  Stakeholder SPVs, based on formulas that were originally agreed on as part of the
  Namibian BEE Transaction ('the Specific Repurchase').

  This will result in the Specific Repurchase of 552 246 Shares from the External
  Stakeholder SPVs as described below.

  2.1     Terms of the Specific Repurchase

          The Specific Repurchase will take place on or about 8 June 2017 as follows:

          2.1.1 the repurchase from the Central Consortium SPV of:
                2.1.1.1 118 476 Shares at a price of R2,53 per share at a total amount
                        of R300 000;
                2.1.1.2 31 679 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          2.1.2 the repurchase from the Manmar SPV of:
                2.1.2.1 44 429 Shares at a price of R2,53 per share at a total amount
                        of R112 500;
                2.1.2.2 11 879 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          2.1.3 the repurchase from the Northern Empowerment Investments SPV of:
                2.1.3.1 37 024 Shares at a price of R2,53 per share at a total amount
                        of R93 750;
                2.1.3.2 9 900 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          2.1.4 the repurchase from the Churches SPV of:
                2.1.4.1 37 024 Shares at a price of R1 per share at a total amount of
                        R37 024;
                2.1.4.2 10 302 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          2.1.5 the repurchase from the WAD SPV of:
                2.1.5.1 37 024 Shares at a price of R1 per share at a total amount of
                        R37 024;
                2.1.5.2 10 302 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          2.1.6 the repurchase from the Education Trust of:
                2.1.6.1 98 730 Shares at a total amount of R1; and
                2.1.6.2 11 858 Shares at a total amount of R1.
          2.1.7 the repurchase from the NedNamibia Holdings Discretionary Trust of:
                2.1.7.1 81 452 Shares at a price of R1 per share at a total amount of
                        R81 452;
                2.1.7.2 12 167 Shares at a total amount of R1;

          After the Specific Repurchase, the Shares will be delisted, cancelled and
          reinstated as authorised but unissued Shares.

          The Specific Repurchase represents 0,1% of Shares currently in issue, being
          498 661 160 Shares.

          The Specific Repurchase will reduce the number of treasury Shares by 552 246
          Shares from 17 168 431 to 16 616 185 Shares.

    2.2   Shareholder approvals for the Specific Repurchase

          In terms of the JSE Limited ('JSE') Listing Requirements and section 48 of the
          Companies Act, 71 of 2008 ('the Companies Act'), the Specific Repurchase was
          approved by shareholders at the general meeting of Nedbank Group held on
          7 December 2006 and ratified on 18 May 2017 to the extent as required under the
          Companies Act of 2008.

    2.3   Statement by the board of directors of Nedbank Group ('the Board')

          After considering the effect of the Specific Repurchase, the Board is of the opinion
          that:
          2.3.1  the Company and Nedbank Group will be in a position to repay their debt
                 in the ordinary course of business for a period of 12 months after the date
                 of the Specific Repurchase;
          2.3.2  the Company's and Nedbank Group's assets will be in excess of the
                 liabilities of the Company and Nedbank Group for a period of 12 months
                 after the date of the Specific Repurchase (for this purpose the assets and
                 liabilities have been recognised and measured in accordance with the
                 accounting policies used in the latest audited consolidated annual
                 financial statements);
          2.3.3  the share capital and reserves of the Company and Nedbank Group will
                 be adequate for ordinary business purposes for a period of 12 months
                 after the Specific Repurchase; and
          2.3.4  the working capital of the Company and Nedbank Group will be adequate
                 for ordinary business purposes for a period of 12 months after the
                 Specific Repurchase.

          The Board further acknowledges that it has applied the solvency and liquidity test
          as set out in section 4 of the Companies Act and has reasonably concluded that
          Nedbank Group will satisfy the solvency and liquidity test immediately after the
          Specific Repurchase.

    2.4   Source of funds

          The Specific Repurchase will be funded from existing cash resources and no
          external borrowings will be used.

3  Impact of the Specific Repurchase on financial information

   3.1    The Specific Repurchase has no significant impact on the consolidated financial
          position of Nedbank Group other than:
          3.1.1   Before the Specific Repurchase the External Stakeholder SPVs held
                  726 502 Shares, which were reported as treasury Shares. A total of
                  552 246 of these Shares will be repurchased from the External
                  Stakeholder SPVs, cancelled and delisted. After the Specific Repurchase
                  140 915 of the remaining Shares in the External Stakeholder SPVs will no
                  longer be accounted for as treasury Shares.
          3.1.2   After the Specific Repurchase the number of issued Shares will decrease
                  by 552 246 Shares to 498 108 914 Shares.
          3.1.3   The Specific Repurchase will result in a total consideration payable by
                  Nedbank Group of R 661 758. The NedNamibia Holdings Discretionary
                  Trust will continue to be consolidated into Nedbank Group's financial
                  information after the Specific Repurchase. Therefore the net cash outflow
                  from Nedbank Group will be R 580 305.
    3.2   The effect of the Specific Repurchase on the Shares and diluted Shares will be
          accounted for in Nedbank Group's financial results from 8 June 2017.

4  Salient dates of the Specific Repurchase

   The salient dates for the Specific Repurchase are as follows:

                                                                                      2017
   Specific Repurchase of a total of 552 246 Shares from the              Thursday, 8 June
   Trusts, on or about
   Cancellation and delisting of 552 246 Shares, on or about             Thursday, 15 June

UPDATE ON NEDBANK GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH 2017
AND PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS AS AT 31 MARCH
2017

UPDATE ON THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH 2017
Nedbank Group’s managed operations continued to produce a solid performance for the first three
months of the year (‘the period’). In a difficult socio political and macro-economic environment,
overall client activity and revenue growth was slower than expected, but this was partially offset by
a better than expected credit loss experience.

Net interest income grew at mid-single digit levels on the back of annualised growth in average
interest-earning banking assets (AIEBA) at low single-digit levels. The net interest margin (NIM) for
the period widened ahead of the full year 2016 level of 3,54% and the Q1 2016 level of 3,51% (which
includes the transfer of the CIB liquid asset portfolio from AIEBA to the trading book). Margin
expansion was led by endowment income as a result of higher average interest rates and higher
capital and transactional deposit levels as well as improved liability margins and advances mix
benefits. Together, these more than offset the adverse implications of the narrowing of the prime
interest rate against the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate during the period.
The benefit of our historic selective asset growth strategies with a wholesale bias continues to
evidence itself in our credit loss ratio (CLR) which decreased from the full year 2016 level of 68 basis
points (bps). The lower CLR was supported by a decrease in impairments in CIB and client collections
in RBB remained effective.

Non-interest revenue grew at low-to-mid single digit levels and continued to be underpinned by
mid-single digit increases in commission and fees and trading income whilst performance of other
NIR components have been more volatile given the challenging economic environment.

Disciplined expense management resulted in expenses growing in line with our expectations.

As previously disclosed in the group’s SENS announcement on 18 April 2017, associate earnings from
the group’s share of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated’s (ETI) attributable income are equity-
accounted one quarter in arrear, using ETI’s publicly disclosed results. The group’s share of ETI’s
attributable loss of USD 427m for the fourth-quarter in 2016 was approximately R1,2bn (Q1 2016:
R676m loss). On 27 April 2017, ETI reported its first quarter results for 2017 with attributable
income of USD 51m. The group’s share is estimated at R144m (subject to exchange rate movements)
which will be accounted for in our second quarter results (Q2 2016: R230m).

In April 2017, Standard & Poor’s Global (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded South Africa’s
(SA) sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade while Moody’s has placed the sovereign ratings
under review for a potential downgrade. SA’s long-term sovereign foreign currency rating was
downgraded to BB+ from BBB- with a negative outlook by S&P and a stable outlook by Fitch. In
addition, SA’s long-term local currency issuer ratings were downgraded to BB+ from BBB- with a
stable outlook by Fitch.

The macroeconomic outlook for SA has deteriorated following the sovereign downgrades which will
impact negatively on confidence, investment and growth. As a result, we have reduced our 2017
GDP growth forecast for SA from 1,1% to 0,7% with risk remaining to the downside and the interest
rate forecast has been revised to either remain flat or increase slightly, in comparison to our
previous expectations of a cumulative decrease of 50 bps later this year.

In view of the volatile socio-political outlook and the weaker than expected macro-economic
environment, we anticipate reduced levels of business and consumer confidence and that it will now
be more challenging to achieve the full 2017 year guidance provided at the time of the release of
our 2016 annual results.
We are monitoring the likely impact of this on credit demand, transactional activity and
impairments, and will update our performance guidance for the full 2017 year in our 2017 Interim
Results announcement on 2 August 2017.

PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS AS AT 31 MARCH 2017
BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY

In terms of the requirements under Regulation 43(1)(e)(iii) of the regulations relating to banks and
Directive 4/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of the Banks Act (Act No. 94 of 1990), minimum
disclosure on the capital adequacy of the group and its leverage ratio is required on a quarterly
basis.

Both the group and bank remain well capitalised at levels significantly above the minimum
regulatory requirements. The common equity tier 1 ratios of 12,6% and 12,3%, respectively, are
reflective of organic capital generation and the limited movement in risk weighted assets during the
period. The group and bank’s total capital ratio was positively impacted by the issuance of R2,0bn of
new style Tier 2 capital in March 2017, offset to a degree by the redemption of old style Tier 2 notes
of R1,0bn in the same month.


The following table sets out the regulatory capital as at 31 March 2017:

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)

In accordance with the provisions of section 6(6) of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks
are directed to comply with the relevant LCR disclosure requirements, as set out in Directive 6/2014
and Directive 11/2014.


The LCR aims to ensure that a bank holds an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid
assets (HQLA) to cover total net cash outflows over a 30-day period under a prescribed stress
scenario. Based on the final revisions announced by the Basel Committee the LCR is being phased-in
from 60% on 1 January 2015, increasing by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.


According to Directive 11/2014 banks should disclose the LCR based on the simple average of
month-end data up to the first reporting period after 1 January 2017, where after the bank should as
a minimum disclose the LCR based on the relevant simple averages of daily data. Below are the LCR
for the group and bank based on the simple average of three month-end data points together with
the LCR for the group and bank based on the simple average of three months of daily data.


The difference between the average month-end LCR calculations and the average daily LCR
calculations can largely be attributed to a business-as-usual concentration of deposits in the first few
weeks of January each year, following the December holiday season in SA. This concentration of
deposits results in lower LCR levels in the beginning of January and typically normalises by the end of
January therefore resulting in the difference between the two calculations. Irrespective of which
calculation is used it should be noted that based on the tables below the group and bank are well
above minimum regulatory requirements.

bonus (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set out
above) can be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into the
scheme. Alternatively, the employee can commit shares already owned by them up to an
equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus less any amount already
deferred under the Compulsory Bonus Deferral Scheme. The employee can dispose of these
shares at any time prior to the vesting date, which will cancel their participation in the scheme in
respect of those shares, and will render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

The date of the transaction was 8 May 2017 and the value of the shares was determined using a
weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 4 May 2017 and 8 May 2017.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still
held in trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the
person has remained in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50%
of the shares held on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined
company performance target for the period 2017 to 2019 is met.

NEDBANK GROUP AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGE TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS

In accordance with the Nedbank Group board succession plan, the boards of Nedbank
Group and Nedbank (“the Companies”) are pleased to announce the appointments of Ms
Neo Dongwana and Ms Linda Manzini as independent non-executive directors of the
Companies with effect from 1 June 2017.

Linda Manzini, the founder of Lima Business Solutions (Pty) Limited, was previously Director
and Head of Investment Banking Coverage (SA) at Standard Bank where she was
responsible for business development and origination across a portfolio of sectors, which
included Oil & Gas, Power, Infrastructure & Renewables, Mining & Metals and
Telecommunications. Prior to that Linda was Managing Director of Diners Club. Linda left
the corporate world to become a career and business coach, providing professionals and
entrepreneurs with skills, insights and tools to enrich their careers and businesses. Linda will
join the Nedbank Group Transformation, Social and Ethics Committee, Group Credit
Committee and the Large-exposure Approval Committee.

Neo Dongwana spent her earlier career as an Equities Analyst before joining Deloitte, where
she held the position of Audit Partner for 9 years. She was the first black female partner in
the Cape Town office and the second black female partner in the South African practice.
Neo serves on a number of boards, including Barloworld limited, AVI limited and Mpact
Limited. She is also a Trustee of the Women’s Development Bank and has represented
South Africa on the Southern African Development Community’s audit committee and serves
as a member of the Financial Services Board Appeal Board. Neo will be appointed as a
member of the Nedbank Group Remuneration Committee and Group Audit Committee.

Mr Vassi Naidoo, Nedbank Group Chairman, extended a warm welcome to both Ms
Dongwana and Ms Manzini and said that their appointments would bring a wealth of
experience and expertise to the Boards and the relevant board committees. He noted that,
given the resignations of Messrs Adomakoh and Boardman as independent non-executive
directors following the AGM on 18 May 2017 (as previously announced), the Nedbank Group
and Nedbank Boards of 17 members will continue to comprise 59% independent non-
executive directors on 1 June 2017, and that performance against Nedbank Group’s Board
diversity targets will be substantially improved following these appointments on 1 June 2017.

Nedbank Group’s Board diversity targets and achievements against these at 1 June 2017 will
be as follows:

VOLUNTARY    ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE RELEASE OF 2016 ECOBANK
TRANSNATIONAL INCORPORATED FINANCIAL RESULTS


Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the Ecobank Transnational
Incorporated (ETI) financial results announcement for the full year 2016,
which was released by ETI on 18 April 2017.


ETI is our strategic partner in Central and West Africa and we have a
shareholding of approximately 20% in ETI. As disclosed in the Group’s
Integrated Report at 31 December 2016, the carrying value of this
investment in ETI, net of a R1,0bn impairment provision, was R4,0bn and the
Group’s market capitalisation was R118,0bn. The carrying value represents
approximately 3,4% of the Group’s market capitalisation.


Associate earnings from the Group’s share of ETI’s attributable income are
equity accounted one quarter in arrear using ETI’s publicly disclosed
results. ETI reported an attributable loss of USD250m for the full year
2016, including an attributable loss of USD427m for the fourth-quarter in
2016. The Group will equity account its share of ETI’s fourth-quarter loss
in the first quarter in 2017. The Group’s Q1 2017 associate loss from ETI
therefore amounted to approximately R1,2bn (Q1 2016: R676m loss).
Accounting for this associate loss in Q1 2017, together with Nedbank’s
share of ETI’s Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and Nedbank FCTR, will
decrease the carrying value of the Group’s investment in ETI from R4,0bn in
December 2016 to approximately R2,9bn in March 2017.


The ETI board also announced a proposed convertible bond issue of up to
USD400m of which approximately USD300m is currently supported by existing
shareholders. USD200m of this funding will be used to repay the short-term
financing used in setting up a resolution vehicle in Nigeria with the sole
objective of ring-fencing the legacy loans from Nigeria’s core bank. The
remaining funding raised is for a conscious debt restructure of the
maturity profile of the ETI Holdco balance sheet. The bond matures 5 years
from issue date and the conversion price of the offer is 6 USD cents
compared to a current price of 3 USD cents with an interest rate of 6.46%
above LIBOR. Nedbank Group is currently not part of the group of existing
shareholders who have indicated appetite for the USD300m of this funding as
the commercial terms of this convertible bond do not meet Nedbank’s
required internal rate of return.


ETI’s 2016 performance reflects the tough economic environment in Nigeria
which represents 32% of its advances. In Nedbank Group’s 2016 financial
results announcement we noted that: ‘Conditions in the key markets in which
ETI operates are currently expected to remain difficult in 2017, before
improving in 2018 and beyond’. Consequently, these ETI results and in
particular the Q4 2016 results are largely as anticipated at the time
Nedbank Group reported its 2016 results and impaired its investment in ETI
by R1,0bn.


The long-term growth potential of financial services in the rest of Africa
remains attractive. We therefore remain committed to our strategy and
investments in the rest of Africa, to ETI as our partner in Central and
West Africa and to growing the Group’s own operations in SADC and East
Africa.


Ade Ayeyemi, ETI Group CEO, said in the ETI announcement: ‘The Francophone
West Africa and Anglophone West Africa regions continue to perform
positively generating over 40% of the Group’s revenues at a return on
equity above 24% and 32% respectively. We remain the leading bank in these
regions. I remain confident in the result of the cost efforts and in our
ability to deliver a leading service for our customers which will be
reflected in improved key performance indicators in 2017 and beyond.’


Mike Brown, Chief Executive of Nedbank Group noted: 'The extent of the oil
and commodity crisis and its impact on the Nigerian economy resulted in
Nigeria’s first recession in 25 years. This has negatively impacted ETI’s
short term performance and profitability. We expect that as the Nigerian
economy recovers and ETI builds on their strong positioning in Central and
West Africa that longer term performance will improve off a low base. We
remain supportive of the strengthened ETI management team and will continue
to work closely with ETI’s shareholders, board and management team to
unlock value.’
An update on Nedbank Group’s performance for the first quarter of 2017 will
as usual be provided to shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on 18
May 2017 and Nedbank Group’s interim results for the six months to 30 June
2017 will be published on 31 July 2017. The financial information on which
this voluntary announcement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the group’s auditors.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2017 COMPULSORY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEME

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following
information is disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors and the company secretary of
Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

The shares as detailed below have been committed on behalf of the executive directors and the company
secretary to the 2017 Compulsory Bonus Deferral Share Scheme, whereby compulsory deferred bonus
amounts are invested in the Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee resign
and not be classified as a good leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well as in cases where, in the
sole opinion of the Nedbank Group Board, material irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results
come to light during the deferral period. In these instances, the employee also forgoes the right to
matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture.

The date of the transaction (off-market) was 31 March 2017 (the inception date) and the value of the
shares was determined using a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 27
March 2017 and 29 March 2017.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in
trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person has
remained in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held
on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance target
for the period 2017 to 2019 is met.

VESTING OF SHARES TO DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY: 2014 MATCHED SHARE SCHEME

The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to
executive directors and the company secretary of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

This voluntary announcement confirms that these shares have vested in terms of the 2014 Matched Share
Scheme. This is not classified as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings Requirements.

(a)     In terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme (CBSS), compulsory deferred bonus amounts
        could be invested in the Matched Share Scheme. The deferred amount would be forfeited should
        the employee resign before the end of the deferral period and not be classified as a good leaver, as
        well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material irregularities or
        misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral period. In these instances,
        the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)     In terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme (VBSS), up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax
        bonus (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set out
        above) could be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would then be committed into the
        Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the employee could commit shares already owned by them
        up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus less any amount already
        deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these
        shares at any time prior to the vesting dates, which would cancel their participation in the scheme
        in respect of those shares and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares committed into the Matched Share Scheme
but no rights to dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless and until the
requisite Matched Shares are delivered to the Participant.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still held in
trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the person
continued in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50% of the shares held
on vesting date would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined company performance
target for the period 2014 to 2016 was met.

VESTING OF SHARES AND OPTIONS GRANTED TO THE COMPANY SECRETARY IN 2012 IN
TERMS OF THE NEDBANK EYETHU BLACK EXECUTIVE TRUST


The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary
shares and options previously granted to the Company Secretary of Nedbank Group and
Nedbank Limited (‘Nedbank’).

This voluntary announcement confirms only that the company secretary is now entitled to
the second tranche of the 2012 award, having remained in the employ of Nedbank Group
over the vesting period, and this is not classified as a ‘dealing’ in terms of JSE Listings
Requirements.

Background:
In August 2005, Nedbank Group implemented a black economic empowerment transaction,
which was comprised of a number of schemes empowering a broad base of over 500 000
previously disadvantaged beneficiaries. 41 268 130 new ordinary shares in Nedbank Group
were issued for the purposes of this BEE transaction, which at the time equated to
approximately 9.47% of the Company’s issued share capital (post the issue of the shares)
and also equated to black ownership of 11.5% of the value of Nedbank Group’s South
African businesses.

The South African BEE transaction comprised of three groupings, namely:

-   the Black Business Partners Schemes and the Non-Executive Directors Scheme;
-   the Client Schemes and the Community Scheme; and
-   the Employee Schemes (including a Black Executive Scheme, Black Management
    Scheme, Broad-based Employee Scheme and the Evergreen Scheme).

Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust:
The Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust (‘BET’) manages and operates the Black Executive
Scheme referred to above. The trustees of the BET award Nedbank Group shares and grant
options on Nedbank Group shares to qualifying participants for retention and attraction
purposes. The entitlement of such executives to the shares and options is conditional upon
them remaining in the employ of Nedbank Group over the vesting period, during which 33%
of the shares awarded or options granted vest in each of years 4 and 5 and 34% in year 6.
The participants are identified from time to time by the Nedbank Group Remuneration
Committee on the recommendation of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee.
Vesting of 33% of the shares and options that were awarded to Thabani Jali on 8 March
2012:
20 000 Nedbank Group shares and 60 000 options (with a strike price of R161,88) were
granted to Thabani Jali, and the second tranche of 33% of this award now vests. Mr Jali
holds the position of Chief Governance and Compliance Officer, and was also appointed as
Company Secretary subsequent to this award being made.

The details of the vesting of the restricted shares and options are as follows:

NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED AND NEDBANK LIMITED – CHANGES TO THE BOARDS
OF DIRECTORS


The boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited (“the Companies”) advise that as a
result of increasing time constraints from their respective overseas and local business
commitments, Tom Boardman and David Adomakoh have notified the boards of their
intention to resign as independent non-executive directors with effect from the close of
Nedbank Group Limited’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday, 18 May 2017.


Nedbank Group Chairman, Vassi Naidoo, expresses his heartfelt gratitude to Tom for the
role he has played in the group, dating back to April 2000 when Tom was appointed as Chief
Executive of BoE Limited, one of SA’s leading private and investment banking companies
which was acquired by Nedbank in 2002. Tom was appointed to the Nedbank boards as an
executive director in 2002, and was Chief Executive from 2003 to 2010. As Chief Executive,
Tom set ambitious goals and a five point plan, all of which were successfully delivered on in
2007 resulting in the bank returning to healthy profitability and ensuring that it was well
positioned to weather the global financial crisis of 2008. Tom was at the forefront of driving
the importance of culture, tone at the top and values in banking. After retiring in 2010, Tom
was appointed a non-executive director. Vassi said that the boards have continued to benefit
from Tom’s vision, strategy and scenario planning skills, banking and financial services
experience, as well as extensive business and accounting experience and independent
thinking. Tom’s immense contribution to the boards of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited
and the many board committees on which he has served will be sorely missed.
Errol Kruger will succeed Tom as the chairman of both the Group Risk and Capital
Management Committee and the Group Credit Committee at the close of the Annual General
Meeting on Thursday, 18 May 2017.


Vassi also thanked David for his tenure with Nedbank and Nedbank Group as an
independent non-executive director since 2014. David’s insights into Africa, particularly with
regards to the expansion of Nedbank’s interests across the continent, have been of
invaluable assistance to the boards.


In accordance with our board succession plans, the Nedbank and Nedbank Group boards
have been engaging with potential new board candidates, and their appointments are
currently being progressed through the required internal and regulatory processes and will be
announced as soon as the necessary approvals are in place.

Excellent performance from Nedbank Group's managed operations, offset by loss from ETI associate

'Nedbank delivered a solid performance in 2016, with excellent
growth from our managed operations offsetting an attributable
loss from our associate ETI. Excluding ETI, headline earnings
from our managed operations grew 16,2% and ROE, excluding
goodwill, was 18,1%, driven by strong revenue generation and
good credit risk management.

CIB's earnings growth of 15,5% reflects the benefits to revenue
generation from deeper client penetration as a result of the integrated
business model. RBB's ROE increased from 16,6% to 18,9% and was
supported by middle-market transactional client growth of 6,3% and
market share gains in key advances and deposit categories, resulting in
transactional revenues increasing 8,7%. Nedbank Wealth produced
reasonable growth while maintaining a high ROE.

The performance of our approximately 20% investment in ETI was
below our expectations, as it was impacted by weaker economic
conditions in West Africa and currency volatilities, particularly in Nigeria.
This led to the carrying value of our investment in ETI decreasing to
R4,0bn at year-end, including an impairment provision of R1,0bn based
on the value-in-use calculation performed in terms of International
Financial Reporting Standards.

Conditions in the key markets in which ETI operates are currently
expected to remain difficult in 2017, before improving in 2018 and
beyond. Our performance guidance for the full year in 2017 is currently
for growth in diluted headline earnings per share to be greater than the
consumer price index plus GDP growth.'

BANKING AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Global political and economic risk increased sharply as 2016
progressed, intensified by the UK's unexpected decision to
leave the European Union (Brexit), the election of
Mr Donald Trump as US president and the general surge in
antiglobalisation sentiment across many developed countries.
These developments have fuelled uncertainty, triggered
significant changes in global investment strategies and
undermined capital flows to many emerging economies.
Economic growth in a number of emerging countries was
affected by political challenges, the prolonged downturn in
global commodity prices or severe drought conditions. The
International Monetary Fund estimates marginally slower
global growth in 2016 of 3,1% (2015: 3,2%) due to advanced
economies easing to 1,6% (2015: 2,0%) and emerging markets
expanding to 4,1%, with growth in sub-Saharan Africa slowing
sharply to 1,6% (2015: 3,4%).

Growth of SA gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to 0,4%
for the first three quarters of 2016, relative to growth of 1,3%
in 2015. Rand volatility reflected the decline in business and
investor confidence in SA and the risk of the sovereign credit
rating being downgraded to subinvestment-grade levels by at
least one of the rating agencies. Inflation increased above the
upper 6,0% target range of the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) to end the year at 6,8% and, as a result, the prime
interest rate increased by 75 basis points (bps) to end the
year at 10,50%.

Following the combined efforts of government, business and
labour to avert a sovereign-ratings downgrade and promote
higher levels of inclusive growth, all three major rating
agencies, S&P Global Ratings, Moody's and Fitch, reaffirmed
SA's investment-grade status in 2016. The risk of a
downgrade remains in 2017, with two agencies ranking SA at
only one notch above subinvestment grade and all three
agencies placing the country on a negative outlook. A ratings
downgrade will negatively impact all South Africans, and to
avert this, the SA economy requires higher levels of inclusive
growth. We will continue to work with business, government
and labour to achieve this.

Tough macro conditions continued to place household
finances and company profits under pressure. Credit demand
has slowed down substantially, with weak levels of growth in
loans to households and companies, and modest growth in
total private sector credit extension of 4,6% in November
2016, compared with 10,2% at the end of 2015. The progress
in 2016 on the ratings front, coupled with a moderate
improvement in global commodity prices and expectations of
stronger global growth in 2017, lifted the rand to end 2016
almost 19% stronger against its trade-weighted basket of
currencies. The SARB has indicated that the interest rate
cycle is close to its peak, as inflation is forecast to return to
within the target range during 2017.

REVIEW OF RESULTS
Despite this challenging background, Nedbank Group's
managed operations produced an excellent performance
for the year ended 31 December 2016, driven by net interest
income (NII) and non-interest revenue (NIR) growth, while
historic loan origination practices and focused credit risk
management enabled the credit loss ratio (CLR) to remain
below the mid-point of our through-the-cycle (TTC) target
range. Headline earnings grew 5,9% to R11 465m and,
excluding the impact of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated
(ETI), our managed operations grew headline earnings by
16,2% to R11 839m.

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) increased 4,8%
to 2 350 cents (2015: 2 242 cents) and headline earnings per
share (HEPS) grew 5,1% to 2 400 cents (2015: 2 284 cents).
Excluding ETI, DHEPS was up 15,1%.

Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (ROE),
excluding goodwill, of 16,5% (2015: 17,0%) and ROE of 15,3%
(2015: 15,7%) reflect a slightly lower return on assets (ROA)
of 1,23% (2015: 1,25%) as a result of the loss in equity-
accounted earnings from ETI. Excluding ETI, the ROA was
1,27% (2015: 1,18%). Economic profit (EP) decreased to
R1 565m (2015: R2 525m) due to the impact of ETI and a
higher cost of equity (COE) of 14,2% (2015: 13,0%).

Our tier 1 capital ratio of 13,0% (2015: 12,0%) and our
average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for the fourth quarter
of 109,3% (2015 quarterly average: 88,5%) are both well
above regulatory requirements of 8,375% and 70,0%
respectively. On a pro forma basis our net stable funding
ratio (NSFR) is above 100%.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLY TO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN 2016
Banks play an important role in a nation's economy by providing a safe foundation for individuals and businesses to invest or
deposit their money, which in turn enables banks to advance loans to individuals and businesses. The ability of society to borrow
from banks helps individuals build homes for their families or have transport to travel to work, and businesses to grow and
create jobs. Banks essentially facilitate economic growth and job creation, helping our nation to become stronger and better.

As a bank we are deeply committed to our purpose of using our financial expertise to do good for individuals, families,
businesses and society. Through our role in SA's society and the economy as a whole we not only contribute directly to our staff,
clients, shareholders, regulators and communities, but we also create long-term value for future generations of South Africans.

For staff

We created 1 089 new permanent-employment opportunities and
invested R413m in staff training, with more than 19 600 staffmembers
participating in learning interventions and 1 140 staffmembers being
supported through bursaries for further development. We also assisted
2 379 staffmembers with their children's education commitments and
1 127 staffmembers with medical costs not covered by medical aid or
gap cover. In continuing to support our country to reduce
unemployment among the youth and address skills shortages, in the
past five years we have successfully engaged 699 external bursars
across 19 universities and 11 038 individuals through learning
programmes and learnerships, including 449 candidates through
several of our graduate programmes for chartered accountants,
quantitative analysts and various other professionals. Cumulatively,
over 84% of the youth given learnership and agraduate opportunities
are black and 52% are women. Nedbank's leading position as a top
empowerment company in the financial services sector and a leader
of transformational change in SA was recognised at the 15th Annual
Oliver Empowerment Awards, where we were honoured as Legend
of Empowerment and Transformation.

For clients

We provided innovative offerings and improved client access by rolling
out an additional 219 Intelligent Depositors, including 170 self-service
devices, 6 025 new point-of-sale devices, and converting a further 45
branches to smaller and more digitally focused branches of the future
since December 2015. Retail main-banked clients increased 3,0%,
including middle-market clients by 6,3% and digitally enabled and
active clients grew strongly, driving up the value of Nedbank App Suite™
transactions by 60,0% to R25,0bn. Information technology (IT) system
stability was maintained at 99,89% and we processed over 15bn
transactions, enabling our clients to pay for goods and services. We
advanced R162bn (2015: R185bn) of new loans to clients, including
R80,9bn to Retail and Business Banking (RBB) clients and R25,7bn to
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and Business Banking clients, as
well as R3,9bn for affordable housing to Corporate and Investment
Banking (CIB) clients. In addition, over R50bn of infrastructure finance
was drawn and committed. Assets under management grew by 6,2%
to R273,3bn (2016: R257,3bn), with Nedgroup Investments placed
among the top three domestic management companies for the eighth
consecutive year, in addition to winning in the Offshore Management
Company of the Year category and achieving third place in the South
African Management Company of the Year category at the 21st Annual
Raging Bull Awards.

For shareholders

We increased net asset value per share to 15 830 cents
(2015: 15 685 cents) and delivered EP of R1 565m and a total
shareholder return of 32,3%, including increasing the dividend 8,4%.
We also realised R8,2bn in value for over 500 0000 of our broad-
based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) shareholders through
our BBBEE schemes on maturity. We also engaged constructively with
shareholders in over 350 meetings, and at our 49th annual general
meeting all resolutions were passed with more than 90% votes of
approval. We ensure transparent, relevant and timeous reporting and
disclosure to shareholders, as acknowledged by Nedbank's Integrated
Report being ranked in the top tier of JSE-listed companies by EY,
Chartered Secretaries and Nkonki.

For regulators

We maintained full compliance with Basel III phase-
in requirements, achieving an improved tier 1 ratio
of 13,0%, an average long-term funding ratio of
29,6% and an average LCR ratio of 109,3% in the
fourth quarter. We have invested over R100bn in
government and public sector bonds as part of our
high-quality liquid-asset (HQLA) requirements and,
in doing so, remain committed to making a
meaningful contribution to the SA economy,
thereby supporting the funding needs of
government. We also made cash taxation,
contributions of R8,7bn relating to direct, indirect,
pay-as-you-earn and other taxation, maintained
transparent relationships and worked closely with all
regulators to ensure efficient delivery of the various
regulatory programmes and achieved anti-money-
laundering remediation of high-risk clients by the
planned due dates.

For communities

We supported local businesses and the SA
economy, purchasing 75,0% of our procurement
spend locally, with 22,9% from black economic
empowerment (BEE) suppliers, 12,5% from black-
women-owned organisations and 16,7% from
SMEs. We won the Chartered Institute of
Procurement and Supply (CIPS) award for the Best
Supplier and Enterprise Development Project for
the pan-African region in recognition of our support
of local SMEs. Since 2012, we have contributed
R634m to socioeconomic development, with R141m
in 2016, of which more than 50% was allocated to
education. In addition, we supported students in
the Fees Must Fall campaign by contributing R11m
towards bursaries, registration fees and student
debt. The Mogale Empowerment Trust was
established with an investment of R100m in the
MTN Zakhele Futhi Scheme, and dividends earned
on investments will be distributed to beneficiaries,
targeting black student bursaries and enterprise
development initiatives. Since its inception in 1990
our four affinities have contributed more than
R350m to more than 1 200 projects across their
social and environmental development focus areas.
In recognition of our contribution to society in SA,
Nedbank was ranked second by peers in the
Trialogue CSI Handbook for 2016 for our
developmental impact and corporate social
investment, and rated first by non-governmental
institutions. Our Fair Share 2030 strategy enabled
more than R2,3bn of new lending to support
student accommodation and embedded energy in
the commercial and agricultural sectors. We have
committed R35bn towards renewable-energy deals,
of which R13,3bn has been disbursed to date. Our
pipeline for the funding of green buildings continues
to grow, with more than R5,2bn committed over
the next two years. We have maintained our level 2
BBBEE contributor status for the eighth
consecutive year.

Nedbank CIB's excellent growth in headline earnings was
driven by strong revenue generation while maintaining a strong
ROE despite the increase in capital allocation. Growth in
revenue was underpinned by transactional banking client gains
and deeper client penetration through improved and
coordinated client value management across all business units.

RBB continued to improve its ROE, with Retail achieving an
ROE of 17,6%, well above the group's COE of 14,2%. RBB grew
transactional revenue by 8,7%, driven by growth in
transactional clients, particularly in the middle market,
and market share gains in selected advances and deposit
categories. In addition, collections were well managed and
impairments remained below the TTC target range, with
continued improvement in the personal-loan CLR.

Nedbank Wealth produced reasonable growth while maintaining
a high ROE. This was supported by strong balance sheet growth
and continued low levels of impairments in Wealth Management.
Despite subdued markets, assets under management increased
6,2%, while Insurance earnings declined due to higher weather-
related claims and lower investment income.

Rest of Africa's earnings were negatively impacted by
earnings from our associate, ETI. The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) subsidiaries grew headline
earnings off a low base, supported by lower headoffice costs
and improved impairments, while we continued to invest in
staff, systems, distribution channels and regulatory
compliance.

The decrease in losses in the Centre was largely due to the
lower cost of basis risk retained in the Centre.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Net interest income
Strong NII growth of 10,6% to R26 426m (2015: R23 885m)
was underpinned by growth in average interest-earning
banking assets of 7,0% and net interest margin (NIM)
expansion to 3,41% (2015: 3,30%).

The margin improved by 11 bps, benefiting from endowment
income of 18 bps, following the 102 bps increase in average
interest rates in 2016. This benefit was partially offset by
among others:

- 3 bps of asset pricing and asset mix changes, although the
  negative mix effect has slowed down materially as our
  personal-loan advances book has started to grow; and

- 5 bps of cost of largely Basel III-related liquidity and
  funding initiatives.

To align with industry practice from November 2016 average
balances of R6bn in the CIB liquid-asset portfolio were
included in our trading book and removed from average
interest-earning banking assets used as the denominator in
the NIM calculation. This HQLA portfolio, together with the
associated market risk, is managed as part of the trading
book within the group's Market Risk Framework. The full-year
2016 NIM would have been 3,54% if the remaining R28bn of
average balances had been removed at the beginning of the
year. This change has no effect on NII.

Impairments charge on loans and advances
Impairments decreased by 4,9% to R4 554m (2015: R4 789m)
and the CLR improved to 0,68% (2015: 0,77%) supported by
lower impairments across all our clusters.

The CLR reflects improvements in CIB's impairments following
the increase in oil and other commodity prices and the
settlement or successful restructuring of certain counters during
the year. RBB's CLR improved to below the lower end of its TTC
target range. The improvement was underpinned by lower
impairments in Personal Loans and Business Banking.
Postwriteoff recoveries remained stable at R1 157m
(2015: R1 137m), of which R398m (2015: R398m) was attributable
to Personal Loans and R370m (2015: R280m) to MFC.

Total defaulted advances increased to R19 553m
(2015: R17 559m), representing 2,72% of advances (2015: 2,53%).
The increase was largely due to the implementation of the
SARB-driven new curing definition, which resulted in cured
defaulted accounts being kept in defaulted status for six months
after curing. In addition, RBB's defaulted advances increased off
a low base on the back of cyclical increases in the secured lending
and card portfolios. The slight increase in CIB's defaulted
advances reflects stress in new sectors following the settlement
or successful restructuring of certain counters. Excluding the
effect of the new curing definition, defaulted advances increased
by 5,0% to R18 445m, which is a more accurate reflection of the
underlying trend in the quality of the book.

The total coverage ratio of 62,2% (2015: 65,0%) includes
specific coverage of 37,4% (2015: 38,0%) and portfolio
coverage on the performing book of 0,69% (2015: 0,70%).
The lower specific coverage was largely driven by the new
curing definition, which led to RBB's ratio decreasing to 41,1%
(2015: 45,6%). Excluding the effect of the new curing
definition, specific coverage would have been 45,3%. CIB's
specific coverage increased to 26,3% (2015: 17,1%) in line with
the settlement and/or restructuring of certain counters
during the year. Nedbank Group's advances portfolio has an
approximate 60% weighting in wholesale advances where
specific provisions are determined on a deal-by-deal basis.
Most wholesale advances are secured by collateral, including
deep security pools held against our commercial-property-
finance portfolio. This creates a relatively lower loss given
default and, as a function of this, lower specific coverage
levels in CIB and consequently at group level.

The portfolio coverage ratio in CIB remained stable at 0,29%
and, since June 2016, central portfolio provisions increased by
R150m to R500m, remaining at the same level at year-end as
in 2015. Additional overlays held in RBB decreased to R654m
(2015: R699m), mainly due to a reduction in overlays held for
the unsecured-debt portfolio. These provisions take into
account our assessment of the risks in some of the more
stressed sectors of the economy and other risks that have
been incurred but have not yet emerged.

Nedbank's International Financial Reporting Standard
(IFRS) 9 implementation programme is on track and we are
well positioned for a parallel run in 2017. While we expect a
transitional increase in balance sheet provisions in line with
the requirements of the standard, this is not anticipated to
have a significant impact on our capital adequacy levels.

Non-interest revenue
NIR grew 8,1% to R23 503m (2015: R21 748m), primarily
driven by:

- Commission and fee income growth of 6,8% to R16 686m
  (2015: R15 627m), following gains in quality retail clients
  along with improved client coverage in CIB as the
  integration continues to deliver revenue benefits.

- Insurance income decreasing 5,6% to R1 727m (2015:
  R1 830m) as a result of higher weather-related claims.

- Trading income increasing 18,8% to R3 761m (2015:
  R3 167m) from higher market volatility, good client flows
  and deeper client penetration in CIB.

- Private-equity income increasing to R929m (2015: R886m)
  due to positive revaluations in certain entities, partly offset
  by lower profits realised.

Expenses
Expenses continue to be managed within expectations and
increased 8,6% to R28 366m (2015: R26 110m), mainly as a
result of:

- Staff-related costs increasing 8,6%, consisting of –

  - 7,4% growth in remuneration and other staff costs,
    driven by a 6,3% average annual salary increase and
    additional staff hires, mainly for regulatory change
    programmes;

  - a 10,5% increase in short-term incentives in line with key
    performance metrics in managed operations, offset by
    the impact of ETI; and

  - a 33,0% increase in long-term incentives as we perform
    better against the group's corporate performance
    targets, thereby increasing expected vesting levels.

- Computer processing costs increasing 14,2% to R4 047m,
  including amortisation costs that increased 11,3% to
  R799m following the capitalisation of IT projects and
  branch reformatting costs.

- Fees and insurance costs being 8,5% higher at R3 040m
  following increased volumes of revenue-generating
  activities such as cash handling and card issuing
  and acquiring.

The group's growth in revenue of 9,4% exceeded growth in
expenses. Excluding ETI, the JAWS ratio from managed
operations was positive at 0,8% (2015: -0,7%). The efficiency
ratio increased to 56,9% (2015: 56,2%), while this metric
improved to 56,4% (2015: 56,8%) if ETI is excluded.

Earnings from associates*
The earnings in associates decreased to a loss of R105m (2015:
R871m profit). This mainly comprised the equity-accounting of
our 21,2% share of ETI's Q4 2015 loss of R676m, which was
partly offset by our share of profits for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2016 of R551m, in line with our policy of
accounting for ETI earnings a quarter in arrear. The total
headline earnings impact of ETI for 2016 was a negative
R374m, including the R249m impact of funding costs.

The carrying value of Nedbank Group's strategic investment
in ETI decreased from R7,8bn to R4,0bn during the year, due
to a combination of foreign currency translation losses arising
from the naira devaluation and therefore ETI's balance sheet
decreasing in US dollars, the rand strengthening against the
US dollar, our share of losses incurred by ETI during the
12 months to 30 September 2016, as well as an impairment
provision of R1,0bn.

The market value of the group's investment in ETI, based on
its quoted share price, was R2,4bn on 31 December 2016 and
R2,1bn on 24 February 2017. The ETI share trades in low
volumes, given its low free float, while also being listed in an
illiquid market. The difference between market value and
carrying value is significant and prolonged, which has
represented evidence of an impairment indicator at
31 December 2016.

Where there is an impairment indicator, IFRS determines that
an impairment test be computed, which compares the value
in use (VIU) and the carrying value of the investment. The
computation of the VIU in accordance with IFRS is subject to
significant judgement as it is based on, inter alia, economic
estimates, macro assumptions and the discounting of future
cashflow estimates. This is particularly complicated in the
current economic environment in many of the jurisdictions in
which ETI operates and with the limited public information
available. As a result, management has computed the VIU
based on a number of scenarios by taking into account
publicly available information. Based on the results of this VIU
calculation, management determined that an impairment
provision of R1,0bn was appropriate. This has reduced the
carrying value of the group's investment to R4,0bn at
31 December 2016.

This calculation is required to be revisited at each reporting
period where the indicators of impairment would be
reconsidered and the VIU calculation would be reassessed
taking into account any future changes in estimates and
assumptions. Any significant changes after this reporting
period that require the VIU calculation or underlying carrying
value of the ETI investment to be revisited could result in a
further impairment or a release of the current R1,0bn
impairment provision. The impairment was recorded within
'non-trading and capital' items and does not impact headline
earnings. Regulatory capital was not impacted as the
impairment amount was less than the full threshold
deduction already taken against regulatory capital.

The group's strategic investment in ETI has been impaired in
accordance with the IFRS accounting considerations and the
main driver of this was the significant change in the economic
estimates and macro assumptions from Nigeria. ETI remains
an important long-term investment for Nedbank, providing
our clients with a pan African transactional banking network
across 39 countries and access to dealflow in Central and
West Africa since its acquisition in 2014. We remain
supportive of ETI's endeavours of delivering an ROE in excess
of its COE in due course. Conditions in the key markets in
which ETI operates are currently expected to remain difficult
in 2017, before improving in 2018 and beyond.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Capital
The group continued to strengthen its capital position and
we operated well within and/or above our internal capital
adequacy targets. Our tier 1 ratio improved to 13,0% (2016:
12,0%) as a result of strong organic capital generation and
the issue of R2,0bn of additional tier 1 capital. Initiatives for
risk-weighted asset optimisation in certain retail portfolios
provided further support.

The group's total capital ratio was further strengthened with
the successful issuance of R2,0bn of tier 2 capital
instruments.

    and 2019, and exclude any idiosyncratic or systemically important bank
    minimum requirements.

Our strong capital base supports our dividend cover of
2,00 times, which recognises our capacity to generate
internal capital in the economic environment projected in our
business plans and takes into account that our approximate
20% share of associate earnings or losses from ETI does not
impact regulatory capital.

Funding and liquidity
Optimising our funding profile and maintaining a strong
liquidity position remain priorities for the group in the current
environment.

The group's three-month average long-term funding ratio
improved to 29,6% for the fourth quarter of 2016
(December 2015: quarterly average of 28,7%), supported by
growth in Nedbank Retail Savings Bonds of R4,7bn to R19,2bn
and the successful issue of R10,8bn in senior unsecured debt.
Our funding profile benefited from our market share in the
medium-to-longer-term wholesale funding buckets, which
reduced our LCR HQLA requirements and consequently, the
all-in total cost of wholesale funding.

The group's quarterly average LCR of 109,3%
(December 2015: 88,5%) exceeded the minimum regulatory
requirement of 70% in 2016 and 80% from 1 January 2017. In
addition, the group maintained appropriate operational
buffers to absorb seasonal and cyclical volatility in this ratio.
We will continue to do this as we proactively position our
balance sheet during the phase-in period as the LCR
regulatory requirement increases by 10% per annum to 100%
by 1 January 2019.

announcement.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR compliant HQLA increased to a
quarterly average of R137,4bn (December 2015: quarterly
average R118,0bn). Together with our portfolio of quick-liquidity
sources, the total available quick liquidity amounted to R180,4bn
(2015: R160,7bn), representing 18,7% of total assets.

SARB released a directive on 8 August 2016 confirming that
the available stable funding factor applicable to wholesale
deposits in the 0-to-6-month bucket will be increased from
0% to 35% to better reflect the actual stability of these
deposits in the SA context. Taking cognisance of the finalised
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) NSFR
standard and the directive issued by SARB, Nedbank is
already compliant with the minimum requirements that will
become effective on 1 January 2018, as our NSFR on a pro
forma basis, at 31 December 2016 was above 100%.
The remaining key focus areas relating to the NSFR are
finalising a number of minor interpretational matters and
ensuring that compliance is achieved within the context of
balance sheet optimisation.

Loans and advances
Loans and advances increased 3,7% to R707,1bn (2015: R681,6bn).
Advances growth continued to be led by wholesale banking,
although the rate of growth slowed down while growth in retail
advances has remained relatively stable.

Loans and advances by cluster are as follows:

CIB's advances growth was mostly from commercial-
mortgage advances increasing by 12,1% and term loans by
10,5% on the back of a good deal pipeline. Our leading
market share of 42% in commercial mortgages continued to
be underpinned by a strong client base and a large, secure
asset pool.

Advances growth in RBB was driven by MFC, Personal Loans
and Card growing ahead of the industry, while Home Loans
grew at market levels. MFC's growth of 7,7% and the increase
in Personal Loans, Card and Home Loans of 7,7%, 5,9% and
2,4% respectively are evidence of the progress made with our
strategy of increasing cross-sell activities and doing more
business with our clients, while not relaxing credit criteria.

Advances growth in the Rest of Africa Cluster was driven by
new-business flows and the consolidation of our acquisition
of Banco Único from October 2016. Excluding Banco Único,
growth was 4,7%.

Deposits
Deposits grew 4,9% to R761,5bn (2015: R725,9bn), while
total liabilities increased 4,4% to R884,3bn (2015: R847,0bn).
The loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 92,8%
(December 2016: 93,9%).

The group continues to actively enhance its deposit and
transactional banking franchise through innovative and
competitive products. Our focus is on growing household and
commercial deposits within the structure of the SA banking
sector, which creates a large proportion of institutional
funding in the system. Good progress was made against our
funding strategy, with RBB deposits up 9,7% to R272,2bn
(2015: R248,1bn) and our household deposit market share
increasing to 18,7% in 2016 (2015: 18,4%), supported by
market share gains in current accounts to 19,3% in 2016
(2015: 18,4%). Growth took place across most deposit
categories, with our current accounts increasing 9,3%, call
accounts and term deposits 6,0%, fixed deposits 7,0%, and
cash management deposits by 9,7%. This growth, together
with that of negotiable certificates of deposit and other
structured deposits, reduced the proportion of more
expensive foreign currency funding.

Group strategic focus
Our five strategic focus areas were refined in 2016 and
strategic enablers introduced to ensure that we deliver on our
financial targets of increasing our ROE, excluding goodwill,
closer to our medium-to-long-term target of COE plus 5%
(currently estimated around 19%) and reducing our cost-to-
income ratio from 57,0% to within our medium-to-long-term
target of 50 – 53%. Good progress continued to be made in
these key areas.

-    Delivering innovative market-leading client experiences.
     We launched the competitive Nedbank Pay-as-you-use
     Account; MyPocket™ – a savings pocket linked to
     transactional accounts with immediate access to cash;
     Nedbank GAP Access™ – a cash advance solution for
     merchants based on their transaction flows; Masterpass™
     – a mobile payment platform in partnership with
     MasterCard®; standalone prepaid functionality for airtime,
     SMS bundles, data bundles and electricity; contactless
     cards – incorporating tap-and-go card acceptance and
     transactional banking; and 'Interactive Teller' – allowing
     transactions to be performed through a video channel that
     is linked to a teller located in our contact centre. In addition,
     a new client relationship management capability enhanced
     the contact centre experience, increasing volumes by 8% a
     year. Membership of our Greenbacks rewards programme
     increased 20%, with redemption values increasing 18%.
     Digitally enabled and active retail clients grew strongly,
     driving up the value of Nedbank App Suite™ transactions
     60% to R25bn. To date 44% of our outlets have been
     converted to new-format branches and we plan to have
     63% of all outlets converted by 2018. These outlets are
     smaller, with fewer staff, and are more digitally focused
     than traditional branches. Our Wealth Cluster launched the
     Nedgroup Investments Global Property Fund, expanding our
     Best of Breed™ product range. Our digital client value
     proposition was enhanced through the launch of contracts
     for difference (CFDs) on our online stockbroking platform;
     new digital self-service functionality; QuoteMe, offering
     funeral and personal-accident solutions as well as funeral
     policy servicing through video capability at all video-enabled
     Nedbank branches.

-    Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than the
     market. Nedbank's retail franchise attracted 3,0%
     additional main-banked clients, within a total client base of
     7,4m, translating into retail transactional NIR growth of
     8,7%. Altogether 69,7% of our retail main-banked clients
     have more than two other products. Our transactional
     banking progress was reflected in market share gains in
     household and transactional deposits to 18,7% and 19,4%
     respectively. The CIB integrated model enabled deeper
     client penetration and increased cross-sell, generating
     39 primary-bank client wins. CIB's leadership in key
     specialist areas supported NIR growth, which was
     acknowledged by CIB winning nine of the 32 Spire awards
     for excellence across the commodity derivatives, currency
     derivatives, fixed-income derivatives and bond markets.

-    Being operationally excellent in all we do. Cost discipline
     remains an imperative, with ongoing initiatives such as our
     strategy to decrease the number of core systems from
     250 to 60, of which 21 have been decommissioned in 2016,
     bringing the total decommissioned to 106; the elimination
     of duplicative processes, the reduction of the cost to serve
     and acquire clients, as well as the reduction of floor space in
     RBB by 30 000 m² by 2020, of which 18 743 m² has been
     achieved since 2014. Nedbank Wealth made good progress
     towards implementing a single policy administration system
     in Insurance, which will support operational excellence. We
     remain on track for delivery by the Old Mutual Group of the
     full target of R1bn of pretax run rate synergies in 2017, of
     which approximately 30% should accrue to Nedbank. To
     date this has amounted to over R250m for Nedbank, driven
     largely by procurement and technology services. In 2016 we
     realised R599m in cost-efficiencies.

-    Managing scarce resources to optimise economic outcomes.
     We maintained our focus on growing activities that
     generate EP, such as growing transactional deposits, with
     current accounts up 9,3%; increasing transactional banking
     activity, with commission and fees up 6,8%; and achieving
     earnings growth of 15,5% in CIB and 11,2% in RBB. Our
     selective origination of personal loans, home loans and
     commercial-property finance has proactively limited
     downside risk in this challenging operating climate,
     enabling a CLR of 68 bps, below the mid-point of our TTC
     target range. At the same time our balance sheet metrics
     remain strong and we continue to deliver good
     dividend growth.

-    Providing our clients with access to the best financial
     services network in Africa. The macroeconomic environment
     in the rest of Africa remains challenging due to slowing
     economic growth, foreign exchange and liquidity shortages,
     and increasing regulatory pressures across a number of
     jurisdictions.

     -  In Central and West Africa, since the establishment of
        our alliance with Ecobank, 192 accounts have been
        opened in 25 countries for 82 of our wholesale clients
        that bank with Ecobank. We work closely with Ecobank
        on joint pipeline deals in the power and infrastructure
        sectors, and opportunities in trade and commodity
        finance.

     -  In the SADC and East Africa we successfully
        implemented our Flexcube core banking system in
        Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho, and we continued to
        launch new products and grow our distribution
        footprint. Our shareholding in Banco Único increased by
        11% to 50% plus one share in October 2016 as a
        progression of the 2014 transaction at a cost of
        approximately R90m.

Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are likely
to remain for 2017, the long-term growth potential of financial
services in the rest of Africa cannot be overlooked. We
therefore remain committed to our strategy and investments
in the rest of Africa and continue to support ETI as our partner
in Central and West Africa. ETI provides our clients with a
pan-African transactional banking network across 39 countries
and is a strategic investment for the group. ETI is targeting an
ROE in excess of its COE in the medium to long term, and our
21,2% shareholding offers our shareholders the opportunity to
participate in this growth over time.

In 2016 we introduced a series of strategic enablers to
facilitate delivery in respect of our strategic focus areas and
the achievement of our targets by changing the way in which
we operate. These include:

-    People 2020 – aimed at transforming our leadership,
     culture and talent capability to enable delivery of our
     strategy through our people.

-    Brand 2020 – building a distinctive and compelling brand
     that will cause disruption, give us greater personality and
     enhance the belief our stakeholders have in Nedbank.

-    Managed Evolution and Digital Fast Lane – an innovative
     technology transformation creating an agile digital
     platform.

-    Governance and regulatory change – leveraging risk
     management to be a strategic and competitive
     differentiator.

-    Fair Share 2030 – guiding the creation of financial
     solutions that deliver on our purpose and making a real
     difference in society.

-    Leading transformation – actively promoting a globally
     competitive financial sector while creating a more
     equitable society.

At the same time, to support strategic delivery further, we
initiated an operating-model review in the latter part of 2016.
The revised model, which we expect to begin implementing in
2017, will enable us to develop greater agility with a view to
innovating quicker and responding to disruptive threats
faster, optimally addressing new-client requirements and
providing best-in-class client experiences, and creating an
enterprise-wide capability with the client at the centre of all
we do. In addition, we aim to organise ourselves, our data and
data analytics and IT to enable differentiation in our clients'
universe, to respond more effectively to regulatory change
and to improve our ability to execute our strategy more
effectively. Collectively these activities are currently expected
to generate approximately R1,0bn of pretax benefits by 2019
and will support our ability to meet our medium-to-long-term
targeted cost-to-income ratio of 50 – 53%.

Old Mutual plc managed separation
Following the Old Mutual plc (OM) and Nedbank Group SENS
announcements released on 28 June 2016, the managed-
separation process was presented at the OM Capital Markets
event in London on 11 October 2016.

In summary, following the creation of a new SA holding
company, OM intends to distribute, in an orderly manner, a
significant proportion of the OM group's shareholding in
Nedbank to the shareholders on the register of the new SA
holding company at that time, leaving Old Mutual Emerging
Markets (OMEM) as the principal business in the group.
Through its ownership of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company
SA the new SA group will retain an appropriate strategic
minority stake in Nedbank, with the exact level still to be
determined together with Nedbank, based on OMEM's
commercial relationship with Nedbank and influenced by
the implications of the incoming Twin Peaks regulation.
The boards of directors and management teams of OM and
Nedbank continue to work closely together on these matters.
The announced target date for the material completion of
the managed separation is the end of 2018.

For Nedbank it is business as usual and OM's decision will
have no impact on the strategy, and the day-to-day
management or operations, nor will there be an impact on
the staff and clients of Nedbank. Our engagements have
been at an arm's length, overseen by independent board
structures. OM operates predominantly in the investment,
savings and insurance industry, which has little overlap with
banking. Our technology systems, brands and our businesses
have not been integrated and we compete in the areas of
wealth and asset management and personal Loans.

Our collaboration with OM to unlock R1,0bn of synergies from
the OM businesses in SA will continue to be underpinned by
OM's strategic shareholding of Nedbank Group. We are fully
committed to working with Old Mutual South Africa to
deliver benefits from the synergies.

Economic outlook
SA's economy is forecast to grow by around 1,1% in 2017 off
a low base. The risk to growth remains on the downside.
Inflation is expected to return to within SARB's inflation
target range, resulting in our forecast of interest rates
decreasing in the second half of the year.

The improvement in the economy is expected to be
underpinned by a recovery in agriculture as the drought
recedes, and in mining and manufacturing as global
commodity prices drift higher. Corporate credit demand
should benefit from the recovery in these sectors, although
demand will remain contained by global growth, the
uncertain domestic policy environment, the pace of the rollout
of government's renewable-energy programme and generally
difficult operating conditions.

Households will remain vulnerable, with job creation and
wage growth unlikely to bounce back quickly. Household
income and spending will therefore remain under pressure
in the first half of the year. However, some relief is expected
later in the year as inflation recedes and interest rates are
expected to decline. This should lead to household credit
demand improving moderately from low levels.

Government spending will be kept in check by the need to
reduce the budget deficit and contain the rise in government
debt to avoid a sovereign-rating downgrade.

Prospects
Our guidance on financial performance for the full year 2017
is as follows:

-   Average interest-earning banking assets to increase
    slightly ahead of nominal GDP growth.

-   NIM to be slightly above the 2016 rebased level of 3,54%.

-   CLR to increase, but to remain below the mid-point of our
    target range of 60 – 100 bps.

-   NIR, excluding fair-value adjustments, to grow at upper
    single digits.

-   Associate income, including ETI's earnings likely to remain
    volatile and uncertain (reported quarterly in arrear).

-   Expenses to increase by mid-to-upper single digits.

Our financial guidance is for growth in DHEPS for the full
2017 year to be greater than growth in nominal GDP
(consumer price index plus GDP growth).

The outlook for our medium-to-long-term targets in 2017 is
as follows:

Accounting policies*
Nedbank Group is a company domiciled in SA. The summary
consolidated financial results of the group at and for the year
ended 31 December 2016 comprise the company and its
subsidiaries ('group') and the group's interests in associates
and joint arrangements.

The summary consolidated financial statements contained in
the SENS announcement have been extracted from the
audited consolidated financial statements. The summary
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the provisions of the JSE Listings
Requirements for preliminary reports and the Companies Act
applicable to summary financial statements. The JSE Listings
Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in
accordance with the framework concepts and the
measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS, the
South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices
Committee, and Financial Pronouncements as issued by
the Financial Reporting Standards Council and also, as a
minimum, to contain the disclosure required by International
Accounting Standard 34: Interim Financial Reporting.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements, from which the summary
consolidated financial statements were derived, are in terms
of IFRS and are consistent with the accounting policies that
were applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated
financial statements.

The summary consolidated financial results have been
prepared under the supervision of Raisibe Morathi CA(SA),
the Chief Financial Officer. The directors take full
responsibility for the preparation of the summary
consolidated financial results and for correctly extracting
the financial information from those underlying audited
consolidated financial statements for inclusion in the 2016
year-end results booklet and SENS announcement.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD*
There are no material events after the reporting period to
report on.

Audited summary consolidated financial statements - independent auditor's 
opinion

The summary consolidated financial statements comprise
the summary consolidated statement of financial position at
31 December 2016, summary consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, summary consolidated statement of
changes in equity and summary consolidated statement of
cashflows for the year then ended and selected explanatory
notes, which are indicated by the symbol*.

These summary consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2016 have been audited by KPMG Inc
and Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified opinion
thereon. The auditors also expressed an unmodified opinion
on the consolidated financial statements from which these
summary consolidated financial statements were derived.

A copy of the auditors' report on the summary consolidated
financial statements and of the auditors' report on the
consolidated financial statements are available for inspection
at the company's registered office, together with the
consolidated financial statements identified in the respective
auditors' reports.

The auditors' report does not necessarily report on all of the
information contained in the 2016 year-end results booklet
and SENS announcement. Shareholders are therefore
advised that, to obtain a full understanding of the nature of
the auditors' engagement, they should obtain a copy of the
auditors' report, together with the accompanying financial
statements, from Nedbank Group's registered office.

Forward-looking statements
This announcement contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the financial condition and results
of operations of Nedbank Group and its group companies
that, by their nature, involve risk and uncertainty because
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may
or may not occur in the future. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include global, national and regional
economic conditions; levels of securities markets; interest
rates; exchange rates; credit or other risks of lending and
investment activities; as well as competitive and regulatory
factors. By consequence, all forward-looking statements have
not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.

Final-dividend declaration
Notice is hereby given that a final dividend of 630 cents per
ordinary share has been declared, payable to shareholders for
the year ended 31 December 2016. The dividend has been
declared out of income reserves.

The dividend will be subject to a dividend withholding tax rate
of 20% (applicable in SA) or 126 cents per ordinary share,
resulting in a net dividend of 504 cents per ordinary share,
unless the shareholder is exempt from paying dividend tax or
is entitled to a reduced rate in terms of an applicable double-
tax agreement. In 2015 and 2016, the dividend withholding
tax rate was 15% and this increased to 20% on
22 February 2017.

Nedbank Group's tax reference number is 9375/082/71/7 and
the number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of
declaration is 495 865 721.

Fair-value hierarchy

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the definition of fair value is an
assumption that an entity is a going concern without any intention or need to liquidate, to curtail materially the scale of its
operations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not, therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or
pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where they exist, they
are used to measure the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if transactions occur with sufficient
volumes and frequencies to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. These quoted prices would generally be classified as
level 1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial instrument is not
active, the group establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques include reference to the current
fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same in nature, reference to the value of the assets of underlying business,
earnings multiples, discounted-cashflow analysis and various option pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would
generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy. The determination of whether an instrument is
classified as level 2 or level 3 is dependent on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs in relation to the fair
value of the instrument. Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility,
servicing costs, equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.
The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review protocols for
the independent review and validation of fair values separate from the business unit entering into the transaction. The valuation
methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to the fair-value measurement of the financial instruments have been applied in a
manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY
The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) fair-value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based on (directly or indirectly) market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the availability of
observable inputs. These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the
relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market, the maturity of market
modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is based on inputs
that are not market-observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of the best information available and
may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities, appropriate proxies or other analytical techniques.

All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE ASSUMPTIONS TO REASONABLE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES
The fair-value measurement of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that include assumptions that are not market-observable. Where
these scenarios apply, the group performs stress testing on the fair value of the relevant instruments. In performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the unobservable-input
parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with the group's approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to
illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable-input parameters and which are
classified as level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. However, the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value for which fair value is disclosed
Certain financial instruments of the group are not carried at fair value, including those categorised as held to maturity, loans and
receivables and financial liabilities at amortised cost. The calculation of the fair value of these financial instruments incorporates the
group's best estimate of the value at which these financial assets could be exchanged, or financial liabilities could be transferred,
between market participants at the measurement date. The group's estimate of what fair value is does not necessarily represent the
amount for which the group would be able to sell the asset or transfer the respective financial liability in an involuntary liquidation or
distressed sale.

The fair values of these respective financial instruments at the reporting date detailed below are estimated only for the purpose of
IFRS disclosure, as follows:

There has been no significant changes in the methodolgy used to estimate the fair value of the above instruments during the year.

LOANS AND ADVANCES
Loans and advances that are not recognised at fair value principally comprise variable-rate financial assets. The interest rates on
these variable rate-financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.

Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value of these
loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs. Due to the unique characteristics of the loans and advances
portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposals of such loans and advances, there is no
basis to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an orderly transaction. The group is not currently
in the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and
advances on a forced-sale basis.

For specifically impaired loans and advances the carrying value as determined after consideration of the group's IAS 39 credit
impairments is considered the best estimate of fair value.

The group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing loans and
advances measured at amortised cost. This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected monthly cashflows
per product type. Future cashflows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be granted to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and maturities. Methodologies and models are updated on a continuous basis for changes in assumptions,
forecasts and modelling techniques. Future forecasts of the group's probability of default (PDs) and loss given defaults (LGDs) for
periods 2017 to 2019 (2015: for periods 2016 to 2018) are based on the latest available internal data and is applied to the first three
years' projected cashflows. Thereafter, PDs and LGDs are gradually reverted to their long-run averages and are applied to the
remaining projected cashflows. Inputs into the model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances. The
determination of such inputs is highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a
significant change in the determination of the fair value of loans and advances.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER SECURITIES
The fair value of government and other securities is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted cashflow
analysis (level 2), where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES
The fair value of other short-term securities is determined using a discounted cashflow analysis (level 2).

LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of long-term debt instruments is determined based on available market prices (level 1) or discounted cashflow analysis
(level 2) where an instrument is not quoted or the market is considered to be inactive.

AMOUNTS OWED TO DEPOSITORS
The amounts owed to depositors principally comprise of variable-rate liabilities. The carrying value of the amounts owed to
depositors approximates fair value because the instruments reprice to current market rates at frequent intervals. In addition, a
significant portion of the balance is callable or is short term in nature.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER ASSETS, MANDATORY DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS, AND
PROVISIONS AND OTHER LIABILITIES
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, mandatory deposits with central banks and provisions and other
liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short term in nature or are
repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.

PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY
RATIOS AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2016

BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY

In terms of the requirements under Regulation 43(1)(e)(iii) of the regulations relating to banks and Directive 4/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of the Banks
Act (Act No. 94 of 1990), minimum disclosure on the capital adequacy of the group and its leverage ratio is required on a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in
accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III accord.

Both the group and the bank remain well capitalised at levels significantly above the minimum regulatory requirements. The common equity tier 1 ratios of 11,5%
and 10,9%, respectively is reflective of organic capital generation, movements in risk weighted assets and the payment of interim dividends in September 2016.
The tier 1 ratios benefitted from the issuance of R1,5bn of new style additional tier 1 capital in May 2016. The group’s total capital ratio was positively impacted by
the issuance of R2,0bn of new style tier 2 capital in September 2016.

The following table sets out the regulatory capital as at 30 September 2016:
                                                                                   Nedbank Group                                     Nedbank Limited

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)
In accordance with the provisions of section 6(6) of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed, to comply with the relevant
LCR disclosure requirements, as set out in Directive 6/2014 and Directive 11/2014.

The LCR aims to ensure that a bank holds an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover total Net Cash
Outflows over a 30-day period under a prescribed stress scenario. Based on the final revisions announced by the Basel Committee in January
2013, the LCR is being phased-in starting at 60% on 1 January 2015 and increasing by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.

The LCR for Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited are well above minimum regulatory requirements. These are set out in the following table:

NEDBANK GROUP – CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS 2016

COMMENTARY

NEDBANK GROUP LTD

Condensed consolidated interim financial results for the six months ended 30
June 2016

- Headline earnings growth of 2,0% – excluding ETI, headline earnings growth was
  20,1%
- Diluted headline earnings per share increased 1,6% to 1 119 cents – excluding
  ETI, diluted headline earnings per share grew 19,7%
- Ongoing selective origination and strong collections focus leading to a high-
  quality advances book and credit losses remaining below expectations at 67bps
- Return on equity (excluding goodwill) of 15,7% and 18,4%, excluding ETI
- Common-equity tier 1 ratio increased to 11,6%
- Net asset value per share up by 9,7%
- Interim dividend per share up 6,1% to 570 cents

'Nedbank Group's managed operations, excluding Ecobank Transnational
Incorporated (ETI), produced a very strong performance for the first six months of the
year. Headline earnings growth was underpinned by strong revenue generation and
an improved credit loss ratio of 67 basis points, while strengthening our portfolio
impairment coverage ratios.

Our focus on growing our transactional banking franchise continues to unlock
benefits. The integration of our CIB Cluster last year resulted in an enhanced client
offering, which increased cross-sell activities. Our RBB Cluster made good progress
in gaining clients through its innovative digital and other offerings, resulting in an
increase of 7,3% in main-banked clients and an increase in the ROE from 15,9% to
18,3%. Our Wealth Cluster grew earnings strongly, with good performances from
Private Wealth, Asset Management and Insurance.

Strong growth from our managed operations in SA was offset by a weak performance
in the Rest of Africa and, in particular, the impact of equity accounting in Nedbank's
first quarter (Q1) 2016 associate income for our share of ETI's loss in its fourth
quarter (Q4) 2015, as we have already reported on in our Q1 2016 performance
update in May. ETI continues to navigate a difficult operating environment, and
following its comprehensive review of processes and portfolios, which led to elevated
impairment charges in Q4 2015, ETI has produced a much-improved performance in
Q1. We believe in the long-term growth potential of the Rest of Africa and remain
supportive of ETI's management and board in their strategy to enhance the focus of
the business on delivering an ROE ahead of its COE.

Our guidance for organic growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2016
remains unchanged. We continue to expect positive growth in this metric, albeit that
in the current economic environment this is expected to be lower than the growth we
achieved in 2015 and below our medium-to-long-term target of the consumer price
index plus GDP growth plus 5%.'

Mike Brown
Chief Executive

Banking and economic environment
The global economic environment remains under pressure. Expectations earlier in
the year of an economic recovery and interest rate normalisation in the US have
softened. The UK's vote to leave the European Union (EU) has triggered increased
volatility across markets and added further uncertainty to a fragile economic
environment in the UK and Eurozone. These factors have led to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) downgrading its 2016 global real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth forecast to 3,1% from 3,8% a year ago. Given continued economic pressures
in developed economies and low economic growth in China, there remains downside
risk for commodity-driven economies, although prices have stabilised since the
beginning of the year. The IMF has also downgraded the GDP growth forecast for the
sub-Saharan Africa region to 1,6%, from 5,1% in July 2015.

The South African economy deteriorated in 2016 off an already low 2015 base. The
GDP contraction of 1,2% in the first quarter of 2016 was largely driven by the sharp
declines in mining and agriculture output, as well as lower export levels despite the
weak rand. Lower levels of consumer spending and private sector fixed investment in
addition to rising inflation further contributed to the economic slowdown.

The reaffirmation of SA's sovereign risk ratings at an investment grade of Baa2 by
Moody's Investor Service and BBB- by Standard and Poor's was a positive outcome
of the work done by government, business and labour in the first six months of the
year. Both rating agencies maintained a negative outlook, reflecting the potential
adverse consequences of low GDP growth and signalling that SA ratings could be
lowered if policy measures are not instituted to be more supportive of inclusive
growth. Fitch's rating, although revised down to BBB- from BBB with a stable outlook,
also remained above investment grade. These ratings acknowledge the fiscal
consolidation achieved; the 2016/17 budget and medium-term plan to reduce
government debt; the underlying strength of SA's institutions; as well as the structural
and legislative reforms that the SA government, businesses and labour have been
working on together to restore confidence in the country to encourage private sector
investment and higher levels of inclusive growth in the economy. Evidence of delivery
on these plans will be needed before December 2016 to prevent any downgrade at
the next round of ratings reviews.

Review of results
Nedbank Group produced headline earnings of R5 427m(1), an increase of 2,0%(1) for
the six months ended 30 June 2016 ('the period'). This earnings growth was
underpinned by strong net interest income (NII) and non-interest revenue (NIR)
growth, as well as impairments remaining below the midpoint of our through-the-
cycle target range.

Headline earnings includes a loss in associate income of R446m(1) (June 2015:
R426m profit) relating to our 21,8%(1) share of the Q4 2015 loss of USD199m and
Q1 2016 profit of USD71m in ETI. Associate income from ETI is equity-accounted
one quarter in arrear using ETI's publicly disclosed results. Excluding both the loss in
associate income of R446m(1) and funding costs of R157m relating to ETI, headline
earnings from Nedbank Group’s managed operations for the period grew strongly by
20,1% to R6 030m.

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) increased 1,6%(1) to 1 119 cents(1) (June
2015: 1 101 cents) and headline earnings per share (HEPS) grew by 0,6%(1) to 1 135
cents(1) (June 2015: 1 128 cents). Excluding ETI, DHEPS was up 19,7% and HEPS
was up 18,7%.

Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (ROE), excluding goodwill, of 15,7%
(June 2015: 17,3%) and ROE of 14,6% (June 2015: 16,0%), reflect a lower return on
assets (ROA) of 1,19% (June 2015: 1,28%) resulting from the above loss in equity-
accounted earnings from ETI. Excluding ETI, the ROA was 1,32%. Our economic
profit decreased to R408m (June 2015: R1 328m), largely as a function of the impact
of ETI and the group's cost of equity (COE) increasing to 14,4% (monthly average for
the period) from 13,0%. This follows the increase in the SA long-bond yield earlier in
the year. In more recent months the SA long-bond rate and our COE have decreased
from their peak in December 2015.

Our Basel III common-equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio improved to 11,6% (December 2015:
11,3%) and remained within our Basel III 2019 internal target range, reflecting a well-
capitalised balance sheet. Our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 93,1% for the second
quarter of 2016 (December 2015: 88,5%) is above the regulatory requirements of
70% for 2016 and incorporates an appropriately sized buffer for volatility in this ratio.
The group's portfolio of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) and other sources of quick
liquidity amounted to R167,7bn (December 2015: R160,7bn).

Delivering sustainably to all our stakeholders in the period
Nedbank Group is committed to creating long-term value for all our stakeholders, as
embodied in our vision to be Africa's most admired bank by our staff, clients,
shareholders, regulators and communities:

For staff – creating 1 176 new permanent-employment opportunities, mainly in our
regulatory change programme support areas and in the Rest of Africa; investing
R127m in training, with more than 3 739 staff participating in learning interventions;
and supporting 61 external bursars across 15 universities and 413 learners across
our learnership programmes during the period. Nedbank's leading position as a top
empowerment company in the financial services sector and a leader of
transformational change in SA was recognised at the 15th annual Oliver
Empowerment Awards where we were honoured as Legend of Empowerment and
Transformation.

For clients – providing innovative offerings and improving client access by rolling out
an additional 93 Intelligent Depositor ATMs and 8 060 new point-of-sale devices, and
converting a further 75 branches to smaller and more digitally focused branches of
the future since June 2015. Retail main-banked clients increased 7,3% and digitally
enabled clients by 26%, with digitally active clients increasing by 29% and driving up
the value of Nedbank App Suite™ transactions by 58,0% to R10,5bn. IT system
stability was maintained at exceptionally high levels, with no major severity incidents.
In June 2016 we processed 1,4bn transactions, our highest ever in a single month in
the first half of the year. We advanced R74,8bn (June 2015: R88,5bn) of new loans
to clients. Assets under management grew by 9,8%(1) to R256,3bn(1) (June 2015:
R233,5bn) as Nedgroup Investments continued to deliver excellent investment
performance, remaining among the top three in the quarterly PlexCrown Unit Trust
Survey over seven years, including maintaining our top position in the offshore
category and achieving second place in the domestic category. In addition, Nedbank
Private Wealth ranked third overall in the 2016 SA's Top Private Banks and Wealth
Managers Survey and achieved first place in the entrepreneur category.

For shareholders – growing net asset value per share by 9,7%(1) to 15 826 cents(1)
(June 2015: 14 428 cents); delivering EP of R408m; and increasing the interim
dividend by 6,1%. Engaging constructively with shareholders during our third annual
governance roadshow, resulting in all resolutions being passed with more than
90% votes of approval at our 49th annual general meeting. Ensuring transparent,
relevant and timeous reporting, and disclosure to shareholders as acknowledged by
Nedbank's ranking in the top quartile of JSE-listed companies by Nkonki and
Chartered Secretaries.

For regulators – maintaining full compliance with Basel III phase-in requirements,
achieving an improved CET1 ratio of 11,6%, an average long-term funding ratio of
30,9% and an average LCR ratio of 93,1% in the second quarter; making cash
taxation contributions of R4,6bn relating to direct, indirect, pay-as-you-earn and other
taxation; maintaining transparent relationships and working closely with all regulators
to ensure efficient delivery of the various regulatory programmes and achieving anti-
money-laundering remediation of high-risk clients by the planned due dates.

For communities – supporting local businesses and the SA economy, purchasing
76% of our procurement spend locally and winning the Best Supplier and Enterprise
Development Project Award in recognition of our support of local small and medium
enterprises (SMEs). Advancing R27,6bn in new loans to retail clients, contributing
R564m to socioeconomic development since 2011 and investing R100m over three
years with our black business partners, Wiphold, Brimstone and Izingwe, in initiatives
aligned with the Financial Sector Code and National Development Plan, seeking to
create sustainable, self-funding opportunities. Our Fair Share 2030 strategy enabled
more than R1bn of new lending to support student accommodation and embedded
energy in the commercial and farming sectors. This is in addition to our investment in
sustainable development such as renewable-energy lending and support for green
buildings. We have committed R35bn towards renewable-energy deals, of which
R11,4bn has been disbursed to date. Our pipeline for the funding of green buildings
continues to grow with more than R5bn committed over the next two years. We have
maintained our level 2 broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE)
contributor status for the seventh consecutive year.

Cluster financial performance
Our Corporate Investment Banking (CIB), Retail and Business Banking (RBB) and
Wealth Clusters generated headline earnings growth of 16,6%(1) to R5 989m(1) (June
2015: R5 136m) and delivered an ROE of 20,8%. Rest of Africa's headline earnings
was impacted by our 21,8%(1) share of the Q4 2015 losses in ETI.

Nedbank CIB's integrated franchise achieved excellent headline earnings growth of
20,9%(1), driven by good cross-sell and client flows, particularly in the global markets
business. This was reflected in robust revenue growth as well as in an improvement
in impairments.

Nedbank RBB generated strong earnings growth and an ongoing ROE improvement
to 18,3%, now well in excess of the group's COE of 14,4%. This was underpinned by
strong NII and NIR growth and a strong performance in credit risk management and
collections while increasing portfolio provisions.

Nedbank Wealth produced good earnings growth at an attractive ROE. These results
were underpinned by strong balance sheet growth and continued low levels of
impairments in Wealth Management. Despite market volatility, assets under
management increased 9,8%(1). Higher sales of single-premium investment products
supported Insurance earnings growth.

Rest of Africa's earnings were largely impacted by our 21,8%(1) share of the Q4 2015
losses in ETI that amounted to R676m, reflected as a loss in associate income. Our
subsidiaries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) grew headline
earnings by 32,5% to R53m (June 2015: R40m) off a low base, mostly from lower
head office costs and improved impairments, offset by lower transactional volumes
and continued investment in staff, systems, distribution channels and regulatory
compliance.

The decrease in losses in the Centre was largely due to a portfolio impairment
reversal of R150m(1) and changes in internal capital allocation.

Financial performance

Net interest income
Strong NII growth of 11,6%(1) to R13 028m(1) (June 2015: R11 675m) was underpinned
by growth in average interest-earning banking assets of 10,9% and slight net interest
margin (NIM) expansion to 3,37% (June 2015: 3,36%). In December the NIM was
3,30%.

The NIM improved 21 basis points (bps) from the combined benefit of endowment
income of 15 bps, as average interest rates increased by 107 bps during the period,
and improved asset pricing of 6 bps. This was partially offset by margin compression
of 21 bps, comprised of an advances mix change of 13 bps as lower-margin
wholesale advances continued to grow faster than higher-margin retail advances;
and a further compression of 8 bps due to Basel III compliance costs related to
higher funding costs for transitioning to net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirements
and holding higher levels of low-yielding HQLA for increasing LCR requirements.

Impairments charge on loans and advances
Impairments declined 4,2%(1) to R2 211m(1) (June 2015: R2 307m) and the credit loss
ratio (CLR) improved to 0,67% (June 2015: 0,77%) due to a lower specific
impairments charge of 0,64% (June 2015: 0,73%) while the portfolio impairments
charge for the period remained similar at 0,03% (June 2015: 0,04%).

The CLR includes the release of R150m(1) from central provisions raised in the second
half of 2015. Excluding this release, the CLR was 0,72%. The improvement in CIB's
impairments was driven by a combination of oil and commodity prices stabilising at
higher levels, as well as the successful settlement or restructuring of certain counters
during the period. RBB's CLR remained below the lower end of its target range due
to reduced impairments in Personal Loans and in Business Banking. Postwriteoff
recoveries increased to R564m (June 2015: R520m), of which R196m (June 2015:
R196m) was attributable to Personal Loans.

Total defaulted advances increased to R18 437m (June 2015: R16 695m),
representing 2,6% of advances (June 2015: 2,5%). The increase was largely as a
result of certain wholesale counters within the stressed sectors of the economy and
the seasonal effects in Home Loans, MFC and Card. South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) directive 7/15, which was implemented in the second half of 2015 and
requires that distressed restructures be classified as defaulted advances for a
minimum period of six months after being restructured, contributed to the increase in
defaulted advances. Excluding the effect of directive 7/15, defaulted advances were
R15 397m.

The total coverage ratio decreased to 62,6% (June 2015: 65,9%), driven by a lower
specific coverage of 36,2% (June 2015: 39,6%) largely as a result of the impact of
directive 7/15 and partial writeoffs in CIB as well as the abovementioned
improvement in impairments. CIB-specific coverage is determined on a deal-by-deal
basis. Wholesale advances are generally secured with collateral and we hold deep
security pools against our commercial property finance portfolio, resulting in relatively
lower-loss expectations in the event of default and, accordingly, lower specific
impairments and coverage levels.

The portfolio coverage ratio increased to 0,71% (June 2015: 0,68%). Additional
overlays in Retail increased to R701m (June 2015: R441m) and central portfolio
provisions were R350m (June 2015: R350m) to take account of risks, including in
commodities and in the rest of Africa, that have been incurred but have not yet
emerged. In December 2015 our overlays were at R699m in RBB and the central
portfolio provisions were R500m.

Non-interest revenue
NIR grew 8,7%(1) to R11 357m(1) (June 2015: R10 450m), primarily driven by:
- Commission and fee income growth of 9,1% to R8 185m (June 2015: R7 499m),
  supported by quality-client gains, an increased focus on cross-sell leading to
  good main-banked client conversion, together with below-inflation annual fee
  increases in RBB in January 2016.
- Insurance income increasing 12,9% to R921m (June 2015: R816m), led by good
  growth in single-premium income, partly offset by higher weather-related claims.
- Trading income growth of 5,0% to R1 771m (June 2015: R1 686m) off a high
  2015 base, following increased market volatility and improved cross-sell in CIB.
- Private-equity income increasing to R432m (June 2015: R250m), largely from
  property private equity gains, the majority of which were realised.

Expenses
Expenses continue to be managed within expectations and increased 8,8%(1) to
R13 686m(1) (June 2015: R12 578m), mainly as a result of -
-  Staff-related costs increasing 7,5%, consisting of -
   -  8,8% growth in remuneration and other staff costs, driven by a 6,3% average
      annual salary increase and additional staff hires, mainly for regulatory change
      programmes; and
   -  a 1,7% combined increase in short-term and long-term incentives, aligned
      with the group's performance.
-   Computer processing costs up 18,8% to R1 985m, including amortisation costs
    increasing 11,1% to R400m following the capitalisation of equipment for
    distribution and reformatting of branches and an increase in IT project costs.
-   Fees and insurance costs being 11,2% higher at R1 381m following increased
    volumes of revenue-generating activities such as cash handling and card issuing
    and acquiring.
-   Occupation and accommodation costs growing 8,1% to R1 098m relating to
    regional consolidation and ongoing investment in distribution.

The group's growth in operating income of 11,9%(1) exceeded growth in expenses.
However, including the loss from ETI in associate income, the jaws ratio was -2,6%(1)
(June 2015: 1,3%). Excluding ETI, the jaws ratio was 1,6%. The efficiency ratio
increased to 57,1%(1) (June 2015: 55,8%) and, excluding ETI, this metric improved to
55,6% (June 2015: 56,4%).

Associate income
Associate income declined to a negative R431m(1) (June 2015: R436m profit). This
mainly comprised the equity accounting of our 21,8% share of ETI's Q4 2015 loss of
R676m and Q1 2016 profit of R230m, in line with our policy of accounting for ETI
earnings a quarter in arrear. The total headline earnings impact of ETI in the period
was a negative R603m, including the R157m impact of funding costs, offset by
endowment on allocated capital.

Statement of financial position
Capital
The group remains strongly capitalised and operates well within our Basel III 2019
capital adequacy targets. The CET1 ratio improved to 11,6% from the 11,3%
reported at the 2015 year-end, largely due to lower credit risk-weighted assets
(RWA). This resulted from improved credit parameters across certain wholesale
portfolios and RWA optimisation initiatives within certain retail portfolios.

Our tier 1 and total capital ratios further reflect the effects of the issuance of a new-
style (Basel III-compliant) additional tier 1 capital instrument of R1,5bn in May 2016,
in line with the group's capital plan.

Funding and liquidity
Nedbank Group maintained a strong funding profile and liquidity position,
underpinned by a significant quantum of long-term funding, a large surplus liquid-
asset buffer, a strong loan-to-deposit ratio that was consistently below 100% and a
low reliance on interbank and foreign-currency funding.

At June 2016 the group's quarterly average LCR of 93,1% (December 2015: 88,5%)
exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of 70%, as a buffer of a minimum of
10,0% is maintained to ensure daily compliance given the volatility of flows. The
group will continue to position proactively for the phase-in period as the LCR
requirement increases by 10% per annum to 100% by 1 January 2019.

Nedbank's portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA increased to R127,1bn (December
2015: quarterly average R118,0bn). Together with our portfolio of quick-liquidity
sources, the total available quick liquidity amounted to R167,7bn (December 2015:
R160,7bn), representing 17,8% of total assets.

We also maintained a strong, well-diversified funding profile. Our three-month
average long-term funding ratio of 30,9% for the second quarter of 2016 (December
2015: quarterly average of 28,7%) represents a slightly more conservative funding
profile than the last reported industry average. The strong funding profile was
supported by growth in Nedbank Retail Savings Bonds of R2,0bn to R16,4bn and
Nedbank having successfully issued R8,8bn in senior unsecured debt in the first half
of 2016.

Following the finalisation of the NSFR calibration in October 2014, the SARB
released a directive on 18 November 2015 increasing the available stable funding
factor applicable to wholesale deposits in the 0-to-6-month bucket from 0% to 35% to
better reflect the stability of these deposits in the SA context. This directive positions
all SA banks favourably to achieve NSFR compliance from the effective date of 1
January 2018.

Loans and advances
Loans and advances increased by 6,9%(1) to R693,3bn(1) (June 2015: R648,8bn),
largely underpinned by growth in banking advances of 8,6%.

Loans and advances by cluster are as follows:

Advances growth in CIB was mostly from term loans increasing 12,5% and
commercial-mortgage advances growing 9,7%. This was led by the drawdown on
existing deals in investment banking and commercial property finance. The decline in
trading advances relates to a decrease in USD-denominated loans during the period.

Growth in RBB's advances was led by the increase of 7,2% in MFC and of 3,8% in
Personal Loans, while Card grew 2,8%. Home Loans increased by 2,1%, with growth
in new-asset payouts partially offset by the rolloff of the backbook. Since December
2015 total loans and advances have grown by an annualised 3,5%

Deposits
Deposits grew 7,4%(1) to R741,7bn(1) (June 2015: R690,5bn), underpinned by deposit
growth in RBB of 12,2% to R256,7bn. The loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 93,5%
(December 2015: 93,9%).

Increasing household and commercial liabilities remains a priority for the group.
Our strategy of growing our transactional banking franchise continued to gain traction,
as reflected in our household deposit market share increasing to 18,7% in May 2016,
from 18,4% in December 2015, supported by market share gains in current accounts
to 19,0% in May 2016 (June 2015: 18,0%). Our current accounts increased 8,4% and
savings accounts by 19,4%, and cash management deposits grew 6,2%. Since
December 2015 total deposits grew by an annualised 4,4%.

Group strategic focus
Good progress continued to be made in our current five key strategic focus areas,
positioning us well in the tough macroeconomic environment:

-   Client-centred innovation: We are in the process of delivering a new digital
    platform with a user-centred design approach that focuses on creating a leading
    digital client experience. We launched the competitive Nedbank Pay-as-you-use
    Account and MyPocket, a savings pocket linked to transactional accounts and
    providing immediate access to cash. We also deployed LOTTO Plus on
    nedbank.co.za and implemented standalone prepaids for airtime, SMS bundles,
    data bundles and prepaid electricity. A cash advance solution, Nedbank GAP
    Access™, was launched, allowing merchants to grow their business off the back
    of their transactional flows. In addition, Nedbank Card and Payments is rolling out
    mobile payment solutions to consumers in partnership with MasterCard®, using
    the innovative MasterPass™ mobile payments platform. In 2016 we issued our
    contactless cards, which incorporate tap-and-go card acceptances and
    transaction banking. Digitally enabled retail clients increased 26% and digitally
    active clients increased 29%, which drove up the value of Nedbank App Suite™
    transactions by 58% to R10,5bn. Client satisfaction levels of our banking app
    increased to 81,3%. The app is now ranked second in the market in the annual
    South African Customer Satisfaction Index for 2015, which is compiled by
    Consulta. To date we have converted 272 outlets, to branches of the future,
    representing 39% of the total and plan to have 56% of all outlets converted by
    2017. These outlets are smaller and more effective than traditional branches.

-   Growing our transactional banking franchise: Nedbank's retail franchise
    attracted 7,3% additional main-banked clients, increasing to a total of 2,7m and
    translating into 9,4% retail transactional NIR growth. Altogether 71,6% of the
    retail main-banked client base have more than two other products (up from 70,9%
    in the prior year). Our transactional banking progress was reflected in market
    share gains in household and transactional deposits to 18,7% and 21,9%
    respectively. Our brand value and client relationships strengthened further, as
    reflected in the Nedbank Brand Tracker results, the Consulta annual retail
    reputational Net Promotor Score (NPS), which improved to 21%, and our South
    African Customer Satisfaction Index score, which increased to 74%. We
    continued to maintain high levels of full-service recovery and remain ranked first
    among the banks in respect of the hellopeter.com index.

-   Optimise and invest: Cost discipline remains an imperative, with ongoing
    initiatives such as our strategy to decrease the number of core systems from
    250 to 60, of which 84 have been decommissioned to date and a further six are
    targeted for 2016; the elimination of duplicative processes; the reduction in the
    cost to serve and acquire clients; as well as the reduction of our branch space by
    25 000 m2, of which 15 965 m2 has already been saved. We relocated and
    consolidated offices, with approximately 6 000 employees relocated on
    completion of the Newtown and Lakeview Campuses in Johannesburg. This
    saved 10 000 m² of space, reducing our office vacancy ratio to worldclass levels
    of below 4%. Efficiencies continued to be generated from the integration within
    RBB and CIB. We remain on track for delivery by the Old Mutual Group of the full
    target of R1bn of pretax run rate synergies in 2017, of which approximately 30%
    should accrue to Nedbank.

-   Strategic portfolio tilt: We maintained our focus on growing activities that
    generate EP, such as transactional deposits with current and savings accounts
    up 11,6%, transactional banking activity with commission and fees up 9,1%, and
    earnings growth of 20,9% in CIB and 18,3% in Nedbank Wealth. Our selective
    origination of personal loans, home loans and commercial property finance has
    proactively limited downside risk in this challenging operating climate, enabling a
    CLR of 67 bps, below the midpoint of our through-the-cycle range. At the same
    time our balance sheet metrics remain strong and we continue to deliver dividend
    growth.

-   Pan-African banking network: The macroeconomic environment in the rest of
    Africa remains challenging due to slowing economic growth, foreign exchange
    and liquidity shortages, and increasing regulatory pressure across a number of
    jurisdictions.
    -    In Central and West Africa, since the establishment of our alliance with
         Ecobank, 183 accounts have been opened in 24 countries for 76 of our
         wholesale clients that bank with Ecobank. We work closely with Ecobank on
         joint pipeline deals in the power and infrastructure sectors, and opportunities
         in trade and commodity finance. At 30 June 2016 the carrying value of our
         long-term strategic investment in ETI was R6,0bn(1) and the market value
         based on ETI's share price, albeit in largely illiquid markets, was R4,3bn.
         A value-in-use test was performed to assess the carrying value for
         impairment. The value in use, while having decreased from December 2015,
         still exceeds the carrying value, and as a result there was no requirement to
         impair our investment. We will continue to assess the indicators of
         impairment in future reporting periods. In the event of an impairment this
         would fall outside of headline earnings and have an immaterial impact on
         regulatory capital.

    -    In SADC and East Africa we successfully implemented our Flexcube core
         banking system in Namibia and Swaziland, and we continued to launch new
         products and grow our distribution footprint. Our shareholding in Banco
         Único will be increased by 11% to 50% plus one share during the second
         half of 2016 to progress the transaction consummated in 2014. This will cost
         approximately R112m.

    Despite these macroeconomic challenges, we believe in the long-term growth
    potential of Africa and we remain confident of our strategy and investments in
    the rest of Africa. We continue to support ETI as our partner in Central and West
    Africa. ETI is a strategic investment for the group, providing our clients with a
    pan-African transactional banking network across 39 countries. Our expectation
    is that ETI will generate an ROE in excess of its COE in the medium-to-long-
    term, and our 21,8%(1) shareholding continues to offer our shareholders the
    opportunity to participate in this growth over time.

Old Mutual plc managed separation
A further update on the managed separation was provided on 28 June 2016, with
Old Mutual plc (OM) stating that, following the creation of a new SA holding
company, it intends to distribute, in an orderly manner, a significant proportion of the
group's shareholding in Nedbank to the shareholders on the register of the new SA
holding company at that time, leaving Old Mutual Emerging Markets (OMEM) as the
principal business in the group. Through its ownership of Old Mutual Life Assurance
Company South Africa the new SA group will retain an appropriate strategic minority
stake in Nedbank, with the exact level still to be determined together with Nedbank
based on OMEM's commercial relationship with Nedbank and influenced by the
implications of the incoming Twin Peaks regulation. The boards of directors and
management teams of OM and Nedbank continue to work closely together on the
managed separation. Shareholders are referred to the OM and Nedbank Group
SENS announcements released on 28 June 2016 for further details on the managed
separation.

Economic outlook
The local economy is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of 2016.
Rising domestic inflation and the increase in interest rates earlier this year are
expected to contain consumer spending. The global economy is also likely to remain
generally unsupportive of growth, complicated further by the UK's vote to leave the
EU and growing tensions in some key emerging economies. Given the sharper-than-
expected decline in SA's GDP in the first quarter, stronger and more consistent
growth is needed over the next three quarters to produce a favourable outcome for
2016. The SA economy is currently expected to contract by 0,1% in 2016 with risk
remaining to the downside.

Interest rates are currently anticipated to increase by a further 25 bps, compared with
earlier projections of a further 50 bps increase, resulting in a cumulative 100 bps
increase for 2016. This is largely due to expectations that global uncertainties
following the 'Brexit' vote will lead to a delay in the normalisation of US monetary
policy, that core inflation in SA will breach 6% only in the fourth quarter of 2016, that
SA's investment grade ratings in the June reviews will be maintained, and that the
rand will be steadier, boosted by the global search for yield.

Corporate credit demand will continue to be affected by softer global demand, weak
commodity prices, rising domestic production costs and limited infrastructure,
offsetting the competitive benefit of a weaker rand. Restructuring is anticipated to
continue as a result, with lower capital expenditure and retrenchments taking place in
the private sector.

Consequently, household credit demand will remain weak, impacted by the weak job
market, softer income growth and increasing levels of consumer indebtedness due to
rising cost pressures from food inflation and higher fuel prices contributing to rising
debt service costs.

Consumption expenditure by general government will be boosted by election-related
spending in the short term and public sector investment in infrastructure and
development projects in the medium term.

Prospects
Our guidance on financial performance for the full year is now as follows:
-   Average advances to grow at mid-to-upper single digits.
-   NIM to be slightly above the 2015 level of 3,30%.
-   CLR to be below the midpoint of our target range of 60 bps to 100 bps.
-   NIR (excluding fair-value adjustments) to grow above mid-single digits.
-   Expenses to increase by mid-to-upper single digits.

Our financial guidance for organic growth in diluted HEPS in 2016 and our medium-
to-long-term targets remain unchanged. We expect growth in diluted HEPS in 2016
to be positive, but lower than the growth achieved in 2015 and below our medium-to-
long-term target of consumer price index plus GDP growth plus 5%. The outlook for
our medium-to-long-term targets in 2016 is as follows:

Events after the reporting period(1)
Following our reporting date on 30 June 2016, the Nigerian naira continued to
depreciate against the dollar and the market value of the group's investment in ETI
based on its quoted share price in a thinly-traded market has decreased further.
These events are not indicative of conditions that existed at our reporting date on 30
June 2016. The group will continue to monitor developments and their possible
impact on the value in use of our ETI investment and any possible impairment to our
carrying value in the second half of 2016.

Reviewed condensed consolidated interim financial statements – independent
auditors' conclusion
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended 30

A copy of the auditors' review report on the condensed consolidated interim financial
statements is available for inspection at the company's registered office, together
with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements identified in the
auditors' review report.

Forward-looking statements
This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the
financial condition and results of operations of Nedbank Group and its group

events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include global, national and regional economic conditions; levels
of securities markets; interest rates; credit or other risks of lending and investment
activities; as well as competitive and regulatory factors. By consequence, all forward-
looking statements have not been reviewed or reported on by the group's auditors.

During 2015 the Nedbank Corporate and Nedbank Capital clusters were merged to form the Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking Cluster. Similarly,
the Nedbank Retail and Nedbank Business Banking clusters were merged to form the Nedbank Retail and Business Banking Cluster.

The comparative segment information previously presented for Nedbank Corporate, Nedbank Capital, Nedbank Retail and Nedbank Business Banking has
been represented based on the new merged clusters. This had the consequential effect that certain intergroup assets and liabilities and the related
eliminations between Nedbank Retail and Business Banking and the Centre have been restated.

The group, in the normal course of business, enters into transactions that expose it to tax, legal and business risks. Provisions are made for known liabilities
that are expected to materialise. Possible obligations and known liabilities where no reliable estimate can be made or it is considered improbable that an
outflow would result, are reported as contingent liabilities. This is in accordance with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Ltd and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at present.

Key assumptions concerning the future and key sources of estimation

The market value of the group’s investment in ETI based on its quoted share price (a thinly-traded share) is below its carrying value, and this decline is
significant and prolonged, which represents evidence of an impairment indicator at 30 June 2016. Where an impairment indicator exists, an impairment
test compares the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal (fair value) or its value in use (VIU) and the carrying value of the investment. In respect of
ETI, the VIU calculation is higher than the fair value calculation. If the VIU amount is lower than the carrying value, the carrying value needs to be impaired
to the VIU amount, with any resulting impairment loss reported within non-trading and capital items. There would be no impact on the group's regulatory
capital unless any impairment exceeds R3,3bn. ETI’s VIU calculation at 30 June 2016 exceeds the carrying value and no impairment loss has therefore
been recognised. The VIU calculation will be revisited at 31 December 2016, taking into account publically available information and any changes to
key assumptions.

On 27 July 2016 the market value of the group’s investment in ETI based on its quoted share price was R3,2bn. Management is not aware of any adjusting
events after the reporting period, and continues to monitor developments and the possible impact on the VIU calculation for the second half of 2016.

Fair-value hierarchy

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the definition of fair value is an assumption that an entity is a going concern
without any intention or need to liquidate, to curtail materially the scale of its operations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not,
therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where they exist, they are used to measure
the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if transactions occur with sufficient volumes and frequencies to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis. These quoted prices would generally be classified as level 1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, the group
establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques include reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is
substantially the same in nature, reference to the value of the assets of underlying business, earnings multiples, discounted-cashflow analysis and various
option pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy. The
determination of whether an instrument is classified as level 2 or level 3 is dependent on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs
in relation to the fair value of the instrument. Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility,
servicing costs, equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.

The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review protocols for the independent review
and validation of fair values separate from the business unit entering into the transaction. The valuation methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to
the fair-value measurement of the financial instruments have been applied in a manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY
The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) fair-value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based on (directly or indirectly) market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs.
These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product,
whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is based on inputs that are not market-
observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of the best information available and may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities,
appropriate proxies or other analytical techniques.

All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions on reasonable possible alternatives

The fair-value measurement of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that include assumptions that are not market-observable. Where these scenarios apply, the group
performs stress testing on the fair value of the relevant instruments. In performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the unobservable-input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing
market evidence and in line with the group’s approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for
which valuation is dependent on unobservable-input parameters and which are classified as level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy. However, the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value for which fair value is disclosed

Certain financial instruments of the group are not carried at fair value, including those categorised as held to maturity, loans and receivables, and financial
liabilities at amortised cost. The calculation of the fair value of these financial instruments incorporates the group’s best estimate of the value at which
these financial assets could be exchanged, or financial liabilities could be transferred, between market participants at the measurement date. The group’s
estimate of what fair value is does not necessarily represent the amount for which the group would be able to sell the asset or transfer the respective
financial liability in an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The fair values of these respective financial instruments at the reporting date, as detailed below, are estimated only for the purpose of IFRS disclosure:

VOLUNTARY SENS ANNOUNCEMENT – OLD MUTUAL PLC UPDATE ON MANAGED
SEPARATION

Shareholders of Nedbank Group are referred to the SENS announcement released by Old
Mutual plc on 28 June 2016 (the ‘Announcement’). The Announcement relates to Old Mutual
plc’s Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2016, when Bruce Hemphill, CEO of Old Mutual
plc, gave an update on the managed separation strategy that Old Mutual plc announced on
11 March 2016 with its 2015 Annual Financial Results.


The salient points for Nedbank Group shareholders extracted from the Announcement are as
follows:


“At Old Mutual’s preliminary results for 2015, the company announced that the long term
interests of its shareholders and other stakeholders would best be served by a managed
separation of the Group into its four constituent businesses.”


“Old Mutual Chief Executive Bruce Hemphill said: ‘We have started executing the managed
separation and I am pleased with the progress that we have made since the announcement
three months ago. We are now in a position to provide further guidance on our plans.
Increased market volatility following the referendum decision to leave the EU does not affect
our strategy although it may impact the performance of the underlying businesses.”


“We have made it clear that there are a number of different means by which to achieve the
managed separation. We have set out below our current plans which have been formulated
following extensive engagement with our key stakeholders and technical advisors. These
discussions are continuing. It should be noted that the managed separation of a diverse
multi-national group is a highly complex matter. Thus, the initial plans outlined below remain
subject to change as a result of factors such as stakeholder consent and/or the readiness of
the underlying businesses.”


“… we intend to pursue one or more transactions in the context of the managed separation
which will ultimately deliver two separate entities, listed on both the London and
Johannesburg stock exchanges, into the hands of Old Mutual’s shareholders. One will
consist principally of the Group’s Wealth operations and the primary means of achieving this
outcome is likely to be through a demerger. The other will consist principally of the Emerging
Markets operations through the creation of a new South African holding company. There are
various means to achieve this outcome and we will update the market on the precise steps
we intend to follow in due course.”


“Following the creation of the new South African holding company referred to above, we
intend to distribute, in an orderly manner, a significant proportion of the Group’s shareholding
in Nedbank to the shareholders on the register of the new South African holding company at
that time, leaving OMEM as the principal business within that group. Through its ownership
of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company South Africa, the new South African group will retain
an appropriate strategic minority stake in Nedbank, with the exact level still to be determined
together with Nedbank based on OMEM’s commercial relationship with Nedbank and
influenced by the implications of the incoming Twin Peaks regulation. The boards of directors
and management teams of Old Mutual and Nedbank continue to work closely together on
these matters.”


Nedbank Group Chief Executive, Mike Brown noted: “The update on the managed
separation provided by Old Mutual plc in respect of Nedbank Group is in line with our
expectations of the process and confirms that it remains business as usual for Nedbank.”


In accordance with Nedbank Group’s general closed period requirement prior to the
announcement of our financial results, Nedbank Group will be in a closed period from 1 July
2016 until the release of our 2016 Interim Results on 1 August 2016 at 8:00am SA time.

UPDATE ON NEDBANK GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31
MARCH 2016 AND PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND
LIQUIDITY RATIOS AS AT 31 MARCH 2016

UPDATE ON THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH
2016

Shareholders of Nedbank Group are referred to the announcement made by Old Mutual plc
(OM) in their 2015 Preliminary Results release on 11 March 2016 that they will cease
quarterly reporting to shareholders. Historically Nedbank has released quarterly trading
updates to enable OM to report quarterly. Following OM’s decision to cease quarterly
reporting, Nedbank Group will no longer report quarterly. In future a high level update on
performance for the first quarter will be provided at our Annual General Meeting and a third
quarter trading update will no longer be released.

At the Nedbank Group AGM on 5 May, CEO, Mike Brown commented as follows on the high
level performance in the first quarter of 2016:

“Nedbank Group’s own operations in South Africa and in the Southern Africa Development
Community produced a solid performance in line with management’s expectations for the
first three months of the year (“the period”).

Net interest income for the period grew at low double digit levels, supported by continued
growth in average interest-earning banking assets. The net interest margin (NIM) for the
period widened slightly from the full year 2015 level of 3,30%. The NIM benefitted from
endowment income following interest rate increases during the period and this more than
offset the negative effects of ongoing asset mix changes and higher funding costs related to
Basel III requirements. The re-pricing of the cost of funding lagged the increases in the prime
interest rate in the period, benefitting the NIM, but this benefit is expected to dissipate by the
end of the 2016 year.

The credit loss ratio (CLR) increased as expected from the full year 2015 level, but remained
within our through-the-cycle target range of 60 – 100 basis points. The increase in the CLR
was driven by normal seasonality effects in Retail and higher specific impairments in CIB
largely due to the impact on clients of the weak commodity cycle. Additional portfolio
impairments were raised in both RBB and CIB. The central portfolio provision was increased
to R500m in the second half of 2015 to take into account risks, particularly in commodities
and in the Rest of Africa that had been incurred in 2015 but were only expected to emerge in
2016. It is expected that a portion of the central portfolio provision will therefore partially
offset any increases in the 2016 CLR.

Non-interest revenue in the period grew at mid-single digit levels, underpinned by solid
growth in commission and fees as total client numbers and main banked client numbers
continued to increase, as well as a good performance from our insurance business. Trading
income benefitted from increased market volatility and improved cross-sell in CIB.

Expenses for the period grew in line with management expectations and continued to be
well-managed.

In Central and West Africa, associate income from our approximately 20% share in Ecobank
Transnational Incorporated (ETI) is equity-accounted one quarter in arrears, using ETI’s
publicly disclosed results. ETI announced its results for the full year 2015 on 13 April 2016,
which reflected a full year attributable profit of USD66m, implying a loss of USD199m for the
fourth-quarter in 2015. This was the first set of ETI annual results following the strategic
review undertaken by the new CEO and the fourth-quarter loss was largely due to increased
impairments on exposures related to the slowdown in economic growth across Africa, as a
result of lower commodity prices. As a result, Nedbank Group's first quarter 2016 results
include a loss in associate income of R676m (Q1 2015: R148m profit) from accounting for
our approximately 20% share of ETI’s fourth-quarter 2015 loss.

On 14 April 2016 ETI reported its first-quarter results for 2016 which reflected an attributable
profit of USD71m. Nedbank Group’s share of this amounts to a profit of R240m (subject to
exchange rate movements) which will be accounted for in our second-quarter 2016 results
(Q2 2015: R278m profit).

Nedbank Group continues to work collaboratively with OM and Old Mutual Emerging Markets
on the programme of ‘Managed Separation’, as announced by OM on 11 March 2016. OM
will provide a more detailed update later in 2016 on the Managed Separation.

Our forecast for the full year 2016 as communicated in the 2015 Annual Results
announcement, that growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2016 will be lower than
the growth achieved in 2015 of 8,5% and below our medium-to-long-term target of consumer
price index + GDP growth + 5%, currently remains unchanged.”


PILLAR 3 BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS AS AT
31 MARCH 2016

BASEL III CAPITAL ADEQUACY
In terms of the requirements under Regulation 43(1)(e)(iii) of the regulations relating to banks
and Directive 4/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of the Banks Act (Act No. 94 of 1990),
minimum disclosure on the capital adequacy of the group and its leverage ratio is required on
a quarterly basis. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel III accord. The
group remains well capitalised with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11,4%, well within our
target range of 10,5% to 12,5%.

As a result of the operation of the threshold deduction formula under Basel III, the group’s
share of ETI’s fourth–quarter losses has no impact on regulatory capital ratios.

The following table sets out the regulatory capital as at 31 March 2016:

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)
In accordance with the provisions of section 6(6) of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of
1990), banks are directed, to comply with the relevant LCR disclosure requirements, as set
out in Directive 6/2014 and Directive 11/2014.

The LCR aims to ensure that a bank holds an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality
liquid assets (HQLA) to cover total Net Cash Outflows over a 30-day period under a
prescribed stress scenario. Based on the final revisions announced by the Basel Committee
in January 2013, the LCR is being phased-in starting at 60% on 1 January 2015 and
increasing by 10% each year to 100% on 1 January 2019.


The LCR for Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited are well above minimum regulatory
requirements. These are set out in the following table:

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY:
2016 COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY BONUS DEFERRAL SCHEMES

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following
information is disclosed in respect of dealings by the executive directors and the company
secretary of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

The following shares have been committed by the executive directors and the company secretary
to the 2016 Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)    in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme, deferred bonus amounts can be invested
       in the Matched Share Scheme. The deferred amount will be forfeited should the employee
       resign and not be classified as a good leaver before the end of the deferral period, as well
       as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material irregularities
       or misrepresentation of financial results come to light during the deferral period. In these
       instances, the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred bonus amount
       subject to forfeiture;

(b)    in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme, up to 50% of an employee’s total after-tax
       bonus (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme set
       out above) can be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which are then committed into
       the Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the employee can commit shares already
       owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the employee’s total after-tax bonus
       less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral scheme. The
       employee can dispose of these shares at any time prior to the vesting date, which will
       cancel their participation in the scheme in respect of those shares, and will render them
       ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

The date of the transactions was 31 March 2016 and the value of the shares was determined using
a weighted average price of Nedbank Group shares acquired between 24 March 2016 and
30 March 2016.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still
held in trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio will be matched on a one-for-one basis if the
person has remained in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50%
of the shares held on vesting date may be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined
company performance target for the period 2016 to 2018 is met.

SCHEME

In terms of paragraphs 3.63 - 3.66 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the following
information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to executive
directors and the company secretary of Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited.

These shares have vested in terms of the 2013 Matched Share Scheme, whereby:

(a)    in terms of the compulsory bonus share scheme (CBSS), deferred bonus amounts could be
       invested in the Matched Share Scheme. The deferred amount would be forfeited should
       the employee resign before the end of the deferral period and not be classified as a good
       leaver, as well as in cases where, in the sole opinion of the Nedbank Group board, material
       irregularities or misrepresentation of financial results came to light during the deferral
       period. In these instances, the employee forgoes the right to matching on the deferred
       bonus amount subject to forfeiture;

(b)    in terms of the voluntary bonus share scheme (VBSS), up to 50% of an employee’s total
       after-tax bonus (less any amount already deferred under the compulsory bonus deferral
       scheme set out above) could be used to acquire shares in Nedbank Group which would
       then be committed into the Matched Share Scheme. Alternatively, the employee could
       commit shares already owned by them up to an equivalent amount of 50% of the
       employee’s total after-tax bonus less any amount already deferred under the compulsory
       bonus deferral scheme. The employee could dispose of these shares at any time prior to
       the vesting dates, which would cancel their participation in the scheme in respect of those
       shares and render them ineligible to qualify for any matching of shares.

Participants are entitled to the dividends paid on the shares committed into the Matched Share
Scheme but no rights to dividends accrue to Participants in respect of the Matched Shares unless
and until the requisite Matched Shares are delivered to the Participant.

On the vesting date (the day following three years after the inception date), 50% of the shares still
held in trust in respect of the participant’s portfolio would be matched on a one-for-one basis if
the person continued in the employ of the company throughout the vesting period. A further 50%
of the shares held on vesting date would be matched on a one-for-one basis if the predetermined
company performance target for the period 2013 to 2015 was met.

VESTING OF SHARES AND OPTIONS GRANTED TO THE COMPANY SECRETARY IN 2012 IN
TERMS OF THE NEDBANK EYETHU BLACK EXECUTIVE TRUST


The following information is disclosed in respect of the vesting of Nedbank Group ordinary
shares and options previously granted to the Company Secretary of Nedbank Group and
Nedbank Limited (‘Nedbank’).

This voluntary announcement confirms only that the company secretary is now entitled to
the first tranche of the 2012 award, having remained in the employ of Nedbank Group over
the vesting period, and this is not classified as a “dealing” in terms of JSE Listings
Requirements.

Background:
In August 2005, Nedbank Group implemented a black economic empowerment transaction,
which was comprised of a number of schemes empowering a broad base of over 500 000
previously disadvantaged beneficiaries. 41 268 130 new ordinary shares in Nedbank Group
were issued for the purposes of this BEE transaction, which at the time equated to
approximately 9.47% of the Company’s issued share capital (post the issue of the shares)
and also equated to black ownership of 11.5% of the value of Nedbank Group’s South
African businesses.

The South African BEE transaction comprised of three groupings, namely:

-   the Black Business Partners Schemes and the Non-Executive Directors Scheme;
-   the Client Schemes and the Community Scheme; and
-   the Employee Schemes (including a Black Executive Scheme, Black Management
    Scheme, Broad-based Employee Scheme and the Evergreen Scheme).

Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust:
The Nedbank Eyethu Black Executive Trust (‘BET’) manages and operates the Black Executive
Scheme referred to above. The trustees of the BET award Nedbank Group shares and grant
options on Nedbank Group shares to qualifying participants for retention and attraction
purposes. The entitlement of such executives to the shares and options is conditional upon
them remaining in the employ of Nedbank Group over the vesting period, during which 33%
of the shares awarded or options granted vest in each of years 4 and 5 and 34% in year 6.
The participants are identified from time to time by the Nedbank Group Remuneration
Committee on the recommendation of the Nedbank Group Executive Committee.
Vesting of 33% of the shares and options that were awarded to Thabani Jali on 8 March
2012:
20 000 Nedbank Group shares and 60 000 options (with a strike price of R161,88) were
granted to Thabani Jali, and the first tranche of 33% of this award now vests. Mr Jali holds
the position of Chief Governance and Compliance Officer, and was also appointed as
Company Secretary subsequent to this award being made.

OLD MUTUAL PLC STRATEGIC REVIEW AND WITHDRAWAL OF NEDBANK GROUP
CAUTIONARY

Nedbank Group shareholders are referred to the Nedbank Group
announcement released on SENS on Monday, 7 March 2016 and to the
announcement released on SENS today by Old Mutual plc (‘Old Mutual’)
regarding Old Mutual’s new strategy to separate its underlying
businesses and to unlock value for Old Mutual shareholders (the ‘Old
Mutual Managed Separation’).

Old Mutual has been engaging with the board of directors of Nedbank
Group regarding its intention to carry out the Old Mutual Managed
Separation. Old Mutual has decided that the long-term interests of
Old Mutual shareholders and other stakeholders will be best served
by Old Mutual separating its four businesses – Old Mutual Emerging
Markets (‘OMEM’), Nedbank Group, Old Mutual Wealth (‘OMW’) and Old
Mutual Asset Management (‘OMAM’) – from each other. Old Mutual
expects that the Old Mutual Managed Separation will be materially
completed by the end of 2018.

Nedbank Group remains an independent entity listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. At 31 December 2015, Nedbank Group was
54.1% owned by Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa)
Limited and associated South African companies in the Old Mutual
group, which are in turn ultimately owned by Old Mutual.

Nedbank Group is governed, managed and operated as a South African
regulated banking entity within the Old Mutual group for the benefit
of all Nedbank Group stakeholders. It is a well-capitalised South
African bank with a strong balance sheet and a clear strategy to
deliver ongoing returns to shareholders. The announcement of the Old
Mutual Managed Separation will have no impact on the strategy or day
to day management or operations of Nedbank Group or its staff or
clients. On 2 March 2016, Nedbank Group announced its audited
results for the year ended 31 December 2015 (details available on
Nedbank Group’s website at nedbankgroup.co.za) and highlights
included growth of 9,6% in headline earnings to R10,8 billion, a
9,0% increase in net asset value per share, a 11,3% common equity
tier 1 ratio and a 7,7% increase in the full year dividend per
share.

Old Mutual and Nedbank Group recognise that their commercial
relationship continues to be a source of value underpinning

successful collaboration activities in both South Africa and the
Rest of Africa. It is therefore intended that the strategic
relationship between Nedbank Group and OMEM will continue following
the Old Mutual Managed Separation. Old Mutual and Nedbank Group
remain committed to achieving the previously announced 2017 pre-tax
synergies target of R1 billion. However, it is agreed that Old
Mutual’s majority shareholding in Nedbank Group is not necessary to
achieve either party’s strategic objectives.

In time, Old Mutual envisages reducing its interest in Nedbank Group
to an appropriate strategic minority position to underpin the future
commercial relationship.     The exact mechanism to achieve any
reduction in Old Mutual’s shareholding has yet to be finally
determined. Old Mutual currently envisages reducing its shareholding
in Nedbank Group primarily by way of a distribution of Nedbank Group
shares to the shareholders of Old Mutual in an orderly manner and at
an appropriate time in the context of the Old Mutual Managed
Separation and does not intend to sell any part of its shareholding
in Nedbank Group to a new strategic investor. It is currently
intended that apart from the strategic minority shareholding in
Nedbank Group to be held by Old Mutual, the remainder of the Nedbank
Group shareholder base will be widely held by the time the Old
Mutual Managed Separation has been completed.

The boards of directors and management teams of Old Mutual and
Nedbank Group are working closely together to determine the most
effective method and appropriate timing to effect the Old Mutual
Managed Separation, in a way that safeguards the stability and
integrity of both Nedbank Group and the South African financial
services sector, including determining the level of the strategic
minority shareholding that Old Mutual will hold in Nedbank Group on
an ongoing basis post the Old Mutual Managed Separation.

The Nedbank Group cautionary announcement dated 7 March 2016 is
hereby   withdrawn.  Nedbank   Group   shareholders will be kept
appropriately informed of further developments.

PRELIMINARY AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

- Headline earnings increased 9,6% to R10 831m¹
- Diluted headline earnings per share up 8,5% to 2 242 cents¹
- Growth in tangible net asset value per share of 9,9%¹
- Return on equity (excluding goodwill) at 17,0%
- Common-equity tier 1 ratio at 11,3%
- Full-year dividend per share up 7,7% to 1 107 cents

'Nedbank Group produced a resilient performance in an environment of difficult macroeconomic conditions, volatile markets and an escalating
regulatory agenda.

We delivered growth in diluted headline earnings per share of 8,5% – ahead of the guidance we gave during the year. Earnings growth was driven by
ongoing momentum in NIR and disciplined cost management, combined with the benefit of equity-accounted earnings from our investment in ETI
based on our 20% share of their 12 months of publicly reported results to September 2015.

NIR growth was underpinned by an 8,5% growth in retail main banked clients and from our integrated CIB model that successfully unlocked additional
revenue growth and cross-sell opportunities. In response to increasing macroeconomic headwinds, we focused on reducing cost growth, maintaining
conservative provisioning levels and increasing liquidity buffers.

Nedbank is committed to long-term value creation for all our stakeholders and we were honoured to win 2015 Bank of the year in both Africa and SA
by The Financial Times and The Banker magazine.

Nedbank Group is in excellent shape to deal with the challenging macroeconomic environment that we expect in both SA and in the rest of Africa.
Forecast risk has increased and as a result our guidance for performance in the year ahead is harder than usual to formulate. Against this context we
currently forecast that growth in diluted headline earnings per share for 2016 will be lower than the growth we achieved in 2015 and below our
medium-to-long-term target of consumer price index + GDP growth + 5%. Given the increased forecast risk we will update this guidance with our
June 2016 results.'

Mike Brown
Chief Executive

BANKING AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

Globally the economic climate remained challenging, with improved growth in developed markets insufficient to offset the effects on emerging
markets of depressed oil and commodity prices and the broader impact of the slowdown in China. Additionally the tightening of US monetary policy
has placed further pressure on emerging markets as capital flows are diverted towards developed markets.

Economic conditions in SA have also deteriorated as reflected by our 2015 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast of 1,3%. This is considerably
less than the 2015 GDP growth of 2,5% we had forecast in February 2015. Various factors, including inadequate infrastructure, economic policy
uncertainty, concerns around government debt levels and the drought-related contraction in the agricultural sector, resulted in the USD/ZAR exchange
rate depreciating significantly in 2015, notwithstanding interest rate increases of 50 basis points (bps) and inflation remaining below 6,0%.

These and other factors led to Fitch Ratings downgrading the sovereign ratings to one notch above investment grade at BBB- (from BBB) with a stable
outlook. Moody's sovereign rating of Baa2/P-2 is currently two notches above investment grade and Standard & Poor's sovereign rating of BBB-/A-3 is
one notch above investment grade. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's revised the outlook on their ratings from stable to negative, indicating a
likelihood of a possible downgrade in the next rating review, which could place Standard & Poor's sovereign rating of SA at subinvestment grade.

Against this challenging background wholesale credit demand has slowed, but remains ahead of retail demand, as consumers face increasing
pressures from the risk of job losses, high levels of indebtedness, increasing administrative costs and higher interest rates. Wholesale credit demand
continues to be supported by infrastructure-related projects.

Government, business and labour are working together to use the challenging economic environment as a catalyst for increased collaboration to
accelerate the rate of economic growth and job creation and to strengthen public finances. The group has been and will continue to be an active
participant in these discussions.

REVIEW OF RESULTS

Headline earnings grew 9,6%¹ to a record level of R10 831m¹ (2014: R9 880m)¹. This was largely achieved through growth in non-interest revenue
(NIR), strong cost discipline and increased associate income from our investment in Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), partly offset by an
increase in impairments. Preprovisioning operating profit (PPOP) increased 7,3% (2014: 3,5%). Earnings growth was stronger in the first half of the
year, boosted by robust trading revenues and a weaker base in 2014. In the second half earnings growth slowed as NIR was impacted by, among
others, reduced levels of card-related interchange and increased impairments in Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB)¹.

Other comprehensive income benefited from foreign currency translation gains and as a result total profit attributable to equity holders of the parent
increased 22,9% to R12,8bn¹.

Diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) grew 8,5% to 2 242 cents¹ (2014: 2 066 cents)¹ and diluted basic earnings per share increased 8,3% to
2 219 cents¹ (2014: 2 049 cents)¹. Excluding associate income from our shareholding in ETI and the related funding costs, the group's DHEPS
increased 4,8%.

Economic profit (EP) increased 19,6% to R2 525m (2014: R2 112m) relative to a cost of equity of 13,0% (2014: 13,5%). The cost of equity metric is set
annually in advance and therefore the 2015 cost of equity of 13,0% is not reflective of the movements in long bond rates in December 2015. The cost
of equity for 2016 is estimated at closer to 15,0% and, had this been used throughout 2015, EP would have decreased 41,0%. Return on average
ordinary shareholders' equity (ROE) (excluding goodwill) and ROE declined slightly to 17,0% (2014: 17,2%) and 15,7% (2014: 15,8%), as a result of the
lower return on assets (ROA) of 1,25% (2014: 1,27%), while gearing increased slightly to 12,5 times from 12,4 times.

The group's balance sheet remained strong. Our Basel III common-equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11,3% (2014: 11,6%) continues to be well within our
Basel III 2019 internal target range of 10,5% to 12,5%. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) increased to 88,5%, above the 60% requirement in 2015 and
the 70% requirement in 2016. Our portfolio of LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) increased to a fourth-quarter average of R118,0bn
(2014: fourth-quarter average R91,4bn). The group's combined portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA and other sources of quick liquidity amounted to
R160,7bn (2014: R126,1bn), representing 17,4% (2014: 15,6%) of total assets.

Net asset value per share continued to increase, growing 9,0%¹ to 15 685 cents¹ (2014: 14 395 cents)¹.

Delivering sustainably to all our stakeholders

Nedbank Group is committed to long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. In line with our vision to be Africa's most admired bank by staff,
clients, shareholders, regulators and communities, we are pleased to report that Nedbank Group was named 2015 Bank of the Year in both Africa and
South Africa by The Financial Times and The Banker magazine.

During the period we delivered on a number of initiatives as part of our commitments to our stakeholders:

For staff – creating 714 new permanent-employment opportunities, restructuring of CIB, integration of Retail and Business Banking (RBB) backoffices
and reorganisation of our insurance businesses; investing R371m in training, with more than 20 000 staff participating in learning programmes;
supporting 111 external bursars across 19 universities and 2 924 learners across our learnership programmes. Nedbank's achievement in staff
transformation was recognised at the 14th Annual Oliver Empowerment Awards where we received the Top Empowered Business of the Year award,
and were placed third overall for creating equal employment opportunities and limiting barriers to employment equity in Namibia by the Employment
Equity Commission.

For clients – investing in client-centred innovation such as the Nedbank Instant Bond Indicator™, Market Edge™ and 'Easy to do credit' in Business
Banking. To improve client access through our distribution channels, we rolled out an additional 94 Intelligent Depositors, 8 195 new point-of-sale
devices and 110 net new ATMs, as well as a further 84 branches in the 'branch of the future' format. Digitally enabled clients increased 40%,
supporting 66% growth in the value of AppSuite™ transactions to R16bn. Group client numbers increased 3,0% to 7,4m, including the closure of
359 000 dormant accounts and retail main banked clients were up 8,5%. We advanced R185bn (2014: R167bn) of new loans to clients. Assets under
management grew by 21,4% to R257bn (2014: R212bn) as Nedgroup Investments continued to produce excellent investment performance for our
clients, including winning the Raging Bull Award for both the South African and Offshore Management Company of the Year, in addition to being
ranked the top unit trust company in the October 2015 Plexcrown quarterly ratings.

For shareholders – growing net asset value per share by 9,0% to 15 685 cents¹ (2014: 14 395 cents)¹, delivering EP of R2 525m, increasing the total
dividend by 7,7%, ahead of the 7,4% growth in headline earnings per share (HEPS) and creating R8,2bn in value for over 500 000 of our broad-based
black economic empowerment (BBBEE) shareholders with the maturing of our BBBEE schemes in January 2015. Ensuring transparent, relevant and
timeous reporting and disclosure to shareholders, as acknowledged by Nedbank's ranking among the top quartile of JSE-listed companies.

For regulators – maintaining full compliance with Basel III phase-in requirements, achieving an average long-term funding ratio of 28,7% and an
average LCR ratio of 88,5% in the fourth quarter; making cash taxation contributions of R8,2bn relating to direct, indirect, PAYE and other taxation;
ensuring we have a comprehensive recovery plan; maintaining transparent relationships and working closely with all regulators; establishing a
Regulatory Change Programme Office focused on ensuring efficient delivery against the various regulatory programmes, including the Anti-money-
laundering, Treating Clients Fairly, Protection of Personal Information, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, Risk Data Aggregation and Risk
Reporting, Twin Peaks and Market Conduct Programmes.

For communities – advancing R57,6bn in new loans to retail clients; contributing R540m to socioeconomic development since 2011, including R125m
in 2015; supporting local businesses and purchasing 75% of our procurement spend locally. Investing R100m over three years in conjunction with our
black business partners in initiatives aligned with the Financial Sector Code and National Development Plan, including the first disbursement of R11m
to the Centane Agricultural Development project in the Eastern Cape focused on creating sustainable, self-funding commercial farms from primarily
communally owned land. We maintained our level 2 BBBEE contributor status for the seventh consecutive year. Our Fair Share 2030 initiative has
enabled R1,8bn of new lending to support green affordable housing, student accommodation and embedded energy, particularly in the farming sector,
and we introduced the Nedbank Insurance Green Property Plan, offering investment opportunities in green properties within a unit-linked fund.
Nedbank also contributed towards the country's water and energy security by investing in the Water Balance Programme to release water back into
the ecosystem and by committing R35,0bn towards renewable energy deals of which R11,0bn has been disbursed.

Cluster financial performance

Our business clusters delivered headline earnings growth of 13,2%¹ and an ROE of 19,3% (2014: 19,7%) on an increased average capital allocation of

Nedbank CIB's earnings growth of 10,2% was driven by good topline performance, demonstrating the strength of the underlying businesses and well-
managed expenses. This was partly offset by an increase in impairments largely relating to clients impacted by the downturn in the commodity cycle.
PPOP increased 21,9%. The ROE decreased to 22,6% (2014: 27,0%) following a 32,0% increase in capital allocated. This increase was mainly due to
ratings migration across certain portfolios, and the introduction of an industrywide regulatory capital charge for credit value adjustments (CVA) on over-
the-counter (OTC) ZAR derivatives and OTC derivatives with local counterparties not cleared through a central counterparty.

Nedbank RBB grew earnings 10,6% and benefited from an ongoing reduction in impairments following a number of years of selective origination strategies
across all asset classes, combined with proactive risk management and continued strengthening of balance sheet impairments. Topline growth improved,
notwithstanding the deliberate slowdown in personal-loan advances, lower interchange fees, and the run rate effect of selected fee reductions
implemented in the second half of 2014. We continued to invest in our distribution channels, marketing and client-centred innovation, while managing
costs diligently and extracting efficiencies. The improvement in ROE from 14,6% to 16,6% was particularly pleasing, given the focus we have had on
this metric.

Nedbank Wealth achieved headline earnings growth of 8,8% and ROE increased to 41,5%. The strong momentum experienced in the first half of 2015
continued both locally and internationally in our Wealth Management businesses. Nedbank Private Wealth benefited from strong advances and liabilities
growth, while stockbroking and financial planning delivered a solid set of results. Asset Management had an outstanding year, with excellent fund
performance and record net inflows. Insurance continues to be impacted by the historic slowdown in retail lending volumes.

Rest of Africa's performance was largely driven by associate income from our investment in ETI, while earnings from our African subsidiaries in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa were affected by a single once-off impairment charge. We account for our share of
ETI's earnings using its publicly disclosed results one quarter in arrears. This means that Nedbank's 2015 results contain our share of ETI's earnings for
their 12-month period ended 30 September 2015.

The centre reported a loss of R662m mainly as a result of the R108m after-tax impact of the R150m increase in the central provision to R500m¹, prime/
Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) margin squeeze of R184m post tax as a result of short-term funding costs repricing faster than prime-linked
assets and accounting mismatch on certain hedged portfolios of R155m post tax that will reverse over time.

Detailed segmental information is available in the results booklet and under the 'Equity Investor Centre' section on the group's website at
nedbankgroup.co.za.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Net interest income

Net interest income (NII) grew 4,0%¹ to R23 885m¹ (2014: R22 961m)¹, with growth in average interest-earning banking assets of 11,0%, including
significantly higher levels of HQLA required for regulatory compliance with the LCR. Excluding HQLA, growth in average interest-earning banking assets
was 9,6%.

As expected, margins remained under pressure with the net interest margin (NIM) narrowing to 3,30% (2014: 3,52%) as the 10 bps combined benefit of
endowment income and asset and liability margin repricing was offset by:

- asset margin compression of 17 bps reflecting,
  - 12 bps from the asset mix change, including the slowdown, albeit at a reduced pace, of our personal-loans book and
  - 5 bps from holding higher levels of lower-yielding HQLA for Basel III LCR requirements; and
- liability margin compression of 15 bps including,
  - 7 bps related to the increased cost of wholesale funding, including 4 bps of ETI funding costs,
  - 6 bps from the relative prime JIBAR reset cost as prime rate changes lagged increases to JIBAR during 2015 and
  - 2 bps linked to the cost of lengthening and diversifying the liquidity risk profile, through capital market and foreign funding sources in
    preparation for the transition to the Basel III net stable funding ratio in 2018.

Impairments charge on loans and advances

Impairments increased 6,3% to R4 789m (2014: R4 506m) and the credit loss ratio (CLR) improved slightly to 0,77% (2014: 0,79%). Continued
improvements in retail impairments were offset by increased impairments in the wholesale clusters. Additional overlays were raised in RBB and at the
centre as deteriorating economic conditions prompted further strengthening of provisioning levels in the second half of 2015.

Total credit loss ratio   0,77   0,77   0,77   0,79

The group's through-the-cycle target range for the CLR was changed to between 0,6% and 1,0%, from 0,8% and 1,2% of banking advances with effect
from 1 January 2016. The lower range reflects the change in advances mix towards a higher proportion of wholesale advances of the total book, as well as
the change in mix within Nedbank Retail towards a lower proportion of personal loans. At its peak, personal loans was 4,2% of total gross advances and
this has now reduced to 2,7%.

Improvements in retail impairments were driven by home loans, MFC and personal loans. Our strong collections focus led to further reductions in the
CLR in personal loans to 7,48% (2014: 10,04%) and in home loans to 0,06% (2014: 0,13%). Postwriteoff recoveries increased 20,8% to R1 137m (2014:
R941m), including recoveries in Retail of R1 015m (2014: R854m), largely comprising personal loans of R398m (2014: R343m) and MFC of R280m
(2014: R193m). This quantum of postwriteoff recovery is indicative of ongoing conservative provisioning levels.

Lower oil and commodity prices resulted in higher impairments in CIB and the Rest of Africa. In addition, RBB's total impairment overlay increased to
R699m (2014: R404m) and takes into consideration, inter alia, an estimate of the impairment impact that has been incurred in our agricultural book as a
result of the drought and in our personal loans book due to job losses in the mining sector, but are not yet evident. Portfolio provisions in the centre were
R350m at the start of 2015 and during the course of the year most of the items for which this provision was held were either satisfactorily resolved or
appropriate provisions were raised in the clusters. In the second half of the year the central portfolio provision was further strengthened to R500m to take
into account risks, particularly in commodities and in the Rest of Africa, that have been incurred but are only expected to emerge in 2016. Total balance
sheet impairments increased to R11 411m¹ (2014: R11 095m)¹.

The group's total coverage ratio of 65,0% (2014: 70,0%) was driven by a lower specific coverage ratio of 38,0% (2014: 43,1%), largely due to the
implementation of the SARB directive 7/2015 on restructured accounts, which reduced specific coverage by 3,5%, improved impairments in retail
and the change in mix of retail and wholesale defaulted advances. Wholesale advances are assessed individually and are predominantly secured with
collateral resulting in relatively lower loss expectations in the event of default and, accordingly, lower specific impairments and coverage levels. The
portfolio coverage ratio for impairments remained stable at 0,70% (2014: 0,70%).

Total defaulted advances to total advances also remained stable at 2,53% (2014: 2,54%) as total defaulted advances increased 10,8% to R17 559m
(2014: R15 846m) in line with the growth in advances.

Non-interest revenue

NIR increased 7,1%¹ to R21 748m¹ (2014: R20 312m)¹, underpinned by:

- Commission and fee income growth of 7,3%¹ to R15 627m¹ (2014: R14 570m)¹, supported by continued client acquisitions, cross-sell and annual
  inflation-related fee increases. Growth was, however, negatively impacted by lower card-related interchange rates amounting to R261m, the
  slowdown in personal loans and the run rate effect of pricing reductions in the second half of 2014 in Small Business Services and Business Banking.
- Trading income growth of 19,6%¹ to R3 167m¹ (2014: R2 648m)¹ following improved cross-sell and a strong performance from our client-led Markets
  business.
- Insurance income reduced 7,9%¹ to R1 830m¹ (2014: R1 986m)¹ owing to the historic slowdown in retail unsecured lending volumes, partially offset
  by a good weather-related claims experience.
- Private-equity income, being of a less predictable nature, increasing 16,3%¹ to R886m¹ (2014: R762m)¹, mostly from realisations.

Expenses

Expenses were well managed and grew at 6,4%¹ to R26 110m¹ (2014: R24 534m)¹, including continued investment in our RBB and Rest of Africa Clusters
and the ongoing cost of compliance with increasing regulatory demands. Excluding the Rest of Africa Cluster, expenses grew at 5,6%. The main drivers
were:

- Staff-related costs rising 3,3%¹ (2014: 9,6%¹), reflecting an increase in remuneration of 6,5% (2014: 8,8%), additional staff employed in regulatory
  compliance support functions, and 2,4% lower variable performance-related incentives.
- Computer processing costs growing 14,4%¹ to R3 543m¹, including amortisation costs increasing 9,6% to R718m¹.
- Fees and insurance costs increasing 23,9% to R2 801m¹ (2014: R2 260m)¹ due to increased costs associated with cash handling, compliance and
  higher volumes of card issuing and acquiring.

Our strong cost discipline and focus on efficiency through our 'Optimise and invest' strategy led to cost efficiencies of R915m, supporting ongoing
investment for the future and contributing to a positive jaws ratio of 0,6% (2014: -2,5%).

Associate income
Associate income, largely from our share of approximately 20% of ETI's attributable income, increased to R871m¹ (2014: R161m).¹ Associate income is
equity-accounted one quarter in arrears using ETI's publicly disclosed results. The related funding costs of R370m (2014: R79m) are included in NII.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

Capital

The group maintained a well-capitalised balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio of 11,3% (2014: 11,6%) remains around the mid-point of our Basel III 2019 internal
target range. The tier 1 and total capital ratios continue to be affected by the Basel III transitional requirements. Consequently, the tier 1 ratio decreased
following the redemption of R1,8bn of old-style hybrid debt, and the total capital ratio decreased with the redemption of NED11, representing R1bn of
old-style tier 2 subordinated debt, on its call date in September 2015. This was partially offset by the issuance of R2,3bn of new-style Basel III-compliant
tier 2 subordinated-debt instruments.

The CET 1 ratio was impacted by risk-weighted assets (RWA) growing 13,7% to R501,2bn (2014: R440,7bn) largely as a result of an increase in credit
RWA due to:

- ratings migration across certain wholesale portfolios in line with the deteriorating economic environment;
- an industrywide CVA capital charge by the South African Reserve Bank for OTC ZAR derivatives and OTC derivatives with local counterparties not
  cleared through a central counterparty, which increased RWA by R6,5bn; and
- growth in loans and advances.

Overall capital adequacy was further impacted by investments in Rest of Africa resulting in a higher capital impairment.

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

Our funding profile and liquidity position remains strong and well-diversified as reflected by the group's average long-term funding ratio for the fourth
quarter of 28,7% (2014: fourth-quarter average 25,4%).

The group's average LCR for the fourth quarter increased to 88,5% (2014: fourth-quarter average 66,4%), exceeding the minimum regulatory requirement,
which increased from 60% in 2015 to 70% from 1 January 2016. Our portfolio of LCR-compliant, HQLA increased to a fourth-quarter average of R118,0bn
(2014: fourth-quarter average R91,4bn). In addition to LCR-qualifying HQLA, Nedbank also holds other sources of quick liquidity, including corporate
bonds, listed equities and other marketable securities, that can be accessed in times of stress. Nedbank's combined portfolio of LCR-compliant HQLA
and other sources of quick liquidity amounted to a fourth-quarter average R160,7bn at December 2015, representing 17,4% of total assets.

LOANS AND ADVANCES

Loans and advances grew 11,2%¹ to R681,6bn¹ (2014: R613,0bn)¹. Excluding lower-yielding trading advances, banking advances growth was 10,5%
following gross new payouts of R184,7bn (2014: R166,8bn).

Loans and advances by cluster are as follows:

Banking advances growth was primarily driven by CIB advances increasing 15,7%, mainly as a result of drawdowns in credit extended to clients in the
renewable-energy and commercial property sectors, as well as stronger growth in Rest of Africa and Wealth.

RBB grew advances by 4,1%, comprised of MFC (vehicle finance) increasing 7,6%, Home Loans by 1,2%, Card by 3,3% and Relationship Banking by 24,7%.
Excluding R4,9bn of advances transferred from Business Banking to Retail Relationship Banking in the first half of the year, Relationship Banking's advances
grew 4,5%, while Personal Loans decreased 4,5%.

Advances growth in the Rest of Africa Cluster was driven by growth in the African subsidiaries as a result of footprint expansion, new products and client
value propositions.

DEPOSITS

The group's strategy of building its deposit franchise through innovative products and competitive pricing led to deposit growth of 11,1% to R725,9bn¹
(2014: R653,5bn)¹ resulting in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 93,9%¹ (2014: 93,8%)¹, which has remained consistently below 100%.

We continued to focus on growing Basel III-friendly deposits, emphasising retail and commercial deposits and reducing reliance on wholesale funding.
Retail deposit growth was 15,9% and commercial and wholesale deposits grew at 9,7%.

Current accounts increased 8,6%, in line with the 8,5% growth in main banked clients. Our savings accounts grew 20,3%, with good takeup of our tax-free
savings product, GoalSave, and foreign currency savings deposits in Nedbank Wealth reflecting higher values as a result of a weaker rand. Growth in fixed
deposits of 14,0% and in negotiable certificates of deposit of 16,7% was driven by demand for longer-term deposits on the back of increased interest rate
expectations. Call and term deposits increased 7,2%. Nedbank also successfully increased foreign currency funding by 50,8% to support foreign
denominated lending and to diversify the funding base.

Total funding-related liabilities grew 11,9% to R770,8bn (2014: R689,1bn), including R15,5bn of long-term debt capital market funding issued as part of our
strategy to lengthen the funding profile.

GROUP STRATEGIC FOCUS

We made good progress with our five key strategic focus areas, namely:

-    Client-centred innovation: We continued to innovate with products such as Market Edge™ – winner of the big data and analytics category at the
     Efma–Accenture Global Banking Innovation Awards. We deployed WebTickets in the Nedbank App Suite™, implemented Tshwane Prepaid Electricity
     on WAP, APP and USSD, launched our tax-free savings account - GoalSave - and our 32Day Notice Account and, for wholesale clients, our worldclass
     Plug and Transact™ token. To date we have converted 255 outlets in the 'branch of the future' format and we currently plan to have converted 77% of
     all outlets by 2017. Digitally enabled clients increased 40% and the value of Nedbank App Suite™ transactions by 66% to R16bn. As part of our
     digital experience management programme, we launched the new Nedbank.co.za website, which leverages worldclass technology to enhance the
     client experience, integrate product applications and render seamlessly across all mobile devices. Our progress in innovation was acknowledged with
     Nedbank receiving The Banker Magazine's Technology Projects of the Year award and being recognised as The Asian Banker's Best Retail Bank in
     South Africa and Best Mortgage and Home Loans Product in Africa for 2015. We also received recognition at the 2015 iCMG Enterprise & IT
     Architecture Excellence Awards for our Managed Evolution architecture.

-    Growing our transactional banking franchise: Our retail franchise continued to strengthen, with main banked clients increasing 8,5% to 2,7m and the
     number of clients with two or more products up 5,5%. Significant progress was made in our brand value and client relationships as reflected in the
     Nedbank Brand Tracker results, the Consulta annual retail reputational Net Promotor Score (NPS), which improved to 21% from 15%, and our SA
     client satisfaction index score increasing to 74,3%. In addition, exceptionally high levels of full-service recovery was recorded, as evidenced by
     Nedbank being ranked first among the banks in respect of the HelloPeter client feedback ratio. CIB successfully acquired the transactional accounts of
     the eThekwini and Ekurhuleni metropolitan municipalities, demonstrating our strong client relationships, deep skills base and innovative transactional
     banking solutions.

-    Optimise and invest: Our expense optimisation programme unlocked R915m of cost savings in 2015 through initiatives such as the rationalisation of
     RBB backoffice operations, the CIB integration and our strategy to decrease our core systems from 250 to 60, of which eight were decommissioned in
     2015 and 84 to date. In response to the evolving regulatory landscape and increasing cost of compliance, we centralised our regulatory change office
     to ensure economies of scale in terms of efficient delivery and cost management. Across the greater Old Mutual group in SA, Nedbank achieved
     R112m of synergies across costs and revenues. Old Mutual Emerging Markets incorporating Mutual & Federal outsourced their IT support to Nedbank
     on a commercial arm's length basis and this is projected to deliver a combined saving of more than R150m over a three-year period. We remain on
     track for delivery of the full R1bn of pretax run rate synergies in 2017, of which just under 30% should accrue to Nedbank.

-    Strategic portfolio tilt: Our focus on growing activities that generate EP, such as transactional deposits, transactional banking and investment in the
     rest of Africa, generated EP growth of 19,6% to R2 525m, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 93,9%, and earnings growth of 93,6% in our Rest of Africa Cluster.
     All this was achieved while maintaining strong balance sheet metrics, keeping impairments below our through-the-cycle range, and delivering
     dividend growth ahead of HEPS growth.

-    Pan-African banking network:

     -    In Central and West Africa our partnership approach through our strategic alliance and approximately 20% shareholding in ETI provides our
          clients with a pan-African transactional banking network across 39 countries and our shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the
          higher growth in the rest of Africa. Our close working relationship with Ecobank, supported by Ecobank's Johannesburg team co-locating into
          Nedbank's offices, resulted in the partnership's conclusion of three joint financing deals in 2015, and 74 of our wholesale clients now banking
          with Ecobank.

     -    In SADC and East Africa we continued to invest in our subsidiaries by implementing the Flexcube core banking system, launching new products
          and rolling out new distribution channels, including the 'branch of the future' format. In terms of our existing contractual agreements we will
          increase our stake in Banco Único to 50% plus one share at an estimated cost of R178,4m in the first half of 2016.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Economic conditions are unlikely to improve in 2016. The group's current forecast for 2016 GDP growth is 0,2%. Interest rates are expected to increase by
a cumulative 125 bps for 2016, having already increased by 50 bps in January in response to a higher inflation outlook caused by administered price
increases, higher food prices and the weaker rand.

Rising interest rates will increase borrowing costs and dampen consumer credit demand. Credit defaults are also expected to increase as a result of rising
rates as consumer debt levels remain high, with the job market unlikely to grow meaningfully in the short term. Transactional banking activity is
anticipated to grow modestly in line with consumer spending.

Growth in wholesale banking will continue to be limited by infrastructure constraints in SA, poor global demand and low international oil and commodity
prices. There remains pockets of growth in infrastructure as well as in renewable-energy projects. Sub-Saharan Africa will still represent an area of growth
for many SA corporates as indicated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its 2016 GDP growth forecast of 4,0% for the region.

PROSPECTS

Our guidance on financial performance for the full 2016 year is as follows:

-   Advances to grow at mid-to-upper single digits.
-   NIM to be in line with the 2015 level of 3,30%.
-   CLR to be within the revised through-the-cycle target range of 60 to 100 bps.
-   NIR (excluding fair-value adjustments) to grow above mid-single digits, prior to the consolidation of Banco Único.
-   Expenses to increase by mid to upper-single digits, prior to the consolidation of Banco Único.

In the current environment forecast risk remains elevated and as a result our guidance for performance in the year ahead is harder to formulate. In this
context we currently forecast that growth in DHEPS for 2016 will be lower than the growth we achieved in 2015 and below our medium-to-long-term
target of consumer price index + GDP growth + 5%. Given the increased forecast risk, we will update this guidance at the time of our June 2016 results.

Our medium-to-long-term targets remain unchanged, with the exception of the CLR through-the-cycle target range, which changed to between 0,6% and
1,0% from 0,8% and 1,2% of banking advances. The lower range reflects the change in advances mix towards a higher proportion of wholesale advances,
as well as the change in mix within Nedbank Retail towards a lower proportion of personal loans. At its peak, personal loans was 4,2% of total gross
advances and this has now reduced to 2,7%.The group's cost of equity for 2016 has been increased from 13,0% to 15,0% to capture the higher cost of
capital imputed by the increase in the SA long-bond yield during late 2015. We will take cognisance of this significant change in the cost of equity and
during 2016 we will review our medium-to-long -term target for ROE (excluding goodwill), being cost of equity + 5%.

Our medium-to-long-term targets and our current performance outlook for 2016 for these are as follows:

During the period the Nedbank Corporate and Nedbank Capital Clusters were merged to form the Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking Cluster.
Similarly, the Nedbank Retail and Nedbank Business Banking Clusters were merged to form the Nedbank Retail and Business Banking Cluster. The
comparative segment information previously presented for Nedbank Corporate, Nedbank Capital, Nedbank Retail and Nedbank Business Banking has been
represented based on the new merged clusters, ie Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking and Nedbank Retail and Business Banking. This had the
consequential effect that certain intergroup assets and liabilities and the related eliminations between Nedbank Retail and Business Banking and the
Centre have been restated.

The group, in the ordinary course of business, enters into transactions that expose it to tax, legal and business risks. Provisions are made for known liabilities that
are expected to materialise. Possible obligations and known liabilities where no reliable estimate can be made or it is considered improbable that an outflow would
result are reported as contingent liabilities. This is in accordance with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Limited and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at present.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Underlying the definition of fair value is an assumption that an entity is a going concern
without any intention or need to liquidate, to curtail materially the scale of its operations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms. Fair value is not,
therefore, the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.

The existence of published price quotations in an active market is the most reliable evidence of fair value and, where they exist, they are used to measure
the financial asset or financial liability. A market is considered to be active if transactions occur with sufficient volumes and frequencies to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis. These quoted prices would generally be classified as level 1 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy.

Where a quoted price does not represent fair value at the measurement date or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, the group
establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques include reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is
substantially the same in nature, reference to the value of the assets of underlying business, earnings multiples, discounted-cashflow analysis and various
option pricing models. Valuation techniques applied by the group would generally be classified as level 2 or level 3 in terms of the fair-value hierarchy. The
determination of whether an instrument is classified as level 2 or level 3 is dependent on the significance of observable inputs versus unobservable inputs
in relation to the fair value of the instrument. Inputs typically used in valuation techniques include discount rates, appropriate swap rates, volatility,
servicing costs, equity prices, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, and the group's own credit on financial liabilities.

The group has an established control framework for the measurement of fair value, which includes formalised review protocols for the independent review
and validation of fair values separate from the business unit entering into the transaction. The valuation methodologies, techniques and inputs applied to
the fair-value measurement of the financial instruments have been applied in a manner consistent with that of the previous financial year.

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY

The financial instruments recognised at fair value have been categorised into the three input levels of the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) fair-value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based on (directly or indirectly) market-observable inputs. Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs.
These factors may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product,
whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic).

Level 3: Valuation techniques based on significant inputs that are not observable. To the extent that a valuation is based on inputs that are not market-
observable the determination of the fair value can be more subjective, depending on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined on the basis of the best information available and may include reference to similar instruments, similar maturities,
appropriate proxies or other analytical techniques.

All fair values disclosed below are recurring in nature.

(3) R1 355m of provisions and other liabilities were previously included in the financial liabilities at amortised cost category within the categories of financial instruments. However, these balances are not within the scope of the IAS 39 categories of financial instruments. Therefore, this amount has been presented under non-financial assets,
 liabilities and equity and the comparative information has been restated to align with current year presentation.

(4) R4 171m of insurance contract liabilities were previously included in the designated at fair value through profit or loss category within the categories of financial instruments. However, these balances are accounted for in terms of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and thus are not within the scope of the IAS 39 categories of financial
 instruments. Therefore, insurance contract liabilities have been presented under non-financial assets, liabilities and equity and the comparative information has been restated to align with current year presentation.

- Designated – R2 802m

Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonable possible alternatives

The fair-value measurement of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that include assumptions that are not market observable. Where these scenarios apply, the group
performs stress testing on the fair value of the relevant instruments. In performing the stress testing, appropriate levels for the unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing
market evidence and in line with the group's approach to valuation control. The following information is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for
which valuation is dependent on unobservable input parameters and which are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value.

2015 and ratings action on the South African banks, including the ratings of Nedbank Group
and Nedbank. Fitch Ratings has downgraded the group and Nedbank’s long-term currency
ratings by one notch to BBB- (from BBB) with a stable outlook; and affirmed our national
ratings at AA (zaf).

sovereign which was downgraded on 4 December 2015 and references Fitch Ratings’
