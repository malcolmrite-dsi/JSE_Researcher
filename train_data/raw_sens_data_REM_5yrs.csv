SUMMARY OF AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND CASH DIVIDEND
DECLARATION

SALIENT FEATURES
• Total headline earnings per share: down by 61.3% to 560.6 cents
• Headline earnings per share from continuing operations: down by 68.7% to 307.5 cents
• Earnings per share: down by 9.1% to 1 176.4 cents
• Ordinary dividend per share: down by 53.0% to 265 cents
• Intrinsic net asset value per share as at 30 June 2020: R154.47

COVID-19
The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures have brought desperation and devastation upon millions.
In South Africa, lives and livelihoods have been lost, with household finances decimated and many going hungry in
large parts of our country. This crisis is one of unknown unknowns and managing the crisis is the number one priority
for Remgro and all of our investee companies. Our focus is on the factors within our control, the health and well-being
of our people, ensuring that our investments have the most robust financial positions to support business continuity and
making sure that underlying investee companies that are in a position to offer help to the country are enabled to do so.

RESULTS
For the year to 30 June 2020, total headline earnings decreased by 61.4% from R8 195 million to R3 167 million, while
total headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 61.3% from 1 448.9 cents to 560.6 cents. As a result of the
unbundling of Remgro’s 28.2% interest in RMB Holdings Limited (RMH) (RMH Unbundling), headline earnings is also
presented for continuing operations and discontinued operations. The investment in RMH is treated as a discontinued
operation and, accordingly, discontinued operations include the equity accounted income of RMH. For the year under
review the investment in RMH was equity accounted for the nine months to 31 March 2020 (2019: twelve months to
30 June 2019). Headline earnings and HEPS from continuing operations decreased by 68.7% from R5 551 million to
R1 737 million and from 981.4 cents to 307.5 cents, respectively. Headline earnings and HEPS from discontinued
operations decreased by 45.9% from R2 644 million to R1 430 million and from 467.5 cents to 253.1 cents, respectively.

The decrease in headline earnings from continuing operations is mainly due to the negative impact that the Covid-19
pandemic and the resultant lockdown measures had on the earnings of Rand Merchant Investment Holdings Limited,
FirstRand Limited, Total South Africa Proprietary Limited, Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited, Distell Group
Holdings Limited and RCL Foods Limited, as well as lower interest income, increased losses from Community
Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited as they expand their fibre network footprint, organically and
acquisitively, and a once-off donation of R500 million to The South African SME Relief Trust (Sukuma donation).

INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE
Remgro’s intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 33.7% from R233.03 at 30 June 2019 to R154.47 at
30 June 2020. The decrease reflects the impact of the RMH Unbundling and the negative impact of the Covid-19
pandemic on market values (listeds) and fair values (unlisteds) of underlying investee companies. The closing share
price at 30 June 2020 was R99.90 (2019: R187.90) representing a discount of 35.3% (2019: 19.4%) to the intrinsic net
asset value.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 40
Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 50 cents (2019: 349 cents) per share has been declared out of
income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par
value, for the year ended 30 June 2020. The final dividend was adjusted downwards to take into account the RMH
Unbundling and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 10 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 40 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate
in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2020 therefore amounts to 265 cents, compared to
564 cents for the year ended 30 June 2019.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares. The
income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.

“unclaimed” in the share register until the shareholder provides the Transfer Secretaries with the relevant banking details
for payout.

TRADING STATEMENT

Paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”)
requires companies to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that their
financial results for the period to be reported upon next, will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

Remgro’s results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are due to be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on or about 28 September 2020. As a result of the unbundling of Remgro’s 28.2% interest in
RMB Holdings Limited (“RMH”), headline earnings is also presented for continuing operations and
discontinued operations. The investment in RMH is treated as a discontinued operation and
accordingly, discontinued operations include the equity accounted income of RMH. For the year
under review the investment in RMH was equity accounted for the nine months to 31 March 2020
(2019: twelve months to 30 June 2019).

In compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the following guidance is provided to Remgro
shareholders regarding the expected outcome for the year ended 30 June 2020:

                                                      Year ended       Guidance for the year ended

 Total headline earnings per share                       1 448.9       55% - 65%       507.1 – 652.0
 Headline earnings per share from continuing
 operations                                                981.4       65% - 75%        245.4 – 343.5

The decrease in headline earnings from continuing operations is mainly due to the negative impact
that the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown measures had on the earnings of most of
Remgro’s underlying investee companies.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

UNBUNDLING OF SHAREHOLDING IN RMB HOLDINGS LIMITED (""RMH""), CASH PROCEEDS IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL
ENTITLEMENTS AND APPORTIONMENT OF TAX COST FOR SOUTH AFRICAN TAX PURPOSES

1. Introduction

Holders of Remgro no par value ordinary shares and Remgro unlisted no par value B ordinary shares (""Remgro
Shareholders"") are referred to the detailed terms and finalisation announcements released by Remgro on the Stock
Exchange News Service on 14 April 2020 and 26 May 2020 respectively, regarding the unbundling by way of a dividend in
specie of the 397,447,747 shares in RMH (the ""Unbundled RMH Shares"") to Remgro Shareholders. Remgro Shareholders
will, pursuant to the dividend in specie, become entitled to Unbundled RMH Shares in the ratio of 0.69939 Unbundled RMH
Shares for every 1 share held in Remgro (""Remgro Shares"") (the ""Remgro Unbundling""). The Remgro Unbundling constitutes
an unbundling transaction in terms of section 46 of the South African Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 (""Income Tax Act"").

2. Purpose of the announcement

The purpose of this announcement is to notify Remgro Shareholders of the following:

   -   The value to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to a Remgro Shareholder in respect of any fractional
       entitlements (""Cash Proceeds"");
   -   The closing prices of both the Unbundled RMH Shares and Remgro Shares on Wednesday, 3 June 2020, the day the
       Remgro Shares begin trading ""ex"" the entitlement to receive the Unbundled RMH Shares; and
   -   The ratio in which the expenditure incurred and / or the market value (for purposes of paragraph 29 of the Eighth
       Schedule to the Income Tax Act) (""Market Value"") in respect of the Remgro Shares must be apportioned between
       the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares for South African taxation purposes (""Apportionment Ratio"").

3. Cash Proceeds of fractional entitlement

As outlined in paragraph 4 of the detailed terms announcement, in implementing the Remgro Unbundling, Remgro is
required by the Listing Requirements of the JSE Limited (""Listing Requirements"") to round down the fractional entitlements
to Unbundled RMH Shares to the nearest whole number. The fractions of Unbundled RMH Shares to which Remgro
Shareholders remain entitled, will not be transferred to them but will be aggregated and sold on the Remgro Shareholders’
behalf in the open market as soon as practically possible after the Remgro Unbundling.

Remgro Shareholders will accordingly receive a monetary amount (i.e. the Cash Proceeds) in respect of their fractional
entitlements to Unbundled RMH Shares. In accordance with the Listing Requirements, the Cash Proceeds have now been
determined with reference to the volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") of an Unbundled RMH Share on the securities
exchange operated by the JSE Limited on Wednesday, 3 June 2020 reduced by 10%.

Taking into account the VWAP of ZAR59.00264, Remgro Shareholders are advised that the calculation of the Cash Proceeds
due to Shareholders in respect of any fractional entitlements will be based on a price of ZAR53.10237 (i.e. ZAR59.00264 x
0.9) per Unbundled RMH Share.

4. Apportionment Ratio tax principles

Remgro Shareholders will have a combined expenditure in respect of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares
received pursuant to the Remgro Unbundling.

Remgro Shares held as trading stock: Any Remgro Shareholder holding Remgro Shares as trading stock will be deemed to
acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure of such Remgro Shares and Unbundled RMH
Shares will be the amount taken into account by the Remgro Shareholder in respect of those Remgro Shares, as contemplated
in section 11(a), section 22(1), or section 22(2) of the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure to be
allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the Market Value of the Unbundled
RMH Shares bears to the sum of the Market Value of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares at the end of the
day of the Remgro Unbundling, being Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The expenditure so allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares
will reduce the expenditure relating to the retained Remgro Shares.

Remgro Shares held as capital assets: Any Remgro Shareholder holding Remgro Shares as capital assets will be deemed to
acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as capital assets. The combined expenditure of such Remgro Shares and Unbundled
RMH Shares will be the original expenditure incurred in respect of the Remgro Shares, that is allowable in terms of paragraph
20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and where the Remgro Shares were acquired before 1 October 2001, the
expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be, adopted or determined as contemplated in paragraph 29 of the Eighth
Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be,
to be allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the Market Value of the
Unbundled RMH Shares bear to the sum of the Market Value of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares at the
end of the day of the Remgro Unbundling, being Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case
may be, so allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will reduce the expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be,
of the retained Remgro Shares.

Remgro Shareholders are advised to consult their own professional tax advisors should they have any queries regarding the
taxation consequences of the Remgro Unbundling and the calculation of their costs for taxation purposes.

5. Apportionment Ratio calculation

Shareholders are further referred to paragraph 9 of the detailed terms announcement, which require Remgro to advise
Remgro Shareholders of the Apportionment Ratio.

Shareholders are hereby advised that the Apportionment Ratio is based on the closing price of ZAR110.80 per Remgro Share
and ZAR59.94 per Unbundled RMH Share on Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The Apportionment Ratio applicable to the Unbundled
RMH Shares has therefore been calculated as follows:

Apportionment Ratio = (A / (A + B))
Where –
A = the closing price of an Unbundled RMH Share x the unbundling ratio, i.e. ZAR41.92 (being ZAR59.94 X 0.69939);
B = the closing price of a Remgro Share, i.e. ZAR110.80
= (ZAR 41.92 / (ZAR41.92 + ZAR110.80))
= 27.44961%

Shareholders are hereby advised that the expenditure incurred and/or Market Value, as the case may be, in respect of
Remgro shares must therefore be apportioned in the ratio of 27.44961% to an Unbundled RMH Share and 72.55039% to a
Remgro Share.

1. Introduction

   Remgro Shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcements released on
   the Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 19 November 2019, 7 January 2020
   and 18 February 2020 relating, inter alia, to the in-principle decision by
   Remgro to pursue the distribution, in full or in part, of its shareholding in
   RMH and FirstRand Limited (""FirstRand"") to Remgro Shareholders. Concurrently
   with Remgro's cautionary announcements, RMH proposed the distribution by RMH
   of its FirstRand shares to its shareholders (""RMH Unbundling"") as part of a
   restructuring of the RMH portfolio of assets and liabilities.

   Remgro Shareholders are further referred to the cautionary announcement
   released on SENS on 31 March 2020 in terms of which Remgro Shareholders were
   advised that the board of directors of Remgro (""Board"") had resolved to proceed
   with the distribution of Remgro's 28.2% interest in RMH to Remgro Shareholders
   (the ""Remgro Unbundling""), but to retain Remgro's 3.9% direct interest in
   FirstRand.

   Remgro Shareholders are also referred to the terms announcement released by
   RMH concurrently with this announcement in which RMH has advised RMH
   shareholders that it intends distributing its entire shareholding in FirstRand
   to RMH shareholders by way of a distribution in specie. Following the
   implementation of the RMH Unbundling, RMH will remain listed, with its property
   portfolio as its sole remaining asset.

   The purpose of this announcement is to provide Remgro Shareholders with
   detailed information regarding the implementation of the Remgro Unbundling.

2. Rationale

   Remgro constantly evaluates the optimal composition of its investment portfolio
   to ensure that it remains an attractive and appropriately rated permanent
   capital investment vehicle for investors. It is important to Remgro to ensure
   that the portfolio composition is shaped by a long-term perspective on
   shareholder value creation. Key considerations in this context include the
   level of maturity, independence and the size of an investment relative to the
   size of the overall Remgro portfolio.
   
   As RMH has developed into a large, mature, independently run business of scale
   with an overweight contribution to the Remgro portfolio, Remgro is of the
   opinion that the Remgro Unbundling will unlock significant value for Remgro
   Shareholders. The Remgro Unbundling also presents an opportunity to rebalance
   the maturity of Remgro's remaining investment portfolio, as well as the
   relative contribution of the remaining portfolio investments to enable greater
   impact and shareholder value creation.

   The Remgro Unbundling has significant benefits for Remgro Shareholders,
   including, inter alia:
    -   Reducing the underlying discount to net asset value that the Remgro shares
        currently trade at by reducing the three listed entry points into the
        underlying operations via FirstRand, RMH and Remgro;
    -   Giving Remgro Shareholders direct access to RMH shares and the dividends
        payable in respect thereof; and
    -   Enabling Remgro Shareholders to participate in the RMH Unbundling pursuant
        to which FirstRand shares will be distributed to them.

   Remgro's direct 3.9% interest in FirstRand will be retained to provide
   additional balance sheet capacity that will support growth in Remgro’s existing
   portfolio, as well as its ability to pursue new opportunities that may arise.

3. Key terms of the Remgro Unbundling

   Remgro will distribute all its RMH Shares (comprising 397,447,747 ordinary
   shares) (the ""Unbundled RMH Shares"") on a pro-rata basis to all the Remgro
   Shareholders as a dividend in specie.

   Remgro Shareholders will receive 0.69939 Unbundled RMH Shares for every 1
   Remgro share held on the Record Date (as defined in paragraph 11 below). The
   transfer of the Unbundled RMH Shares will result in fractional entitlements,
   which is explained in more detail in paragraph 4 below.

   The Remgro Unbundling will result in Remgro Shareholders holding a direct
   interest in RMH. As direct shareholders of RMH, Remgro Shareholders will be
   entitled to participate in the RMH Unbundling.

   The detailed tax implications of the Remgro Unbundling are set out in paragraph
   9 below.

4. Fractional entitlements, cash proceeds and applicable rate

   In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, fractional entitlements will
   be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The aggregated excess fractions
   of the Unbundled RMH Shares to which Remgro Shareholders will remain entitled,
   will be sold in the market, on the Remgro Shareholders’ behalf, as soon as
   practicable after the Remgro Unbundling. The cash proceeds of the sale of the
   fractional entitlements (""Cash Proceeds"") will be paid to the relevant Remgro
   Shareholders on the basis set out below, net of any applicable taxes (such as
   Securities Transfer Tax (""STT"")) and costs.

   Cash Proceeds due to Remgro Shareholders will be determined at a 10% discount
   to the VWAP of RMH Shares on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (""JSE"") on
   Wednesday, 3 June 2020, being the day on which Remgro shares will begin to
   trade 'ex' the entitlement to receive the Unbundled RMH Shares. The actual
   price used to calculate the Cash Proceeds will be announced on SENS on Thursday,
   4 June 2020, by 11h00.

5. Financial effects

   Based on Remgro’s unaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
   the pro forma financial effects of the Remgro Unbundling on the earnings per
   share (""EPS""); diluted EPS, headline earnings per share (""HEPS""); diluted HEPS,
   HEPS, excluding option remeasurement, diluted HEPS, excluding option
   remeasurement; net asset value per share (""NAV""); net tangible asset value per
   share (""NTAV"") and intrinsic NAV per share (""INAV"") of Remgro, are set out
   below.

   These financial effects are prepared for illustrative purposes only to assist
   Remgro Shareholders to assess the impact of the Remgro Unbundling but, because
   of their nature, may not give a fair presentation of the effect of the Remgro
   Unbundling on Remgro’s results of operations.

   The summarised pro forma financial effects have been prepared in a manner
   consistent in all respects with International Financial Reporting Standards
   (""IFRS""), the accounting policies adopted by Remgro as at 31 December 2019 and
   the JSE Listings Requirements. The summarised pro forma financial effects have
   not been audited, or reported on, by Remgro’s auditors or reporting
   accountants.

   The pro forma financial effects are the responsibility of the Board. The
   material assumptions used in the preparation of the pro forma financial effects
   are set out in the notes following the table below.

Notes:
1.     The pro forma financial effects are based on the unaudited financial
       results of Remgro for the six months ended 31 December 2019. The
       financial impact on the earnings of Remgro are illustrated as if the
       Remgro Unbundling had been completed on 1 July 2019, while the impact
       on the net assets of Remgro are shown as if the Remgro Unbundling had
       been implemented on 31 December 2019.
2.     The following common assumptions have been used in the calculation of
       the pro forma financial information:
          a. A FirstRand share price of R62.80 at 31 December 2019; and
          b. An RMH share price of R80.44 at 31 December 2019.
3.     As a result of the Remgro Unbundling, Remgro ceases to have significant
       influence in FirstRand and would therefore have to derecognise its
       FirstRand equity accounted investment and account for it as a financial
       asset at fair value through other comprehensive income (the “FirstRand
       Reclassification”). The pro forma income statement effects represent
       the dividends received from FirstRand and the reversal of Remgro's
       attributable portion of FirstRand’s and RMH’s equity accounted earnings
       for the six months ended 31 December 2019, as well as the profit realised
       on the Remgro Unbundling and FirstRand Reclassification
4.     The statement of financial position effects represent the profit
       realised on the Remgro Unbundling and FirstRand Reclassification as
       described above, as well as the dividend in specie.
5.     The financial effects set out above have been prepared based on IFRS
       and interpretations of IFRS applicable at 31 December 2019.

6. Information relating to RMH

   RMH is an investment holding company with a track record of investing in
   disruptive and entrepreneurial financial services businesses.

   RMH was listed on the JSE in 1992 as a vehicle to allow investors to co-invest
   with the founders of Rand Merchant Bank, and since then has played a significant
   role in the establishment and growth of some of South Africa’s most iconic
   financial services businesses, including FirstRand, Discovery, Momentum
   Metropolitan and OUTsurance.

   In 2011, RMH's insurance interests (Discovery, Momentum Metropolitan and
   OUTsurance) were separately listed as Rand Merchant Investment Holdings
   Limited. Since then RMH has been an investment vehicle into FirstRand, one of
   South Africa’s most successful financial services groups. RMH is the largest
   shareholder in FirstRand.

   During July 2016 RMH expanded its investment strategy to include a property
   investment business alongside its 34% investment in FirstRand. This involved
   establishing a diversified portfolio of scalable entrepreneur-led businesses
   with proven track records in managing and growing property portfolios.

   For further detailed information on RMH, Remgro Shareholders are referred to
   the annual report of RMH for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 and the
   unaudited interim results of RMH for the six-month period ended 31 December
   2019, both of which can be accessed on RMH's website (www.rmh-online.co.za).

7. Condition precedent

   The implementation of the Remgro Unbundling is subject to the fulfilment, or
   waiver, as the case may be, of the condition precedent that by no later than
   30 April 2020 the Ontario Securities Commission has granted an exemption from
   the prospectus requirement of section 53 of the Securities Act (Ontario) in
   connection with the Remgro Unbundling.

8. Exchange Control Regulation

   The Unbundled RMH Shares are not freely transferable from the common monetary
   area and must be dealt with in terms of the South African Exchange Control
   Regulations, 1961 (as amended) (""Exchange Control Regulations""). The following
   summary of the Exchange Control Regulations is intended as a guide only and
   is not a comprehensive statement of the Exchange Control Regulations or advice.
   Remgro Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding the Exchange Control
   Regulations should contact their own professional advisers. This summary is
   based on the laws and regulations as in force and as applied in practice as
   at the date hereof and is subject to changes to those laws and regulations and
   practices subsequent to such date.

   8.1 Emigrants from the Common Monetary Area consisting of South Africa, the
   Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and eSwatini (""CMA"")

   Any share certificates that may be issued by RMH to emigrants from the CMA
   will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange Control
   Regulations.
   
   Uncertificated Unbundled RMH Shares will be credited directly to the emigrants’
   respective emigrant share accounts at the CSDP or broker controlling their
   remaining portfolios and an appropriate electronic entry will be made in the
   relevant register reflecting a “non-resident” endorsement. The CSDP or broker
   will ensure that the emigrant adheres to the Exchange Control Regulations.

   Any Unbundled RMH Shares and/or securities issued in certificated form, cash
   dividends and residual cash payments based on emigrants’ Unbundled RMH Shares
   and/or securities controlled in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations will
   be forwarded to the authorised dealer in foreign exchange controlling their
   remaining assets.

   8.2 Residents outside of the CMA

   Any share certificates that may be issued by RMH to non-residents of the CMA
   will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange Control
   Regulations.

   Uncertificated Unbundled RMH Shares and/or securities will be credited directly
   to the non-resident’s non-resident share accounts at the CSDP or broker
   controlling their portfolios and an appropriate electronic entry will be made
   in the relevant register reflecting a ""non-resident"" endorsement. The CSDP or
   broker will ensure that the non-resident adheres to the Exchange Control
   Regulations.

   Any Cash Proceeds payable to non-resident Remgro Shareholders in relation to
   their fractional entitlements are freely transferable from South Africa,
   subject to being converted into a currency other than Rand or paid for the
   credit of a non-resident Rand account.

9. Taxation

   The following summary describes the tax consequences of the Remgro Unbundling
   that may apply to Remgro Shareholders generally. This summary is based on the
   laws as in force and as applied in practice as at the date hereof and is
   subject to changes to those laws and practices subsequent to such date.

   In the case of persons who are non-residents of South Africa for tax purposes,
   this summary should be read in conjunction with the provisions of any
   applicable double tax agreement between South Africa and their country of
   residence. Remgro and its advisers cannot be held responsible for the taxation
   consequences that the Remgro Unbundling may have on individual Remgro
   Shareholders and therefore if you are in any doubt about your tax position you
   should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser.

   The Remgro Unbundling will constitute a disposal by Remgro of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares to Remgro Shareholders. It is intended that the disposal will be
   implemented in terms of section 46 of the Income Tax Act, which allows for a
   tax neutral implementation of the Remgro Unbundling from an income tax, Capital
   Gains Tax (""CGT""), dividend tax and STT perspective, including the following
   concessions for Shareholders:

   9.1 Remgro shares held as trading stock

   Remgro Shareholders holding Remgro shares as trading stock will be deemed to
   acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as trading stock through a dividend in specie
   that must be disregarded for dividends tax purposes. The distribution must
   also not be treated as a return of capital for the purposes of paragraph 76B
   of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

   The original expenditure incurred in respect of the Remgro shares will be
   apportioned between the Unbundled RMH Shares and the Remgro shares based on a
   ratio that is determined with reference to the respective closing prices of
   the shares in RMH and Remgro on the first business day after the LDT Date (as
   defined in paragraph 11 below).

   9.2 Remgro shares held as capital assets

   Remgro Shareholders holding Remgro shares as capital assets will be deemed to
   acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as capital assets through a dividend in specie
   that must be disregarded for dividends tax purposes. The distribution must
   also not be treated as a return of capital for the purposes of paragraph 76B
   of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

   The CGT 'base cost' of the Remgro shares in the hands of Remgro Shareholders
   immediately before the Remgro Unbundling will be apportioned between the
   Unbundled RMH Shares and the Remgro shares based on a ratio that is determined
   with reference to the respective closing prices of the shares in RMH and Remgro
   on the first business day after the LDT Date (as defined in paragraph 11
   below).

   Remgro Shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the Unbundled RMH Shares
   on the date on which the Remgro shares were originally acquired.

   9.3 Apportionment ratios to be used

   Remgro will advise Remgro Shareholders of the relevant apportionment ratios
   to be used to determine their tax cost bases in the Remgro shares and the
   Unbundled RMH Shares by way of an announcement to be released on SENS on the
   second business day after the LDT Date (as defined in paragraph 11 below).

   These ratios must be used in the determination of any income or capital gains
   or losses (as the case may be), derived on any future disposals of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares or Remgro shares.

10. Foreign Shareholders

   The following summary describes the restrictions applicable to Remgro
   Shareholders in terms of the Remgro Unbundling who have registered addresses
   outside South Africa and/or who are nationals, citizens or residents of
   countries other than South Africa (""Overseas Shareholders"") or who are persons
   (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) who have a
   contractual or legal obligation to forward this announcement to a jurisdiction
   outside South Africa, or who hold Remgro shares for the account or benefit of
   any such Overseas Shareholder and will therefore hold RMH in a similar manner
   and hence may have an impact on Remgro Shareholders.

   The Remgro Unbundling will be implemented as a pro-rata distribution in specie
   for no consideration to all Remgro Shareholders recorded as such in the
   register of Remgro on the Record Date.

   It is the responsibility of any Overseas Shareholder (including, without
   limitation, nominees, agents and trustees for such persons) being notified by
   this announcement of the Remgro Unbundling and wishing to have their Unbundled
   RMH Shares transferred to them in terms of the Remgro Unbundling to satisfy
   themselves in respect of the applicable laws in their territory, including
   obtaining any requisite governmental or other consents, observing any other
   requisite laws, requirements or formalities and paying any issue, transfer or
   other taxes due in such territories.

   Accordingly, persons (including, without limitation, nominees, agents and
   trustees) being notified in terms of this announcement should not distribute
   or send the announcement to any person in, or citizen or resident of, or
   otherwise into any jurisdiction where to do so would or might contravene
   applicable law or regulation, including local securities laws or regulations.
   Any person who does distribute this announcement into any such territory
   (whether under a contractual or legal obligation or otherwise) should draw the
   recipient’s attention to the contents of this paragraph.

   Remgro reserves the right, but shall not be obliged, to treat as invalid any
   transfer of Unbundled RMH Shares in terms of the Remgro Unbundling, which
   appears to Remgro or its agents to have been executed, effected or dispatched
   in a manner which may involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations
   of any jurisdiction; or if Remgro believes (in its discretion) or its agents
   believe that the same may violate applicable legal or regulatory requirements;
   or if Remgro believes (in its discretion) that it is prohibited or unduly
   onerous or impractical to transfer the RMH Shares to such Overseas Shareholder
   in terms of the Remgro Unbundling.

   If an Overseas Shareholder is of the view that the transfer of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares in terms of the Remgro Unbundling to such Overseas Shareholder may
   involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations or violate applicable
   legal or regulatory requirements, such Overseas Shareholder must as soon as
   reasonably practicable notify their CSDP or broker of such fact or
   circumstance.

   Remgro shall be entitled (in its discretion), including in either of the
   aforementioned instances, to do all things necessary or desirable to ensure
   compliance with applicable law and/or regulation including selling the
   Unbundled RMH Shares that would otherwise have been transferred to the Overseas
   Shareholder under the Remgro Unbundling on behalf of the Overseas Shareholder
   and at their risk, with the net proceeds of such sale (after deduction of any
   applicable taxes which may in this instance include STT, withholdings or costs)
   to be paid to the Overseas Shareholder. In this regard, the Unbundled RMH
   Shares may be aggregated and disposed of on the JSE in an orderly manner by
   the Remgro transfer secretaries on behalf of and for the benefit of such
   Overseas Shareholders as soon as is reasonably practical after the
   implementation of the Remgro Unbundling at the best price that can reasonably
   be obtained at the time of sale.

REMGRO’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

The majority of South African Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are experiencing financial and
operational stress due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent lockdown, further exacerbating the lack
of economic growth.

The Remgro Management Board has voluntarily decided to forego 30% of their salary for the months
of April, May and June 2020. The savings to the Company generated from this reduction in salaries will
be paid by the Company to the Sukuma Relief Programme, an initiative aimed at supporting SMEs, and
administered by Business Partners Limited.

FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on 19 November 2019, 7 January 2020 and 18 February 2020 relating, inter alia, to
the proposed distribution by RMB Holdings Limited (""RMH"") of its FirstRand Limited
(""FirstRand"") shares to RMH shareholders (""RMH Distribution”) as part of a restructuring of the
RMH portfolio of assets and liabilities (“the RMH Restructuring”) and the in-principle decision
by Remgro to pursue the distribution, in full or in part, to its shareholders of Remgro's exposure
to RMH and FirstRand (the ""Remgro Distribution"").

Shareholders are further referred to the RMH announcement released concurrently with this
announcement in which RMH advised its shareholders that, although still committed to the
RMH Restructuring, given the unprecedented market turmoil being experienced in South Africa
and globally as a result of Covid-19, the RMH Board is currently assessing the optimal timing
and detailed transaction steps required to give effect to the RMH Restructuring.

Remgro is supportive of the RMH Board’s process to finalise the terms of the RMH
Restructuring under these circumstances.

With regards to the Remgro Distribution, and having taken cognisance of the current market
conditions, the Remgro Board has resolved that it will, subject to the relevant regulatory
approvals, proceed with the full distribution of its 28.2% interest in RMH to its shareholders.
The Remgro Board has further resolved to retain its 3.9% direct interest in FirstRand in order
to provide additional balance sheet capacity to support growth in Remgro’s existing portfolio
and its ability to pursue new opportunities that may arise.

Remgro will publish the detailed terms of the Remgro Distribution by no later than 14 April
2020 and shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
company’s securities, until a detailed announcement is made.

SALIENT FEATURES

• Headline earnings per share, excluding option remeasurement: +2.4% to 750.7 cents
• Earnings per share: -57.9% to 766.3 cents
• Intrinsic net asset value per share as at 31 December 2019: R240.93
• Interim dividend per share sustained: 215 cents

RESULTS

Introduction
Shareholders are reminded that this report is based on the actual results for the six months ended 31 December 2019.
Therefore, this report does not reflect the current market conditions and must be read in that context.

Headline earnings
For the period under review, headline earnings decreased by 0.4% from R4 259 million to R4 242 million, while headline
earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 0.2% from 752.1 cents to 750.9 cents.

Included in headline earnings for the period under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to R1 million
(2018: R106 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders’ exchange option of the exchangeable bonds
(option remeasurement). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline earnings increased by 2.1% from
R4 153 million to R4 241 million, whereas HEPS increased by 2.4% from 733.4 cents to 750.7 cents. The increase in
headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher earnings from Mediclinic International plc,
Siqalo Foods Proprietary Limited, the banking platform and Total South Africa Proprietary Limited. The increase is
partly offset by lower contributions from Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited, Rand Merchant
Investment Holdings Limited and Grindrod Limited, as well as lower interest income.

INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

Remgro’s intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 3.4% from R233.03 at 30 June 2019 to R240.93 at
31 December 2019. The closing share price at 31 December 2019 was R195.00 (30 June 2019: R187.90) representing
a discount of 19.1% (30 June 2019: 19.4%) to the intrinsic net asset value.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 39

Notice is hereby given that an interim gross dividend of 215 cents (2018: 215 cents) per share has been declared out
of income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par
value, for the six months ended 31 December 2019.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 43 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 172 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced
rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares.
The income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 15 April 2020, and Friday,

In terms of the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation, dividends will only be transferred electronically to the bank
accounts of shareholders, while dividend cheques are no longer issued. In the instance where shareholders do not
provide the Transfer Secretaries with their banking details, the dividend will not be forfeited, but will be marked as
“unclaimed” in the share register until the shareholder provides the Transfer Secretaries with the relevant banking details
for payout.

RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on 19 November 2019 and on 7 January 2020 relating, inter alia, to the proposed
distribution by RMB Holdings Limited (""RMH"") of its FirstRand Limited (""FirstRand"") shares to
RMH shareholders (""RMH Distribution"") and the corresponding proposed distribution by
Remgro, in full or in part, of Remgro's exposure to RMH and FirstRand, to Remgro
shareholders (""Remgro Distribution"").

CHANGE IN FUNCTION OF DIRECTORS

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, the following information is disclosed:

On 28 November 2019 the Remgro Board of directors appointed
Mr Fred Robertson, a current Remgro independent non-executive
director, as co-deputy chairman with Mr Josua Malherbe, who is the
current deputy chairman.

It was the Company's previously stated intention (per the Stock
Exchange News Service announcement dated 19 September 2019) to
amend its Board Charter to provide for only one deputy chairman.
On reflection, Remgro has determined that Mr Robertson will bring
valuable insight, skills and experience to the deputy chairman
role. The Board Charter will accordingly remain unchanged.

Mr Phillip Jabulani Moleketi has been appointed as a member of the
Remuneration   and   Nomination   Committee   with   effect   from
28 November 2019.

CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT
Shareholders' attention is drawn to the cautionary announcement published today by RMB
Holdings Limited (""RMH""), which relates to the proposed restructuring of RMH's portfolio of
assets and liabilities, including a distribution of its FirstRand Limited (""FirstRand"") shares to
RMH shareholders (the ""RMH Distribution"").

In parallel with this, the board of Remgro has resolved, in principle, to pursue the distribution
to shareholders, in full or in part, of Remgro's exposure to RMH and FirstRand (the ""Remgro
Distribution"").

The mechanism and steps required to effect such distributions are the subject of further
evaluation and consideration by the board of Remgro. The boards of RMH and Remgro have
further agreed to work together to determine the most practical and effective way to
implement the Remgro Distribution and the RMH Distribution.

The RMH Distribution and the Remgro Distribution will be subject to customary conditions
precedent, including receipt of the requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals. A detailed
announcement is expected to be made before the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Accordingly, Remgro shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in Remgro's
securities until a detailed announcement is made.

SUMMARY OF AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019 AND CASH DIVIDEND
DECLARATION

SALIENT FEATURES
* Headline earnings per share: -4.2% to 1 448.9 cents
* Headline earnings per share, excluding option remeasurement: -2.6% to 1 429.1 cents
* Earnings per share: -18.0% to 1 294.0 cents
* Intrinsic net asset value per share as at 30 June 2019: R233.03
* Ordinary dividend per share: +6.0% to 564 cents

RESULTS

Headline earnings
For the year to 30 June 2019 headline earnings decreased by 4.4% from R8 573 million to R8 195 million, while
headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 4.2% from 1 512.6 cents to 1 448.9 cents.

Included in headline earnings for the year under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to R112 million
(2018: R261 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders' exchange option of the exchangeable bonds
(option remeasurement). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline earnings decreased by 2.8% from
R8 312 million to R8 083 million, whereas HEPS decreased by 2.6% from 1 466.5 cents to 1 429.1 cents. The decrease
in headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is mainly due to lower earnings from RCL Foods Limited,
Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited, Total South Africa Proprietary Limited and the exclusion
of Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited due to its disposal. The decrease is partly offset by the inclusion
of Siqalo Foods Proprietary Limited and a higher contribution from the banking platform, as well as higher interest
income.

INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 9.3% from R256.97 at 30 June 2018 to R233.03 at
30 June 2019. The closing share price at 30 June 2019 was R187.90 (2018: R204.29) representing a discount of 19.4%
(2018: 20.5%) to the intrinsic net asset value.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 38

Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 349 cents (2018: 328 cents) per share has been declared out of
income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par
value, for the year ended 30 June 2019.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 69.8 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 279.2 cents
per share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced
rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2019 therefore amounts to 564 cents, compared to
532 cents for the year ended 30 June 2018.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares. The
income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.

(1.) The amounts previously reported in the Income Statement for six months ended 31 December 2017 for ""inventory
     expenses"" and ""other net operating expenses"" were restated. Previously ""inventory expenses"" were incorrectly
     understated and ""other net operating expenses"" incorrectly overstated by R1 298 million. The restatement had no
     impact on trading profit, earnings or headline earnings.
(2.) On 30 June 2018 the investment in Unilever was transferred from ""investments - equity accounted"" to ""assets held
     for sale"" (refer to the section dealing with ""Investment activities""). Profit from discontinued operations consists of the
     equity accounted earnings of Unilever as well as the profit on its subsequent disposal. The six months ended
     31 December 2017 has been represented accordingly.

Fair value remeasurements
The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale, at fair value through other comprehensive income, at fair value through
  profit and loss and investment in money market funds: fair value is based on quoted market prices or, in the
  case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow, liquidation
  valuation and actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: the fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation
  methodologies and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability,
            either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table illustrates the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value,
by hierarchy level:

Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 509 million and R241 million respectively. These investments
are all valued based on the fair value of each investment's underlying assets, which are valued using a variety of
valuation methodologies. Listed entities are valued at the last quoted share price on the reporting date, whereas
unlisted entities' valuation methods include discounted cash flow valuations, appropriate earnings and revenue
multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (21%), cash and cash equivalents (1%), and unlisted
investments (78%). Unlisted investments included at transaction prices in Milestone's fair value amounted to
R543 million, while its remaining six unlisted investments were valued at R634 million. PRIF's main assets are the
investments in ETG Group, Octotel, RSAWeb, Lumos Global and GPR Leasing. ETG Group was valued at its last
traded price used for the acquisition of an interest by a third party, while the other investments were valued using
the discounted cash flow method.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on
Remgro's financial statements as the underlying assets of the funds in which Remgro made its investments are
widely spread.

1.        ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          The interim report is prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of
          International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, and the
          SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
          Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and in accordance with the
          requirements of the Companies Act (No. 71 of 2008), as amended, and the Listings Requirements of the
          JSE Limited. The financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Chief Financial
          Officer, Neville Williams CA(SA). The interim report has not been audited or reviewed.

          These financial statements incorporate accounting policies that are consistent with those of the previous
          financial periods, with the exception of the implementation of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments and IFRS 15:
          Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Refer to ""Change in accounting policies"" for further detail on the
          implementation of these standards and amendments.

          During the period under review various other interpretations and amendments became effective, but their
          implementation had no impact on the results of either the current or prior periods.

2.        CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          This section explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments and IFRS 15: Revenue
          from Contracts with Customers on the Group's financial statements.

     A.   Impact of the adoption of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
          IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of
          financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets
          and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 was adopted without restating comparative information in accordance with
          the transitional provisions (IFRS 9, paragraphs 7.2.15 and 7.2.26). The adjustments arising from the new
          standard are therefore not reflected in the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018, but are
          recognised in the opening statement of financial position on 1 July 2018.

     1.   Classification and measurement
          -  Loans and receivables
             Loans and receivables are classified as financial assets at amortised cost. The implementation of IFRS 9
             had no impact on the classification of these assets. It is the Group's business model to hold these
             instruments for collection of cash flows, and the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and
             interest.

          - Equity investments previously classified as available-for-sale
            The Group elected to present changes in the fair value of all its equity investments previously classified
            as available-for-sale in other comprehensive income as these investments are held as long-term
            investments and are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term. As a result, assets with a fair
            value of R3 067 million were reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to financial assets at
            fair value through other comprehensive income and the related fair value gains of R661 million remains
            in the fair value reserve on 1 July 2018. Any subsequent remeasurements of these instruments will be
            reflected in other comprehensive income and no portion will be transferred to the income statement.
            Dividends from these investments are accounted for in profit and loss.

          - Borrowings, derivatives and hedging activities
            The adoption of IFRS 9 had no impact on the Group's classification and measurement of borrowings,
            derivatives and the Group's hedging activities.

2.   Impairment of financial assets
     The impact on the Group's results from the adoption of IFRS 9 relate solely to the new impairment
     requirements. The Group's financial assets carried at amortised cost consist of:

     - Current trade and other receivables related to sales of goods;
     - Trade and other receivables - non-current;
     - Cash and cash equivalents; and
     - Loans receivable.

     The impact of the change in impairment methodology on the Group's total equity is disclosed below. The
     adjustment arose from changes in the impairment provisions for the Group's current trade and other
     receivables.

     The Group's subsidiaries apply the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses on its
     current trade receivables, which calculates the loss allowance on a lifetime basis. The Group has credit
     guarantee insurance in place where management of each business unit deems it necessary. The Group's
     credit policies requires each new customer to be analysed individually for creditworthiness before delivery
     and payment terms are offered.

     To measure the expected credit loss, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared characteristics
     and days past due. The calculation of the expected credit loss takes into account any insurance cover in
     place.

     Reconciliation of the loss allowance for trade receivables as at 30 June 2018 to 1 July 2018:

                                                                                                          Trade
                                                                                                    receivables
                                                                                                     impairment
     R million                                                                                        provision
     Closing impairment provision (as calculated under IAS 39) - 30 June 2018                               135
     Amount restated in opening equity                                                                       25
     Opening impairment provision (as calculated under IFRS 9) - 1 July 2018                                160


     Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there
     is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others:
     -    the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with Group;
     -    the failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than the number of days past due as
          set by each business unit; and/or
     -    a legal process has not enabled recovery.

3.   Debt instruments
     The debt instruments classified as measured at amortised cost at 30 June 2018 are considered to have a
     low credit risk. The loss allowance calculated for these were therefore limited to 12 months' expected losses
     and was immaterial. The debt instruments are considered to have a low credit risk when they have a low
     risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near
     term.

     The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions pertaining to risk of default and expected
     loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
     impairment calculation, based on past experience, existing market conditions as well as forward looking
     estimates at the end of each reporting period.

B.   Impact of the adoption of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
     In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has applied the modified retrospective
     application option, and certain adjustments are therefore recognised in the opening statement of financial
     position on 1 July 2018.

1.   Accounting for payments to customers for non-distinct goods and services
     The adoption of IFRS 15 has required the Group to identify separate performance obligations in contracts
     with customers. The Group makes payments or provides products to customers linked to a loyalty program
     and distribution of sales and marketing related functions carried out by them. These costs have previously
     been included in expenditure items in the income statement, but is now accounted for against revenue.
     This change had no impact on net profit.

2.   Accounting for refunds
     When the customer has a right to return the product within a given period, the Group is obliged to refund
     the purchase price. The Group recognises revenue when the goods have been formally accepted by the
     customer or the goods have been delivered and the time period for rejection had expired as there is
     uncertainty about the possibility of return. When goods are returned, revenue is derecognised and the
     customer credited with value of the goods originally delivered.

     In terms of IFRS 15, a refund liability for the estimated expected refunds of R19 million outstanding to
     customers was recognised as an adjustment to trade and other payables on 1 July 2018. Simultaneously,
     the Group has a right to recover the product from the customer where the customer exercises his right of
     return, which right is included in trade and other receivables amounting to R12 million at 1 July 2018. The
     asset is measured by reference to the former carrying value of the product. The costs to recover the
     products are not material as the products are usually returned during the normal distribution process.

C.   Impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on equity accounted investments
     Remgro's equity accounted investments followed the same transitional arrangements as described above.

     The impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 from equity accounted investments on Remgro's statement of
     financial position was a decrease amounting to R795 million in both equity accounted investments and
     reserves. The amendment that had the largest impact was applying the expected credit losses on FirstRand
     Limited's (FirstRand) results, which in turn affected RMB Holdings Limited's (RMH) statement of financial
     position on 1 July 2018. The implementation of IFRS 9 by these two companies reduced Remgro's carrying
     value of equity accounted investments and reserves by R735 million.

     The impact of the implementation of IFRS 15 amounted to a reduction in the carrying value of equity
     accounted investments and reserves of R298 million, of which R289 million is attributable to SEACOM
     Capital Limited (SEACOM). SEACOM adjusted the accounting of its indefeasible right of use contracts
     which included the obligation to provide services at various capacities across two networks and with
     different pricing structures for which cash is received in advanced.

D.   Impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on the consolidated statement of financial position
     The following table shows the adjustments recognised for each individual line item. Line items that were
     not affected by the changes have not been included. As a result, the sub-totals and totals disclosed cannot
     be recalculated from the numbers provided.

3.   COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR PERIODS

     On 2 July 2018 the Unilever Spreads business, Siqalo Foods Proprietary Limited (Siqalo Foods), became
     a wholly owned subsidiary of Remgro (refer to ""Investment activities"" for further detail). Furthermore and
     as previously reported, Remgro holds the majority of voting rights in Distell Group Holdings Limited (Distell)
     since 11 May 2018, which resulted in the investment in Distell being consolidated from that date.

     As a result of the above transactions, certain line items in the statement of financial position and income
     statement are not directly comparable with the prior periods. The initial accounting for these business
     combinations has not yet been completed and the provisional fair values at the acquisition dates were as
     follows:

     Siqalo Foods and Distell's revenue contributions for the period under review are R1 405 million and
     R14 424 million (30 June 2018: R4 219 million), respectively.

4.   RESULTS
     Headline earnings
     For the period under review, headline earnings decreased by 3.3% from R4 406 million to R4 259 million,
     while headline earnings per share (HEPS) also decreased by 3.3% from 777.5 cents to 752.1 cents.

     Included in headline earnings for the period under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to
     R106 million (2017: R134 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders' exchange option
     of the exchangeable bonds (option remeasurement). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline
     earnings decreased by 2.8% from R4 272 million to R4 153 million, whereas HEPS decreased by 2.7%
     from 753.9 cents to 733.4 cents. The decrease in headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is
     mainly due to lower earnings from Total South Africa Proprietary Limited (Total), Community Investment
     Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (the CIV group), RCL Foods Limited (RCL Foods) and the exclusion
     of Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (Unilever) due to its disposal. The decrease is partly
     offset by the inclusion of Siqalo Foods and higher contributions from Mediclinic International plc

Commentary on reporting platforms' performance

Banking
The headline earnings contribution from the banking platform amounted to R1 775 million (2017:
R1 678 million), representing an increase of 5.8%. FirstRand and RMH reported headline earnings growth
of 6.1% and 5.7% respectively. RMH reported lower growth due to higher funding costs.

On a normalised basis, which excludes certain non-operational and accounting anomalies, and is a better
reflection of underlying performance, FirstRand and RMH reported earnings growth of 7.1% and 6.7%
respectively. These increases are mainly due to growth in both net interest income, underpinned by solid
growth in advances and deposits, and non-interest revenue due to strong fee and commission income
growth. This growth in earnings was partly offset by an increase of 16% in non-performing loans, in part
reflecting strong book growth, as well as reflecting the IFRS 9 impairment provisioning methodology
resulting in an increase in credit impairment charges.

Healthcare
Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R623 million (2017: R487 million),
representing an increase of 27.9%. As previously reported, Mediclinic's contribution for the comparative
period included an accelerated amortisation charge of R171 million relating to the rebranding of all the Al
Noor facilities to Mediclinic. Excluding the impact of the accelerated amortisation in the comparative period,
Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have decreased by 5.3% from R658 million
to R623 million. In British pound terms Mediclinic's contribution, excluding the accelerated amortisation,
decreased by 8.6% mainly due to a lower contribution from the Switzerland division, partly offset by a
stronger performance by the Southern Africa and Middle East operating divisions.

Switzerland's underperformance was a direct result of recent regulatory changes in the Swiss healthcare
market which impacted all providers. These changes included the implementation of national outpatient
tariff (TARMED) reductions and the outmigration of identified clinical treatments, transferring from an
inpatient to an outpatient tariff across many cantons. Steps have been taken to improve the current
financial performance through securing revenue growth, reducing costs and driving efficiency savings in
different areas of the business. Additional medium term actions include improving service differentiation
across insurance categories, doctor recruitment initiatives and advancing the outpatient delivery model.

Consumer products
The contribution from consumer products to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R932 million (2017:
R1 140 million), representing a decrease of 18.2%.

RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings decreased by 26.5% to R366 million (2017:
R498 million). This decrease is mainly due to significant challenges within the Sugar and Chicken business
units resulting from lower prices realised, mainly due to oversupply, and higher commodity and transport
costs. Profitability in the Chicken business unit was hampered by dumped imports entering the market
leading to lower pricing and an increase in feed costs. The Sugar business unit was impacted by reduced
domestic sugar consumption, brought about by, inter alia, the implementation of the Health Promotion Levy
(sugar tax), and the continued volumes of dumped imports, resulting in a shift in sales mix towards raw
(unrefined) exports. Export prices were significantly lower than local prices due to suppressed worldwide
sugar prices. The Groceries cluster however, delivered solid growth, benefiting from volume and margin
increases in the Grocery and Pies portfolios and market share gains in several categories.

Distell's contribution to headline earnings amounted to R399 million (2017: R354 million), representing an
increase of 12.7%. Note that the comparative period included the contribution from Capevin Holdings
Limited. Distell reported headline earnings growth, adjusted for retrenchment and restructuring costs, the
Tanzania Distilleries Limited once-off losses in the comparative period and foreign exchange movements,
of 6.6%, mainly due to solid revenue growth in the South African and other African markets. In addition to
Distell's contribution, Remgro also accounted for amortisation and depreciation charges of R24 million
relating to the additional assets identified when Remgro obtained control over Distell on 11 May 2018.

On 2 July 2018 Unilever acquired Remgro's 25.75% shareholding in Unilever in exchange for Unilever's
Spreads business in Southern Africa, namely Siqalo Foods, as well as a cash consideration of
R4 900 million. As a result, no headline earnings contribution was accounted for Unilever (2017:
R288 million), however, Siqalo Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period under
review amounted to R231 million. In addition to Siqalo Foods' contribution, Remgro also accounted for
amortisation and depreciation charges of R40 million relating to the additional assets identified when
Remgro obtained control over Siqalo Foods.

Insurance
Rand Merchant Investment Holdings Limited's (RMI) contribution to Remgro's headline earnings decreased
by 7.0% to R582 million (2017: R626 million). On a normalised basis, RMI reported a decrease of 8.2% in
earnings mainly due to lower contributions from Discovery Holdings Limited (Discovery) and OUTsurance
Holdings Limited (OUTsurance). Discovery's contribution to RMI decreased by 16.6% due to significant
spend on new initiatives, a spike in large mortality claims at Discovery Life and the negative impact of the
transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9. OUTsurance's contribution decreased by 5.8% due to exceptionally low
claims in the comparative period, higher natural peril claims in Australia, corrective pricing measures to
recognise lower accident frequencies and significant investments in new business growth activities. The
contribution of MMI Holdings Limited increased by 5.7% and that of Hastings Group Holdings plc decreased
by 8.9%.

Industrial
Air Products South Africa Proprietary Limited's (Air Products) contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
increased by 22.5% to R174 million (2017: R142 million). This increase is mainly due to an improvement
in gas volumes and successful cost containment initiatives.

Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R101 million (2017: R258 million). Included
in the contribution to headline earnings for the period under review are unfavourable stock revaluations
amounting to R75 million (2017: favourable stock revaluations of R135 million). These revaluations are the
result of the volatility in the Brent Crude price and the rand exchange rate. Excluding these revaluations,
the contribution increased by 43.1% from R123 million to R176 million. This increase is mainly due to an
increase in turnover resulting from higher sales volumes in the mining and reseller sector.

Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited's (KTH) and Wispeco Holdings Proprietary Limited's (Wispeco)
contributions to headline earnings amounted to R77 million and R52 million (2017: R73 million and
R62 million), while PGSI Limited (PGSI) contributed R8 million to Remgro's headline earnings (2017:
R16 million).

    Infrastructure
    The CIV group's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R104 million (2017:
    profit of R32 million). The results were negatively impacted by the acquisition of a 34.9% stake in Vumatel
    Proprietary Limited (Vumatel), which was implemented during June 2018. Included in the CIV group's
    results were finance costs amounting to R136 million, relating to the financing of the Vumatel acquisition,
    as well as Vumatel's equity accounted losses amounting to R41 million. Excluding the aforesaid Vumatel
    impact, the contribution to headline earnings decreased from a profit of R32 million to a loss of R11 million
    mainly due to Dark Fibre Africa Proprietary Limited's (DFA) higher depreciation and finance costs as a
    result of the expanding network. Despite the decrease in earnings, DFA's revenue increased by 18.2% to
    R1 067 million (2017: R903 million) mainly due to strong growth in annuity revenue.

    Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R101 million (2017: a loss of
    R52 million). The increase is mainly due to improved results across core businesses, resulting from
    increased commodity demand, whereas the comparative period included stock impairments in the rail
    assembly business, due to the closure of this business unit, and losses from the shipping division.

    During June 2018 Grindrod completed the separate listing of its shipping division and Remgro received
    Grindrod Shipping Holdings Limited (Grindrod Shipping) shares as a dividend in specie. Grindrod
    Shipping's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R18 million (included in the
    2017 contribution of Grindrod: R62 million).

    Remgro's share of SEACOM's loss amounted to R1 million (2017: a profit of R32 million). This decrease is
    mainly due to a once-off realisation of deferred revenue relating to the early termination of long-term
    contracts in the comparative period, as well as the negative impact of the implementation of IFRS 15 in the
    period under review.

    Media and sport
    Media and sport primarily consist of the interests in eMedia Investments Proprietary Limited (eMedia
    Investments) and various sport interests, including an interest in the Blue Bulls rugby franchise and
    Stellenbosch Academy of Sport Properties Proprietary Limited.

    eMedia Investments' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased to R11 million (2017:
    R3 million). This increase is mainly due to an increase in revenue, as well as a lower investment into the
    multi-channel business (Openview and e.tv multichannel).

    Other investments
    The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R15 million (2017: R29 million),
    of which Business Partners Limited's contribution was R29 million (2017: R29 million).

    Central treasury and other net corporate costs
    Finance income amounted to R397 million (2017: R259 million). This increase is mainly due to higher
    average cash balances as a result of the Unilever disposal. Finance costs amounted to R459 million (2017:
    R452 million). The positive fair value adjustment of R106 million (2017: R134 million) relates to the
    decrease in the value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds. Other net corporate costs
    amounted to R112 million (2017: R60 million). The increase in other net corporate costs is mainly due to
    the utilisation of corporate taxation credits in the comparative period.

    Earnings
    Earnings increased by 149.3% to R10 297 million (2017: R4 131 million). This increase is mainly due to
    the profit realised on the Unilever disposal of R8 318 million. This increase is partly offset by Remgro's
    portion of the impairments of Mediclinic's properties and trade names in Switzerland and its investment in
    Spire Healthcare Group plc of R1 954 million (2017: R830 million).


5.   INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

    Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 10.4% from R256.97 at 30 June 2018 to
    R230.23 at 31 December 2018. The closing share price at 31 December 2018 was R194.74
    (30 June 2018: R204.29) representing a discount of 15.4% (30 June 2018: 20.5%) to the intrinsic net asset
    value. Refer to Annexure B for full details.

6.   INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
     The most important investment activities during the period under review were as follows:

     Unilever
     On 2 July 2018 Unilever acquired Remgro's 25.75% shareholding in Unilever in exchange for Unilever's
     Spreads business in Southern Africa, as well as a cash consideration of R4 900 million, representing a total
     transaction value of R11 900 million. This transaction valued the Unilever Spreads business at
     R7 000 million. The Unilever Spreads business was transferred to Siqalo Foods, which became a wholly
     owned subsidiary of Remgro on 2 July 2018.

     Remgro's investment in Unilever was previously classified as an associate and accounted for using the
     equity method. With effect from 2 July 2018, Remgro consolidated Siqalo Foods at 100.0%, while the
     investment in Unilever, with a carrying value of R3 582 million, was disposed of for a consideration of
     R11 900 million, realising an accounting profit on the disposal of investment of R8 318 million.

     In terms of IFRS 3: Business Combinations the purchase price of Siqalo Foods was R7 000 million. The
     preliminary fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the effective date were:
     intangible assets of R1 710 million, property, plant and equipment of R495 million, and other net liabilities
     of R396 million. The balance of R5 191 million, being the difference between the purchase price and Siqalo
     Foods' identifiable net assets, was allocated to goodwill.

     The fair value adjustment to Siqalo Foods' statement of financial position relates mainly to the recognition
     of brands (inter alia Rama, Stork and Flora) and non-contractual customer relationships. The amortisation
     of these additional assets will result in an annual after-tax expense of R80 million included in headline
     earnings. The impact on headline earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2018 amounted to
     R40 million.

     Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIVH)
     During July 2018, CIVH repurchased 6.3% of its shares from a shareholder, which increased Remgro's
     interest in CIVH to 54.5% (30 June 2018: 51.0%). On 29 August 2018 and 27 September 2018 Remgro
     subscribed for 10 834 CIVH shares amounting to R324 million and 16 596 CIVH shares amounting to
     R490 million, respectively, in terms of two CIVH rights issues. These share subscriptions did not alter
     Remgro's interest in CIVH.

     Prescient China Equity Fund (Prescient)
     During October 2018, Remgro invested $50 million in Prescient. Prescient was launched during
     October 2018 and Remgro and Reinet Investments S.C.A. provided the seed capital. Prescient, which uses
     a systematic, quantitative approach to seek long term capital growth, invests in listed stocks in the Chinese
     market and is benchmarked to the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index.

     Milestone Capital Strategic Holdings Limited (MCSH)
     Remgro previously invested $43 million in MCSH, consisting of an interest bearing loan of $38 million and
     an investment of $5 million. During August 2018 MCSH repaid the loan and interest amounting to
     $42 million and Remgro disposed of its investment in MCSH for a total purchase consideration of
     $28 million. The purchase consideration was settled with cash amounting to $6 million, 10 714 310 Li Ning
     Company Limited (Li Ning) shares valued at $12 million and JHL Biotech, Inc. bonds (JHL bonds) valued
     at $10 million.

     During December 2018 and January 2019, Remgro disposed of 607 500 Li Ning shares for $1 million and
     10 106 810 Li Ning shares for $11 million, respectively. The JHL bonds are held in escrow and will be
     utilised as Remgro's first contribution towards Milestone China Opportunities Fund IV (the Fund). Remgro
     committed up to a maximum amount of $100 million to the Fund during the period under review.

     RMI
     On 11 September 2018 RMI declared its final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2018, which included an
     alternative to the cash dividend of either receiving a scrip distribution or reinvesting the cash dividend by
     subscribing for new RMI ordinary shares. Remgro elected to reinvest its cash dividend amounting to
     R300 million, and received 7 894 998 new RMI ordinary shares at R38.00 per share.

     RCL Foods
     During December 2018 Remgro acquired a further 7 042 924 RCL Foods shares for a total amount of
     R115 million. This transaction marginally increased Remgro's effective interest in RCL Foods to 77.5%
     (30 June 2018: 77.0%).

     Premier Team Holdings (PTH) and Saracens Copthall LLP (Copthall)
     On 24 October 2018, Remgro entered into an agreement in terms of which it disposed of its 50.0% interest
     in PTH (the entity that owns the Saracens rugby club) for a nominal amount with the right to sell its 49.5%
     interest in Copthall (the entity that houses the Saracens club's stadium, Allianz Park) after three years for
     GBP8 million. The combined transaction gave Remgro the ability to completely exit the Saracens Group.

     Remgro's investments in PTH and Copthall were previously classified as associates and accounted for
     using the equity method. With effect from 24 October 2018, Remgro disposed of its investment in PTH and
     derecognised its associated investment in Copthall. The right to sell Copthall is classified as a financial
     instrument with fair value movements accounted for through profit and loss.

     Other
     Other smaller investments amounted to R145 million.

     Events after 31 December 2018

     There were no significant transactions subsequent to 31 December 2018.


7.   INFORMATION REGARDING UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

     Siqalo Foods
     Siqalo Foods owns the trademarks for Rama, Flora, Stork, Rondo and other spreads related brands in the
     Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries, as well as a production facility. The business was
     acquired on 2 July 2018 as part of the consideration received on the disposal of Remgro's 25.75%
     shareholding in Unilever.

     During the period under review, Unilever continued to act as principal as part of its obligation under the
     transition agreement. Siqalo Foods will assume full operational accountability by the end of March 2019.

     Siqalo Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months under review amounted to
     R231 million. The spreads business generated higher headline earnings mainly due to lower overhead
     charges by Unilever during the transition agreement period, a better gross margin realisation from lower
     cost inputs, as well as strong underlying volume growth during the period.

     Air Products
     Air Products has a September year-end and its results for the six months ended 30 September 2018 have
     been included in Remgro's results for the period under review. Air Products' contribution to Remgro's
     headline earnings for the period under review increased by 22.5% to R174 million (2017: R142 million).

     Turnover for Air Products' six months ended 30 September 2018 increased by 7.8% to R1 609 million
     (2017: R1 492 million), while the company's operating profit for the same period increased by 12.4% to
     R490 million (2017: R436 million).

     The period under review saw some improvement in gas volumes, particularly in the On-sites and large
     tonnage gases businesses, as well as some successful cost containment initiatives.

     KTH
     KTH is a leading black-owned investment company with a strong and diversified asset portfolio covering
     the industrial, services, media, financial services and healthcare sectors.

     KTH's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period under review amounted to R77 million
     (2017: R73 million). The increase in earnings was mainly due to positive equity accounting results from
     investments, reduced operating costs for the group and a decrease in the net finance cost paid during the
     period to R73 million (2017: R117 million).

KTH's profit attributable to ordinary shareholders amounted to R101 million (2017: R138 million loss). The
increase in attributable profit was driven by positive equity accounted results from investments and a
decrease in impairments recognised compared to the comparative period. The increase was partly offset
by the loss recognised on the disposal of XK Platinum Partnership and lower group revenue for the period.
The comparative period included an impairment of the investment in Actom Investment Holdings
Proprietary Limited of R412 million which was partly offset by the reversal of impairment of XK Platinum
Partnership (R146 million).

Income from equity accounted investments increased to R220 million (2017: R50 million), partly due to
significant losses recognised in the comparative period on certain equity accounted investments which
yielded positive returns during the period. The major contributors to equity accounted earnings during the
reporting period were the investments in MMI Holdings Limited, Fidelity Bank (Ghana) Limited, Eris
Property Fund and XK Platinum Partnership.

Total
Total has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2018 have been included
in Remgro's results for the period under review. Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the
six months to 31 December 2018 amounted to R101 million (2017: R258 million).

Total's turnover for the six months ended 31 December 2018 increased by 30.8% to R39 505 million (2017:
R30 196 million), mainly due to the increase in the basic fuel price and increased sales volumes in the
mining and reseller sector during the period under review.

The results were negatively impacted by stock revaluation losses of R420 million (2017: gains of
R753 million) due to the sharp decrease in the average basic fuel price and in crude prices during the last
two months of the period under review.

Total experienced lower refining margins in comparison to 2017, due to the impact of the unfavourable
market environment. Natref's average refining margin indicator for the period under review decreased from
$54 per ton to $40 per ton mainly due to the significant increase in average Brent crude price of $71 per
barrel from $56 per barrel.

PGSI
PGSI's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months to 31 December 2018 amounted to
R8 million (2017: R16 million). PGSI's turnover for the period under review increased from R2 171 million
to R2 238 million. The group's normalised operating profit, which excludes the impact of asset impairments
and charges for the early adoption of new IFRS standards, decreased from R114 million to R93 million.

The group's main operating subsidiary in South Africa, PG Group, manufactures and supplies glass for the
building and automotive industries. The building glass businesses reported a decline in profits due to weak
domestic demand and growing pressure on selling prices in a competitive and oversupplied market. The
automotive businesses fared better despite economic pressures on consumers, lower claims from the
insurance sector and variable demand in export markets. Supplies to local automotive assembly operations
have been challenged by very competitive pricing, especially out of China. The Rest of Africa businesses
reported a decline in profitability with many regions impacted by weaker economic activity, as well as
political instability in some regions.

While the economic climate remains challenging, the group has made good progress in the areas of cost
reduction, manufacturing quality and performance efficiencies. Initiatives to focus on market requirements
and improve the service offering to its customers are progressing well.

Wispeco
Wispeco's turnover for the six months ended 31 December 2018 increased by 16.4% to R1 253 million
(2017: R1 076 million). This resulted mainly from higher selling prices linked to the combined effect of the
global price of aluminium and the rand-dollar exchange rate. Sales volumes for the period were slightly
higher in a subdued Southern African market. Despite higher import duties, price competition against
imports remains intense and margins are tight. Headline earnings for the period under review decreased
to R52 million (2017: R62 million).

Wispeco drives improvement of internal efficiencies and invests in state-of-the-art manufacturing processes
to remain cost effective and competitive against low cost imports. Opportunities to expand its distribution
footprint in Southern Africa are also pursued on an ongoing basis. Wispeco continues to lead the market
with product innovation and software solutions to support the sale of its products. The Crealco brand is
gaining prominence and is firmly positioned as the local benchmark for architectural aluminium products.

CIV group
Remgro has an effective interest of 54.5% in the CIV group, which is active in the telecommunications and
information technology (ICT) sector. The key operating company of the group is Dark Fibre Africa
Proprietary Limited (DFA), which constructs and owns fibre-optic networks. The CIV group also acquired a
34.9% interest in Vumatel Proprietary Limited (Vumatel) during June 2018. Vumatel is a leader in the Fibre-
to-the-Home (FTTH) market. Vumatel's FTTH network spans over 8 000 km over a residential area footprint
which it leases to Internet Services Providers (ISPs), who in turn sell internet products to the consumer.
DFA also has a 90.0% investment in an FTTH operator, South African Digital Villages (SADV), and a 100%
share in Sqwidnet, an Internet-of-Things (IOT) network provider.

The CIV group has a March year-end and therefore its results for the six months ended 30 September 2018
have been included in Remgro's results for the period under review. The CIV group's contribution to
Remgro's headline earnings for the period under review amounted to a loss of R104 million (2017:
R32 million profit). Included in the CIV group's results are finance costs amounting to R136 million, relating
to the financing of the Vumatel acquisition, as well as Vumatel's equity accounted losses amounting to
R41 million. Excluding the aforesaid Vumatel impact, the contribution to headline earnings decreased from
a profit of R32 million to a loss of R11 million mainly due to higher finance costs and depreciation as a
result of the expanding network.

DFA's revenue for the six months ended 30 September 2018 increased by 18.2% to R1 067 million (2017:
R903 million) mainly as a result of solid growth of 24.1% in annuity revenue. DFA's EBITDA for the period
under review increased by 9.5% to R597 million. The current book value of the fibre-optic network is in
excess of R9 billion (30 June 2018: R8 billion). DFA has thus far secured a healthy annuity income of
R152 million per month, with the majority thereof being on long-term contracts with customers.

DFA owns fibre network in all major metropolitan areas, as well as a number of smaller metropolitan areas,
including East London, Polokwane, Tlokwe, Emalahleni, George and Pietermaritzburg. At
30 September 2018, a total distance of 11 190 km (September 2017: 10 138 km) of fibre network had been
completed in the major metropolitan areas, small towns and on long-haul routes. The SADV network adds
another 2 500 km of fibre network.

The DFA revenue model is flexible to adapt to customers' needs and DFA either sells an indefeasible right
of use agreement, which is a lump sum in advance, or on an annuity basis with multi-year contracts of
mostly up to 15 years.

SEACOM
Remgro has an effective interest of 30.0% in SEACOM, which operates Africa's largest international data
network connecting Southern and Eastern Africa with Europe and Asia.

SEACOM has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2018 have been
included in Remgro's results for the period under review. SEACOM contributed a loss of R1 million (2017:
headline profit of R32 million) to Remgro's headline earnings for the period under review.

SEACOM's core sales and revenue streams are generated from its established base of Service Provider
(wholesale) customers that also provide the basis for network scale, cost reductions and service innovation.
The Service Provider segment continues to see strong demand for international capacity from large Over
The Top providers and from the growth of Internet Protocol Transit traffic from local ISPs. The SEACOM
international and terrestrial networks are continuously upgraded to keep pace with this demand.

SEACOM Business provides the platform for future growth and improved profitability as the number and
size of corporate customers increases. Revenue for the period under review grew by 35.0%. SEACOM
Business has a healthy pipeline to continue to grow sales and revenue in 2019. In addition to organic
growth, SEACOM Business continues to make acquisitions of ISPs focused largely on the enterprise
market. The acquisitions have had a significantly positive contribution in the reporting period. SEACOM
Business continues to focus its investments on in-building fibre reticulation and terrestrial fibre to unlock
previously unserved areas. The acquisition of FibreCo Holdings Proprietary Limited will enable SEACOM
to grow its customer base, delivering large capacity services between key cities and towns in South Africa.


8.   TREASURY SHARES
     At 30 June 2018, 1 389 033 Remgro ordinary shares (0.3%) were held as treasury shares by a wholly

     average price of R198.07 per share for a total amount of R396 million, while 13 699 Remgro ordinary

Notes
(1.)   Remgro determined recoverable amounts for Mediclinic and Distell which are in excess of the investments' carrying values.
(2.)   The prior year includes the investment in Capevin Holdings Limited.
(3.)   The initial accounting for the Siqalo Foods business combination, including the allocation of goodwill, has not yet been completed. The impairment
       assessment of goodwill will be performed at 30 June 2019 when the accounting for the acquisition has been finalised.
(4.)   Cash at the centre excludes cash held by subsidiaries that are separately valued above (mainly RCL Foods, Distell, Siqalo Foods and Wispeco).
(5.)   The potential capital gains tax (CGT) liability is calculated on the specific identification method using the most favourable calculation for investments
       acquired before 1 October 2001 and also taking into account the corporate relief provisions. Deferred CGT on investments at fair value through
       other comprehensive income is included in ""other net corporate assets"" above.
(6.)   For purposes of determining the intrinsic net asset value, the unlisted investments are shown at directors' valuation and the listed investments are
       shown at stock exchange prices.

Fair value remeasurements

The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale and investment in money market funds: Fair value is based on quoted market prices
  or, in the case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow, liquidation
  valuation and actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation methodologies
  and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
          (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table illustrates the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by hierarchy
level:

There were no transfers between the different levels.

Level 3 financial assets consist mainly of investments in the Milestone China entities (Milestone) and the Pembani Remgro
Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 737 million and R234 million respectively, while the investment in the Kagiso
Infrastructure Empowerment Fund was disposed of during the year under review. These investments are all valued based on
the fair value of each investment's underlying assets, which are valued using a variety of valuation methodologies. Listed
entities are valued at the last quoted share price on the reporting date, whereas unlisted entities' valuation methods include
discounted cash flow valuations, appropriate earnings and revenue multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (43%), cash and cash equivalents (6%), unlisted investments (60%) and
other net liabilities (9%). Unlisted investments included at transaction prices in Milestone's fair value amounted to
R573 million, while its remaining eight unlisted investments were valued at R469 million. PRIF's main assets are the
investments in ETG Group, Nova Lumos and GPR Leasing. ETG Group was valued at its last traded price used for the
acquisition of an interest by a third party. GPR Leasing and Nova Lumos were valued using the discounted cash flow method.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on Remgro's
financial statements as the underlying assets of the funds in which Remgro made its investments are widely spread.

COMMENTS

1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
     (JSE) Listing Requirements for provisional reports, and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to
     summary financial statements. The JSE Listing Requirements for provisional reports require summary financial
     statements to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition
     requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as
     issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
     Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34: Interim Financial
     Reporting.

     The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summary
     consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies
     applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements, with the exception of the
     adoption of the amendments to IAS 7: Cash flow statements, IAS 12: Income taxes and IFRS 12: Disclosure of
     interest in other entities. The implementation of these interpretations and amendments had no impact on the results
     of either the current or prior years.

     The financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, Neville Williams
     CA(SA).

2.   COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR YEAR

     Since 11 May 2018 Remgro holds the majority of voting rights (56.0%) in Distell, thereby resulting in the
     investment in Distell now being consolidated at 31.8%. Therefore, certain line items in the statement of financial
     position and income statement are not directly comparable with the prior year. Based on the preliminary accounting
     for the business combination, the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities acquired are as follows:

3.   RESULTS

     Headline earnings
     For the year to 30 June 2018 headline earnings increased by 4.3% from R8 221 million to R8 573 million, while
     headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 1.8% from 1 485.5 cents to 1 512.6 cents. The difference in the
     increase between headline earnings and HEPS is attributed to the impact of the rights issue during the comparative
     year.

     Included in headline earnings for the year under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to
     R261 million (2017: R687 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders' exchange option of the
     exchangeable bonds (option remeasurement). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline earnings increased by

     10.3% from R7 534 million to R8 312 million, while HEPS increased by 7.7% from 1 361.3 cents to 1 466.5 cents.
     The increase in headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher earnings from the
     banking and insurance platforms, RCL Foods, Total and higher finance income, offset by a lower contribution from
     Mediclinic as well as transaction costs incurred on the Distell ownership restructuring and the Unilever Spreads
     business acquisition.

     Commentary on reporting platforms' performance (unaudited)
     
     Banking
     The headline earnings contribution from the banking division amounted to R3 525 million (2017: R3 163 million),
     representing an increase of 11.4%. FirstRand and RMH reported headline earnings growth of 11.6% and 11.4%
     respectively. On a normalised basis, which excludes certain non-operational and accounting anomalies, and is a
     better reflection of underlying performance, both FirstRand and RMH reported earnings growth of 7.9%. These
     increases are mainly due to growth in both net interest income, underpinned by good growth in advances and
     deposits, and non-interest revenue due to strong growth in fee and commission income. This growth in earnings was
     partly offset by an increase in non-performing loans due to the constrained macro-economic environment resulting in
     an increase in credit impairment charges.

     Healthcare
     Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 556 million (2017: R1 875 million),
     representing a decrease of 17.0%. It should be noted that all the Al Noor facilities were rebranded to Mediclinic and
     therefore Mediclinic's contribution for the year under review included an accelerated amortisation charge of
     R171 million relating to the Al Noor trade name. Mediclinic's contribution also included a derecognition charge of
     R114 million in respect of unamortised finance expenses relating to the refinancing of Hirslanden's debt. Excluding
     the impact of the accelerated amortisation and derecognition of unamortised finance expenses, Mediclinic's
     contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have decreased by 1.8% from R1 875 million to R1 841 million.
     The strengthening of the rand against the Swiss franc, British pound and United Arab Emirates dirham also had a
     negative impact on Mediclinic's contribution. In British pound terms Mediclinic's contribution, excluding the
     accelerated amortisation and derecognition of unamortised finance expenses, increased by 4.9% mainly due to a
     stronger performance by the Southern Africa and Middle East operating divisions, offset by a lower contribution
     from Hirslanden and a decrease in the equity accounted earnings from Spire. Hirslanden's results were impacted by a
     subdued market, the continued change in insurance mix and the evolving changes in the regulatory environment,
     while Spire's contribution to Mediclinic's results included a provision of £9 million for the potential cost of a
     settlement relating to civil litigation against a consultant who previously had practicing privileges at Spire and a
     charge relating to a decision to cease the provision of radiotherapy services at the Spire Specialist Cancer Care
     Centre in Baddow (Essex).
     
     Consumer products
     The contribution from consumer products to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 605 million (2017:
     R1 354 million), representing an increase of 18.5%.
     
     RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased by 52.6% to R647 million (2017: R424 million).
     This increase is mainly due to the recovery in the Chicken business unit, strong volume performances in the
     Dressings, Pet Food and Pies categories, lower interest costs and a tax credit of R64 million relating to an energy
     efficiency allowance in the Sugar business unit. The improvement from the Chicken business unit resulted from a
     revised business model, lower feed prices and improved realisations. The increase was dampened by the impact of
     listeriosis within the business unit, amounting to an estimated negative impact of R158 million. The Sugar operations
     experienced challenging market conditions due to low international prices, a relatively strong currency and a
     significant volume of dumped imports.
     
     Unilever's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased by 11.1% to R499 million (2017: R449 million).
     This increase is mainly due to an improvement in gross margins as a result of tighter spend management.
     
     Distell's contribution to headline earnings, which includes the investment in Capevin Holdings, amounted to
     R459 million (2017: R481 million). Distell's results for the year under review were negatively impacted by once-off
     losses and write-offs amounting to R78 million (2017: R22 million) in its associate, Tanzania Distilleries Limited,
     following a sachet ban and excise duty dispute. The comparative year included a reversal of a provision for interest
     payable in respect of an extended excise duty dispute of R42 million. Distell reported headline earnings growth,
     adjusted for foreign exchange movements, retrenchment and group restructuring costs, as well as the aforementioned
     once-off items, of 5.2%, mainly driven by a 10.4% increase in revenue achieved across all regions and categories.
     
     Insurance
     RMI Holdings' contribution to headline earnings increased by 18.0% to R1 228 million (2017: R1 041 million). On a
     normalised basis, RMI Holdings reported an increase of 14.8% in earnings mainly due to the contributions from
     Discovery (up 16.2%), OUTsurance (up 11.5%) and the newly acquired Hastings, partly offset by higher funding
     costs relating to the Hastings acquisition and a lower contribution by MMI (down 12.4%). The strong result by
     Discovery was driven by both established and emerging businesses, while OUTsurance's results were impacted by
     favourable claims conditions throughout all major operations. MMI's results were negatively impacted by the
     continued challenging macro-economic environment, as well as operational shortcomings in the Momentum and
     Metropolitan retail divisions.
     
     Industrial
     Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R501 million (2017: R224 million). Included in the
     contribution to headline earnings for the year under review are favourable stock revaluations amounting to
     R216 million (2017: unfavourable stock revaluations of R82 million). These revaluations are the result of the
     volatility in the Brent Crude price and the rand exchange rate. Excluding these revaluations, the contribution
     decreased by 6.9% from R306 million to R285 million.
     
     Remgro's share of the results of KTH amounted to R55 million (2017: R34 million). This increase is mainly due to
     lower finance costs as a result of the repayment of debt following the disposal of the investment in Exxaro Resources
     Limited.
     
     Air Products' and Wispeco's contribution to headline earnings amounted to R289 million and R122 million
     respectively (2017: R298 million and R169 million), while PGSI contributed R4 million to Remgro's headline
     earnings (2017: R25 million).
     
     Infrastructure
     Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R46 million (2017: a loss of
     R48 million), impacted by stock impairments in the rail assembly business due to the closure of this business unit.
     This decrease was partly offset by improved results across core businesses mainly due to increased commodity
     demand and stronger drybulk shipping rates.
     
     For the year under review the CIV group contributed R48 million to headline earnings (2017: R110 million). This
     decrease is mainly due to higher finance costs and depreciation due to increased infrastructure spend. Despite the
     decrease in earnings, the CIV group's monthly annuity income increased to R138 million (2017: R115 million).
     
     Remgro's share of SEACOM's profit amounted to R15 million (2017: loss of R33 million). This increase is mainly
     due to improved results in South Africa and Kenya, as well as a once-off realisation of deferred revenue relating to
     the early termination of long-term contracts.
     
     Media and sport
     Media and sport primarily consist of the interests in eMedia Investments and various sport interests, including
     interests in rugby franchises, as well as the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport.

     eMedia Investments' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings decreased to R1 million (2017: R49 million). This
     decrease is mainly due to a significant decline in license revenue resulting from a renegotiated DStv agreement, and
     the continued investment in the Openview platform.

     Other investments
     The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R66 million (2017: R70 million), of
     which Business Partners' contribution was R65 million (2017: R54 million).

     Central treasury and other net corporate costs
     Finance income amounted to R524 million (2017: R349 million). This increase is mainly due to higher average cash
     balances as a result of the Remgro rights issue in the comparative year. Finance costs amounted to R891 million
     (2017: R903 million). The positive fair value adjustment of R261 million (2017: R687 million) relates to the
     decrease in the value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds. Other net corporate costs amounted to
     R282 million (2017: R143 million). The increase in other net corporate costs is mainly due to transaction costs
     amounting to R109 million, incurred on the Distell ownership restructuring and the Unilever Spreads business
     acquisition.

     Earnings
     Earnings increased by 6.1% to R8 943 million (2017: R8 431 million). This increase is mainly due to the profit
     realised on the Distell restructuring transaction of R5 150 million, as well as the increase in headline earnings as
     explained above. This increase is partly offset by Remgro's portion of the impairments of Mediclinic's investments
     in Hirslanden and Spire of R5 257 million, as well as the lower positive fair value adjustment, relating to the
     decrease in value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds of R261 million (2017: R687 million).

4.   INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

     Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 2.2% from R251.48 at 30 June 2017 to R256.97 at
     30 June 2018. The closing share price at 30 June 2018 was R204.29 (2017: R213.46) representing a discount of
     20.5% (2017: 15.1%) to the intrinsic net asset value. Refer to Annexure B for full details.

5.   INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
     The most important investment activities during the year under review were as follows:

     Distell Group Holdings Limited (Distell)
     On 30 June 2017 Remgro had an indirect economic interest of 31.8% in Distell Group Limited (previously listed
     Distell). This interest was held through its 50.0% shareholding in Remgro-Capevin Investments Proprietary Limited
     (RCI) and 19.0% shareholding in Capevin Holdings Limited (Capevin). Capevin held the other 50.0% shareholding
     in RCI and RCI had a 53.5% economic interest (or 52.8% voting interest) in the previously listed Distell.

     On 11 May 2018 the competition authorities approved the restructuring of the previously listed Distell's multi-tiered
     ownership structure. In terms of the restructuring, Remgro exchanged its 50.0% shareholding in RCI for additional
     ordinary shares in Capevin (the RCI Exchange). The RCI Exchange increased Remgro's interest in Capevin from
     19.0% to 59.5%. Following the RCI Exchange, Remgro exchanged its entire Capevin shareholding for ordinary
     shares in Distell, a new listed entity which is substantially similar to the previously listed Distell. Remgro also
     received unlisted B shares in Distell, which shares are linked to the Distell ordinary shares acquired by Remgro by
     virtue of the RCI Exchange, resulting in Remgro replicating RCI's 52.8% voting rights in the previously listed
     Distell. The unlisted B shares only carry voting rights in Distell and have no economic participation. The
     restructuring had no impact on Remgro's intrinsic net asset value and Remgro retained its 31.8% economic interest
     in Distell, but increased its voting rights in Distell to 56.0%.

     Remgro's investments in RCI and Capevin were previously classified as a joint venture and an associate,
     respectively, and accounted for using the equity method. Since the restructuring, Remgro holds the majority of
     voting rights (56.0%) in Distell, thereby resulting in the investment in Distell now being consolidated at 31.8% with
     effect from 11 May 2018, while the investments in RCI and Capevin were derecognised at their fair values totalling
     R8 940 million, realising an accounting profit on the sale of investments of R5 150 million.

     In terms of IFRS 3: Business Combinations the purchase consideration for Distell, consisting of the fair value of
     Remgro's previously held interests in RCI and Capevin, amounted to R8 940 million. The preliminary fair value of
     the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the effective date were: intangible assets of R10 169 million,
     property, plant and equipment of R6 608 million, and other net assets of R521 million. Non-controlling shareholders'
     proportionate interest in the fair value of Distell's net assets amounted to R11 893 million, while Remgro's economic
     interest therein amounted to R5 405 million. The balance of R3 535 million, being the difference between the
     purchase price and Remgro's portion of Distell's identifiable net assets, was allocated to goodwill.
     
     The fair value adjustment to Distell's statement of financial position relates mainly to the recognition of brands (inter
     alia Hunters, Savanna, Amarula and Bernini). The amortisation of these additional assets will result in an annual
     after-tax expense of R145 million (Remgro's portion being R46 million) included in headline earnings. Since
     Remgro retained its economic interest of 31.8% in Distell's underlying business, the impact on attributable headline
     earnings for the year under review only relates to the additional after-tax amortisation expense of R8 million for the
     period to 30 June 2018.
     
     RMI Holdings Limited (RMI Holdings)
     On 19 September 2017 and 12 March 2018 RMI Holdings declared its final dividend for the year ended
     30 June 2017 and interim dividend for the six months ended 31 December 2017 respectively. Both dividends
     included an alternative to the cash dividend of either receiving a scrip distribution or reinvesting the cash dividend by
     subscribing for new RMI Holdings ordinary shares. Remgro elected the reinvestment alternative for both
     declarations. Cash dividends amounting to R471 million were reinvested for 7 691 641 new RMI Holdings ordinary
     shares at R38.00 per share and 4 196 921 new RMI Holdings ordinary shares at R42.50 per share during
     October 2017 and April 2018 respectively. These investments increased Remgro's interest in RMI Holdings
     marginally to 30.3% (30 June 2017: 29.9%).
     
     Grindrod Limited (Grindrod)
     On 19 June 2018 Grindrod distributed its shipping division to its shareholders as a dividend in specie. Grindrod
     shareholders received 1 Grindrod Shipping Holdings Limited (Grindrod Shipping) share for every 40 Grindrod
     shares held and, accordingly, Remgro received 4 329 580 Grindrod Shipping shares. Grindrod Shipping listed on the
     NASDAQ on 18 June 2018 with a secondary inward listing on the JSE on 19 June 2018. On 30 June 2018 Remgro's
     effective interests in Grindrod and Grindrod Shipping were 23.0% (2017: 23.1%) and 22.7% respectively.
     
     Kagiso Infrastructure Empowerment Fund (KIEF)
     During the year under review, Remgro disposed of its investment in KIEF, realising a profit on disposal of
     R103 million on the transaction. Remgro initially committed funds amounting to R350 million to KIEF, which had a
     target size of R650 million and aimed to invest in infrastructure projects, including roads, airports, power and
     telecommunication installations, railway systems, ports, water and social infrastructure. In total, Remgro invested
     R285 million in KIEF and received income and capital distributions amounting to R381 million, which includes the
     proceeds on disposal of KIEF.
     
     Invenfin Proprietary Limited (Invenfin)
     During the year under review Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Invenfin) invested a further R80 million
     in Bos Brands Proprietary Limited (Bos Brands), thereby increasing its cumulative investment in Bos Brands to
     R244 million. Bos Brands is an owner, producer, marketer and distributor of a range of ice teas and sports drinks,
     under the BOS brand.
     
     Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF)
     During the year under review Remgro invested a further R43 million in PRIF, thereby increasing its cumulative
     investment to R298 million. As at 30 June 2018 the remaining commitment to PRIF amounted to R352 million.
     
     Other
     Other smaller investments amounted to R114 million.
     
     Events after year-end
     
     Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (Unilever)
     The competition authorities have approved Unilever's acquisition of Remgro's 25.75% shareholding in Unilever in
     exchange for Unilever's Spreads business in Southern Africa, as well as a cash consideration of R4 900 million,
     representing a total transaction value of R11 900 million. This transaction valued the Unilever Spreads business at
     R7 000 million. The effective date of the transaction was 2 July 2018.
     
     On 2 July 2018 the Unilever Spreads business, valued at R7 000 million, was transferred to Silver 2017 Proprietary
     Limited (Silver), which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Remgro, and the investment in Unilever was disposed
     of for R11 900 million. In terms of IFRS 3: Business Combinations the purchase price of the Unilever Spreads
     business will be allocated to intangible assets (mainly brands like Rama, Stork and Flora), property, plant and
     equipment and other net assets, while the balance will be allocated to goodwill. At the date of publication of the
     audited consolidated results, the acquisition date fair values of acquired net assets have not yet been determined.
     
     RMI Holdings
     On 11 September 2018 RMI Holdings declared its final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2018, which included an
     alternative to the cash dividend of either receiving a scrip distribution or reinvesting the cash dividend by subscribing
     for new RMI Holdings ordinary shares. Remgro has committed to reinvesting its cash dividend amounting to
     R300 million, by electing the reinvestment alternative, in order to receive 7 894 998 new RMI Holdings ordinary
     shares at R38.00 per share.
     
     Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIVH)
     On 29 August 2018 Remgro invested a further R324 million in CIVH as part of a CIVH rights offer.
     
     Milestone Capital Strategic Holdings Limited (MCSH)
     During August 2018 Remgro disposed of its investment and loan in MCSH for a total purchase consideration of
     $70 million.
     
     Other than the above-mentioned transactions, there were no other significant transactions subsequent to
     30 June 2018.

     subsidiary of Remgro. As previously reported, these shares were acquired for the purpose of hedging Remgro's share
     incentive scheme.

7.   CASH RESOURCES AT THE CENTRE

     The Company's cash resources at 30 June 2018 were as follows:

                                                                  30 June 2018            30 June 2017

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND
Declaration of Dividend No. 36
Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 328 cents (2017: 301 cents) per share has been declared out of income
reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par value, for the
year ended 30 June 2018.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 65.6 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 262.4 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in
terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2018 therefore amounts to 532 cents, compared to 495 cents

Fair value remeasurements

The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale and investment in money market funds: Fair value is based on quoted market prices
  or, in the case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow, liquidation
  valuation and actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation methodologies
  and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
           (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table illustrates the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by hierarchy
level:

There were no transfers between the different levels.

Level 3 financial assets consist mainly of investments in the Milestone China entities (Milestone) and the Pembani Remgro
Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 492 million and R228 million respectively. These investments are all valued
based on the fair value of each investment's underlying assets, which are valued using a variety of valuation methodologies.
Listed entities are valued at the last quoted share price on the reporting date, whereas unlisted entities' valuation methods
include discounted cash flow valuations, appropriate earnings and revenue multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (45%), cash and cash equivalents (6%) and unlisted investments (49%).
Unlisted investments included at recent transaction prices in Milestone's fair value amounted to R400 million, while its
remaining nine unlisted investments were valued at R328 million and is considered to be immaterial. PRIF's main assets are
the investments in ETG Group and Lumos Global. The fund values its investments using appropriate revenue and earnings
multiples based on peer group companies to determine a price-to-book valuation.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on Remgro's
financial statements as the underlying assets of the funds in which Remgro made its investments are widely spread.

COMMENTS


1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The interim report is prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of International
   Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, and the SAICA Financial
   Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
   Financial Reporting Standards Council, and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act (No. 71 of
   2008), as amended, and the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited. The financial statements have been prepared
   under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, Neville Williams CA(SA). The interim report has not been
   audited or reviewed.

   These financial statements incorporate accounting policies that are consistent with those of the previous financial
   periods, with the exception of the adoption of the amendments to IAS 7: Cash flow statements, IAS 12: Income taxes
   and IFRS 12: Disclosure of interest in other entities. The implementation of these interpretations and amendments
   had no impact on the results of either the current or prior periods.

2. RESULTS
   Headline earnings
   For the period under review, headline earnings decreased by 6.1% from R4 690 million to R4 406 million, while
   headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 10.4% from 867.7 cents to 777.5 cents. The difference in the
   decrease between headline earnings and HEPS is attributed to the impact of the rights issue during the comparative
   period.

   Included in headline earnings for the period under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to
   R134 million (2016: R667 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders' exchange option of the
   exchangeable bonds (""option remeasurement""). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline earnings increased by
   6.2% from R4 023 million to R4 272 million, while HEPS increased by 1.3% from 744.3 cents to 753.9 cents. The
   increase in headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher earnings from RCL Foods,
   Total, RMI Holdings and higher finance income, offset by a lower contribution from Mediclinic.

   Commentary on reporting platforms' performance
   
   Banking
   The headline earnings contribution from the banking division amounted to R1 678 million (2016: R1 580 million),
   representing an increase of 6.2%. FirstRand and RMH reported headline earnings growth of 6.0% and 6.2%
   respectively. On a normalised basis, which excludes certain non-operational and accounting anomalies, FirstRand
   and RMH reported earnings growth of 7.0% and 7.2% respectively. These increases are mainly due to growth in both
   net interest income, underpinned by good growth in advances and deposits, and non-interest revenue due to strong
   growth in fee and commission income.
   
   Healthcare
   Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R487 million (2016: R983 million),
   representing a decrease of 50.5%. It should be noted that all the Al Noor facilities were rebranded to Mediclinic and
   therefore Mediclinic's contribution for the period under review included an accelerated amortisation charge of
   R171 million relating to the Al Noor trade name. Excluding the impact of the accelerated amortisation, Mediclinic's
   contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have decreased by 33.1% from R983 million to R658 million. The
   strengthening of the rand against the Swiss franc, British pound and United Arab Emirates dirham also had a
   negative impact on Mediclinic's contribution. In British pound terms Mediclinic's contribution, excluding the
   accelerated amortisation, decreased by 20.4% mainly due to a weaker performance by the Hirslanden and Middle
   East operating divisions and a decrease in the equity accounted earnings from Spire. Hirslanden's comparative period
   also included a positive past service cost adjustment of GBP10 million, while Spire's contribution to Mediclinic's results
   included a provision of GBP7 million for the potential cost of a settlement relating to civil litigation against a consultant
   who previously had practicing privileges at Spire.
   
   Consumer products
   The contribution from consumer products to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 140 million 
   (2016: R945 million), representing an increase of 20.6%. RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased
   by 56.6% to R498 million (2016: R318 million). The increase is mainly due to an improved result in the Chicken
   business unit as a result of a revised business model, lower feed prices and improved realisations. On a normalised
   basis, which excludes certain once-off items in the comparative period, relating to the settlement of the Zam Chick
   and Zamhatch put options and costs incurred on the implementation of the revised Chicken business model, RCL
   Foods reported headline earnings growth of 35.3%. Unilever's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased
   by 9.5% to R288 million (2016: R263 million). This increase is mainly due to an improvement in gross margins as a
   result of cost control. Distell's contribution to headline earnings, which includes the investment in Capevin
   Holdings, amounted to R354 million (2016: R364 million). Distell's results for the period under review were
   negatively impacted by once-off losses and write-offs amounting to R78 million in its associate, Tanzania
   Distilleries Limited, following a sachet ban and excise duty dispute. The comparative period included a reversal of a
   provision for interest payable in respect of an extended excise duty dispute of R42 million. Distell reported headline
   earnings growth, adjusted for foreign exchange movements and the aforementioned once-off items, of 3.2%, mainly
   driven by a 9.3% increase in revenue achieved across all regions and categories.
   
   Insurance
   RMI Holdings' contribution to headline earnings increased by 27.2% to R626 million (2016: R492 million). On a
   normalised basis, RMI Holdings reported an increase of 25.8% in earnings mainly due to Discovery and
   OUTsurance (excluding Hastings), which achieved earnings growth of 29.5% and 11.3% respectively. The strong
   result by Discovery was driven by both established and emerging businesses, while OUTsurance's results were
   driven by Youi's growth in operating profit as a result of lower natural peril claims in Australia. The contribution
   from Hastings were partially offset by higher funding costs relating to its acquisition in the prior year.
   
   Industrial
   Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R258 million (2016: R102 million). Included in the
   contribution to headline earnings for the period under review are favourable stock revaluations amounting to
   R135 million (2016: unfavourable stock revaluations of R28 million). These revaluations are the result of the
   volatility in the Brent Crude price and the rand exchange rate. Excluding these revaluations, the contribution
   decreased by 5.4% from R130 million to R123 million mainly due to a lower refining margin, the impact of planned
   and unplanned refinery shutdowns and a less favourable economic environment. Remgro's share of the results of
   KTH amounted to R73 million (2016: R58 million), mainly due to lower finance costs as a result of the repayment
   of debt following the disposal of the investment in Exxaro Resources Limited. Air Products' and Wispeco's
   contribution to headline earnings amounted to R142 million and R62 million respectively (2016: R151 million and
   R90 million), while PGSI contributed R16 million to Remgro's headline earnings (2016: R25 million).

   Infrastructure
   Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R52 million (2016: a loss of
   R18 million), impacted by stock impairments in the rail assembly business due to the closure of this business unit.
   This decrease was partly offset by improved results across core businesses mainly due to increased commodity
   demand and stronger drybulk shipping rates. For the period under review the CIV group contributed R32 million to
   headline earnings (2016: R44 million). This decrease is mainly due to higher finance costs and depreciation as a
   result of the expanding network, as well as lower equity accounted income due to the disposal of the CIV group's
   investment in Dartcom SA Proprietary Limited. Remgro's share of SEACOM's profit amounted to R32 million
   (2016: loss of R18 million). This increase is mainly due to improved results in South Africa and Kenya, as well as a
   once-off realisation of deferred revenue relating to the early termination of long term contracts.

   Media and sport
   Media and sport primarily consist of the interests in eMedia Investments and various sport interests, including
   interests in rugby franchises, as well as the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport. eMedia Investments' contribution to
   Remgro's headline earnings decreased to R3 million (2016: R33 million). This decrease is mainly due to a
   significant decline in license revenue resulting from a renegotiated DStv agreement.

   Other investments
   The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R29 million (2016: R39 million), of
   which Business Partners' contribution was R29 million (2016: R23 million).

   Central treasury and other net corporate costs
   Finance income amounted to R259 million (2016: R105 million). This increase is mainly due to higher average cash
   balances as a result of the Remgro rights issue in the comparative period. Finance costs amounted to R452 million
   (2016: R462 million). The positive fair value adjustment of R134 million (2016: R667 million) relates to the
   decrease in the value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds. Other net corporate costs amounted to
   R60 million (2016: R75 million).

   Earnings
   Earnings decreased by 20.8% to R4 131 million (2016: R5 219 million). This decrease is mainly the result of the
   lower positive fair value adjustment, relating to the decrease in value of the exchange option of the exchangeable
   bonds of R134 million (2016: R667 million), as well as Remgro's portion of the impairment of Mediclinic's
   investment in Spire amounting to R830 million.

3. INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

   Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 5.7% from R251.48 at 30 June 2017 to R265.84 at
   31 December 2017. The closing share price at 31 December 2017 was R236.00 (30 June 2017: R213.46)
   representing a discount of 11.2% (30 June 2017: 15.1%) to the intrinsic net asset value. Refer to Annexure B for full
   details.

   telecommunication installations, railway systems, ports, water and social infrastructure. In total, Remgro invested

   though not having any economic rights, will increase Remgro's voting rights in New Distell to 56.0%. The
   restructuring is still subject to the approval by the relevant competition authorities.

   Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (Unilever)
   On 22 September 2017 it was announced that Unilever will acquire Remgro's 25.75% shareholding in Unilever in

   RMI Holdings Limited (RMI Holdings)
   On 12 March 2018 RMI Holdings declared its interim dividend for the six months ended 31 December 2017, which

   subscribing for new RMI Holdings ordinary shares. Remgro has committed to reinvesting its cash dividend
   amounting to R178.4 million, by electing the reinvestment alternative, in order to receive 4 196 921 new RMI
   Holdings ordinary shares at R42.50 per share.

   Other than the above-mentioned transactions, there were no other significant transactions subsequent to

5. INFORMATION REGARDING UNLISTED INVESTMENTS
   Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (Unilever)
   Unilever has a 31 December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2017 have been included in
   Remgro's results for the period under review. Unilever's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six
   months under review increased by 9.5% to R288 million (2016: R263 million). The higher headline earnings
   contribution was mainly due to improvements in trading results, gross margins and cost control, which resulted in
   strong operating income in 2017.

   Air Products South Africa Proprietary Limited (Air Products)
   Air Products has a September year-end and its results for the six months ended 30 September 2017 have been
   included in Remgro's results for the period under review. Air Products' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
   for the period under review decreased by 6.0% to R142 million (2016: R151 million).

   Turnover for Air Products' six months ended 30 September 2017 increased by 3.1% to R1 492 million 
   (2016: R1 447 million), while the company's operating profit for the same period remained unchanged at
   R436 million (2016: R436 million).

   The period under review saw difficult trading conditions with depressed demand for the company's products in most
   sectors of the business.

   Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited (KTH)
   KTH is a leading black-owned investment company with a strong and diversified asset portfolio covering the
   resources, industrial, media, financial services, healthcare, property and information technology sectors.

   KTH's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period under review amounted to R73 million 
   (2016: R58 million). The increase in headline earnings was mainly due to the decrease in net finance cost to R117 million
   (2016: R219 million) resulting from the repayment of debt at the centre following the disposal of the investment in
   Exxaro Resources Limited (Exxaro). Exxaro's contribution to KTH's headline earnings for the period under review
   amounted to R69 million (2016: R134 million), which included the profit on disposal thereof (included in headline
   earnings).

   KTH's loss attributable to ordinary shareholders amounted to R138 million (2016: R383 million profit). The loss is
   mainly due to the impairment of the investment in Actom Proprietary Limited of R412 million, partly offset by the
   reversal of impairment of XR Platinum Partnership (R146 million), while the comparative period included the profit
   on disposal of Idwala Holdings Limited (R308 million).
   
   Income from equity accounted investments decreased to R50 million (2016: R57 million) partly due to lower
   contributions from other associates, joint ventures and partnerships as a result of the current difficult macro-
   economic conditions. The major contributors to equity accounted earnings during the reporting period were the
   investments in MMI Holdings Limited and Fidelity Bank (Ghana) Limited.
   
   Total South Africa Proprietary Limited (Total)
   Total has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2017 have been included in
   Remgro's results for the period under review. Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months
   to 31 December 2017 amounted to R258 million (2016: R102 million).
   
   Total's turnover for the six months ended 31 December 2017 increased by 12.9% to R30 196 million 
   (2016: R26 747 million), mainly due to a price increase and increased sales volumes in the mining and reseller sector during
   the period under review.
   
   The results were positively impacted by stock revaluation gains of R753 million (2016: loss of R156 million) due to
   the increase in the average basic fuel price and in crude prices during the period under review.
   
   Total experienced lower refining margins during the period under review in comparison to 2016, due to the impact of
   a major planned shutdown during October and November 2017, other unplanned shutdowns and a less favourable
   economic environment.
   
   PGSI Limited (PGSI)
   PGSI's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months to 31 December 2017 amounted to
   R16 million (2016: R25 million). PGSI's turnover for the period under review increased from R2 105 million to
   R2 171 million. The group's normalised operating profit, which excludes the impact of asset impairments, decreased
   from R159 million to R114 million.
   
   The group's main operating subsidiary in South Africa, PG Group, manufactures and supplies glass for the building
   and automotive industries. The building glass businesses reported a decline in profits due to weak domestic demand
   and growing pressure on selling prices in a competitive and oversupplied market.
   
   The automotive businesses were negatively impacted by economic pressures on consumers, lower claims from the
   insurance sector and weaker demand in export markets. The strong rand negatively impacted automotive export
   profitability. Supplies to local automotive assembly operations have been challenged by very competitive pricing,
   especially out of China. Original Equipment Manufacturers benchmarking prices with global competitors, who have
   the advantage of better economies of scale, also compressed margins.
   
   The Rest of Africa businesses, which have shown robust growth over the past few years, reported a decline in
   profitability with many regions impacted by weaker economic activity, as well as political instability in some
   regions.
   
   The group made good progress in reducing costs and improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies. This has
   established a sound strategic base for future growth.
   
   Wispeco Holdings Proprietary Limited (Wispeco)
   Wispeco's turnover for the six months ended 31 December 2017 decreased by 7.4% to R1 076 million 
   (2016: R1 162 million). This decrease resulted from sales volumes being lower in a market where price competition is
   intense and margins are under pressure. Headline earnings for the period under review decreased to R62 million
   (2016: R90 million). Import duties on aluminium extrusions were increased from 5% to 15% at the end of 2017,
   going some way in levelling the playing field going forward for local manufacturers against subsidised imports. The
   recent strengthening of the rand poses its own challenges for local manufacturing, emphasising the importance of
   Wispeco's drive to world-class productivity and lowest cost of production.
   
   Wispeco continues to lead the way with product innovation and aluminium solutions. New fit-for-purpose
   aluminium products are being developed to meet the needs of specific market segments. Its new design and
   estimating software package for fabricators of aluminium windows and doors (Starlite) will soon be launched to
   support sales and legal compliance in the fastest growing segment of the market. Technical manufacturing
   capabilities are elevated continuously to produce more challenging products for industrial (non-architectural)
   markets. Opportunities to expand the company's distribution footprint are exploited on an ongoing basis.
   
   Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIV group)
   Remgro has an effective interest of 51.0% in the CIV group, which is active in the telecommunications and
   information technology (ICT) sector. The key operating company of the group is Dark Fibre Africa Proprietary
   Limited (DFA), which constructs and owns fibre-optic networks.
   
   The CIV group has a March year-end and therefore its results for the six months ended 30 September 2017 have
   been included in Remgro's results for the period under review. The CIV group's contribution to Remgro's headline
   earnings for the period under review amounted to R32 million (2016: R44 million). This decrease is mainly due to
   higher finance costs and depreciation as a result of the expanding network, as well as lower equity accounted income
   due to the disposal of the CIV group's investment in Dartcom SA Proprietary Limited.
   
   DFA's revenue for the six months ended 30 September 2017 increased by 23.0% to R903 million 
   (2016: R734 million) mainly as a result of solid growth of 28.3% in annuity revenue. DFA's EBITDA for the period under
   review increased by 10.1% to R545 million. The current book value of the fibre-optic network is in excess of
   R6.8 billion (30 June 2017: R6.6 billion). DFA has thus far secured a healthy annuity income of R113 million per
   month, with the majority thereof being on long-term contracts with customers.
   
   DFA owns fibre network rings in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Midrand, Centurion and Pretoria, as well as a
   number of smaller metropolitan areas, including East London, Polokwane, Tlokwe, Emalahleni, George and
   Pietermaritzburg. At 30 September 2017, a total distance of 10 138 km (September 2016: 9 503 km) of fibre network
   had been completed in the major metropolitan areas, small towns and on long-haul routes. The network uptime for
   the period under review was 99.99%.
   
   The DFA revenue model is flexible to adapt to customers' needs and DFA either sells an indefeasible right of use
   agreement, which is a lump sum in advance, or on an annuity basis with multi-year contracts of mostly up to
   15 years. The future value of the current annuity contract base is in excess of R12.2 billion.
   
   SEACOM Capital Limited (SEACOM)
   Remgro has an effective interest of 30% in SEACOM, which operates Africa's largest international data network
   connecting Southern and Eastern Africa with Europe and Asia.
   
   SEACOM has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2017 have been included in
   Remgro's results for the period under review. SEACOM's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period
   under review amounted to R32 million (2016: headline loss of R18 million). The increase in headline earnings is due
   to an improved SEACOM Business result in South Africa and Kenya and the once-off realisation of deferred
   revenue associated with the early termination of long term indefeasible right of use (IRU) contracts.
   
   SEACOM's core sales and revenue streams are generated from its established base of Service Provider (wholesale)
   customers that also provide the basis for network scale, cost reductions and service innovation. The Service Provider
   segment is seeing strong demand for international capacity from large Over The Top providers and from the growth
   of Internet Protocol Transit traffic from local internet service providers. The SEACOM international and terrestrial
   networks are continuously being upgraded to keep pace with this demand.
   
   SEACOM Business provides the platform for future growth and improved profitability as the number and size of
   corporate customers increases. SEACOM Business added over 1 000 corporate customers in 2017, and over
   US$22 million in new order total contract value. The unit has a healthy pipeline to continue to grow sales and
   revenue in 2018. In addition to organic growth, SEACOM Business has made acquisitions of internet service
   providers focused largely on the enterprise market. SEACOM Business continues to focus its investments on 
   in-building fibre reticulation and terrestrial fibre to unlock previously unserviced areas.

PROPOSED DISPOSAL OF 25.75% SHAREHOLDING IN UNILEVER SA AND ACQUISITION OF SOUTHERN AFRICA
SPREADS PORTFOLIO


1.   Introduction
     Remgro shareholders are advised that Remgro, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Robertsons Holdings Proprietary
     Limited, has entered into an agreement with certain entities within the Unilever PLC group of companies whereby Remgro’s
     entire shareholding of 25.75% in Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (“Unilever SA”) will be exchanged for
     full ownership of the Unilever spreads business in Southern Africa (“Spreads Business”) plus ZAR 4.9 billion in cash (the
     “Transaction”).


2.   Transaction overview and rationale
     Unilever SA manufactures and markets a range of food, home and personal care products. Brands include Ola, Robertsons,
     Rama, Flora, Lipton, Joko, Shield, Dove, Sunlight and Omo. Remgro obtained its holding in Unilever SA in 2007 through the
     merger of certain of its interests in the food space with those of Unilever.
     
     While the investment has been a profitable one for Remgro, its inability to shape the strategic direction of the Unilever SA
     business has led Remgro to conclude that it will create more value through full ownership and control of the Spreads
     Business. As such, Remgro has agreed to dispose of its 25.75% interest in Unilever SA in exchange for the Spreads
     Business plus ZAR 4.9 billion in cash. The Spreads Business is an attractive business, with leading brands (including Rama,
     Stork, Flora and Rondo) and good growth prospects.

3.   Key terms of the Transaction
     3.1    Transaction consideration
            The Transaction consideration of ZAR 11.9 billion will be settled as follows:
                 -     ZAR 4.9 billion in cash; and
                 -     The acquisition of 100% of the Spreads Business, valued at ZAR 7.0 billion.
            
            The cash proceeds will be used by Remgro for investment and/or capital management purposes.
            
            This Transaction values Unilever SA and the Spreads Business at enterprise values of ZAR 48.1 billion and ZAR 7.0
            billion respectively.

     3.2    Board representation
            Remgro nominated director J J du Toit will resign from the Unilever SA board when the Transaction becomes
            effective.

     3.3    Conditions precedent
            The Transaction is subject to the relevant regulatory approvals including approval of the South African competition
            authorities.

     3.4    Timeline
            The expected closing date of the Transaction, subject to fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out in paragraph
            3.3 above, is in the first quarter of 2018.

4.   Value of the net assets and profits attributable to the net assets
     Following implementation of the Transaction, Remgro will no longer equity account for or receive dividends from Unilever
     SA but will consolidate the Spreads Business. Prior to completion, Remgro will receive a final dividend from Unilever SA for
     the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and a proportional dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 December
     2018, to the extent that it remains a shareholder during that year.
     
     Remgro carries its current interest in Unilever SA at an accounting book value of ZAR 3.7 billion. Remgro accounted for ZAR
     446 million in equity accounted earnings from this investment for the 12 months ended 30 June 2017.
     
     Unilever SA has warranted EBITDA from the Spreads Business of ZAR 522 million for the period ended 31 December 2016.
     The estimated profit attributable to the Spreads Business for the same period is ZAR 338 million, taking into account the
     depreciation and tax estimated to have been attributable on a debt free basis to the Spreads Business for that period.

5.   Categorisation
     The Transaction constitutes a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements. Accordingly, no
     shareholder approval is required.

Fair value remeasurements

The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale and investment in money market funds: Fair value is based on quoted market prices
  or, in the case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow, liquidation
  valuation and actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation methodologies
  and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
           (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table illustrates the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by hierarchy
level:

There were no transfers between the different levels.

Level 3 financial assets consist mainly of investments in the Milestone China entities (Milestone), the Kagiso Infrastructure
Empowerment Fund (KIEF) and the Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 554 million, R272 million
and R246 million respectively. These investments are all valued based on the fair value of each investment's underlying
assets, which are valued using a variety of valuation methodologies. Listed entities are valued at the last quoted share price on
the reporting date, whereas unlisted entities' valuation methods include discounted cash flow valuations, appropriate earnings
and revenue multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (40%), cash and cash equivalents (4%) and unlisted investments (56%).
Unlisted investments included at recent transaction prices in Milestone's fair value amounted to R606 million, while its
remaining eight unlisted investments were valued at R264 million and is considered to be immaterial. KIEF's investments
were valued using the discounted cash flow method or the agreed exit price. PRIF's main assets are the investments in ETG
Group and Nova Lumos. ETG Group was valued using appropriate revenue and earnings multiples based on peer group
companies to determine a price-to-book valuation, while Nova Lumos was recently acquired and therefor valued at its cost
price.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on Remgro's
financial statements as the underlying assets of the funds in which Remgro made its investments are widely spread.

1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
     (JSE) for summary financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial
     statements. The JSE requires summary financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the framework
     concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
     and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
     Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the
     information required by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

     The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summary
     consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies
     applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements, with the exception of the
     adoption of the amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41: Agriculture. These amendments
     have to be applied retrospectively and accordingly the reported results of the comparative year were restated. The
     restatements pertain to the reclassification of bearer plants from biological assets to property, plant and equipment,
     the transfer of the remaining non-current biological assets (being the produce) to current biological assets and the
     measurement of the reclassified assets under the appropriate accounting treatment. Refer to the section ""Restatement
     of comparative numbers"" for further detail.

     The financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, Neville Williams
     CA(SA).

2.   RIGHTS ISSUE
     During October 2016 Remgro completed a rights issue whereby 48 110 637 new ordinary shares and 3 550 635 new
     B ordinary shares were issued at a subscription price of R192.50 per share for a total consideration of
     R9 944.8 million. The offer to the ordinary shareholders was made in the ratio of 10 rights issue shares for every
     100 ordinary shares held on the record date of the rights issue, representing an aggregate amount of
     R9 261.3 million. In order to maintain the current level of voting rights of Rupert Beleggings Proprietary Limited
     (Rupert Beleggings) in Remgro, and to contribute to the new equity capital being raised, Remgro offered Rupert
     Beleggings the right to subscribe for 3 550 635 B ordinary shares, representing an aggregate amount of
     R683.5 million. In terms of IAS 33 paragraph 26, an adjustment to the weighted average number of shares in issue
     for the comparative period is required as the shares were issued at a discount to the Remgro share price on the day
     before the announcement (being R243.29 per share). Consequently, the comparable weighted number of shares in
     issue was adjusted by 9 994 195 shares to account for the deemed dilutive effect of the rights issue. Refer to the
     section ""Restatement of comparative numbers"" for further detail.

3.   RESULTS
     Headline earnings
     For the year to 30 June 2017, headline earnings increased by 40.0% from R5 874 million to R8 221 million, while
     headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 32.7% from 1 119.6 cents to 1 485.5 cents. The difference in the
     increase between headline earnings and HEPS is attributed to the impact of the rights issue during the year under
     review.

     Included in headline earnings for the comparative year are once-off transaction costs incurred with the Mediclinic
     International Limited (Mediclinic) rights issue and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc (Al Noor) transaction amounting to
     R788 million (""once-off costs""), as well as a negative fair value adjustment of R730 million, relating to the increase
     in value of the bondholders' exchange option of the bonds (""option remeasurement""). The year under review
     includes a positive fair value adjustment of R687 million. Excluding these items, headline earnings increased by
     1.9% from R7 392 million to R7 534 million, while HEPS decreased by 3.4% from 1 409.0 cents to 1 361.3 cents.
     The increase in headline earnings, excluding once-off costs and option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher
     contributions from the banking and insurance platforms, KTH and higher interest income, partly offset by lower
     earnings from RCL Foods and higher finance costs.

     Commentary on reporting platforms' performance
     
     Healthcare
     Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 875 million (2016: R1 566 million),
     representing an increase of 19.7%. It should be noted that Mediclinic's results for the comparative period include
     once-off transaction costs incurred with the Al Noor transaction amounting to R891 million (Remgro's portion being
     R386 million). Excluding these once-off items Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have
     decreased by 3.9% from R1 952 million to R1 875 million. This decrease is mainly due to the strengthening of the
     rand against the British pound. In British pound terms Mediclinic's contribution, excluding once-off transaction
     costs, increased by 8.2% mainly due to Remgro's increased interest in Mediclinic (42.1% to 44.6%), the inclusion of
     the results of Al Noor and Spire Healthcare Group plc (Spire) for the full twelve months and a strong performance in
     Switzerland, as well as good organic growth in Southern Africa. The increase is partly offset by the underperforming
     Middle East business, which was impacted by a number of operational and regulatory factors, doctor vacancies and
     delayed facility openings.
     
     Banking
     The headline earnings contribution from the banking division amounted to R3 163 million (2016: R2 989 million),
     representing an increase of 5.8%. FirstRand and RMBH reported headline earnings growth of 6.1% and 5.7%
     respectively. On a normalised basis, which excludes certain non-operational and accounting anomalies, FirstRand
     and RMBH reported earnings growth of 7.1% and 6.6% respectively. These increases are mainly due to growth in
     both net interest income, underpinned by good growth in deposits and a positive endowment on the back of higher
     average interest rates, and non-interest revenue due to strong growth in fee and commission income at FNB and
     from realisations in RMB's private equity portfolio at marginally higher levels. This growth in earnings was partly
     offset by an increase in credit impairment charges.
     
     Consumer products
     The contribution from consumer products to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 354 million (2016:
     R1 605 million), representing a decrease of 15.6%. RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
     decreased by 34.3% to R424 million (2016: R645 million). During the comparative period RCL Foods' results were
     positively impacted by the release of a R163 million provision raised for uncertain tax disputes as part of the
     Foodcorp acquisition, as well as a R119 million gain on the exercise of the Zam Chick and Zamhatch put options.
     On a normalised basis, RCL Foods reported headline earnings growth of 7.7%. The Sugar business benefited from
     price increases which helped offset reduced volumes, while the Chicken business was impacted by a massive
     oversupply in the local market caused by local production and dumping of imported chicken. Unilever's contribution
     to Remgro's headline earnings decreased by 2.6% to R449 million (2016: R461 million). This decrease is mainly the
     result of lower tax allowances following the completion of manufacturing investments, as well as a weakening trade
     environment. Distell's contribution to headline earnings, which includes the investment in Capevin Holdings,
     amounted to R481 million (2016: R499 million). Distell's results were negatively impacted by a stronger rand,
     particularly against the British pound, as well as intense competition and pressure on consumers. Distell reported
     headline earnings growth, adjusted for foreign exchange movements, of 7.4%.
     
     Insurance
     RMI Holdings' contribution to headline earnings increased by 17.2% to R1 041 million (2016: R888 million). On a
     normalised basis, RMI Holdings reported an increase of 16.4% in earnings mainly due to OUTsurance and
     Discovery, which achieved earnings growth of 25.7% and 8.2% respectively. The strong result by OUTsurance was
     driven by favourable claims experienced across the group, as well as a significant improvement in the cost-to-income
     ratio, particularly at Youi due to scale benefits and cost efficiencies. With effect from 1 March 2017 RMI Holdings
     acquired a 29.9% stake in Hastings Group Holdings plc (Hastings), a fast-growing agile digital general insurance
     provider operating principally in the UK motor market. The contribution from Hastings were partially offset by
     higher funding costs relating to the acquisition.
     
     Industrial
     Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R224 million (2016: R291 million). The decrease is
     mainly due to a lower refining margin. Remgro's share of the results of KTH amounted to a profit of R34 million
     (2016: loss of R229 million). In the comparative period, KTH's results were negatively impacted by unfavourable
     fair value adjustments relating to its investments in Exxaro Resources Limited and MMI Holdings Limited
     preference shares. Air Products' and Wispeco's contribution to headline earnings amounted to R298 million and
     R169 million respectively (2016: R275 million and R144 million), while PGSI contributed R25 million to Remgro's
     headline earnings (2016: R36 million).
     
     Infrastructure
     Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R48 million (2016: a loss of
     R45 million). The increased loss is mainly due to the underperformance of the rail assembly businesses resulting
     from a lack in demand for locomotives, continued uncertainty in the mining sector and low levels of activity in
     Southern Africa. The increased loss is partly offset by an improvement in dry-bulk shipping rates and commodity
     markets, as well as the Agricultural businesses. For the year under review the CIV group contributed R110 million to
     headline earnings (2016: R64 million). This increase is mainly due to solid growth in annuity revenue. Remgro's
     share of SEACOM's loss amounted to R33 million (2016: loss of R33 million).
     
     Media and sport
     Media and sport primarily consist of the interests in eMedia Investments and various sport interests, including
     interests in rugby franchises, as well as the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport. eMedia Investments' contribution to
     Remgro's headline earnings increased to R49 million (2016: R28 million), mainly due to higher advertising revenue
     as a result of an improvement in market share. The increase is partly offset by higher business development costs, as
     well as continued investment into the multi-channel business.
     
     Other investments
     The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R70 million (2016: R67 million), of
     which Business Partners' contribution was R54 million (2016: R48 million).
     
     Central treasury and other net corporate costs
     Finance income amounted to R349 million (2016: R125 million). This increase is mainly due to higher average cash
     balances as a result of the Remgro rights issue. Finance costs mainly consist of funding costs amounting to
     R893 million (2016: R466 million) and once-off transaction costs in the comparative period amounting to
     R402 million, which relate to the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor transaction. The positive fair value adjustment
     of R687 million relates to the decrease in the value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds (2016:
     negative fair value adjustment of R730 million). Other net corporate costs amounted to R143 million (2016:
     R251 million). The comparative period includes transaction and funding costs amounting to R115 million relating to
     Remgro's acquisition of Spire. These costs were recouped from Mediclinic as part of the Spire disposal
     consideration, outside headline earnings.
     
     Earnings
     Earnings increased by 57.2% to R8 431 million (2016: R5 364 million). This increase is mainly the result of the
     positive fair value adjustment relating to the decrease in value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds
     amounting to R687 million (2016: negative fair value adjustment of R730 million) and the once-off transaction costs
     in the comparative period amounting to R788 million, which relate to the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor
     transaction. The comparative period also includes an impairment of the investment in Grindrod (R1 861 million),
     Remgro's portion of the impairments in Grindrod's Rail and Shipping divisions (R577 million) and Remgro's
     portion of an impairment in RCL Foods' Milling business (R439 million), offset by a profit of R2 262 million
     realised on the dilution of Remgro's interest in Mediclinic as part of the Al Noor transaction.

4.   INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE
     Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 17.9% from R306.44 at 30 June 2016 to R251.48 at
     30 June 2017 mainly due to a 40.4% drop in the market value of the Mediclinic investment, as well as the dilutive
     effect of the rights issue. The closing share price at 30 June 2017 was R213.46 (2016: R254.66) representing a
     discount of 15.1% (2016: 16.9%) to the intrinsic net asset value. Refer to Annexure B for full details.

5.   INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
     The most important investment activities during the year under review were as follows:

     Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIVH)
     During September 2016 Remgro subscribed for an additional 12 353 shares in CIVH for a total amount of
     R329.3 million in terms of a CIVH rights issue. As a result of the share subscription, Remgro's interest in CIVH
     increased marginally to 51.0% on 30 June 2017 (2016: 50.9%).

     Capevin Holdings Limited (Capevin)
     During May 2017 Remgro acquired a further 30 667 156 Capevin shares for a total amount of R264.5 million. This
     transaction increased Remgro's effective interest in Capevin to 19.0% (2016: 15.6%).

     Invenfin Proprietary Limited (Invenfin)
     During July 2016 Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Invenfin) acquired a 30% stake in Dynamic
     Commodities Proprietary Limited (Dynamic Commodities) for R80.0 million. Dynamic Commodities is an export-
     focused company that produces high quality frozen desserts, snacks and value-added ""fresh frozen"" fruit.

     During August 2016, Invenfin also acquired a 30% stake in Joya Brands Proprietary Limited, a sweets manufacturer,
     for R50.2 million.

     Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF)
     On 15 August 2016 PRIF had its final close, which resulted in Remgro receiving a capital distribution of
     R14.6 million, as well as an income distribution of R3.8 million. During the year under review Remgro also invested
     a further R58.0 million in PRIF, thereby increasing its cumulative investment to R255.2 million. As at 30 June 2017
     the remaining commitment to PRIF amounted to R394.8 million.

     Other
     Other smaller investments amounted to R215 million.

     Events after year-end

     Distell Group Limited (Distell)
     During June 2017 it was announced that Distell will restructure its multi-tiered ownership structure (the Proposed
     Transaction) and in order to give effect to the Proposed Transaction, Remgro will, through a number of inter-
     conditional steps, exchange its existing 50% shareholding in Remgro-Capevin Investments Proprietary Limited
     (RCI) for additional ordinary shares in Capevin Holdings Limited (Capevin) (RCI Exchange). Remgro currently
     holds 19.0% of the ordinary shares in Capevin and after the RCI Exchange, Remgro will hold 59.5% in Capevin.
     Following the RCI Exchange, Remgro will exchange its entire Capevin shareholding for ordinary shares in a new
     listed entity (New Distell), which entity will be substantially similar to the current Distell. Remgro will, in addition,
     also receive unlisted B shares in New Distell, which shares will be linked to those New Distell ordinary shares
     acquired by Remgro in virtue of the RCI Exchange, resulting in Remgro replicating RCI's current 52.8% voting
     rights in Distell. The unlisted B shares will only carry voting rights in New Distell and will have no economic
     participation. The Proposed Transaction will have no impact on Remgro's intrinsic asset value and Remgro will
     retain its economic interest in Distell. Post implementation of the Proposed Transaction, Remgro will, in aggregate,
     have voting rights of 56.0% in New Distell. The Proposed Transaction is still subject to a number of conditions
     precedent, inter alia Distell and Capevin shareholders' approvals, which is expected to be on 27 October 2017, as
     well as the approval of the relevant competition authorities.

     RMI Holdings Limited (RMI Holdings)
     On 19 September 2017 RMI Holdings declared its final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2017, which included an
     alternative to the cash dividend of either receiving a scrip distribution or reinvesting the cash dividend by subscribing
     for new RMI Holdings ordinary shares. Remgro has committed to reinvesting its cash dividend amounting to
     R292.3 million, by electing the reinvestment alternative, in order to receive 7 691 641 new RMI Holdings ordinary
     shares at R38.00 per share.

     Other than the above-mentioned transactions, there were no other significant transactions subsequent to
     30 June 2017.

6.   TREASURY SHARES
     At 30 June 2016, 1 725 393 Remgro ordinary shares (0.4%) were held as treasury shares by a wholly owned
     subsidiary of Remgro. As previously reported, these shares were acquired for the purpose of hedging Remgro's share
     incentive scheme.

     During the year under review 224 542 Remgro ordinary shares were utilised to settle Remgro's obligation towards
     scheme participants who exercised the rights granted to them. Remgro also followed its rights with respect to
     treasury shares it held when it completed the rights issue during October 2016 and subscribed for 165 787 Remgro
     ordinary shares for a total amount of R32 million.

     At 30 June 2017, 1 666 638 (0.3%) Remgro ordinary shares were held as treasury shares.

The Company's directors are responsible for the preparation of a summary of the audited consolidated financial statements.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND
Declaration of Dividend No. 34
Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 301 cents (2016: 275 cents) per share has been declared out of income
reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par value, for the year
ended 30 June 2017.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 60.2 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 240.8 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in
terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2017 therefore amounts to 495 cents, compared to 460 cents for

TRADING STATEMENT

Paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”)
requires companies to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that their
financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

Remgro’s results for the year ended 30 June 2017 are due to be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on or about 20 September 2017. In compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements, Remgro
shareholders are advised that Remgro’s headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the year ended
30 June 2017 is expected to be between 1 466.7 cents (31% higher) and 1 511.5 cents (35% higher)
compared to the HEPS of 1 119.6 cents reported for the year ended 30 June 2016.

The increase in HEPS is mainly due to a positive fair value adjustment of R687 million, relating to
the decrease in value of the bondholders’ exchange option of the exchangeable bonds (“option
remeasurement”), whereas the comparative results were affected by a negative option remeasurement
of R730 million, as well as once-off transaction costs amounting to R788 million, which relate to the
Mediclinic International Limited rights issue and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc transaction.

Shareholders were informed during March 2017 that Remgro adopted the amendments to IAS 16:
Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41: Agriculture and adjusted the prior year’s weighted
number of shares in issue due to a rights issue, which resulted in the restatement of its results for the
comparative year ended 30 June 2016. It should be noted that the restated results are used as basis for
the guidance set out above.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING BY DISTELL GROUP LIMITED OF ITS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE

1. INTRODUCTION

   Remgro shareholders are referred to the Distell Group Limited (“Distell”) and Capevin Holdings
   Limited (“Capevin”) detailed announcements, released on the Stock Exchange News Service
   (“SENS”) simultaneously with this announcement, setting out the terms of the proposed
   restructuring by Distell of its ownership structure (“Proposed Transaction”).

   The purpose of this announcement is to disclose the effect of the Proposed Transaction on the
   Company.

2. EFFECT OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION TERMS ON REMGRO

   In order to give effect to the Proposed Transaction, Remgro will, through a number of inter-
   conditional steps, exchange its existing 50% shareholding in Remgro-Capevin Investments
   Proprietary Limited (“RCI”) for additional ordinary shares in Capevin (“RCI-Related Capevin
   Shares”) (“RCI Exchange”). Remgro currently holds 19.0% of the ordinary shares in issue in
   Capevin pre the RCI Exchange and will, after the RCI Exchange, hold 59.5% in Capevin.

   Furthermore, following the RCI Exchange, Remgro will exchange its full Capevin ordinary
   shareholding for ordinary shares in a new listed entity (“New Distell Exchange”), which new
   listed entity will be substantially similar to the current Distell (“New Distell”). Remgro will, in
   addition, receive unlisted B shares in New Distell (“B shares”). The B shares in New Distell will
   be stapled to those New Distell ordinary shares acquired by Remgro pursuant to the New Distell
   Exchange in respect of the RCI-Related Capevin Shares, resulting in Remgro replicating RCI’s
   current 52.8% voting rights in Distell. The unlisted B shares will only carry voting rights in New
   Distell and will have no economic participation, save for the right, if repurchased, to be
   repurchased at their issue price of R0.00001 per B Share and the right, upon liquidation of New
   Distell, for their holders to be repaid their issue price of R0.00001 per B Share before any
   liquidation payment or distribution is made to the ordinary shareholders of New Distell.

   Pursuant to the Proposed Transaction, both Distell and Capevin will be delisted (“Distell
   Delisting” and “Capevin Delisting”) and become wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Distell.

3. VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AND PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET ASSETS

   Remgro shareholders are advised that the implementation of the Proposed Transaction will
   have no impact on the Company’s intrinsic asset value or headline earnings attributable to
   Distell as disclosed in the Company’s financial statements. Additionally, Remgro will retain its
   economic interest in Distell post implementation of the Proposed Transaction.

   As at 31 December 2016                         Headline earnings (1)     Intrinsic asset value (1)
   Distell (30.9% interest (2))                                   R502m                      R9.782bn
   (1) Based on LTM numbers as at December 2016 per the interim financial statements
   (2) The Category 2 Transaction relates to 26.4% of Remgro’s holding in Distell, as held through RCI, the additional holding is held via listed shares
       in Capevin that do not form part of the Category 2 Transaction
   (3) As at December 2016 Remgro held 15.6% of the listed Capevin shares, subsequent to the interim results Remgro has increased its holding in
       Capevin to 19.0%


4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

   Implementation of the Proposed Transaction is subject to fulfilment or waiver, where capable
   of waiver, of the following inter-conditional conditions precedent, by no later than Monday,
   2 October 2017 (1), being the expected effective date of the Proposed Transaction:

   - Distell shareholder approval of the New Distell Exchange and Distell Delisting;
   - Capevin shareholder approval of the RCI Exchange, the New Distell Exchange and the
     Capevin Delisting;
   - approval of the relevant competition authorities;
   - approval of the Takeover Regulation Panel and the JSE Limited;
   - registration of the prospectus to be issued by New Distell with the Companies and
     Intellectual Property Commission;
   - the registration of the special resolutions required to restructure New Distell’s share
     capital and to adopt the New Distell memorandum of incorporation;
   - waiver by the minority shareholders of Distell and Capevin of mandatory offers by
     Remgro for their ordinary Distell and Capevin shares pursuant to implementation of the
     RCI Exchange; and
   - within the period prescribed by section 164(7) of the Companies Act, no demands, or
     valid demands which in aggregate represent not more than 5% of Distell or Capevin
     shares, are received by Distell or Capevin in accordance with section 115(8) of the
     Companies Act.

 (1) This date may change to the extent that the requisite approvals of the relevant Competition Authorities are not obtained by
     Monday, 2 October 2017


5  JSE CATEGORISATION

The Proposed Transaction constitutes a Category 2 transaction in terms of paragraph 9.5(a) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements in respect of the Company, and accordingly no shareholder approval is
required.

Fair value remeasurements

The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale and investment in money market funds: Fair value is based on quoted market prices
  or, in the case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow, liquidation
  valuation and actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation methodologies
  and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
           (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following tables illustrate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by hierarchy
level:

There were no transfers between the different levels.

Level 3 financial assets consist mainly of investments in the Milestone China entities (Milestone), the Kagiso Infrastructure
Empowerment Fund (KIEF) and the Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 551 million, R283 million
and R193 million respectively. These investments are all valued based on the fair value of each investment's underlying
assets, which are valued using a variety of valuation methodologies. Listed entities are valued at the last quoted share price on
the reporting date, whereas unlisted entities' methods include discounted cash flow valuations and appropriate earnings and
revenue multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (38%), cash and cash equivalents (4%) and unlisted investments (58%).
68% of the unlisted investments were valued at cost (or the price at which additional investments were made) as Milestone's
management considers the transaction price to be the fair value of the investments, while the remaining 32% was valued at
approximately R279 million. KIEF's investments were valued using the discounted cash flow method. PRIF's main asset is
the investment in ETG Group and it was valued using appropriate revenue and earnings multiples based on peer group
companies to determine a price-to-book valuation.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on Remgro's
financial statements.

COMMENTS

1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The interim report is prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of International
     Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, and the SAICA Financial
     Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
     Financial Reporting Standards Council, and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
     (No. 71 of 2008), as amended, and the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited. The financial statements have been prepared
     under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, Neville Williams CA(SA). The interim report has not been
     audited or reviewed.

     These financial statements incorporate accounting policies that are consistent with those of the previous financial
     periods, with the exception of the adoption of the amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment and
     IAS 41: Agriculture. These amendments have to be applied retrospectively and accordingly the reported results of
     both comparative periods were restated. The restatements pertain to the reclassification of bearer plants from
     biological assets to property, plant and equipment, the transfer of the remaining non-current biological assets (being
     the produce) to current biological assets and the measurement of the reclassified assets under the appropriate
     accounting treatment. Refer to the section ""Restatement of comparative numbers"" for further detail.

     During the period under review various other new and revised accounting standards became effective, but their
     implementation had no impact on the results of either the current or prior periods.

2.   RIGHTS ISSUE

     During October 2016 Remgro completed a rights issue whereby 48 110 637 new Remgro ordinary shares and
     3 550 635 B ordinary shares were issued at a subscription price of R192.50 per share for a total consideration of
     R9 944.8 million. In terms of IAS 33 paragraph 26, an adjustment to the weighted average number of shares in issue
     for the comparative periods is required as the shares were issued at a discount to the Remgro share price on the day
     before the announcement (being R243.29 per share). Consequently, the comparable weighted number of shares in
     issue was adjusted by 9 994 195 shares to account for the deemed dilutive effect of the rights issue. Refer to the
     section ""Restatement of comparative numbers"" for further detail.

3.   RESULTS

     Headline earnings
     For the period under review headline earnings increased by 29.7% from R3 616 million to R4 690 million, while
     headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 25.9% from 689.4 cents to 867.7 cents. The difference in the
     increase between headline earnings and HEPS is attributed to the impact of the rights issue during the period under
     review.

     Included in headline earnings for the comparative period are once-off transaction costs incurred with the Mediclinic
     rights issue and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc (Al Noor) transaction amounting to R128 million (""once-off costs"").
     The period under review includes a positive fair value adjustment of R667 million, relating to the decrease in value
     of the bondholders' exchange option (accounted for as a derivative liability) of the bonds (""option remeasurement"")
     that were issued during March 2016 to partially refinance the foreign bridge funding that was raised for the Al Noor
     transaction. The bonds are exchangeable into Mediclinic plc shares and/or cash and fair value adjustments on the
     option (reflecting inter alia the movement in the underlying Mediclinic plc share price) are expected to cause
     volatility in headline earnings during its five-year term. Excluding these items, headline earnings increased by 7.5%
     from R3 744 million to R4 023 million, whereas HEPS increased by 4.3% from 713.8 cents to 744.3 cents. The
     increase in headline earnings, excluding once-off costs and option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher
     contributions from the healthcare and banking platforms and KTH, partly offset by lower earnings from RCL Foods
     and higher finance costs.

Commentary on reporting platforms' performance

Food, liquor and home care
The contribution from food, liquor and homecare to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R945 million 
(2015: R1 242 million), representing a decrease of 23.9%. RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
decreased by 44.6% to R318 million (2015: R574 million). During the comparative period RCL Foods' results were
positively impacted by the release of a R163 million provision raised for uncertain tax disputes as part of the
Foodcorp acquisition. Excluding the above, RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have
decreased by 29.0% from R448 million. This decrease is mainly due to a lower contribution from the Chicken
business, partly offset by a strong Sugar business performance. The Chicken business was impacted by a massive
oversupply in the local market caused by local production and dumping of imported chicken, while the Sugar
business benefitted from price increases which helped offset reduced volumes. Unilever's contribution to Remgro's
headline earnings decreased by 14.3% to R263 million (2015: R307 million). This decrease is mainly the result of
lower tax allowances following the completion of manufacturing investments, as well as a weakening trade
environment. Distell's contribution to headline earnings, which includes the investment in Capevin Holdings,
amounted to R364 million (2015: R361 million). Distell's results were negatively impacted by a stronger rand,
particularly against the British pound, as well as intense competition and pressure on consumers.

Banking
The headline earnings contribution from the banking division amounted to R1 580 million (2015: R1 386 million),
representing an increase of 14.0%. Both FirstRand and RMBH reported headline earnings growth of 14.0%. On a
normalised basis, which excludes certain non-operational and accounting anomalies, mainly adjustments relating to
the share based payment obligation, FirstRand and RMBH reported earnings growth of 6.7% and 6.4% respectively.
These increases are mainly due to growth in both net interest income and non-interest revenue from FNB, RMB and
WesBank, partly offset by an increase in credit impairment charges.

Healthcare
Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R983 million (2015: R787 million). This
increase is mainly due to Remgro's increased interest in Mediclinic (42.1% to 44.6%), the inclusion of the results of
Al Noor and Spire Healthcare Group plc (Spire) and a strong performance in Switzerland, as well as good organic
growth in Southern Africa. The increase is partly offset by the underperforming Middle East business, which was
impacted by a number of operational and regulatory factors, including the new insurance co-payment requirements,
doctor vacancies and delayed facility openings.

Insurance
RMI Holdings' contribution to headline earnings increased by 8.1% to R492 million. On a normalised basis, RMI
Holdings reported an increase of 11.2% in earnings, with OUTsurance and Discovery achieving earnings growth of
24.1% and 2.4% respectively, offset by lower earnings from MMI Holdings (lower by 3.8%). The strong result by
OUTsurance was driven by a significant improvement in the cost-to-income ratio, particularly at Youi due to scale
benefits and cost efficiencies.

Industrial
Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R102 million (2015: R51 million). Included in the
contribution to headline earnings for the period under review is unfavourable stock revaluations amounting to
R28 million (2015: unfavourable stock revaluations of R144 million). These revaluations are the result of the
volatility in the Brent Crude price and the rand exchange rate. Excluding these revaluations, the contribution
decreased by 33.3% from R195 million to R130 million mainly due to a lower refining margin and lower volumes.
Remgro's share of the results of KTH amounted to a profit of R58 million (2015: loss of R260 million). In the
comparative period, KTH's results were negatively impacted by unfavourable fair value adjustments relating to its
investments in Exxaro Resources Limited and MMI Holdings Limited preference shares. Air Products' and
Wispeco's contribution to headline earnings amounted to R151 million and R90 million respectively 
(2015: R142 million and R54 million), while PGSI contributed R25 million to Remgro's headline earnings 
(2015: R18 million).

Infrastructure
Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R18 million (2015: a profit of
R43 million). This loss is mainly the result of the continuation of weak commodity markets and low dry-bulk
shipping rates during the period. For the period under review the CIV group contributed R44 million to headline
earnings (2015: R35 million). Remgro's share of SEACOM's loss amounted to R18 million (2015: loss of
R28 million).

Media and sport
Media and sport primarily consist of the interests in eMedia and various sport interests, including interests in rugby
franchises, as well as the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport. eMedia's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
amounted to R33 million (2015: R11 million), mainly due to higher advertising revenue as a result of an
improvement in market share. The increase is partly offset by higher business development costs, as well as
continued investment into the multi-channel business. Other media and sport interests' contribution to headline
earnings amounted to a loss of R58 million (2015: loss of R39 million).

Other investments
The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R39 million (2015: R31 million), of
which Business Partners' contribution was R23 million (2015: R21 million).

Central treasury and other net corporate costs
Finance income amounted to R105 million (2015: R77 million). This increase is mainly due to higher average cash
balances as a result of the Remgro rights issue. Finance costs mainly consist of funding costs amounting to
R458 million (2015: R91 million) and once-off transaction costs in the comparative period amounting to
R128 million, which relate to the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor transaction, as well as a positive fair value
adjustment for the period under review of R667 million, relating to the decrease in the value of the exchange option
of the exchangeable bonds. Other net corporate costs amounted to R75 million (2015: R194 million). The
comparative period includes transaction and funding costs amounting to R115 million relating to Remgro's
acquisition of Spire. These costs were recouped from Mediclinic as part of the Spire disposal consideration, outside
headline earnings.

Earnings
Earnings increased by 56.5% to R5 219 million (2015: R3 334 million). This increase is mainly the result of the
positive fair value adjustment relating to the decrease in value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds
amounting to R667 million, as well as a reversal of impairment of the investment in Grindrod amounting to
R724 million.

4.   INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

     Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 15.9% from R306.44 at 30 June 2016 to R257.79 at
     31 December 2016 mainly due to a 38.7% drop in the market value of the Mediclinic investment, as well as the
     dilutive effect of the rights issue. The closing share price at 31 December 2016 was R223.05 
     (30 June 2016: R254.66) representing a discount of 13.5% (30 June 2016: 16.9%) to the intrinsic net asset value. Refer to Annexure
     B for full details.

5.   INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

     The most important investment activities during the period under review were as follows:

     Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIVH)
     During September 2016 Remgro subscribed for an additional 12 353 shares in CIVH for a total amount of
     R329.3 million in terms of a CIVH rights issue. As a result of the share subscription, Remgro's interest in CIVH
     increased marginally from 50.9% on 30 June 2016 to 51.0% on 31 December 2016.

     Invenfin Proprietary Limited (Invenfin)
     On 27 July 2016 Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Invenfin) acquired a 30% stake in Dynamic
     Commodities Proprietary Limited (Dynamic Commodities) for R80.0 million. Dynamic Commodities is an export-
     focused company that produces high quality frozen desserts, snacks and value-added ""fresh frozen"" fruit.

     During August 2016, Invenfin also acquired a 30% stake in Joya Brands Proprietary Limited, a sweets manufacturer,
     for R50.2 million.

     Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF)
     On 15 August 2016 PRIF had its final close, which resulted in Remgro receiving a capital distribution of
     R14.6 million, as well as an income distribution of R3.8 million. During the period under review Remgro also
     invested a further R5.6 million in PRIF, thereby increasing its cumulative investment to R202.9 million. As at
     31 December 2016 the remaining commitment to PRIF amounted to R447.1 million.

     Other
     Other smaller investments amounted to R152 million.

     Events after 31 December 2016
     There were no significant transactions subsequent to 31 December 2016.

6.   INFORMATION REGARDING UNLISTED INVESTMENTS

     Unilever South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (Unilever)
     Unilever has a 31 December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2016 have been equity
     accounted in Remgro's results for the period under review. Unilever's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
     for the six months under review decreased by 14.3% to R263 million (2015: R307 million). The lower headline
     earnings contribution was mainly due to a higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax allowances following the
     completion of manufacturing investments, as well as a tough competitive environment experienced in this consumer
     market.

     Air Products South Africa Proprietary Limited (Air Products)
     Air Products has a September year-end and its results for the six months ended 30 September 2016 have been
     included in Remgro's results for the period under review. Air Products' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
     for the period under review increased by 6.3% to R151 million (2015: R142 million).

     Turnover for Air Products' six months ended 30 September 2016 increased by 6.2% to R1 447 million 
     (2015: R1 363 million), while the company's operating profit for the same period increased by 2.3% to R436 million 
     (2015: R426 million).

     The period under review saw difficult trading conditions with depressed demand for the company's products in most
     sectors of the business.

Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited (KTH)
KTH is a leading black-owned investment company with a strong and diversified asset portfolio covering the
resources, industrial, services, media, financial services and healthcare sectors.

KTH's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period under review amounted to R58 million 
(2015: headline loss of R260 million). The increase in earnings was mainly due to KTH's net attributable share of positive
fair value adjustments on its equity investment in Exxaro Resources Limited (R320 million), AECI Limited
(R64 million) and Aveng Limited (R43 million).

Income from equity accounted investments decreased to R57 million (2015: R245 million) partly due to the disposal
of Idwala Holdings Limited, as well as significantly lower contributions from other associates due to the difficult
macro-economic conditions.

Net finance costs amounted to R219 million (2015: R209 million).

Total South Africa Proprietary Limited (Total)
Total has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2016 have been included in
Remgro's results for the period under review. Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months
to 31 December 2016 amounted to R102 million (2015: R51 million).

Total's turnover for the six months ended 31 December 2016 increased by 2.1% to R26 747 million 
(2015: R26 195 million), mainly due sales to other oil companies that were affected by the transporter strike during the
period under review. There was no increase in the wholesale margin during the period.

The results were positively impacted by lower stock revaluation losses of R156 million (2015: loss of R802 million)
due to a decrease in the average basic fuel price during the period under review.

NATREF (in which Total has an interest of 36.4%) experienced lower refining margins during the period under
review as compared to 2015, due to the impact of a less favourable economic environment and a major planned
shutdown during October and November 2016.

PGSI Limited (PGSI)
PGSI's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the six months to 31 December 2016 amounted to
R25 million (2015: R18 million). PGSI's turnover for the period under review increased from R1 975 million to
R2 105 million. The group's normalised operating profit, which excludes the impact of asset impairments, increased
from R135 million to R159 million.

The group's main operating subsidiary in South Africa, PG Group, manufactures and supplies glass for the building
and automotive industries. In spite of the difficult economic climate, the Group has reported reasonable growth in
both industries.

The group has shown positive growth in the building division's results in 2016, driven by market share gains in the
domestic market coupled with profitable growth in the ""Rest of Africa"" markets.

The Group's automotive division has reported significant improvements in 2016 over the prior periods results. This
sector has been negatively impacted by the economic climate, with pressure on consumers, lower volumes of claims
from the Insurance sector, weak demand in export markets and competition from low priced imported products. The
Group responded with a low priced product offering for the local aftermarket called Safevue. New local vehicle sales
have been declining for the past ten months, so whilst the company expect to secure some new supply contracts with
the Original Equipment Manufacturing assembly operations, PGSI does not foresee significant growth in this area.

Wispeco Holdings Proprietary Limited (Wispeco)
Wispeco's turnover for the six months to 31 December 2016 increased by 9.2% to R1 162 million 
(2015: R1 064 million). This increase came on the back of slightly higher selling prices as well as higher sales volumes for
the period. Headline earnings for the period under review increased to R90 million (2015: R54 million). Sales
margins were higher than expected due to volatility in raw material costs, although this situation was recently
reversed as world-wide primary aluminium prices rose.

Wispeco continues to drive productivity and cost efficiency improvements through capital investment into leading
edge technologies to support the company's future sustainability and growth. Its PDC subsidiary benefitted from
growing exports.

Wispeco actively supports the local downstream aluminium fabrication industry through continuous product
innovation, best-in-industry lead times and ongoing investment in the development of design software widely used
by fabricators and architects. Technical capabilities are nourished to produce ever more challenging products for
industrial (non-architectural) markets.

Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited (CIV group)
Remgro has an effective interest of 51.0% in the CIV group, which is active in the telecommunications and
information technology (ICT) sector. The key operating company of the group is Dark Fibre Africa Proprietary
Limited (DFA), which constructs and owns fibre-optic networks.

The CIV group has a March year-end and therefore its results for the six months ended 30 September 2016 have
been included in Remgro's results for the period under review. The CIV group's contribution to Remgro's headline
earnings for the period under review amounted to R44 million (2015: R35 million) driven by increased revenue and
operating performance from DFA.

DFA's revenue for the six months ended 30 September 2016 increased by 38.8% to R734 million 
(2015:R529 million) mainly as a result of solid growth of 29.0% in annuity revenue. DFA's earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation for the period under review increased by 42.7% to R495 million. The current book
value of the fibre-optic network is in excess of R7.4 billion. DFA has thus far secured a healthy annuity income of
R101 million per month, with the majority thereof being on long-term contracts with customers.

DFA owns fibre network rings in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Midrand, Centurion and Pretoria. The network
has been expanded to a further 21 smaller metros, including East London, Polokwane, Tlokwe, Emalahleni, George
and Pietermaritzburg, to name a few. At 30 September 2016, a total distance of 9 503km (September 2015: 8 839km)
of fibre network had been completed in the major metropolitan areas and on long-haul routes. The network uptime
for the period under review was 99.9921%.

The DFA revenue model is flexible to adapt to customers' needs, and DFA either sells an indefeasible right of use
agreement, which is a lump sum in advance, or on an annuity basis with multi-year contracts of mostly up to
15 years. The future value of the current annuity contract base is in excess of R18 billion.

SEACOM Capital Limited (SEACOM)
Remgro has an effective interest of 30% in SEACOM, which operates Africa's largest international data network
connecting Southern and Eastern Africa with Europe and Asia.

SEACOM has a December year-end and its results for the six months to 31 December 2016 have been included in
Remgro's results for the period under review. SEACOM's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings for the period
under review amounted to a loss of R18 million (2015: loss of R28 million). The decreased loss is mainly due to a
change in the estimated useful life of the network assets in 2015 and the resulting normalisation of the depreciation
charge in 2016. The change did not have any impact on operating cash flow. In 2016, SEACOM continued its
growth strategy in the corporate market under ""SEACOM Business"".

SEACOM provides high-capacity low-latency international data connectivity services to customers in the form of
private data transmission and public IP-based services. These services are generally sold under 12- to 36-month lease
contracts and as long-term indefeasible right of use (IRU) contracts, which include upfront cash payment and then
annual maintenance charges over the term. Upfront revenue from IRUs is accounted for over the full term of 15 or
20 years.

     SEACOM's core sales and revenue streams continue to come from its established base of Service Provider
     (wholesale) customers that also provide the basis for network scale, cost reductions and service innovation.
     SEACOM Business provides the platform for future growth and improved profitability as the number and size of
     corporate customers increases. SEACOM Business added over 1 000 corporate customers in 2016, and has a healthy
     pipeline to continue to grow sales and revenue in 2017. Simultaneously, SEACOM is working with partners to
     ensure that connectivity to corporates is done over fibre-optic solutions, allowing for future upgrades as data demand
     continues to accelerate and cloud-based IT solutions become the norm.

TRADING STATEMENT

Paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”)
requires companies to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that
their financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from those
of the previous corresponding period.

Remgro’s results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 are due to be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service on or about 16 March 2017. In compliance with the JSE Listings
Requirements, Remgro shareholders are advised that Remgro’s reported headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) for the six months ended 31 December 2016 is expected to be between 852.3 cents
(+21%) and 887.5 cents (+26%) compared to the HEPS of 704.4 cents reported for the six months
ended 31 December 2015.

The increase in HEPS is mainly due to a positive fair value adjustment of R667 million, relating to
the decrease in value of the bondholders’ exchange option (accounted for as a derivative liability) of
the bonds that were issued during March 2016 to partially refinance the foreign bridge funding that
was raised for the Al Noor Hospitals Group plc transaction. The bonds are exchangeable into
Mediclinic International plc (Mediclinic plc) shares and/or cash and fair value adjustments on the
option (reflecting inter alia the movement in the underlying Mediclinic plc share price) are
expected to cause volatility in headline earnings during its five-year term.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

RIGHTS ISSUE DECLARATION AND FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT: FULLY UNDERWRITTEN 
RENOUNCEABLE RIGHTS ISSUE TO QUALIFYING REMGRO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE RATIO OF 
10 RIGHTS ISSUE SHARES FOR EVERY 100 REMGRO ORDINARY SHARES HELD ON THE RECORD DATE

1. Introduction

Remgro Shareholders are referred to the circular dated 15 July 2016 relating to:

   i.    an increase in the number of the Company’s authorised ordinary shares (""Ordinary Shares"")
         and B ordinary shares (""B Ordinary Shares"") and the corresponding amendment to Remgro’s
         memorandum of incorporation;
   ii.   the placing of a certain number of authorised but unissued Ordinary Shares and B Ordinary
         Shares under the control of the directors of the Company; and
  iii.   the authority to issue B Ordinary Shares to Rupert Beleggings Proprietary Limited (formerly
         known as Rembrandt Trust Proprietary Limited) (""Rupert Beleggings"").

The resolutions above were passed by the requisite majority of votes at Remgro’s general meeting
held on 16 August 2016, as announced on the Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") and the
special resolutions forming part thereof were duly filed with the Companies and Intellectual Property
Commission. The Company has now declared its intention to undertake a fully underwritten,
renounceable rights issue (""Rights Issue"") to Qualifying Shareholders, as defined in the Rights Issue
circular, and to issue B Ordinary Shares to Rupert Beleggings to raise an aggregate amount of
R9 944.8 million.

2. Rationale for the Rights Issue

Remgro has a long and successful track record of utilising its available financial resources, including
debt, to facilitate and support the investment and growth ambitions of its portfolio companies and to
capitalise on attractive growth opportunities. Remgro’s ability to be opportunistic and act quickly in a
dynamic M&A environment, together with the management of its portfolio companies, is critical to
unlocking value enhancing opportunities. The proposed Rights Issue will provide the Company with
cash resources and flexibility to capitalise on attractive investment opportunities and continue to
support and facilitate the growth ambitions of its portfolio companies. Remgro is currently assessing a
number of attractive investment opportunities in its portfolio. More specifically, in terms of the
conditions to the approval of the merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and
SABMiller plc by the Competition Tribunal, the merged entity is required to divest of its 26.4% stake in
Distell Group Limited (""Distell"") in due course. Remgro and Capevin Holdings Limited hold a pre-
emptive right to purchase these shares in Distell. No agreement regarding the potential acquisition
has been reached, and Remgro will only exercise its pre-emptive right on commercially appropriate
terms. Other strategic opportunities are also being explored by Remgro and its portfolio companies
and further information regarding these opportunities will be made public at an appropriate time if any
of them materialise. Any surplus cash not utilised for strategic opportunities may also be used to
repay Remgro’s existing debt to ensure an efficient and robust balance sheet with sufficient flexibility
for future growth opportunities.

3. Terms of the Rights Issue

The Rights Issue will consist of an offer of 48 110 637 new Ordinary Shares (""Rights Issue Shares"") in
the ratio of 10 Rights Issue Shares for every 100 Ordinary Shares held on the record date of the
Rights Issue, at a subscription price of R192.50 per Rights Issue Share (""Rights Issue Price""),
representing an aggregate amount for all the Rights Issue Shares of R9 261.3 million.

Business Venture Investments No 1027 Proprietary Limited and Carhant Investments Proprietary
Limited (both Rupert family related entities) have provided the Company with irrevocable undertakings
to subscribe for, in aggregate, 1 396 973 Rights Issue Shares. The balance of 46 713 664 Rights
Issue Shares have been fully underwritten by Rand Merchant Bank (a division of FirstRand Bank
Limited).
      
4. Issue of B Ordinary shares

In order to maintain the current level of voting rights of Rupert Beleggings in the Company, and to
contribute to the new equity capital being raised by Remgro, Remgro will offer Rupert Beleggings the
right to subscribe for 3 550 635 B Ordinary Shares at a price of R192.50 per new B Ordinary Share
which is equal to the Rights Issue Price, representing an aggregate amount for all the B Ordinary
Shares being issued of R683.5 million.

5. Fractional entitlements

Rights Issue Shares representing fractional entitlements will not be issued to Qualifying Shareholders.
Where necessary, entitlements to Rights Issue Shares of 0.5 or greater will be rounded up and less
than 0.5 will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

6. Excess applications

Shareholders will be permitted to apply for additional Rights Issue Shares over and above their
entitlement. Should there be excess Rights Issue Shares available for allocation, such excess Rights
Issue Shares will be allocated equitably, as contemplated in section 5.33 of the Listings Requirements
of the JSE.

*  ""Net impairment of equity accounted investments"" and ""Impairment of intangible assets"" primarily consist of the
   impairment of the investment in Grindrod of R1 861 million and an impairment in RCL Foods' Milling business
   amounting to R643 million respectively. The carrying value of Grindrod has exceeded its market value for a prolonged
   period, therefore the investment was impaired to its market value on 30 June 2016 of R1 986 million.

** For the year under review ""Profit on sale and dilution of equity accounted investments"" primarily consists of a profit
   of R2 262 million realised on the dilution of Remgro's interest in Mediclinic as part of the Al Noor transaction, while
   the comparative year included a profit of R958 million realised on the dilution of Remgro's interest in Mediclinic due
   to a bookbuild exercise.

Fair value remeasurements
The following methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
- Financial instruments available-for-sale and investment in money market funds: Fair value is based on quoted market
  prices or, in the case of unlisted instruments, appropriate valuation methodologies, being discounted cash flow,
  liquidation valuation or actual net asset value of the investment.
- Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by using appropriate valuation
  methodologies and mark-to-market valuations.

Financial instruments measured at fair value, are disclosed by level of the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
          (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following tables illustrate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by hierarchy
level:

There were no transfers between the different levels.

Level 3 financial assets consist mainly of investments in the Milestone China entities (Milestone), the Kagiso Infrastructure
Empowerment Fund (KIEF) and the Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF) amounting to R1 534 million,
R306 million and R228 million respectively. These investments are all valued based on the fair value of each investment's
underlying assets, which are valued using a variety of valuation methodologies. Listed entities are valued at the last quoted
share price on the reporting date, whereas unlisted entities' methods include discounted cash flow valuations and appropriate
earnings and revenue multiples.

Milestone's fair value consists of listed investments (32%), cash and cash equivalents (7%) and unlisted investments (61%).
86% of the unlisted investments were valued at cost as Milestone's management considers the transaction price to be the fair
value of the investments, while the remaining 14% was valued at approximately R121 million. KIEF's investments were
valued using the discounted cash flow method. PRIF's main asset is the investment in ETG Group and it was valued using
appropriate revenue and earnings multiples based on peer group companies to determine a price-to-book valuation.

Changes in the valuation assumptions of the above unlisted investments will not have a significant impact on Remgro's
financial statements.

Related party transactions
During the year under review the most material related party transactions are Remgro's facilitation of Mediclinic's
acquisition of Spire, as well as Remgro's participation in the combination of Mediclinic and Al Noor. Remgro obtained
bridge financing from Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) to partly fund these transactions. The bridge financing was partly
replaced by long-term debt of which fixed rate cumulative redeemable preference shares amounting to R3 500 million were
issued to RMB. Refer to the section dealing with ""Investment activities"" for more detail on these transactions.

2.   RESULTS

     Headline earnings
     For the year to 30 June 2016, headline earnings and headline earnings per share decreased by 26.4% from
     R7 996 million to R5 887 million and from 1 555.0 cents to 1 143.9 cents respectively.

     Included in headline earnings for the year under review are once-off transaction costs incurred with the Mediclinic
     rights issue and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc (Al Noor) transaction amounting to R788 million, of which
     R402 million is Remgro's own costs and R386 million is Remgro's share of Mediclinic's transaction costs (""once-
     off costs""), as well as a fair value adjustment of R730 million, relating to the increase in value of the bondholders'
     exchange option (accounted for as a derivative liability) of the bonds (""option remeasurement"") that were issued
     during March 2016 to partially refinance the foreign bridge funding that was raised for the Al Noor transaction. The
     bonds are exchangeable into Mediclinic plc shares and/or cash and fair value adjustments on the option (reflecting
     inter alia the movement in the underlying Mediclinic plc share price) are expected to cause volatility in headline
     earnings during its five-year term. Excluding these items, headline earnings decreased by 7.4% from R7 996 million
     to R7 405 million, whereas headline earnings per share decreased by 7.5% from 1 555.0 cents to 1 438.9 cents.

     It should furthermore be noted that headline earnings includes other once-off items, which cause comparability of
     the results to be challenging. These are:

     - Additional finance cost incurred with the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor transaction that were accounted for
       the three months to 30 June 2016 amounting to R245 million, whilst the equity accounted earnings for
       Mediclinic was recognised only for the period until 31 March 2016, since the Group lags Mediclinic's reporting
       period by three months;
     - Facilitation and underwriting fees of R99 million received from Mediclinic in the 2015 financial year;
     - Transaction and funding costs relating to the Spire Healthcare Group plc (Spire) transaction amounting to
       R115 million (2015: R38 million), whereas the recoupment of R153 million is included in profit on the sale of
       Spire to Mediclinic, outside headline earnings;
     - Positive impact on RCL Foods' results with the release of a R163 million provision raised for uncertain tax
       disputes, as well as a R119 million gain on the exercise of the Zam Chick and Zamhatch put options (Remgro's
       portion being R218 million);
     - Positive impact on Mediclinic's profit in the comparative year due to Swiss prior year tax adjustments of
       R712 million (Remgro's portion being R300 million);
     - Positive impact on RMI's profit in the comparative year with the release of a put option liability at Discovery of
       R415 million (Remgro's portion being R126 million) and
     - PRIF distributions of R170 million in the comparative year due to first close versus R18 million in the year
       under review resulting from the second and third closes.

Excluding all the aforementioned items, Remgro's comparable headline earnings increased by 2.6% from
R7 339 million to R7 529 million mainly due to better operating performances by its banking, insurance, healthcare
and industrial platforms, offset by lower earnings from RCL Foods, as well as Grindrod.

Commentary on reporting platforms' performance

Food, liquor and home care
The contribution from food, liquor and home care to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 618 million
(2015: R1 531 million), representing an increase of 5.7%. RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings
decreased by 12.8% to R658 million (2015: R755 million). During the year under review RCL Foods' results were
positively impacted by the release of a R163 million provision raised for uncertain tax disputes as part of the
Foodcorp acquisition, as well as a R119 million gain on the exercise of the Zam Chick and Zamhatch put options.
Excluding these remeasurements, RCL Foods' contribution to Remgro's headline earnings would have decreased by
41.7% to R440 million. This decrease is mainly due to lower contributions from the Sugar and Chicken businesses.
The Chicken business was impacted by a massive oversupply in the local market caused by local production and
dumping, while the Sugar business remained under pressure due to the severe drought conditions. Unilever's
contribution to Remgro's headline earnings increased by 39.3% to R461 million (2015: R331 million). This increase
is mainly the result of revenue growth and margin improvement. Distell's contribution to headline earnings, which
includes the investment in Capevin Holdings, amounted to R499 million (2015: R445 million). This increase is
mainly the result of revenue growth and efficiency improvements across the business. Distell experienced strong
performances from all product categories and also benefited from a weaker rand against the major currencies in
which it trades.

Banking
The headline earnings contribution from the banking division amounted to R2 989 million (2015: R2 845 million),
representing an increase of 5.1%. FirstRand and RMBH reported headline earnings growth of 5.9% and 4.5%
respectively. On a normalised basis, FirstRand and RMBH reported earnings growth of 7.4% and 7.0% respectively,
mainly due to growth in both interest income and non-interest income from FNB, RMB and WesBank, partly offset
by an increase in credit impairment charges, which reflect the deteriorating macro-economic environment.

Healthcare
Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R1 566 million (2015: R1 734 million). It
should be noted that Mediclinic's results for the year under review include once-off transaction costs incurred with
the Al Noor transaction of R891 million, while the comparative period included positive Swiss prior year tax
adjustments of R712 million. Excluding these once-off items Mediclinic's contribution to Remgro's headline
earnings would have increased by 36.1% from R1 434 million to R1 952 million. This increase is mainly due to
solid performances by all three operating platforms, as well as the positive effect of the weaker rand.

Insurance
RMI Holdings' contribution to headline earnings decreased by 9.9% to R888 million (2015: R986 million). This
decrease is mainly the result of a once-off profit in the comparative period, with the release of a put option liability
at Discovery, which is excluded from RMI Holdings' normalised earnings. On a normalised basis, RMI Holdings
reported an increase of 5.9% in earnings, with Discovery and OUTsurance achieving good earnings growth of 6.6%
and 42.7% respectively, offset by lower earnings from MMI Holdings (lower by 15.8%). OUTsurance's growth can
be attributed to the significant improvement in the contribution from the Youi group. The comparative year's results
were negatively impacted by numerous weather-related catastrophes in Australia. MMI Holdings' decrease is mainly
due to lower underwriting profits, as well as lower asset-based fees.

Industrial
Total's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to R291 million (2015: R133 million). Included in the
contribution to headline earnings is unfavourable stock revaluations amounting to R88 million (2015: R286 million).
These revaluations are the result of the volatility in the Brent Crude price and the rand exchange rate. Excluding
these revaluations, the contribution decreased by 9.5% from R419 million to R379 million mainly due to an
excellent operational performance by NATREF in the comparative period, which the refinery was unable to repeat
during the current reporting period. Remgro's share of the results of KTH amounted to a loss of R229 million
(2015: loss of R108 million). KTH's results were negatively impacted by unfavourable fair value adjustments
relating to its investments in Exxaro Resources Limited and MMI Holdings Limited preference shares. Air Products'
and Wispeco's contribution to headline earnings amounted to R275 million and R144 million respectively (2015:
R222 million and R104 million), while PGSI contributed R36 million to Remgro's headline earnings (2015:
R30 million).

Infrastructure
Grindrod's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings amounted to a loss of R45 million (2015: a profit of
R135 million). This decrease is mainly the result of weak commodity markets and significantly lower dry-bulk
shipping rates. For the year under review the CIV group contributed R64 million to headline earnings (2015:
R51 million). SEACOM reported a headline loss of R113 million for the year under review (2015: headline earnings
of R96 million), with Remgro's share of this loss amounting to R33 million (2015: profit of R24 million). This
decrease is mainly due to a higher depreciation charge on certain cable assets resulting from a change in the
estimated useful life of these assets. During the year under review the Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund (PRIF)
had its second and third closes, which resulted in Remgro receiving an income distribution of R18 million (2015:
R170 million in respect of the first close), mainly due to foreign exchange gains realised in the PRIF structure.

Media and sport
Media and sport consist of the interests in eMedia and various sport interests, including interests in rugby franchises,
as well as the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport. eMedia's contribution to Remgro's headline earnings decreased by
59.4% to R28 million (2015: R69 million), mainly due to continued pressure on advertising revenue as a result of a
sharp drop in market share during the previous financial year, leading to a considerable investment in local
programming to recover market share, as well as continued investment into the multi-channel business. The sport
interests' contribution to headline earnings amounted to a loss of R64 million (2015: loss of R85 million).

Other investments
The contribution from other investments to headline earnings amounted to R67 million (2015: R84 million), of
which Business Partners' contribution was R48 million (2015: R47 million).

     Central treasury and other net corporate costs
     Finance income amounted to R125 million (2015: R111 million). This increase is mainly the result of higher
     average cash balances, as well as higher interest rates than in the comparative period. Finance costs mainly consist
     of funding costs amounting to R466 million and once-off transaction costs amounting to R402 million, which relate
     to the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor transaction, as well as a fair value adjustment of R730 million, relating to
     the increase in the value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds. Other net corporate costs amounted to
     R251 million (2015: R52 million). The year under review includes transaction and funding costs amounting to
     R115 million (2015: R38 million) relating to Remgro's acquisition of Spire Healthcare Group plc (Spire). Remgro
     recouped this amount from Mediclinic as part of the Spire disposal consideration, which resulted in a profit on
     disposal of investment of R153 million, excluded from headline earnings. The comparative period also includes a
     net after-tax facilitation and underwriting fee of R99 million received from Mediclinic on the Spire transaction and
     resultant rights issue.

     Earnings
     Earnings decreased by 38.2% to R5 386 million (2015: R8 715 million). The decrease is mainly the result of the
     once-off transaction costs incurred with the Mediclinic rights issue and Al Noor transaction (R788 million), the fair
     value adjustment relating to the increase in value of the exchange option of the exchangeable bonds (R730 million),
     the impairment of the investment in Grindrod (R1 861 million) and Remgro's portion of the impairments in
     Grindrod's Rail and Shipping divisions (R577 million), as well as Remgro's portion of an impairment in RCL
     Foods' Milling business (R439 million). The decrease is partly offset by a profit of R2 262 million realised on the
     dilution of Remgro's interest in Mediclinic as part of the Al Noor transaction (2015: profit of R958 million due to a
     bookbuild exercise).

3.   INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

     Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 6.1% from R288.89 at 30 June 2015 to R306.44 at
     30 June 2016. The closing share price at 30 June 2016 was R254.66 (2015: R255.94) representing a discount of
     16.9% (2015: 11.4%) to the intrinsic net asset value. Refer to Annexure B for full details.

4.   INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

     The most important investment activities during the year under review were as follows:

     Mediclinic International Limited (Mediclinic)

     Facilitation of Mediclinic's acquisition of Spire
     During June 2015 Remgro entered into an agreement with funds managed by Cinven to acquire 119 923 335 Spire
     Healthcare Group plc (Spire) shares (equivalent to a 29.9% shareholding in Spire) at a price of GBP3.60 per share for a
     total purchase consideration of GBP431.7 million (excluding transaction costs). The transaction was concluded early in
     July 2015 and Remgro financed the transaction through a combination of its own cash and external funding.

     In conjunction with the above transaction, Remgro and Mediclinic concluded an agreement whereby Mediclinic
     would acquire Remgro's interest in Spire, subject to Mediclinic raising the appropriate funds in order to conclude
     such a transaction. During August 2015 Mediclinic raised R10.0 billion through a rights issue in terms of which
     111 111 111 new Mediclinic shares were issued at a price of R90.00 per share. Remgro, by following its rights and
     by underwriting the balance of the rights issue, subscribed for an additional 51 342 886 Mediclinic shares totalling
     R4.6 billion. Following the successful conclusion of the rights issue, Mediclinic acquired Remgro's shareholding in
     Spire during August 2015 for an amount of R8.6 billion, equal to the purchase price, transaction and funding costs.
     Remgro thus effectively only facilitated the acquisition of Spire by Mediclinic.

     In order to participate in the above-mentioned rights issue Remgro obtained bridge financing amounting to
     R3.5 billion. On 13 January 2016 Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Remgro Healthcare Holdings
     Proprietary Limited (Remgro Healthcare)) refinanced the bridge financing by issuing fixed rate cumulative
     redeemable preference shares. These preference shares have a tenure of four years and the dividend rate is fixed at
     7.7%, payable semi-annually.

     After the above transactions, Remgro's effective interest in Mediclinic was 42.5% (30 June 2015: 42.0%).

Combination of Mediclinic and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc (Al Noor)
On 14 October 2015 Mediclinic and Al Noor agreed on the terms for the combination of their respective businesses
(the ""Combination"") pursuant to which Al Noor offered to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Mediclinic.
The transaction was concluded on 15 February 2016 and given the relative size of Mediclinic and Al Noor, the
Combination was classified as a reverse takeover of Al Noor. The combined group was renamed Mediclinic
International plc (Mediclinic plc) and it retained its premium listing on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (LSE). Mediclinic plc also obtained an inward secondary listing on the main board of the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange (JSE) and it was admitted to the FTSE 100 index of the LSE. Mediclinic shareholders received
0.625 Al Noor shares for every Mediclinic share held by them, based on the five-day volume weighted average price
up to and including 1 October 2015 of the Mediclinic shares on the JSE and of the Al Noor shares on the LSE
(which was GBP5.20 and GBP8.32, respectively). As a result of the reverse take-over, Remgro realised a profit on the
dilution of the interest in Mediclinic amounting to R2 262 million.

In addition to the Al Noor shares received by Remgro and as an indivisible component of the Combination, Remgro
also subscribed for an additional 72 115 384 shares in Al Noor at a subscription price of GBP8.32 per share for an
aggregate amount of GBP600.0 million during February 2016 (the ""Remgro Subscription""). In order to fund the
Remgro Subscription, Remgro obtained bridge financing of which GBP400.0 million was borrowed offshore, while
GBP200.0 million (or R4.3 billion) was borrowed in South Africa.

On 16 March 2016 Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Remgro Healthcare) refinanced the local bridge
financing with newly issued fixed rate cumulative redeemable preference shares amounting to R4.4 billion. The
preference shares have a tenure of five years and a fixed dividend rate of 8.3%, payable semi-annually.

On 22 March 2016 Remgro (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Remgro Jersey GBP Limited) refinanced

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND
Declaration of Cash Dividend No. 32
Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 275 cents (2015: 259 cents) per share has been declared out of income
reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par value, for the year
ended 30 June 2016.

A dividend withholding tax of 15% or 41.25 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 233.75 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in
terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.


The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2016 therefore amounts to 460 cents, compared to 428 cents
for the year ended 30 June 2015.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 481 106 370 ordinary shares and 35 506 352 B ordinary shares. The

TRADING STATEMENT

Paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”)
requires companies to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that their
financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

Remgro’s results for the year ended 30 June 2016 are due to be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on or about 20 September 2016. In compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements, Remgro
shareholders are advised that Remgro’s reported headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the year
ended 30 June 2016 is expected to be between 1 119.6 cents (-28%) and 1 181.8 cents (-24%)
compared to the HEPS of 1 555.0 cents reported for the year ended 30 June 2015.

The decrease in HEPS is mainly due to once-off transaction costs incurred with the Mediclinic
International Limited (Mediclinic) rights issue and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc (Al Noor) transaction
amounting to R788 million, of which R402 million is Remgro’s own costs and R386 million is
Remgro’s share of Mediclinic’s transaction costs, as well as a fair value adjustment of R730 million,
relating to the increase in value of the bondholders’ exchange option of the bonds (accounted for as a
derivative liability) that were issued during March 2016 to partially refinance the foreign bridge
funding that was raised for the Al Noor transaction. The bonds are exchangeable into Mediclinic
International plc (Mediclinic plc) shares and/or cash and fair value adjustments on the option
(reflecting the movement in the underlying Mediclinic plc share price) are likely to cause volatility in
headline earnings during its five-year term.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

POSTING OF CIRCULAR AND NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING

Posting of circular
Remgro shareholders are advised that the Company has posted a circular to shareholders containing details of:
   - an increase in the number of the Company’s authorised ordinary shares and B ordinary shares and the
      corresponding amendment to the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation;

   - the authority to issue B ordinary shares to Rupert Beleggings Proprietary Limited (“Rupert Beleggings”)

The Circular has been posted to shareholders today, 15 July 2016.

The proposed authorities will provide the Company with greater flexibility to raise new equity capital, at an

opportunities, to continue to support and facilitate growth ambitions of its portfolio companies and to repay
existing debt. The authority to issue additional B ordinary shares is, in addition to contributing to the new
equity capital raising, to enable Rupert Beleggings to invest alongside ordinary shareholders to retain its pro-

Remgro Limited completed the placement of GBP 350 million bonds
exchangeable into Mediclinic International plc shares


Remgro Limited (“Remgro”) has completed the placement of GBP 350 million in aggregate principal
amount of senior, secured, guaranteed bonds due 2021 (the “Bonds”) exchangeable into ordinary
shares (the “Shares”) of Mediclinic International plc (“Mediclinic”) (the “Offering”).

The Bonds will be issued through Remgro’s subsidiary, Remgro Jersey GBP Limited (the “Issuer”).

The Bonds will pay a coupon of 2.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. The initial
exchange price for the Bonds will be GBP 11.3086 per Share, representing a premium above the
Reference Share Price (as defined below) of 30.00%. The “Reference Share Price” represents the
volume weighted average price of the Shares on the London Stock Exchange between launch and
pricing of the Offering.

The Bonds in aggregate are exchangeable into approximately 30.9 million Shares, representing
approximately 4.2% of the currently outstanding share capital of Mediclinic.

The Bonds will be issued at 100% of their principal amount and, unless previously redeemed,
exchanged or purchased and cancelled, will be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount on the
maturity date of the Bonds.

Upon exchange of the Bonds, the Issuer will have the discretionary right to deliver an amount in cash,
instead of the Shares, as described in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds. Upon redemption of
the Bonds, the Issuer will have the option to deliver a combination of Shares and cash, as described in
Terms and Conditions of the Bonds.

Settlement is expected to take place on or about 22 March 2016 (the “Closing Date”) and it is intended
that an application will be made for the Bonds to be included for trading on the Open market
(Freiverkehr) segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange within 90 days following the Closing Date.


                                                                                                     
The net proceeds from the Bonds will be used to partly refinance the loan facility provided to Remgro
in connection with the combination of Mediclinic International plc and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc.

Under the terms of the Offering, Remgro will agree not to issue or sell any Shares for a lock-up period
ending 90 days following today’s date, subject to customary exceptions.

Remgro Limited launches an offer of bonds exchangeable into Mediclinic
International plc shares

Remgro Limited (?Remgro?) today announces an offering of GBP 300 million in aggregate principal
amount of senior, secured, guaranteed bonds due 2021 (the ?Bonds?) exchangeable into ordinary
shares (the ?Shares?) of Mediclinic International plc, which may be increased by up to GBP 50 million
at the option of Remgro before pricing (the ?Offering?). The Bonds will be issued through a subsidiary
of Remgro, Remgro Jersey GBP Limited, (the ?Issuer?) and will be offered via an accelerated
bookbuilding to institutional investors.

The Issuer's obligations under the Bonds will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by
Remgro and will constitute direct and unconditional obligations of the Issuer and will be secured, as
described in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds (the ?Conditions?).

The Bonds will be marketed with a coupon of 2.125 - 2.625% per annum payable semi-annually in
arrears. The initial exchange price of the Bonds is expected to be at a premium of between 30% and
35% above the Reference Share Price (as defined below). The coupon, initial exchange price and the
exchange premium for the Bonds will be determined following the accelerated bookbuilding, which is
expected to take place today, 15 March 2016 (the ?Pricing Date?).

The reference share price represents the volume weighted average price of the Shares on the London
Stock Exchange between launch and pricing of the Offering (the ?Reference Share Price?).

The Bonds will be issued at 100% of their principal amount and, unless previously redeemed,
exchanged or purchased and cancelled, will be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount on the
maturity date of the Bonds.

Upon exchange of the Bonds, the Issuer will have the discretionary right to deliver an amount in cash,
instead of the Shares, as described in the Conditions. Upon redemption of the Bonds, the Issuer will
have the option to deliver a combination of Shares and cash, as described in the Conditions.

Settlement is expected to take place on or about 22 March 2016 (the ?Closing Date?) and it is intended
that an application will be made for the Bonds to be included for trading on the Open market
(Freiverkehr) segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange within 90 days following the Closing Date.
The net proceeds from the Bonds will be used to partly refinance the loan facility provided to Remgro
in connection with the combination of Mediclinic International plc and Al Noor Hospitals Group plc.

Remgro expects to announce the final terms of the Offering upon completion of the accelerated
bookbuilding later today.

Under the terms of the Offering, Remgro will agree not to issue or sell any Shares for a lock-up period
ending 90 days following the Pricing Date, subject to customary exceptions.

Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited
(London Branch) are acting as Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners on this transaction.
