Forward Looking Statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-
looking” statements made within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are often, but not always, made
through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,”
“would,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook”, “target” and similar expressions. These
include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning,
amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects,
growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to
time in the countries and markets in which the Group operates.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject
to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition,
performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and
results expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical
data within this announcement. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are uncertainties
related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the impact of
adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or
international tax laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax
authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of
such outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or
international economic or political conditions; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
adverse decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact of market
size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational and transactional foreign
exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace;
the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the current capital
structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and rollout New Categories; and
changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of the Group.

It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they
may be affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those currently anticipated. Past performance is no guide to future
performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser.
The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date
of preparation of this announcement and the Group undertakes no obligation to update or
revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-
looking statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in
this communication should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the
current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical
published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the
Annual Report on Form 20-F filed on 26 March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-K,

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject
to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition,

results expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical
data within this announcement. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are uncertainties

international tax laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax
authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of

        -     This acquisition has no impact on BAT’s commitment to previously stated deleverage targets

LONDON 3 November 2020 – British American Tobacco p.l.c today announces that the US business of the BAT
Group (BAT) has acquired the nicotine pouch product assets of Dryft Sciences, LLC (Dryft), a US-based Modern
Oral nicotine product company.

New Category Portfolio Expansion in the US:
- This acquisition expands BAT’s Modern Oral portfolio in the US, expanding from 4 to 28 product variants. It
   follows the acceptance of Dryft’s recent Pre-Market Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) submission for
   filing by the US Food and Drug Administration.

-   The enhanced portfolio will include a wider range of nicotine strengths and flavours providing adult
    nicotine consumers with a greater degree of choice, covering all key consumer preferences. This will
    significantly strengthen BAT’s portfolio in a fast-growing nicotine category in the US.

-   BAT will rebrand Dryft’s US portfolio under its global Modern Oral brand, VELO, and expects to accelerate
    growth through superior distribution, marketing and channel capabilities.

BAT’s ‘A Better Tomorrow’ Corporate Purpose:
This acquisition is a further demonstration of BAT’s continued commitment to its purpose, to build A Better
Tomorrow by reducing the health impact of its global business, which entails:

    -       Committing to providing adult consumers with a wide range of enjoyable and less risky products
    -       Continuing to be clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid
            these risks is not to start or to quit
    -       Encouraging those who otherwise continue to smoke, to switch completely to scientifically-
            substantiated, reduced-risk alternatives
    -       Tracking and sharing progress of our transformation

BAT aims to accelerate the growth of its New Category revenues at a faster rate than its total revenue,
reaching £5bn in 2025. BAT has an ambition to reach 50 million consumers of non-combustibles worldwide by
2030. Today, BAT’s non-combustible products are already available in more than 50 countries across the
globe.

Jack Bowles, CEO of BAT, said:
“Today’s announcement underscores our societal commitment to accelerate our transformation and build A
Better Tomorrow. Our multi-category strategy is key to our transformation.

“The addition of Dryft to our US Velo brand is a major step forward, further enhancing our successful vaping
and oral portfolio.”

Guy Meldrum, CEO of Reynolds American Inc., said:
“The modern oral category in the US is developing rapidly. We are excited to expand the portfolio of Velo
products to meet the evolving preferences of adult consumers.

“We are confident that, leveraging our strong in-market execution capability, the new Velo portfolio will
contribute to accelerated growth.”

Jason Carignan, President of DRYFT Sciences, LLC, said:
“We’re proud of the tremendous momentum we’ve built with Dryft and thrilled that our strong product
portfolio will now serve to enhance the Velo brand. We remain confident that modern oral innovations like
Dryft and Velo will continue to find an adult consumer base seeking alternatives to traditional products.”

                      BAT To Appoint New Chairman
We are pleased to announce that Luc Jobin will succeed Richard Burrows as Chairman of British
American Tobacco p.l.c. (BAT). This will take effect from the conclusion of the Company’s Annual
General Meeting (AGM) on 28 April 2021 and, in order to ensure an effective transition of the
leadership of the Board, Mr Jobin will be appointed as Chairman Designate of BAT effective 1 March
2021.

As BAT accelerates the delivery of its transformation strategy towards A Better Tomorrow and
following a comprehensive search of external and internal candidates the Board unanimously
concluded that Mr Jobin's experience of enterprise transformation, extensive North American
knowledge and cross-industry credentials make him the right candidate to lead the Board.

His passion for shaping sustainable businesses aligns strongly with the BAT culture and ethos. He is
currently an independent Director on the Boards of Gildan Activewear Inc and Hydro-Québec.

Mr Jobin joined the BAT Board in 2017 as an independent Non-Executive Director. During his
executive career, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian National Railway
Company, prior to which he was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Previously, Mr
Jobin was Executive Vice President of Power Corporation of Canada (an international financial
services company), and held the roles of Chief Financial Officer and, between 2003 and 2005, Chief
Executive Officer of Imperial Tobacco Canada.

Mr Burrows will step down as Chairman and retire from the Board at the end of the Company’s 2021
AGM.

Commenting on Mr Jobin’s appointment, Dimitri Panayotopoulos, Senior Independent Director said:

“The Board was clear that it was looking for a candidate with energy and personality to lead the
Board while BAT embraces the strategic opportunities of our corporate transformation. His
significant North American experience and his track record in consumer and customer businesses, set
against a strong list of external and internal candidates, made Luc the ideal candidate.”

Current Chairman, Richard Burrows said:

“I am delighted that the Board has appointed Luc as the incoming Chairman for BAT. Luc brings with
him significant financial, regulatory and M&A experience. He has been an outstanding non-executive
director over the last three years, providing consistent support, insight and constructive challenge
through the development of strategy. I am sure that BAT will go from strength to strength with Luc
as Chairman and Jack Bowles as Chief Executive Officer.”
As a current Non-Executive Director of BAT, the appointment of Mr Jobin will enable an effective
transition to the role of Chairman in these restricted COVID times and allow BAT to maintain its clear
focus on accelerating the transformation of its business.

               2021

             (1) Per $1,000, £1,000 or €1,000, as applicable, principal amount of Securities validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase.
             (2) For the avoidance of doubt, the Early Tender Premium is included within the Total Consideration (which, in the case of all Securities, except for the 2021 Euro
                 BATIF Notes, was calculated using the Fixed Spread over the relevant Reference Yield as described herein), and is not in addition to the Total Consideration.
             (3) To determine whether the Maximum Tender Amount or any Sub-Cap has been reached, we converted the applicable purchase price payable with respect to the
                 Sterling Securities and Euro Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rates of
                 £/$1.2962 and €/$1.1783, respectively, reported as set forth under “The Terms of the Offer - Maximum Tender Amount; Sub - Caps; Acceptance Priority Levels
                 and Proration.” in the Offer to Purchase.

                            The amount of each series of Securities that is purchased in the Tender Offer
             on the Early Settlement Date (as defined below) is determined in accordance with
             the acceptance priority levels specified in the table above (the “Acceptance Priority
             Level”), with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 7 being the lowest
             Acceptance Priority Level, subject to the Maximum Tender Amount and the Sub-
             Caps, increased as announced earlier today (as applicable) and as described in
             more detail in the Offer to Purchase (as defined below).
                            The maximum aggregate purchase price that the Offerors will pay in the
             Tender Offer is an amount that is sufficient to allow the Offerors to purchase (x) the
             entire principal amounts of the Dollar Securities in Acceptance Priority Levels 1
             through 5 specified in the table above validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
             prior to the Early Tender Deadline, (y) approximately $100 million equivalent
             principal amount of 2022 Sterling BATIF Notes validly tendered and not validly
             withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline and (z) €100 million aggregate
             principal amount of 2021 Euro BATIF Notes validly tendered and not validly
             withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline. Based on the pricing set forth above,
             this amount is approximately $3.564 billion (excluding accrued and unpaid
             interest).

The Tender Offer is being made upon and is subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 22, 2020 (as
amended by Supplement No. 1, dated September 30, 2020 and the press release
issued by BAT earlier today, the “Offer to Purchase”). The Tender Offer will expire
at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 20, 2020, unless extended or earlier
terminated (the “Expiration Date”).      However, because the aggregate purchase
price of all series of Securities validly tendered in the Tender Offer at or prior to the
Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount, the Offerors will not
accept for purchase any Securities tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and at
or prior to the Expiration Date. In addition, because the 2022 Sterling BATIF Notes
Sub-Cap and the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes Sub-Cap have been reached as of the
Early Tender Deadline, holders who validly tender 2022 Sterling BATIF Notes or
2021 Euro BATIF Notes following the Early Tender Deadline will not have any such
Securities accepted for purchase. The Withdrawal Deadline was 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on October 5, 2020; therefore, Securities that have been validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn may not be withdrawn unless otherwise
required by applicable law.

       The applicable Offerors plan to accept all Securities validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline with Acceptance Priority Levels
1 through 5, Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early
Tender Deadline with Acceptance Priority Level 6 using a proration factor of
approximately 70% in accordance with the Offer to Purchase and Securities validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline with
Acceptance Priority Level 7 using a proration factor of approximately 41.87% in
accordance with the Offer to Purchase. Securities not accepted for purchase will be
promptly returned or credited to the Holder’s account.
      Holders of Securities who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their
Securities at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and whose Securities were
accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration, which includes
the applicable early tender premium specified in the table above (the “Early Tender
Premium”).

      The applicable Total Consideration for Securities denominated in U.S. Dollars,
Sterling and Euro will be paid in U.S. Dollars, Sterling and Euro, respectively.
Acceptance of Securities with reference to the Maximum Tender Amount and each
Sub-Cap has been determined subject to the currency conversion methods
described in the Offer to Purchase.

      In addition to the applicable Total Consideration, accrued and unpaid interest
from and including the most recent interest payment date applicable to the relevant
series of Securities up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date will be paid
in cash on all validly tendered Securities accepted for purchase.
       Each Offeror’s obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Securities
validly tendered in the Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions described in the Offer to Purchase.

      Securities that are accepted in the Offer will be purchased by the applicable
Offeror and retired and canceled and will no longer remain outstanding obligations
of the applicable Offeror.

      The settlement date for the Securities that have been validly tendered at or
prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase is expected to be
October 8, 2020 (the “Early Settlement Date”).
      All terms used but not defined in this announcement shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Offer to Purchase.

Forward-Looking Statements

        Statements included in this announcement and the Offer to Purchase regarding the
future expectations of BAT and its subsidiaries (the “BAT Group”), beliefs, plans, objectives,
financial conditions, assumptions or future events or performance that are not historical
facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made
through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”,
“expect”, “intend”, “may”, “outlook”, “plan”, “positioned”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”,
“should”, “strategy”, “target”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions. These include
statements regarding the BAT Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, among other things, the BAT Group’s results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances
occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the BAT Group operates.
All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition,
performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results
expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data
within this announcement. The BAT Group believes that the expectations reflected in this
document are reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range of variables that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Among the key
factors that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and
financial position of the BAT Group and that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements, are competitive actions and pricing
pressures in the marketplace, including competition from illicit sources, market size
reduction and consumer down-trading; limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco
products; changes in tobacco-related, tax and other laws and regulations, the interpretation
of such laws and regulations by governmental authorities or adverse decisions by domestic
or international regulatory bodies; the outcome of pending or potential litigation, including
tobacco litigation, environmental litigation and personal injury claims and significant
monetary obligations imposed under outstanding settlement agreements; economic,
regulatory and geopolitical risks (including as a result of COVID-19) inherent in the BAT
Group’s global operations; risks relating to the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund
the business under the current capital structure; risks relating to government regulations or
actions adversely affecting the BAT Group’s business, including the BAT Group becoming
subject to substantial and increasing U.S. regulations, in particular in relation to the nicotine
level or use of menthol in tobacco products, including by virtue of the BAT Group’s increased
ownership in RAI; the continuing decline in cigarette consumption, or the overall
consumption of legitimate tobacco products or the transition of adult tobacco consumers
away from premium cigarette brands; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; potentially
significant costs in the event of breaches of, or liabilities arising under, health and safety
and environmental laws; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace;
liquidity, interest rate and counterparty risks; the inability to develop, commercialize and
deliver BAT Group’s vapor, modern oral and tobacco heating products strategy; and risks
related to other factors discussed or incorporated by reference in the Offer to Purchase,
including in the section captioned “Risks and Uncertainties” in the Half-Year Report and the
sections captioned “Principal Group Risks”, “Group Risk Factors” and “Recent Developments”
in the 2019 Form 20-F.

       The forward-looking statements in this announcement speak only as of the date of
the document in which the forward-looking statement is made, and the Offerors undertake
no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether because
of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Forward-Looking Statements

        Statements included in this announcement and the Offer to Purchase regarding the
future expectations of BAT and its subsidiaries (the “BAT Group”), beliefs, plans, objectives,
financial conditions, assumptions or future events or performance that are not historical
facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made
through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”,
“expect”, “intend”, “may”, “outlook”, “plan”, “positioned”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”,
“should”, “strategy”, “target”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions. These include
statements regarding the BAT Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, among other things, the BAT Group’s results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances
occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the BAT Group operates.
All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition,
performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results
expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data
within this announcement. The BAT Group believes that the expectations reflected in this
document are reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range of variables that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Among the key
factors that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and
financial position of the BAT Group and that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements, are competitive actions and pricing
pressures in the marketplace, including competition from illicit sources, market size
reduction and consumer down-trading; limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco
products; changes in tobacco-related, tax and other laws and regulations, the interpretation
of such laws and regulations by governmental authorities or adverse decisions by domestic
or international regulatory bodies; the outcome of pending or potential litigation, including
tobacco litigation, environmental litigation and personal injury claims and significant
monetary obligations imposed under outstanding settlement agreements; economic,
regulatory and geopolitical risks (including as a result of COVID-19) inherent in the BAT
Group’s global operations; risks relating to the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund
the business under the current capital structure; risks relating to government regulations or
actions adversely affecting the BAT Group’s business, including the BAT Group becoming
subject to substantial and increasing U.S. regulations, in particular in relation to the nicotine
level or use of menthol in tobacco products, including by virtue of the BAT Group’s increased
ownership in RAI; the continuing decline in cigarette consumption, or the overall
consumption of legitimate tobacco products or the transition of adult tobacco consumers
away from premium cigarette brands; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; potentially
significant costs in the event of breaches of, or liabilities arising under, health and safety
and environmental laws; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace;
liquidity, interest rate and counterparty risks; the inability to develop, commercialize and
deliver BAT Group’s vapor, modern oral and tobacco heating products strategy; and risks
related to other factors discussed or incorporated by reference in the Offer to Purchase,
including in the section captioned “Risks and Uncertainties” in the Half-Year Report and the
sections captioned “Principal Group Risks”, “Group Risk Factors” and “Recent Developments”
in the 2019 Form 20-F.

       The forward-looking statements in this announcement speak only as of the date of
the document in which the forward-looking statement is made, and the Offerors undertake
no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether because
of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Forward-Looking Statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking” statements made within the
meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are often, but not
always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,”
“intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook,” “target” and
similar expressions. These include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning,
amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the BAT Group
operates.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals,
expectations and results expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data within this
announcement. Among the key factors that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and
financial position of the BAT Group and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements, are competitive actions and pricing pressures in the marketplace, including competition from
illicit sources, market size reduction and consumer down-trading; limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco
products; changes in tobacco-related, tax and other laws and regulations, the interpretation of such laws and regulations
by governmental authorities or adverse decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the outcome of pending
or potential litigation, including tobacco litigation, environmental litigation and personal injury claims and significant
monetary obligations imposed under outstanding settlement agreements; economic, regulatory and geopolitical risks
(including as a result of COVID-19) inherent in the BAT Group’s global operations; risks relating to the ability to maintain
credit ratings and to fund the business under the current capital structure; risks relating to government regulations or
actions adversely affecting the BAT Group’s business, including the BAT Group becoming subject to substantial and
increasing U.S. regulations, in particular in relation to the nicotine level or use of menthol in tobacco products, including by
virtue of the BAT Group’s increased ownership in RAI; the continuing decline in cigarette consumption, or the overall
consumption of legitimate tobacco products or the transition of adult tobacco consumers away from premium cigarette
brands; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; potentially significant costs in the event of breaches of, or liabilities arising
under, health and safety and environmental laws; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace; liquidity,
interest rate and counterparty risks; the inability to develop, commercialize and deliver BAT Group’s vapor, modern oral
and tobacco heating products strategy; and risks related to other factors discussed or incorporated by reference in the
Offer to Purchase, including in the section captioned “Risks and Uncertainties” in the half-year report and the sections
captioned “Principal Group Risks”, “Group Risk Factors” and “Recent Developments” in the 2019 Form 20-F.

It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide
range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Past performance is
no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser. The forward-
looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the
Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this communication should be
interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or
exceed the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed on 26 March 2020 and Current
Reports on Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov, and the Company’s
Annual Reports.
United Kingdom

The communication of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and any other documents or
materials relating to the Notes is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, persons outside the United Kingdom or in
the United Kingdom that are qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation (“qualified
investors”) that also (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, or the Order, (ii) who fall within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order or (iii) to whom it may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to purchase
or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, relevant persons.

European Economic Area and United Kingdom Retail Investors

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to, any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (1) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (2) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (3) not a
qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be
unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

               Notes due
               2021

     (1) Per $1,000, £1,000 or €1,000, as applicable, principal amount of Securities validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase.
     (2) For the avoidance of doubt, the Early Tender Premium is included within the Total Consideration (which, in the case of all Securities, except for the 2021 Euro
         BATIF Notes, will be calculated using the Fixed Spread over the relevant Reference Yield as described herein), and is not in addition to the Total Consideration.
     (3) Assuming an Early Settlement Date of October 8, 2020, the Total Consideration for the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes represents a yield to the maturity date of the 2021
         Euro BATIF Notes of -0.20%, and is equivalent to the value of all remaining payments of principal and interest on the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes to but excluding
         the scheduled maturity date of the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes, discounted to the Early Settlement Date at a discount rate equal to -0.20%. The yield to the maturity
         date corresponding to the Total Consideration for the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes would represent a lower (i.e., more negative) yield if the Early Settlement Date
         were to be later than October 8, 2020. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon for any other purpose.
     (4) Total Consideration will be determined by taking into account the par call date for the 2022 BATCAP Notes.
     (5) Hypothetical Total Consideration as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on September 21, 2020 and assuming an Early Settlement Date of October 8, 2020.
     (6) To determine whether the Maximum Tender Amount or any Sub-Cap has been reached, we will convert the applicable purchase price payable with respect to the
         Sterling Securities and Euro Securities validly tendered into U.S. Dollars using the applicable exchange rate set forth under “The Terms of the Offer - Maximum
         Tender Amount; Sub - Caps; Acceptance Priority Levels and Proration.” in the Offer to Purchase.


                 The amount of each series of Securities that is purchased will be determined
     in accordance with the acceptance priority levels specified in the table above (the
     “Acceptance Priority Level”), with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and
     7 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level, subject to the Maximum Tender
     Amount and, with respect to the 2022 Sterling BATIF Notes, a maximum aggregate
     purchase price of $100 million (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) (the “2022
     Sterling BATIF Notes Sub-Cap”) and, with respect to the 2021 Euro BATIF Notes, a
     maximum aggregate purchase price of $100 million (excluding accrued and unpaid
     interest) (the “2021 Euro BATIF Notes Sub-Cap” and, together with the 2022
     Sterling BATIF Notes Sub-Cap, the “Sub-Caps”).
                 The Tender Offer is being made upon and is subject to the terms and
     conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 22, 2020, including
     the Financing Condition (as defined below). The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59
     p.m., New York City time, on October 20, 2020, unless extended or earlier
     terminated (the “Expiration Date”). Tenders of Securities may be withdrawn at any
     time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 5, 2020, but may not
     be withdrawn thereafter, unless the Offerors are required by applicable law to
     permit withdrawal.
                 As regards the Securities denominated in U.S. Dollars and Sterling, the
     applicable Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration to be paid for each
series of Securities accepted for purchase will be determined at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the business day following the Early Tender Deadline (as it may
be extended, the “Price Determination Date”), which is expected to be October 6,
2020. The applicable Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration to be paid
for the Securities denominated in U.S. Dollars and Sterling will be determined in the
manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed
spread over the yield to maturity based on the bid side price of the applicable
Reference Security specified in the table above, and the Total Consideration or
Tender Offer Consideration to be paid for the Securities denominated in Euro will be
a fixed amount as set forth in the table above.
      Holders of Securities who validly tender and not withdraw their Securities at
or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 5, 2020 (unless extended,
the “Early Tender Deadline”) and whose Securities are accepted for purchase will
receive the applicable Total Consideration, which includes the applicable early
tender premium specified in the table above (the “Early Tender Premium”). Holders
of Securities who validly tender their Securities following the Early Tender Deadline
and at or prior to the Expiration Date and whose Securities are accepted for
purchase will only receive the applicable “Tender Offer Consideration,” which is
equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the applicable Early Tender
Premium.
      The applicable Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration for
Securities denominated in U.S. Dollars, Sterling and Euro will be paid in U.S.
Dollars, Sterling and Euro, respectively. Acceptance of Notes with reference to the
Maximum Tender Amount and each Sub-Cap will be determined subject to the
currency conversion methods described in the Offer to Purchase.
      In   addition   to   the   applicable   Total   Consideration   or   Tender   Offer
Consideration, as the case may be, accrued and unpaid interest from and including
the most recent interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Securities
up to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date will be paid in cash on all
validly tendered Securities accepted for purchase.
      Even if the Maximum Tender Amount is not reached as of the Early Tender
Deadline, subject to the Sub-Caps, Securities validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in
priority to Securities tendered following the Early Tender Deadline even if such
Securities tendered following the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance
Priority Level than Securities tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline.
      Securities of a series may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
would cause the Maximum Tender Amount or any applicable Sub-Cap to be
exceeded. Furthermore, if the Maximum Tender Amount is reached as of the Early
Tender Deadline, holders who validly tender Securities following the Early Tender
Deadline will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase unless the
Maximum Tender Amount is increased. If the relevant Sub-Cap is reached as of the
Early Tender Deadline, holders who validly tender 2022 Sterling BATIF Notes or
2021 Euro BATIF Notes following the Early Tender Deadline will not have any such
Securities accepted for purchase unless the applicable Sub-Cap is increased.
      Each Offeror’s obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Securities
validly tendered in the Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including (i) the completion by
BATCAP and BATIF prior to the Early Settlement Date (which is expected to be
October 8, 2020) or the Expiration Date, as applicable, of one or more offerings of
debt securities that result in aggregate net proceeds of at least $2 billion, on terms
and subject to conditions satisfactory to the Offerors in their sole discretion, and (ii)
the Offerors having available funds sufficient to pay (x) the applicable Total
Consideration or the applicable Tender Offer Consideration, and the applicable
accrued but unpaid interest, with respect to validly tendered Securities for an
aggregate purchase price of up to the Maximum Tender Amount, and (y) all fees
and expenses related to the Tender Offer (collectively, the “Financing Condition”).
      The Offer is being undertaken to optimize BAT Group’s debt capital structure.
Securities that are accepted in the Offer will be purchased by the applicable Offeror
and retired and canceled and will no longer remain outstanding obligations of the
applicable Offeror.
      Payment for Securities that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at
or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase will be made as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Early Tender Deadline (such date, the
“Early Settlement Date”). The Offerors expect that the Early Settlement Date will be
October 8, 2020, the second business day after the Price Determination Date.
Payment for Securities that are validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline
but at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase will be made
promptly following the Expiration Date (such date, the “Final Settlement Date”).
The Offerors expect that the Final Settlement Date will be October 22, 2020, the
second business day after the Expiration Date, assuming the Maximum Tender
Amount of Securities is not purchased on the Early Settlement Date.
      The Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn in
whole or with respect to any series of Securities without amending, extending,
terminating or withdrawing the Offer with respect to any other series of Securities.
The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum amount of Securities being
tendered. The Offerors reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to: (i) waive any
and all conditions to the Offer; (ii) extend or terminate the Offer; (iii) increase or
decrease the Maximum Tender Amount or any Sub-Cap; or (iv) otherwise amend
the Tender Offer in any respect.

Forward-Looking Statements

        Statements included in this announcement and the Offer to Purchase regarding the
future expectations of BAT and its subsidiaries (the “BAT Group”), beliefs, plans, objectives,
financial conditions, assumptions or future events or performance that are not historical
facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made
through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”,
“expect”, “intend”, “may”, “outlook”, “plan”, “positioned”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”,
“should”, “strategy”, “target”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions. These include
statements regarding the BAT Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, among other things, the BAT Group’s results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances
occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the BAT Group operates.
All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition,
performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results
expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data
within this announcement. The BAT Group believes that the expectations reflected in this
document are reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range of variables that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Among the key
factors that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and
financial position of the BAT Group and that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements, are competitive actions and pricing
pressures in the marketplace, including competition from illicit sources, market size
reduction and consumer down-trading; limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco
products; changes in tobacco-related, tax and other laws and regulations, the interpretation
of such laws and regulations by governmental authorities or adverse decisions by domestic
or international regulatory bodies; the outcome of pending or potential litigation, including
tobacco litigation, environmental litigation and personal injury claims and significant
monetary obligations imposed under outstanding settlement agreements; economic,
regulatory and geopolitical risks (including as a result of COVID-19) inherent in the BAT
Group’s global operations; risks relating to the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund
the business under the current capital structure; risks relating to government regulations or
actions adversely affecting the BAT Group’s business, including the BAT Group becoming
subject to substantial and increasing U.S. regulations, in particular in relation to the nicotine
level or use of menthol in tobacco products, including by virtue of the BAT Group’s increased
ownership in RAI; the continuing decline in cigarette consumption, or the overall
consumption of legitimate tobacco products or the transition of adult tobacco consumers
away from premium cigarette brands; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; potentially
significant costs in the event of breaches of, or liabilities arising under, health and safety
and environmental laws; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace;

Quarterly Dividends for the year ended 31 December 2019:
Payment No. 3 – November 2020 (the “November 2020 Dividend”)
South Africa Branch Register Finalisation Information

On 27 February 2020, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of
210.4p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 52.6p per ordinary
share in May 2020, August 2020, November 2020 and February 2021.

The November 2020 Dividend will be payable on 12 November 2020 to shareholders registered on
either the UK main register or the South Africa branch register on 2 October 2020 (the record date).

In accordance with the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listing Requirements, the finalisation information for the
November 2020 Dividend relating to shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register is
set out in the paragraphs below.

The salient dates and other dividend declaration information announced on 27 February 2020 remain
unchanged for the November 2020 Dividend.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividend Rate

The British American Tobacco Group reports in sterling, therefore dividends are declared and
payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch register in South Africa whose dividends
are payable in rand. A rate of exchange of £:R = 20.98730 as at 17 September 2020 (the closing rate
on that date as quoted by Bloomberg), results in an equivalent November 2020 Dividend of
1103.93198 SA cents per ordinary share.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividends Tax Information

South Africa Dividends Tax (at a rate of 20%), equivalent to 220.78640 SA cents per ordinary share,
will be withheld from the gross November 2020 Dividend paid to shareholders on the South Africa
branch register, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. After Dividends Tax has been
withheld, the net dividend will be 883.14558 SA cents per ordinary share. The November 2020
Dividend is regarded as a ‘foreign dividend’ for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax. For
the purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the
November 2020 Dividend is the United Kingdom.

At the close of business on 17 September 2020 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of the
declaration of the South African rand equivalent of the November 2020 Dividend), the Company had
a total of 2,294,234,719 ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held
162,347,668 ordinary shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,456,582,387 ordinary
shares.
British American Tobacco p.l.c. is registered with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with tax
reference number 9378193172.

For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends Tax and the information provided above is of only direct
application to shareholders on the South Africa branch register. Shareholders on the South Africa
branch register should direct any questions regarding the application of Dividends Tax to

British American Tobacco (“BAT”) announces new President for US business, Reynolds American

We are announcing the following changes:

Ricardo Oberlander will step down as President of Reynolds American, Inc. (“Reynolds American”)
and from the Management Board on 31 August 2020 and will leave the Group at the end of the year.
Ricardo has been with the Group for almost three decades, over seven years of which as a member
of the Management Board, firstly as Regional Director Americas and then latterly leading Reynolds
American. Ricardo steps down in order to pursue other opportunities.

Guy Meldrum, currently Regional Director, Asia-Pacific and Middle East, will succeed Ricardo as
President of Reynolds American effective 1 September 2020.

Michael (Mihovil) Dijanosic, currently Area Director Asia-Pacific Area, will be appointed Regional
Director, Asia-Pacific and Middle East, replacing Guy.

Commenting on the changes, BAT Chief Executive, Jack Bowles, said:

""I am grateful for the drive and leadership that Ricardo has brought to the Group throughout his
career and for leaving the Reynolds American business in such robust shape. I would like to thank
Ricardo for his significant contribution over the last three decades, including over seven years as a
member of the Management Board. We all wish him the very best for the future.

Guy’s extensive experience with BAT over the last 26 years, including a number of senior roles in
Australasia, the North Asia Area, Russia and his recent experience in leading the Asia-Pacific and
Middle East Region, will serve him well to further drive the transformation of Reynolds American.

I am delighted to welcome Michael, who has over two decades of experience with the Group, to the
Management Board. He has held a number of senior leadership roles in Asia Pacific across different
markets and has been a member of the regional leadership team since 2012. This in-depth
knowledge of the region positions him extremely well to succeed Guy.”

  “The business is performing well in difficult circumstances as our continued focus on our three key priorities
  has enabled us to rapidly adapt to the current environment.
  1.     We are building A Better Tomorrow
       o     10% of our revenues come from non-combustible categories
       o     We are making good progress towards our target of 50 million non-combustibles consumers by
             2030
       o     Invested an additional £250 million in New Categories marketing
  2.     We are continuing to deliver adjusted revenue, profit from operations and earnings growth at
         constant rates
       o     Strong cigarette price/mix (8.5%) reflects the strength of our differentiated brand portfolio
       o     Which offsets lower cigarette and THP volume (down 6.3%)
       o     And the impact of COVID-19 of approximately -4% on adjusted revenue in the first six-months of
             2020
  3.     Multi-category consumer acquisition drives share growth
       o     Our Non-Combustibles consumer base increased to 11.6 million (up 1.1 million from December
             2019), being an increase of 2.7 million consumers on a rolling 12 month basis from June 2019
       o     New categories revenue grew 12.7% (at constant rates)
       o     We are growing volume share in THP and value share in Vapour, with Modern oral adjusted
             revenue up 71% (at constant rates)




  1. Three key priorities are “Driving value from Combustibles”, “Ensuring a step change in New Category performance” and “Simplifying the business”.
Chief Executive summary cont…

4.       We are delivering excellent combustibles volume and value share growth
     o       Cigarette volume share (up 50 bps) and value share (up 20 bps)
     o       Driven by the strength of the Group’s differentiated cigarette portfolio
     o       Strategic cigarettes and THP portfolio now accounts for 66% of total cigarettes and THP volume
     o       US cigarette volume share up 10 bps and value share up 30 bps
5.       We are navigating COVID-19 supported by a diverse market footprint
     o       Consumption trends in Developed Markets (75% of Group adjusted revenue) remain robust, with
             good pricing and little evidence to date of accelerated down-trading
     o       In Emerging Markets, we are growing cigarette and THP volume share strongly, up 70 bps
     o       Volumes are strong where we see illicit trade reduction and can leverage our operational agility
     o       Weaker industry volume where there have been stricter lockdown measures (for instance South
             Africa)
     o       We continue to anticipate a full year headwind of around 3% from COVID-19 on constant currency
             adjusted revenue
6.     We are committed
     o     We are on track to deliver against our 2020 guidance
     o     We maintain our medium-term post COVID-19 guidance of 3-5% constant currency adjusted
           revenue growth and high-single figure constant currency adjusted diluted EPS growth
     o     We are committed to our 65% dividend pay-out ratio

I would like to thank our staff, customers, partners and suppliers for working tirelessly through this difficult
period. We expect the coming months to bring continued uncertainty. Nevertheless, we will continue to invest
in accelerating our strategy. Building on our excellent momentum, we are confident that we will exit this crisis
as a stronger and better business”
                                                                                     Jack Bowles, 31 July 2020

DIVIDENDS
Declaration
On 27 February 2020, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of 210.4p per
ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 52.6p per ordinary share in May 2020,
August 2020, November 2020 and February 2021.

The May 2020 dividend was paid to shareholders on the UK main register and South Africa branch register on
13 May 2020 and to holders of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) on 18 May 2020. The three remaining
quarterly dividends will be paid to shareholders registered on either the UK main register or the South Africa
branch register, and to holders of ADSs, each on the applicable record dates set out under the heading ‘Key
Dates’ below.

South Africa Branch Register
In accordance with the JSE Limited (JSE) Listing Requirements, the finalisation information relating to
shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register (comprising the amount of the dividend in South
African rand, the exchange rate and the associated conversion date) will be published on the dates stated
below, together with South Africa dividends tax information.

The quarterly dividends are regarded as ‘foreign dividends’ for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax.
For the purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the
quarterly dividends is the United Kingdom.
Holders of ADSs

For holders of ADSs listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the record dates and payment dates are
also set out below. The equivalent quarterly dividends receivable by holders of ADSs in US dollars will be
calculated based on the exchange rate on the applicable payment date. A fee of US$0.005 per ADS will be
charged by Citibank, N.A. in its capacity as depositary bank for the British American Tobacco American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) programme in respect of each quarterly dividend payment.

General dividend information

months ended 30 June 2020 reflect the fourth quarterly dividend from the declaration made on 28 February

 are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the impact of adverse domestic or
 international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international tax laws and rates and the impact of an
 unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of such
 outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or international economic or political conditions;
 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; adverse decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact of market
 size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious
 injury, illness or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the current capital
 structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and rollout New Categories; and changes in the market position, businesses,
 financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Group.

 It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range of
 variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Past performance is no guide to
 future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser. The forward-looking statements
 reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the Group undertakes no
 obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
 otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this communication should be
 interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed
 the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

 Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and
 Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed on 26 March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-
 K, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov, and the Company’s Annual Reports, which

Quarterly Dividends for the year ended 31 December 2019:
Payment No. 2 – August 2020 (the “August 2020 Dividend”)
South Africa Branch Register Finalisation Information

On 27 February 2020, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of
210.4p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 52.6p per ordinary
share in May 2020, August 2020, November 2020 and February 2021.

The August 2020 Dividend will be payable on 19 August 2020 to shareholders registered on either
the UK main register or the South Africa branch register on 10 July 2020 (the record date).

In accordance with the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listing Requirements, the finalisation information for the
August 2020 Dividend relating to shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register is set
out in the paragraphs below.

The salient dates and other dividend declaration information announced on 27 February 2020 remain
unchanged.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividend Rate

The British American Tobacco Group reports in sterling, therefore dividends are declared and
payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch register in South Africa whose dividends
are payable in rand. A rate of exchange of £:R = 21.33070 as at 26 June 2020 (the closing rate on
that date as quoted by Bloomberg), results in an equivalent August 2020 Dividend of 1121.99482 SA
cents per ordinary share.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividends Tax Information

South Africa Dividends Tax (at a rate of 20%), equivalent to 224.39896 SA cents per ordinary share,
will be withheld from the gross August 2020 Dividend paid to shareholders on the South Africa
branch register, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. After Dividends Tax has been
withheld, the net dividend will be 897.59586 SA cents per ordinary share. The August 2020 Dividend
is regarded as a ‘foreign dividend’ for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax. For the
purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the
August 2020 Dividend is the United Kingdom.

At the close of business on 26 June 2020 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of the
declaration of the South African rand equivalent of the August 2020 Dividend), the Company had a
total of 2,294,223,710 ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held
162,350,165 ordinary shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,456,573,875 ordinary
shares.
British American Tobacco p.l.c. is registered with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with tax
reference number 9378193172.

For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends Tax and the information provided above is of only direct
application to shareholders on the South Africa branch register. Shareholders on the South Africa
branch register should direct any questions regarding the application of Dividends Tax to

                                  RESILIENT AND GROWING
                                                        
Trading update - ahead of closed period commencing 1 July 2020.


The business is performing well against a backdrop of a very challenging and volatile trading environment. We
continue to see good pricing and strong volume and value share growth across our combustibles business,
together with good share growth across all three of the new categories - vapour, tobacco heating and modern
oral. This strong operational performance is reflected in our continued commitment to our 65% dividend pay-
out policy.

Results in developed markets (c.75% of Group revenue) are strong, with continued good pricing, little evidence
of accelerated downtrading to date and a particularly strong performance from our business in the US, which
has been highly resilient throughout the COVID-19 crisis.

The impact of COVID-19 in emerging markets has been more pronounced, including in Bangladesh, Vietnam
and Malaysia. In addition, closures and other lock-down measures in certain countries, in particular South
Africa, Mexico and Argentina, have persisted longer than anticipated. In South Africa there are still no signs of
the COVID-19 related tobacco sales ban being lifted.

Together with the previously announced impact on International Travel Retail sales, this means that we now
anticipate, in total, a FY headwind of c.3% from COVID-19 on constant currency adjusted revenue. As a result,
we believe it prudent to anticipate a FY20 constant currency adjusted revenue growth in the 1-3% range.

In New Categories, the business is performing well, with share growth in all three categories and recent
launches in THP showing encouraging early results. COVID-19 has disrupted consumer activation plans,
reducing overall industry growth rates in New Categories. It has also led to the scaling back or postponement
of some launches, as well as causing supply disruption and out-of-stocks earlier in the year. While the vapour
category continues to recover following the global slowdown in H2 last year, the US market remains below
historical levels.

Given these factors, while we continue to invest more in New Categories and make further progress towards
our £5bn revenue ambition, growth this year will be slower. We now anticipate reaching the £5bn target in
2025 (previously 2023/24).

We provide the following guidance:
-   FY constant currency adjusted revenue in the 1-3% range (previously ‘around the lower end of the 3-5%
    range’)
-   Mid-Single Figure FY constant currency adjusted diluted EPS growth (previously ‘High-Single Figure’)
-   Continued deleveraging of the balance sheet to around 3x Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA by end
    2021, (previously ‘below 3x’), given the impact of COVID-19 on our operating results in 2020
-   A continued dividend pay-out ratio of 65% of adjusted diluted EPS and growth in sterling terms, supported
    by a strong liquidity position

We expect the building blocks of this to be:
- Continued growth in FY cigarette volume and value share, currently up 50bps and 20bps YTD, respectively
- Expectations for global industry cigarette and THP volume to be down c. 7% (previously c.5%), as a result
   of COVID-19 lockdowns persisting longer than anticipated in some key emerging markets, most notably in
   South Africa, Mexico and Argentina
- A strong performance in our US business, with continued value share growth, up 30bps YTD
- Improved expectations for a US cigarette industry volume decline of c. 4% (previously c.5%), following
   continued volume resilience in the market, down around -2% YTD May on a sales-to-retail (STR) basis
- Good cigarette price mix at a group level, driven by a strong performance in our developed market
   businesses
- Progress towards our 2025 ambition of £5bn in New Category revenue (previously 2023/4)
- Good improvement in adjusted operating margin at both the HY and FY, while continuing to invest in the
   total business to underpin future growth, fuelled in part by accelerated savings from Project Quantum
- While we continue to expect the FY underlying tax rate to be around 25.5%, H1 adjusted diluted EPS is
   expected to benefit from a reduced underlying tax rate at H1, driven by a number of one-off items
- Strong FY operating cash flow conversion in excess of 90% of adjusted profit from operations

Applying current foreign exchange spot rates*, we expect a translation headwind of around 1% on H1 20
adjusted diluted EPS growth and around 2% for the full year.

Jack Bowles, Chief Executive:

“Our primary focus remains the health and well being of our employees and we are working hard to best ensure
their safety and minimise the risk of virus transmission. As a global business we are also leveraging our
distribution and manufacturing capabilities to support the wider community at this difficult time.

Our purpose is clear, we are committed to Building a Better Tomorrow. This includes our potential vaccine for
COVID-19, under development at our US bio-tech subsidiary, Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP), which has
demonstrated its ability to generate an immune response in pre-clinical testing and is poised to move to clinical
trials.

We have made a good start to the year, with strong volume and value share growth in combustibles
underpinning the sustainability of the business.

Our focus on becoming a faster, simpler, more agile business through Project Quantum has positioned us well for
continued delivery in the current environment and these efforts have ensured we are a highly resilient company.

We are delivering on our three key priorities:
   - We are driving value growth in combustibles
   - We are continuing to invest behind growth and the New Categories
   - We are transforming the business with the completion of phase 1 of Project Quantum.
Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our teams around the world, I am pleased to say that we continue to
perform well and expect a good performance in 2020, in the context of very challenging circumstances.

Looking further ahead, we are confident about the future opportunities for BAT. Our continued commitment to
our dividend policy reflects this confidence.”

Trading update detail:

Good performance in combustibles, with strong price mix and volume and value share gains offsetting lower
industry volume
- Global industry cigarette and THP volume, expected to be down c.7% for the FY
- BAT FY cigarette volume expected to be ahead of the industry, reflecting the growth in market share
- Corporate value share up 20bps YTD, with volume share up over 50bps
- Strategic Brands (now 68% of Group volume) up 30bps YTD in volume share and up 40bps YTD in value share

US performing strongly, with volume ahead of expectations, good pricing and continued value share growth
- Expected strong constant currency revenue growth, supported by both our combustible and non combustible
   businesses
- FY 2020 US industry volume expected to be down c.4%. The US represents less than 10% of global industry
   volume
- Continued strong value share performance, with corporate value share up 30bps YTD, and premium share up
   50bps YTD, driven by Natural American Spirit and Newport, with Newport reaching a record volume share
   high of 15%
- Strategic Brands volume share up 20bps YTD May; corporate volume share up 10bps YTD May to a record
   share of 35%

Year to date share gains across all three New Categories driven by consumables
- In Vapour, Vuse is growing value share in all key markets, with high-single/low-double digit consumable share
   growth across the US, Canada, France and Germany, and continued positive share momentum in the UK:
         o In the US, Vuse Alto value share is up 570bps to 21.1% v Dec 19, with total Vuse family value share
             at 26.2%
         o In the UK, France and Germany Vype gained +80bps, +150bps and +300bps of value share v Dec 19
             respectively to 12.8%, 24.8% and 45.5%, driven by ePod and ePen3
         o In Canada, Vype remains the fastest growing vapour brand in the industry reaching 35.2% of value
             share +710bps YTD v Dec 19 driven by the strong growth from ePod
- In THP, glo is back to growth in Japan and continues to grow share in ENA:
         o In Japan, glo grew +30bps v Dec 19 to a record volume share of 5.4% in April, driven by a strong
             performance from glo Pro and glo Hyper. Consumer traction for glo Sens remains slow
         o Overall, our nicotine (FMC+THP) volume share in Japan is up 70bps YTD vs FY19, reaching 18.8%
         o glo Hyper was launched predominantly via digital in mid-April in Japan and is now distributed
             nationally, already reaching a share of 0.4%. Early results are very encouraging with positive
             consumer feedback
         o glo Hyper has also been soft-launched in Italy, Romania, Russia and Spain with encouraging early
             results
- In Modern Oral, we continue to strengthen our position:
         o Continued broad-based volume share growth in Europe, including in Scandinavia, reaching 4.0%
             and 14.1% volume share of the total oral markets in Sweden and Norway, respectively, up 80bps
             and 70bps v Dec 19
         o In the US, Velo is holding its volume share of the sub-6mg segment at 29% and consolidating its
             volume share position in the Eastern US with total volume share at 9.5%. Activation of the brand
             further West continues, although plans have been impacted by COVID-19
         o Encouraging results from our test launches in emerging markets

Expected de-leveraging to around 3x adjusted net debt** to adjusted EBITDA*** by end 2021 given the impact
of COVID-19 on our operating results in 2020
- Expect continued strong operating cashflow conversion in excess of 90% of adjusted profit from operations
- Continued strong liquidity position with strong cash flow conversion supplemented by successful recent US
  Dollar and Euro bond issuances and an undrawn £6bn RCF, with no financial covenants
- Medium-term rating target remains BBB+/Baa1, with a current rating of BBB+/Baa2****

Market share data (unless otherwise stated) is at April 2020 and volume data is based on YTD April.
* Current exchange rates of USD/GBP 1.268 as at 5th June 2020
** Adjusted Net Debt is not a measure defined by IFRS. Adjusted Net Debt is total borrowings, including related
derivatives, less cash and cash equivalents and current investments held at fair value, excluding the impact of the
revaluation of RAI acquired debt arising as part of the purchase price allocation process.
*** Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined by IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is profit for the year before net finance
costs/income, taxation on ordinary activities, depreciation, amortisation, impairment costs, the Group’s share of post-
tax results of associates and joint ventures, and other adjusting items.
****A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. A credit rating may be subject to
withdrawal or revision at any time. Each rating should be evaluated separately of any other rating.

As used herein, volume share refers to the retail sales volume of the product sold as a proportion of total retail sales
volume in that category and value share refers to the retail sales value of the product sold as a proportion of total
retail sales value in that category. Please refer to the 2019 Annual Report on Form 20?F for a full description of these
measures, together with a description of other Key Performance Indicators, on page 257.

New Categories comprises Tobacco Heating Products (THP), Vapour and Modern Oral.

Note on Non-GAAP Measures

This announcement contains several non-GAAP measures used by management to monitor the Group’s
performance. For the non-GAAP information contained in this announcement, no comparable GAAP or IFRS
information is available on a forward-looking basis, as the effect of adjusting items and rates of exchange, which
could be significant, may be highly variable and cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty.

The Group’s Management Board regularly reviews the measures used to assess and present the financial
performance of the Group and, as relevant, its geographic segments, and believes that these measures provide
additional useful information to investors. Certain of our measures are presented based on an adjusted basis and
on a constant currency basis. Please refer to the 2019 Annual Report on Form 20?F for a full description of each
measure, pages 257 to 268.

The principal non-GAAP measures which the Group uses and that are contained in this announcement are
adjusted revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are before the impact of adjusting items and are
derived from revenue, and diluted earnings per share, respectively. This announcement also contains adjusted
operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined as adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted
revenue. This announcement also contains underlying tax rate, a non-GAAP measure
defined as the tax rate incurred before the impact of adjusting items and to adjust for the inclusion of the
Group’s share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures within the Group’s pre-tax results.

This announcement also contains adjusted net debt and adjusted EBITDA. The Group uses adjusted net debt and
adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial capacity. The Management Board believes that these additional measures,
which are used internally, are useful to the users of the financial statements in helping them to see how business
financing has changed over the year.

Adjusting items, as identified in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, represent certain items of
income and expense which the Group considers distinctive based on their size, nature or incidence. These
include significant items in revenue, profit from operations, net finance costs, taxation and the Group’s share of
the post?tax results of associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are
relevant to an understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Although the Group does not
believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe such results excluding
the impact of adjusting items provide additional useful information to investors regarding the underlying
performance of the business on a comparable basis.

Adjusting items in respect of adjusted revenue refers to the excise on bought-in goods in 2019 and earlier
periods that the Group acquired and sold, for a limited period and were recorded in accordance with IFRS as a
cost of sale and within revenue, with a dilutive effect on operating margin. Once the short-term arrangements
cease, the goods will be manufactured by the Group, and the excise, in accordance with Group policy, will not be
included in cost of sales or revenue – leading to a reduction in revenue and improvement in operating margin
that does not represent the underlying performance of the Group. As short-term contract manufacturing
agreements in ENA, to which such adjustments relate, have either ended in 2019 or will be immaterial in 2020,
2019 is the last year where the Group adjusted for the excise on bought-in goods.

The Group’s management reviews a number of our IFRS and non?GAAP measures for the Group and its
geographic segments at constant rates of exchange. This allows comparison of the Group’s results, had they
been translated at the previous year’s average rates of exchange. The Group does not adjust for the normal
transactional gains and losses in operations that are generated by exchange movements. Although the Group
does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such
results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year?on?year provide additional useful information to
investors regarding the operating performance on a local currency basis.

Forward looking statements

This announcement does not constitute an invitation to underwrite, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire or
dispose of any British American Tobacco p.l.c. (""BAT"") shares or other securities. This announcement contains
certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking” statements made within the meaning of Section
21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, regarding our intentions, beliefs or current
expectations concerning amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects,
growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries
and markets in which the Group operates, including the projected future financial and operating impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,”
“anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook,” “target” and similar expressions.
All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors. It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they
may be affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently anticipated.

Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-
looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the
impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international tax
laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation
and dispute outcomes and the effect of such outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences
in domestic or international economic or political conditions (including as a result of COVID-19); adverse
decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer
down-trading; translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness
or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the current
capital structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver the New Categories strategy; and changes in
the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Group.

Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent
financial adviser. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of
preparation of this announcement and BAT undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Resolution 2 - Directors’ Remuneration Report

In respect of resolution 2 (Directors’ Remuneration Report), we acknowledge that a significant minority of
shareholders chose not to support this resolution.

This year, as with every year, the Remuneration Committee has given careful consideration to executive
remuneration. Our executive remuneration arrangements are fully in line with our Directors’ Remuneration
Policy which was approved by a significant majority of our shareholders at our 2019 Annual General
Meeting with 92.6% of votes in favour of the policy.

However, the views of all our shareholders are important to us and we will continue to listen to their views
to better understand the specific concerns of those who voted against this resolution. Prior to today’s
Annual General Meeting, we engaged with a number of our shareholders on our executive remuneration
arrangements and we will continue to actively engage shareholders on this important topic during 2020.

Resolution 15 - Authority to allot shares

We acknowledge that a number of our shareholders did not support this resolution. It remains standard
market practice for many UK FTSE listed companies to retain this type of authority. As we have previously
reported, the authority sought by the Company is in accordance with the UK Investment Association's share
capital management guidelines and prevailing voting guidelines of leading corporate governance agencies
applicable to UK listed companies.

However, we remain aware that some institutional investors, particularly outside the UK, have specific
policies against supporting this type of resolution. Following the outcome of today’s vote, we will continue
our ongoing engagement with shareholders for which this authority presents concern and will keep best
practice in this area under review.

Chairman’s AGM Statement - 2020 outlook

Dear Shareholders,

Since the publication of our Annual Report and Accounts last month, the situation relating to COVID-19 has
developed significantly and, as a result, I am unable to address our AGM in person this year.

Our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our employees. To best ensure safety and to
minimise the risk of virus transmission, we have implemented a series of preventative health measures for
our employees around the world, based on country-specific situations and government guidance. This is
especially important for our employees whose jobs cannot be done from home. I am pleased to be able to
announce that we have not had to make any employee redundant, nor furlough any staff, due to the COVID-
19 crisis. I would like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts to support
everyone’s well-being, as well as the success of the business during this time.

As a global business we are also working hard to support the wider community during this very difficult time.
We are leveraging our distribution system across our markets to support the delivery of thousands of vital
items such as cleaning and hygiene products, masks and food. We have repurposed a number of our
manufacturing facilities to permit the manufacture of sanitisers and personal protective equipment.
Following a request from the UK Government, we have also lent some of our analytical machinery to support
their COVID-19 testing programme.

Additionally, our US bio-tech subsidiary, Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP) is developing a potential vaccine for
COVID-19 which is now in pre-clinical testing. This vaccine project is being carried out on a not-for-profit
basis.

Our current ESG priority is responding to the ‘whole of society’ approach called for by the WHO, as we have
outlined above. That said, I would like to highlight the greater focus we have brought to ESG issues generally
during 2019.

Sustainability Front and Centre

As explained at the recent Capital Markets Day in March, sustainability is front and centre of everything we
do, and we now have a clear corporate purpose to create “A Better Tomorrow” for all our stakeholders:

    -   For our consumers through offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products
    -   For society through reducing the overall health and environmental impacts of our business
    -   For our employees by creating a dynamic and purposeful place to work, and
    -   For our shareholders by consistently delivering against our financial commitments

At our Capital Markets Day, we announced ambitious new sustainability targets:
    -   To have 50 million consumers of non-combustible products by 2030
    -   To achieve carbon neutrality by that same year, and
    -   To bring forward our existing 2030 environmental targets to 2025




2019 Performance – A Strong Operational Performance

2019 was characterised by a strong operational performance and we delivered on our three core priorities,
to:

    -   Deliver value in combustibles
    -   Drive a step change in New Categories
    -   Build a simpler, faster organisation

We delivered against all our financial targets:

    -   Strong reported revenue growth up 5.7% at current rates and 5.6% on an adjusted constant rate
        basis, driven by the excellent performance from our combustibles portfolio, which was up 4.6% also
        on an adjusted constant rate basis
    -   This was powered by our strategic combustibles brands, which, driven by continued strong volume
        and value share growth and strong price/mix of 9%, grew adjusted revenue 5.6% at constant rates,
        and

This enabled:

    -   Continued deleveraging of the balance sheet, reducing Adjusted Net Debt**/Adjusted EBITDA*** by
        0.5x to 3.5x
    -   A dividend of 210.4p per ordinary share, a 3.6% increase, maintaining our 65% pay-out policy

This supported further increased investment in New Categories, focussing on building global brands to
support our differentiated multi-category approach across vapour, tobacco-heating and modern oral
products resulting in:

    -   32% constant currency revenue growth in New Categories
    -   11 million consumers of non-combustible products, and
    -   New Categories revenue of £1.2bn at constant rates, more than doubling revenue from two years
        ago and providing us with a vital platform for future growth

Building A Better Tomorrow

Jack Bowles marked his first full year as CEO, delivering strong results in 2019, and is accelerating our
ambition to transform our business. The Board and I fully endorse the evolved “A Better Tomorrow”
strategy he presented at the Capital Markets Day with its vision to simplify the Group, drive value from our
combustibles portfolio, and better satisfy evolving consumer preferences with new and innovative
potentially reduced risk products.

The simplification started in 2019 with the first phase of Project Quantum, a fundamental re-evaluation of
how we are organised, including:
    -   Redesigning management layers and eliminating duplication
    -   Whilst entrenching accountability, and
    -   Creating new capabilities in the organisation




Project Quantum will also release valuable funds for further reinvestment in future growth. We announced a
further phase of the project at our recent Capital Markets Day and in total we aim to deliver savings of £1bn
over 2020- 2022. This further phase will include:

    -   Operational efficiencies
    -   Route-to-market focus, and
    -   Supply chain productivity

We remain committed to continuing the transformation of our business in 2020.

Despite ongoing uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the resilience of our supply chain in
combination with the dedication of our teams means that I am confident we will continue to deliver. We
maintain our commitment to high single figure constant currency adjusted diluted EPS growth.

Board Composition

I am very pleased to welcome Jerry Fowden, who brings extensive US experience to the Board. Let me thank
Kieran Poynter our Senior Independent Director, who stands down from the Board today. Dimitri
Panayotopoulos will become Senior Independent Director after today’s meeting.

And as you would expect given my tenure as Chairman, the Board and Nominations Committee will be
focussed on succession planning for my role, from which I expect to retire at or before our 2021 AGM. I feel
strongly that my successor will inherit a business that is in excellent shape, which I am confident will deliver
sustainable growth for many years to come.

2020 Outlook – Confirming High Single Figure EPS Growth and 65% Dividend Pay-out Policy

We have consistently delivered on our high single figure constant currency earnings growth target and we
continue to maintain this guidance for 2020.

We have made a strong start to the year driven by:

    -   Continued volume and value share growth of 40bps and 20bps respectively
    -   Positive volume growth (with some benefit from an increase in trade and consumer stocks), and
    -   Strong price mix, with pricing in line with our plan

A Resilient Business
Most of our factories are open and are currently operating at full capacity, and we have built up an average
stock of around 2 months of finished goods, with further stock throughout our wholesale and retail
footprint.

We are a very geographically diverse company and including the US around 75% of our global revenue is in
developed markets where distribution and availability is largely unchanged.

In a small number of markets where mandated by governments, our Combustibles manufacturing facilities
have faced some limited periods of shutdown.

To date, we have seen limited impact on consumer demand, pricing or consumers’ ability to access products.
Sales in global travel retail have been significantly impacted, although this represents less than 1% of our
sales. Government restriction of the sale of cigarettes has only been seen in a few countries.

In New Categories, having reported some supply chain disruption at the retail level during our Preliminary
results in February, we are pleased that:

   -   Our supply chain for New Categories is now operating back at full capacity, and we are starting to
       build contingency stocks
    -  Traffic to our websites is up significantly and internet sales have more than doubled as government
       social-distancing measures have reduced our ability to engage with consumers at the point of sale
   -   We continue to launch new innovations – like Glo Hyper & capsule consumables– albeit with an
       adapted launch model reacting to the current environment
   -   Glo capsules are now around a quarter of the product mix in Japan

Looking Forward

The impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict. We are anticipating a reduction in trade and consumer
stocks and some effect on industry volume and revenue growth in Q2. This, together with some delayed
launches in New Categories, means we expect results to be weighted to the second half.

Being prudent, we now expect the building blocks of high single figure adjusted constant currency EPS
growth in FY 2020 to include:

   -   Constant currency adjusted revenue growth around the low end of the 3-5% range
          o Including expectations for global industry cigarette and THP volume decline to around c.5%
              (previously c.4%), while we maintain our forecast for US industry decline at around c.5%
   -   Continued progress towards our 2023/24 ambition of £5bn in revenue in New Categories

   This will be delivered in partnership with:

   -   Good improvement in adjusted operating margin
   -   Strong operating cashflow conversion in excess of 90% of adjusted profit from operations
   -   Continued deleveraging of the balance sheet
   -   Further strengthening of our liquidity position by recent successful US Dollar and Euro bond
       issuances and an undrawn £6bn RCF with no financial covenants
   -   A dividend pay-out ratio of 65% of adjusted diluted EPS and growth in sterling terms

Extrapolating foreign exchange spot rates* for the full year, we expect a translation headwind of around 2%
on full year adjusted diluted EPS growth.

In summary
Overall, and considering the challenging environment, our business is resilient, competitive and performing
well, and we are confident in delivering another good year of adjusted diluted high single figure EPS growth
in constant currency.

Forward-Looking Statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including ""forward-looking"" statements
made within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as ""believe,""
""anticipate,"" ""could,"" ""may,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""potential,"" ""predict,"" ""will,"" ""expect,""
""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""positioned,"" ""strategy,"" ""outlook"", ""target"" and similar expressions. These include
statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, amongst other things, our
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and
business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the BAT Group
operates, including the projected future financial and operating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.



All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks,
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and results to
differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results expressed in the forward-looking statements
and other financial and/or statistical data within this announcement. Among the key factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are uncertainties
related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the impact of adverse domestic or
international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international tax laws and rates and the
impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute
outcomes and the effect of such outcomes on the Group's financial condition; changes or differences in
domestic or international economic or political conditions (including as a result of COVID-19); adverse
decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer
down-trading; translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury,
illness or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the
current capital structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver the New Categories strategy;
and changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the
Group.
It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be affected
by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently
anticipated. Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult
an independent financial adviser. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information
available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the Group undertakes no obligation to update
or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this
communication should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future
financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company's filings with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed on 26
March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website,

Update on arrangements for the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in light of COVID-19

Following the publication of the Company’s Notice of AGM and associated announcement on 27
March 2020, the UK Government has extended its COVID-19 ‘Stay at Home’ measures until 7 May
2020. These measures prohibit, amongst other things, public gatherings of more than two people.

In order to comply with Government measures, the Company’s AGM at 11:30am on 30 April 2020
will be convened with the minimum necessary quorum of two shareholders, in accordance with the
Company's Articles of Association. Other shareholders will not be allowed to attend and anyone
seeking to attend the AGM will be refused entry on the grounds of safety. The business to be
transacted remains unchanged from that set out in the Notice of AGM.

The Board recognises that the AGM is an important event for all shareholders and is keen to ensure
that they are able to exercise their right to vote notwithstanding the restrictions on attendance in
person. As such, the Board strongly encourages all shareholders to exercise their vote by appointing
the Chairman of the Meeting as their proxy rather than another person who will not be permitted to
attend the AGM. Shareholders on the UK main register and South Africa branch register should refer
to Appendix 1 in the Notice of AGM for instructions on how to vote by proxy (electronically and by
post). Shareholders are encouraged to submit their voting instructions as soon as possible and they
must be received by the Company’s registrars in the UK and South Africa by 11:30am (UK time) on
Tuesday 28 April 2020. Holders of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) should refer to the
Depositary’s Notice of AGM for voting instructions and the ADS voting deadline.

All valid proxy appointments will be included in the poll to be taken at the AGM. The results of voting
will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and
published on the Company’s website, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the AGM.

Shareholders will have the opportunity to submit questions about the business of the AGM via the
AGM page on the Company’s website www.bat.com/agm from 9:00am on Monday 20 April until the
start of the AGM on 30 April 2020. Responses to questions relevant to the business of the meeting
will be published on our website following the AGM.

The Board would like to take this opportunity to thank all shareholders for their support and
understanding in these unprecedented circumstances.

The above AGM arrangements are subject to UK Government COVID-19 measures in force from time
to time. Any further updates on the status of the AGM will be published on www.bat.com/agm and
announced to the stock market.

Forward-Looking Statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking”
statements made within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as
“believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,”
“will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook”, “target” and similar
expressions. These include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects,
growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the
countries and markets in which the BAT Group operates.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks,
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and
results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results expressed in the
forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data within this announcement.
Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from
illicit trade; the impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in
domestic or international tax laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax
authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of such outcomes
on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or international economic or
political conditions (including as a result of COVID-19); adverse decisions by domestic or international
regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational and
transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the
workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the current capital
structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver the New Categories strategy; and
changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of
the Group.

It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be
affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently anticipated. Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice
should consult an independent financial adviser. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge
and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the Group undertakes
no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this
communication should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future
financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed
on 26 March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at the
SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov, and the Company’s Annual Reports, which may be obtained free
of charge from the British American Tobacco website www.bat.com.

United Kingdom

The communication of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and any other
documents or materials relating to the Notes is only being distributed to, and is only directed at,
persons outside the United Kingdom or in the United Kingdom that are qualified investors within the
meaning of Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation (“qualified investors”) that also (i) have professional
experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, or the Order, (ii) who fall within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order or (iii) to whom it may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all
such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Notes are only available to, and
any invitation, offer or agreement to purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only
with, relevant persons.

European Economic Area and United Kingdom Retail Investors

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (1) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (2) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (3) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation.

Annual Report for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 and Annual General Meeting 2020

British American Tobacco p.l.c. (the ""Company"" or “BAT”) reports that the following documents are
being mailed and made available to its shareholders (as applicable) today, 27 March 2020. Those
documents with a web-link shown are also available to be viewed or downloaded on the British

In compliance with Listing Rule 9.6.1, copies of each of the above documents(1) will be submitted to
the National Storage Mechanism as soon as practicable and will be available for inspection via the

Note:
(1) On 26 March 2020, the Company announced that the Annual Report 2019 was published to be
    viewed or downloaded on the Company’s website and was submitted to the National Storage
    Mechanism. The relevant disclosures were also made with reference to the requirements of Rule
    6.3.5 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.

Arrangements for the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in light of CoVid-19

BAT is closely monitoring the CoVid-19 situation, including UK Government measures, and will
continue to do so in the lead up to the AGM.

In order to ensure the health and safety of shareholders and BAT staff, shareholders should note
that the AGM will focus only on those matters required by law and regulation. Aside from the formal
meeting, there will not be the usual refreshments and other opportunities to meet members of the
BAT Board and management team informally.

In light of the current UK Government measures on staying at home and away from others (social
distancing) to reduce the transmission of CoVid-19, and specifically the avoidance of gatherings
and non-essential use of public transport, shareholders are advised not to attend the meeting in
person this year if the measures continue to be the same or even more restrictive.
As such, the Board urges all shareholders to appoint a proxy as early as possible in order to vote
on the matters being considered at the meeting.

The situation is developing rapidly and shareholders should note that further changes may need to
be put in place at short notice in relation to the AGM this year.

Updates on the status of the AGM and any changes to the proceedings of the meeting will be
published on www.bat.com/agm and announced to the stock market.

      The impact of the present coronavirus (the “COVID 19 pandemic”) on our results of
      operations and financial condition is uncertain and cannot be predicted

      The Group continues to monitor developments closely as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.
      To date, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s business has not been material,
      but if the situation deteriorates or persists for an extended period in key geographies the risk
      of a significant adverse impact to the Group’s business will increase.

      The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Group’s business will depend on a range of
      factors which we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the
      pandemic, the geographies impacted, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and
      the nature and severity of measures adopted by governments. These factors include, but are
      not limited to:

       -   Reductions or volatility in consumer demand for one or more of our products due to
           illness, retail closures, quarantine or other travel restrictions, economic hardship and
           customer-downtrading (switching to a cheaper brand), which may impact the Group’s
           market share.

       -   The deterioration of socio-economic conditions and disruptions to the Group’s
           operations, such as its supply chain, or manufacturing or distribution capabilities, which
           may result in increased costs due to the need for more complex supply chain
           arrangements, to expand existing facilities or to maintain inefficient facilities, or in a
           reduction of the Group’s sales volumes.

       -   Significant volatility in financial markets (including exchange rate volatility) and measures
           adopted by governments and central banks that further restrict liquidity, which may limit
           the Group’s access to funds, lead to shortages of cash and cash equivalents needed to
           operate the Group’s business, and impact the Group’s ability to refinance its existing
           debt.

      All of these factors may have material adverse effects on the Group’s results of operations and
      financial condition.

APPENDIX A

PRINCIPAL GROUP RISKS

Overview

The principal risks that may affect the Group are set out on the following pages.

Each risk is considered in the context of the Group’s strategy and business model, as set out in this
Strategic Report on pages 8 to 9, and 22 to 23. Following a description of each risk, its potential
impact and management by the Group is summarised. Clear accountability is attached to each risk
through the risk owner.

The Group has identified risks and is actively monitoring and taking action to manage the risks. This
section focuses on those risks that the Directors believe to be the most important after assessment
of the likelihood and potential impact on the business. Not all of these risks are within the control of
the Group and other risks besides those listed may affect the Group’s performance. Some risks may
be unknown at present. Other risks, currently regarded as less material, could become material in
the future.

The risks listed in this section and the activities being undertaken to manage them should be
considered in the context of the Group’s internal control framework. This is described in the section
on risk management and internal control in the corporate governance statement on pages 87 to 88.
This section should also be read in the context of the cautionary statement on page 298.

A summary of all the risk factors (including the principal risks) which are monitored by the Board
through the Group’s risk register is set out in the Additional disclosures section on pages 272 to 286.

Assessment of Group Risk

During the year, the Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks,
uncertainties and emerging risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

The principal risks facing the Group have remained broadly unaltered over the past year with
regards to marketplace, excise and tax, operations, regulation and litigation risks.

The viability statement below provides a broader assessment of long-term solvency and liquidity.
The Directors have considered a number of factors that may affect the resilience of the Group.
Except for the risk ‘injury, illness or death in the workplace’ the Directors have also assessed the
potential impact of the principal risks that may impact the Group’s viability.

Viability Statement

The Board has assessed the viability of the Group taking into account the current position and
principal risks, in accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. While
the Board believes the Group will be viable over a longer period, owing to the inherent uncertainty
arising due to ongoing litigation and regulation, the period over which the Board has formed the
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as
they fall due is three years.

In making its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the Board has considered the Group’s continued
strong cash generation from operating activities. This assessment included a robust review of the
principal risks that may impact the Group’s viability (as indicated on pages 59 to 62) which are
considered, with the mitigating actions, at least once a year. The Board also took account of the
Group’s operational and financial processes, which cover both short-term (1-2 year financial
forecasts, 2-3 year capacity plans) and longer-term strategic planning. The assessment included
reverse stress testing core drivers that underpin the specific risks to ensure the business is able to
continue in operation, while not breaching the required gross interest cover of 4.5 times (see page
48). Each impact would, individually, have to be between 5 times and 10 times worse than a prudent
annual forecast, or would all have to arise simultaneously with no mitigating or corrective actions to
affect the Group’s ability to meet the liabilities as they fall due.

Due to the level of borrowings carried on the balance sheet, the Group may be exposed to
movements in interest rates. The Board noted that, as stated in note 22 in the Notes on the
Accounts, the Group sets a minimum of 50% of interest rate as fixed on short- to medium-term
borrowings, minimising the risk of interest rate fluctuation impacting viability over the period. At 31
December 2019, the ratio of floating to fixed rate borrowings was 18:82 (2018: 21:79).

The Board noted that the Group would be able to adjust certain capital requirements, including but
not limited to the investment in the Group’s manufacturing infrastructure in the short term and
access the £6 billion credit facility (2019 undrawn), to mitigate the impact of the effect of the above
principal risks, each of which have specific mitigation activities as disclosed on pages 59 to 62.

The Group is subject to inherent uncertainties with regards to regulatory change and litigation, the
outcome of which may have a bearing on the Group’s viability. The Group maintains, as referred to
in note 27 in the Notes on the Accounts ‘Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments’, that,
while it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case, the defences of the Group’s
companies to all the various claims are meritorious on both law and the facts. If an adverse
judgment is entered against any of the Group’s companies in any case, an appeal may be made, the
duration of which can be reasonably expected to last for a number of years.

Differences in translation between earnings and net debt may affect key ratios used by credit rating
agencies.
Volatility and/or increased costs in our business, due to transactional FX, may adversely impact
financial performance.

Mitigation activities
While translational FX exposure is not hedged, its impact is identified in results presentations and
financial disclosures; earnings are re-stated at constant rates for comparability.
Debt and interest are matched to assets and cash flows to mitigate volatility where possible and
economic to do so.

approved by the Board.
Illiquid currencies of many markets where hedging is either not possible or uneconomic are
reviewed on a regular basis.

The Group has a number of transactions and relationships with related parties, as defined in IAS 24
Related Party Disclosures, all of which are undertaken in the normal course of business. Transactions
with CTBAT International Limited (a joint operation) are not included in these disclosures as the
results are immaterial to the Group.

Transactions and balances with associates relate mainly to the sale and purchase of cigarettes and
tobacco leaf. The Group’s share of dividends from associates, included in other net income in the
table below, was £239 million (2018: £211 million; 2017: £688 million).

As explained in note 23, in 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of RAI
not already owned. This transaction has not been included in the table above.

On 17 December 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, BATUS Japan Inc. (BATUSJ), entered
into an Amendment and Extension Agreement (referred to as the Amendment) with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of RAI, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (referred to as RJRTC). The Amendment modifies
the American-blend Cigarette Manufacturing Agreement (referred to as the 2010 Agreement),
effective as of 1 January 2010.

Prior to the Amendment, the term of the 2010 Agreement was scheduled to expire on 31 December
2014, subject to early termination and extension provisions. Pursuant to the Amendment, the
Manufacturing Agreement would remain in effect beyond 31 December 2014, provided that either
RJRTC or BATUSJ may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement by furnishing three years’ notice to
the other party. Such notice was given in January 2016. As a result of early termination of this
agreement the Group agreed to a compensation payment of US$90 million of which US$7 million
was paid to RJRTC on 22 September 2016, with the Group recognising the full expense of US$90
million as required by IFRS in 2016. The balance was paid in March 2017.
During 2019, the Group acquired 60% of VapeWild Holdings LLC and a minority stake in AYR Limited.
The Group also made a capital injection in Brascuba Cigarillos S.A..

During 2018, the Group acquired a further 44% interest in British American Tobacco Myanmar
Limited and a further 11% interest in British American Tobacco Vranje.

During 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 49% interest in IPRESS d.o.o. and a further 0.01%
interest in British American Tobacco Chile Operaciones S.A. The combined costs are less than £1
million.

As explained in note 11, contributions to the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund are secured
by a charge over the Group’s Head Office (Globe House) up to a maximum of £150 million.

The key management personnel of British American Tobacco consist of the members of the Board of
Directors of British American Tobacco p.l.c. and the members of the Management Board. No such
person had any material interest during the year in a contract of significance (other than a service
contract) with the Company or any subsidiary company. The term key management personnel in this
context includes their close family members.

                                                                                          2019           2018      2017

APPENDIX C

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

The responsibility statement set out below is solely for the purpose of complying with Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rule 6.3.5R. This statement relates to and is extracted from the 2019
Annual Report. Responsibility is for the full 2019 Annual Report and not the extracted information
presented in this announcement and the Preliminary Announcement. We confirm that to the best
of our knowledge:

•      the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting
       standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss
       of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and

•      the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair review of the development and
       performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included
       in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and
       uncertainties that they face.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking”
statements made within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such
as “believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,”
“predict,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook”, “target” and
similar expressions. These include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current
expectations concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances occurring from
time to time in the countries and markets in which the Group operates.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks,
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and
results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results expressed in the forward-
looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data within this announcement. Among the
key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-
looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit
trade; the impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in
domestic or international tax laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax
authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of such
outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or international
economic or political conditions (including as a result of COVID-19); adverse decisions by domestic or
international regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer down-trading;
translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness
or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the
current capital structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver New Category strategy;
and changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of the Group.

It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be
affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently anticipated. Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing
advice should consult an independent financial adviser. The forward-looking statements reflect
knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the
Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this
communication should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or
future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share
of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F
filed on 26 March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at

  £1bn efficiencies to fuel New Category investment and delivery against our financial guidance

   Stretching new ESG ambitions including 50 million non-combustible product consumers and
                                   carbon neutrality by 2030


Chief Executive of British American Tobacco p.l.c., Jack Bowles, and members of the management
team, will today host a capital markets update via webcast.

This will provide an update on BAT’s three clear priorities to:

    •   Drive value from combustibles
    •   Ensure a step change in New Categories performance
    •   Simplify the business

In 2019, we made good progress on these priorities. We delivered against our financial guidance
with a strong operational performance and cash generation driving deleveraging of the balance
sheet. This was achieved while investing significant additional resources into New Categories to drive
revenue growth and build the capabilities required for long-term success. During 2019, we recruited
over 300 new specialist management hires, and women now represent 37% of the management
population. This has injected new capabilities and diverse skillsets including digital, product
development, science and design. With these strong foundations we remain confident in our ability
to deliver.

As we continue to become a stronger, simpler and faster organisation we are announcing:

    •   An ambition to satisfy evolving consumer preferences and recapture moments through a
        focused portfolio of products that offer sensorial enjoyment for a variety of moods and
        moments, leveraging our unique multi-category consumer insights platform (PRISM)
    •   £1bn of efficiencies over the next three years from an extended project Quantum, our
        simplification program that will fuel New Category investment and delivery against our
        financial guidance
    •   The creation of open innovation and corporate venture teams to assess, test and ultimately
        accelerate the development of products, including beyond nicotine, that leverage our
        proven delivery technologies.

These underpin our new corporate purpose: to build A Better Tomorrow by reducing the health
impact of our business through offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products for our
consumers.

Jack Bowles, Chief Executive, British American Tobacco said:

“I am pleased that our organisation fully embraced the priorities I set out in early 2019 and has
started to deliver against them. We are now challenging ourselves with a clear purpose to build A
Better Tomorrow by reducing the health impact of our business through offering a greater choice of
enjoyable and less risky products for our consumers.

Today we underscore our commitment to our new sustainability agenda by announcing stretching
new targets across the ESG landscape. Our ambition is to have 50 million non-combustible product
consumers by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, while bringing forward our existing
2030 environmental targets to 2025. The importance of this agenda, and communicating our
progress against it, is reflected in our new organisational structure, with the ESG and
Communications functions now reporting to Kingsley Wheaton, Chief Marketing Officer.

To achieve our ambitions, we need to be bold, fast, empowered, responsible and diverse. As we drive
value from our combustibles business, and generate £1billion in efficiencies over the next three years
through an extended Quantum simplification programme, we can accelerate the revenue growth of
our New Categories business.

Looking forward, we will drive the implementation of our strategy and deliver on our financial
guidance through the framework of our three clear priorities. We are on a journey and these are
exciting times at BAT. I very much look forward to sharing our plans”.

2020 Outlook

COVID-19 is developing rapidly. We are fortunate that our business is resilient and is supported by a
geographically diversified supply chain from both a manufacturing and distribution standpoint. As
yet, we have seen no material impact.

As previously stated, New Category revenue growth in the first half of the year will be difficult and,
although supply chains in China are recovering, we have postponed certain launches and we are
seeing some disruption in activation. Nevertheless, in 2020 we expect to make further progress
towards our ambition of £5bn New Category revenue in 2023/24.

Although we have seen limited impact to date on consumer demand for cigarettes (outside the Duty
Free channel, which is not material), we continue to monitor the situation closely. At present we are
maintaining our expectations for 2020 global industry cigarette and THP volume to be down c.4%
and, while year to date US industry volume contraction has been c.1% more benign than last year
(YTD to February c.-4%), we retain our Full Year 2020 US industry volume decline forecast of c.5%,
given the rapidly changing environment.

Overall, despite the global uncertainty, the business is performing well, and we have already
achieved close to 60% of the pricing we planned for 2020. At this stage, we maintain our guidance
for constant currency adjusted revenue growth of 3-5%, together with an improvement in operating
margin, and are confident of another year of high single figure constant currency adjusted diluted
EPS growth. With strong operating cashflow conversion in excess of 90%, we expect to continue to
delever the balance sheet and remain committed to a 65% dividend pay-out ratio on adjusted
diluted EPS and growth in sterling terms. Extrapolating yesterday’s foreign exchange spot rates for
the full year, we would now expect a headwind of less than 1% on full year adjusted diluted EPS
growth, although exchange rates are clearly very changeable.

Forward looking statements
This announcement does not constitute an invitation to underwrite, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire or
dispose of any British American Tobacco p.l.c. (""BAT"") shares or other securities. This announcement contains
certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking” statements made within the meaning of
Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, regarding our intentions, beliefs or current
expectations concerning our year-end results as well as, amongst other things, our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances
occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the Group operates.

These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,”
“anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook,” “target” and similar expressions.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors. It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they
may be affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently anticipated.

Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-
looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the
impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international
tax laws and rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area; adverse
litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of such outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or
differences in domestic or international economic or political conditions; adverse decisions by domestic or
international regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational
and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the
workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business under the current capital structure;
the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver the New Categories strategy; and changes in the market
position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Group.
Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an
independent financial adviser. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at
the date of preparation of this announcement and BAT undertakes no obligation to update or revise these
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this
communication should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future
financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed on or about
26 March 2020 and Current Reports on Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website,
http://www.sec.gov, and the Company’s Annual Reports, which may be obtained free of charge from the

Quarterly Dividends for the year ended 31 December 2019: Payment No. 1 – May 2020 (the “May
2020 Dividend”) South Africa Branch Register Finalisation Information

On 27 February 2020, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of
210.4p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 52.6p per ordinary
share in May 2020, August 2020, November 2020 and February 2021.

The May 2020 Dividend will be payable on 13 May 2020 to shareholders registered on either the UK
main register or the South Africa branch register on 27 March 2020 (the record date).

In accordance with the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listing Requirements, the finalisation information for the
May 2020 Dividend relating to shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register is set out
in the paragraphs below.

The salient dates and other dividend declaration information announced on 27 February 2020 remain
unchanged.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividend Rate

The British American Tobacco Group reports in sterling, therefore dividends are declared and
payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch register in South Africa whose dividends
are payable in rand. A rate of exchange of £:R = 20.11360 as at 13 March 2020 (the closing rate on
that date as quoted by Bloomberg), results in an equivalent May 2020 Dividend of 1057.97536 SA
cents per ordinary share.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividends Tax Information

South Africa Dividends Tax (at a rate of 20%), equivalent to 211.59507 SA cents per ordinary share,
will be withheld from the gross May 2020 Dividend paid to shareholders on the South Africa branch
register, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. After Dividends Tax has been withheld, the
net dividend will be 846.38029 SA cents per ordinary share. The May 2020 Dividend is regarded as a
‘foreign dividend’ for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax. For the purposes of South
Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the May 2020 Dividend is
the United Kingdom.

At the close of business on 13 March 2020 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of the
declaration of the South African rand equivalent of the May 2020 Dividend), the Company had a
total of 2,294,183,992 ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held
162,365,192 ordinary shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,456,549,184 ordinary
shares.
British American Tobacco p.l.c. is registered with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with tax
reference number 9378193172.

For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends Tax and the information provided above is of only direct
application to shareholders on the South Africa branch register. Shareholders on the South Africa
branch register should direct any questions regarding the application of Dividends Tax to

 Jack Bowles, Chief Executive said:
 “When I became CEO, my commitment was to maximise value growth from combustibles, deliver a step
 change in New Categories and develop a simpler, stronger, faster, more agile organisation to create a
 better tomorrow. I am delighted with the progress we have made in all areas. We have delivered value
 growth from our combustible business and grown our New Categories business, now providing potentially
 reduced risk products to close to 11 million consumers. In September, we announced a significant
 restructuring and simplification programme, which is largely complete. This will create the capabilities and
 resources to continue investing in New Categories and allow us to deliver on our financial commitments.
 Looking into 2020, we are confident of another year of high single figure adjusted constant currency
 earnings growth.”

 Key highlights, at current rates unless otherwise stated:
 • Reported diluted EPS of 249.0p down 5.4%, impacted by a number of adjusting items discussed below;
 • Adjusted diluted EPS of 323.8p up 9.1%, or 321.6p up 8.4% at constant rates;
 • Cigarette and THP volume share1 increased by 20 bps, with value share2 up 30bps in key markets;
 • New Categories revenue grew 36.9% or 32.4% to £1,214m at constant rates with strong growth in all
    categories, despite the slowdown in US vapour. Excluding US vapour, New Categories revenue grew
    39% at constant rates;
 • Reported revenue of £25,877m (up 5.7%);
 • Adjusted revenue of £25,827m (up 6.2%), or £25,683m on a constant currency basis (up 5.6%);
 • Reported profit from operations of £9,016m down 3.2% driven by adjusting items of £2,114m (2018:
    £1,034m) partly due to the charges incurred in respect of Canada (Quebec), Quantum (simplification
    programme), other smoking and health litigation including Engle in the US, Russia (excise dispute) and
    Indonesia (goodwill impairment), the majority of which are non-cash items;
 • Adjusted profit from operations of £11,130m (up 7.6%), an increase of 6.6% on a constant currency
    basis;
 • Reported operating margin declined 320 bps to 34.8%, largely due to the adjusting items;
 • Adjusted operating margin up 50 bps with significantly increased investment in New Categories;
 • At constant rates of exchange, the US delivered a strong year with adjusted revenue up 4.4%, value
    share up 30 bps and adjusted profit from operations up 6.4%;
• Operating cash flow conversion was 97%, with adjusted cash generated from operations down 16.3%
  (on a constant currency basis). Normalising for the timing of the 2018 MSA payment, ACGFO increased
  1.2%;
• Free cash flow after dividends of £1,921m drove deleveraging of 0.5x to 3.5x (0.4x at constant rates);
  and
• Dividend up 3.6% to 210.4p, in line with our commitment to a 65% pay-out ratio of adjusted diluted
  EPS.

BOARD SUCCESSION
The Board considers the length of service of the Directors of the Board as a whole and the need for
membership to be refreshed progressively is kept under regular review.

During 2018 and 2019, the Nominations Committee prioritised effective succession planning for the Chief
Executive and the Finance Director. Having overseen the orderly transition for both those roles, the
Nominations Committee has focused on succession planning for the role of Chairman, mindful of the
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and that Richard Burrows has served as a Director
for just over ten years.

To facilitate the ongoing succession process and to best serve the interests of the Company’s
shareholders, it is intended that Mr Burrows will retire from the Board at or prior to the Annual General
Meeting in 2021 and will continue to lead the Board in the interim. Accordingly, the Board will be
proposing Mr Burrows for re-election as Chairman at the forthcoming 2020 Annual General Meeting.

Kieran Poynter will retire from the Board with effect from the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting
on 30 April 2020. Mr Poynter has served as a Non-Executive Director since July 2010, as Senior
Independent Director since October 2016, and is currently a member of the Audit and Nominations
Committees.

Dimitri Panayotopoulos will succeed Mr Poynter as the Company’s Senior Independent Director with
effect from the conclusion of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Mr Panayotopoulos has also taken over
responsibility for leading the process for succession planning for the role of Chairman. Mr Panayotopoulos
has served as a Non-Executive Director since February 2015, is the Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee and is a member of the Nominations Committee.

OTHER INFORMATION

DIVIDENDS

Declaration
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 210.4p per ordinary share of 25p, for the year ended 31
December 2019, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 52.60p per ordinary share in May 2020,
August 2020, November 2020 and February 2021. This represents an increase of 3.6% on 2018 (2018:
203.0p per share), and a payout ratio, on 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share, of 65.0%.

The quarterly dividends will be paid to shareholders registered on either the UK main register or the
South Africa branch register and to holders of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), each on the applicable
record dates set out under the heading ‘Key Dates’ below.

South Africa Branch Register
In accordance with the JSE Limited (JSE) Listing Requirements, the finalisation information relating to
shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register (comprising the amount of the dividend in
South African rand, the exchange rate and the associated conversion date) will be published on the dates
stated below, together with South Africa dividends tax information.
 The quarterly dividends are regarded as ‘foreign dividends’ for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends
 Tax. For the purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of
 the quarterly dividends is the United Kingdom.

 Holders of ADSs
 For holders of ADSs listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the record dates and payment dates
 are set out below. The equivalent quarterly dividends receivable by holders of ADSs in US dollars will be
 calculated based on the exchange rate on the applicable payment date. A fee of US$0.005 per ADS will be
 charged by Citibank, N.A. in its capacity as depositary bank for the BAT American Depositary Receipt
 (“ADR”) programme in respect of each quarterly dividend payment.

 General dividend information
 Under IFRS, the dividend is recognised in the year that it is approved by shareholders or, if declared as an
 interim dividend by directors, in the period that it is paid.

 During the year, as an outcome of the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) review of the Group’s 2018
 Annual Report and Accounts, the Group received correspondence related to a number of areas, including
 the accounting treatment for interim dividends. It was agreed that the recognition of an accrual at the
 year-end in respect of the dividend paid in February 2018 and February 2019 was incorrect. Accordingly,
 from 1 January 2019, the Group has revised the treatment to recognise the interim dividends in the
 period in which they are paid. The review conducted by the FRC was based solely on the Group’s
 published report and accounts and does not provide any assurance that the report and accounts are
 correct in all material respects.

 The cash flow, prepared in accordance with IFRS, reflects the total cash paid in the period, amounting to
 £4,598 million (2018: £4,347 million) and was unaffected by the change.
                                                                       2019                             2018

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements, including “forward-looking” statements made within the
 meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are often, but not always,
 made through the use of words or phrases such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “intend,”
 “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “outlook”, “target” and
 similar expressions. These include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, amongst
other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and
business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the Group operates.

All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals,
expectations and results expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data within this
announcement. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the
impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international tax laws and
rates and the impact of an unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area; adverse litigation and dispute
outcomes and the effect of such outcomes on the Group’s financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or
international economic or political conditions; adverse decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact
of market size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the
impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings and to fund the business
under the current capital structure; the inability to develop, commercialise and deliver New Category products; and
changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Group.

It is believed that the expectations reflected in this announcement are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range
of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Past performance is no
guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser. The forward-
looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this announcement and the
Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements.

No statement in this communication is intended to be a profit forecast and no statement in this communication should be
interpreted to mean that earnings per share of BAT for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or
exceed the historical published earnings per share of BAT.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed on 15 March 2019 and Current Reports on
Form 6-K, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov, and the Company’s Annual
Reports, which may be obtained free of charge from the British American Tobacco website www.bat.com.

        BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO WELCOMES FDA GUIDANCE AS A FURTHER STEP TOWARD A
               SUSTAINABLE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE US VAPOUR MARKET

    -    British American Tobacco (BAT) welcomes the U.S. FDA's acknowledgment that a properly
         regulated vapour category continues to provide a credible alternative to smoking

    -    Appropriate enforcement will ensure the sustainability of adult consumer choice across all
         product categories

    -    BAT's U.S. subsidiary, Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), stands ready to comply with the new flavour
         guidelines

    -    RAI has already submitted its first brand PMTA application and is well positioned to make further
         applications for the rest of its vapour portfolio ahead of the May 2020 deadline

    -    RAI is confident that, as required by the PMTA process, all VUSE products will be shown to be
         appropriate for the protection of public health


British American Tobacco (BAT) welcomes the U.S. FDA's acknowledgement that a properly regulated
vapour category continues to provide a credible alternative to smoking, whilst also highlighting the
important issue of preventing the access and appeal of vapour products to youth. Following a significant
period of disruption and uncertainty, this regulatory clarity is a welcome step towards returning the US
vapour market to stability.

British American Tobacco Chief Executive Officer, Mr Jack Bowles noted:
     ""Yesterday's announcement takes us a step closer to a predictable regulatory environment in a key
     marketplace, but focus must now shift to enforcement to ensure vapour market regulations are
     effective.

    ""We have long said it is not the marketing of these products per se that is the concern, it is the
    irresponsible marketing of them that should be robustly addressed. For us, smart regulatory
    frameworks partnered with responsible marketing and appropriate enforcement will ensure the
    sustainability of adult consumer choice across all categories.""

The guidance the FDA has provided, together with the previously announced requirement to submit
PMTAs by May 2020 for all products, is a positive step and will help ensure consumers have access to
appropriately regulated, quality-assured products that do not appeal to or are accessible to youth.

Importantly, the guidance is clear that flavours can return to the market place once they have been
cleared through the PMTA process.

Mr Bowles continued:

    ""Millions of adult tobacco consumers are looking for an alternative to cigarettes and it's important
    to remember that properly regulated flavours can play an important role in the choice of adult
    tobacco consumers to transition to vapour products as an alternative to cigarettes.""

    ""Our US subsidiary, RAI Group, has already submitted one brand PMTA for VUSE Solo and is well
    positioned to submit applications for the remaining VUSE portfolio ahead of the deadline of May
    2020. We are confident that, as required by the PMTA process, all VUSE products will be shown to be
    appropriate for the protection of public health.""

BAT has long argued for sustainable regulatory frameworks for its new category products. BAT believes
in providing adult consumers with vapour systems that are hard to adulterate; providing new category
products which are supported by world class science and product stewardship; offering a range of
flavours which ensure adult consumer satisfaction whilst not appealing to youth; and marketing
freedoms to drive category adoption among adult consumers.

Mr Bowles concluded:
   ""We will continue to work with the U.S. FDA throughout the implementation of this new regulatory
   framework to make sure consumers have access to quality-assured products whilst doing our utmost
   to ensure that vaping remains positioned as a credible option for smokers looking for an alternative
   to tobacco.""

South Africa Branch Register Finalisation Information

On 28 February 2019, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of
203.0p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 50.75p per ordinary
share in May 2019, August 2019, November 2019 and February 2020.

The February 2020 Dividend will be payable on 6 February 2020 to shareholders registered on either
the UK main register or the South Africa branch register on 27 December 2019 (the record date).

In accordance with the JSE Limited (""JSE"") Listing Requirements, the finalisation information for the
February 2020 Dividend relating to shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register is set
out in the paragraphs below.

The salient dates and other dividend declaration information announced on 28 February 2019 remain
unchanged for the February 2020 Dividend.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividend Rate

The British American Tobacco Group reports in sterling, therefore dividends are declared and
payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch register in South Africa whose dividends
are payable in rand. A rate of exchange of P:R 19.53720 as at 10 December 2019 (the closing rate on
that date as quoted by Bloomberg), results in an equivalent February 2020 Dividend of 991.51290 SA
cents per ordinary share.

South Africa Branch Register: Dividends Tax Information

South Africa Dividends Tax (at a rate of 20%), equivalent to 198.30258 SA cents per ordinary share,
will be withheld from the gross February 2020 Dividend paid to shareholders on the South Africa
branch register, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. After Dividends Tax has been
withheld, the net dividend will be 793.21032 SA cents per ordinary share. The February 2020
Dividend is regarded as a  foreign dividend' for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax. For
the purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the
February 2020 Dividend is the United Kingdom.

At the close of business on 10 December 2019 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of the
declaration of the South African rand equivalent of the February 2020 Dividend), the Company had a
total of 2,293,867,380 ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held
162,645,590 ordinary shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,456,512,970 ordinary
shares.
British American Tobacco p.l.c. is registered with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with tax
reference number 9378193172.

For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends Tax and the information provided above is of only direct
application to shareholders on the South Africa branch register. Shareholders on the South Africa
branch register should direct any questions regarding the application of Dividends Tax to

Trading update - ahead of closed period commencing 1 January 2020
The business continues to perform well and we expect:
- A strong financial performance on an adjusted basis
- A good performance from Combustibles, with strong price mix and share gains
- Strong results in the US
- Growing share and good revenue growth in New Categories in second half (H2)
- FY New Category constant currency revenue growth at the lower end of our range of 30-50%, reflecting
    the recent slowdown in the US vapour market
- De-leveraging in line with our guidance

Jack Bowles, Chief Executive:

""We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2019, building on the good progress we made in the first half. Our
focus on our global strategic brands is delivering share gains and strong price mix in combustibles, both globally
and in the US. Increased investment and new product launches are delivering good New Category revenue growth
in H2, despite the recent slowdown in the US vapour market. We believe that the issues around vaping in the US
should lead to a better and stronger regulatory environment in which we are well placed to succeed. In summary,
we are delivering on our priorities. We are driving value growth in combustibles, we are investing to deliver a step
change in New Categories and we are transforming the business to create a stronger, simpler, more agile BAT.
We are on track for a strong year.""

The business continues to perform well and we expect:
A strong financial performance on an adjusted basis
- FY constant currency adjusted revenue growth in the upper half of our 3-5% long term guidance range
- FY adjusted operating margin improvement of 50-100bps while delivering substantial additional investment
    behind New Categories

    range
- FY high single figure constant currency adjusted diluted EPS growth, with a currency translation tailwind of
    around 1.2%, and a headwind of around 2% for 2020*

A good performance from Combustibles, with strong price mix and share gains
- No change to expectations for global industry volumes, down around 3.5% for the FY
- BAT FY volumes to be broadly in line with the industry, after adjusting for the continued impact of Egypt and
   Venezuela and a 60bps impact from a one-off stock reduction in Russia
- Corporate value share up 20bps YTD, driven by the Strategic Brands, up 55bps YTD
- Corporate volume share up over 10bps YTD, with Strategic Brands up 60bps YTD
- FY combustible price mix in excess of 7%

Strong results in the US
- Strong constant currency revenue growth in line with the 3-5% Group guidance range, supported by good
   pricing and reduced discounting
- No change to 2019 expectations for FY US industry volumes, down around 5.5%. Expect between 4-6% in
   2020
- Continued strong value share performance, with corporate value share up 30bps YTD, and premium share up
   50bps YTD, driven by Natural American Spirit and Newport
- Strategic brands volume share up 20bps YTD; corporate volume share flat YTD
- Traditional Oral tobacco to deliver good constant currency revenue growth driven by pricing and share
   growth in moist snuff, up 90bps YTD

Growing share and good revenue growth in New Categories in H2
- In vapour, Vuse is growing value share in the US, with Vuse Alto value share up 840bps to 11.1% in October,
   with total Vuse family value share at 17.5%. Vype continues to grow value share, reaching 11.8% in the UK,
   up 260bps, and 19.2% in France, up 790bps in October, with ePod successfully launched in both markets. In
   Canada, Vype is the fastest growing brand, reaching a value share of 27.6%, up 570 basis points since July
- In THP, glo in Japan is holding volume share at 4.9% YTD in a competitive market. glo Pro and glo Nano
   launched successfully, with distribution building; glo Sens rollout began this month. Total nicotine corporate
   volume share in Japan is up 210bps to 18.4% YTD. Elsewhere, glo is now above 1% volume share in key cities
   in Eastern Europe, including Moscow
- In Modern Oral, Velo's rollout in the US has now expanded to 75k outlets and reaching a modern oral
   category volume share of 9.2%. LYFT/EPOK continue to grow, consolidating their leadership of the modern
   oral category outside the US
- FY New Category constant currency revenue growth at the lower end of our range of 30-50%, reflecting the
   slowdown in the US vapour market
- New Category constant currency revenue growth, excluding US vapour, to be around the middle of the range

De-leveraging in line with our guidance
- Adjusted Net debt**/adjusted EBITDA*** reducing by approximately 0.4x excluding the impact of FX

available-for-sale investments, excluding the impact of the revaluation of RAI acquired debt arising as part of the
purchase price allocation process.
*** Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined by IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is profit for the year before net finance
costs/income, taxation on ordinary activities, depreciation, amortisation, impairment costs, the Group's share of post-
tax results of associates and joint ventures, and other adjusting items.

Note on Non-GAAP Measures

This announcement contains several non-GAAP measures used by management to monitor the Group's
performance. For the non-GAAP information contained in this announcement, no comparable GAAP or IFRS
information is available on a forward-looking basis, as the effect of adjusting items and rates of exchange, which
could be significant, may be highly variable and cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty.

The Group's Management Board regularly reviews the measures used to assess and present the financial
performance of the Group and, as relevant, its geographic segments, and believes that these measures provide
additional useful information to investors. Certain of our measures are presented based on an adjusted basis and
on a constant currency basis. Please refer to the 2018 Annual Report on Form 20?F for a full description of each
measure, pages 258 to 266. Free cashflow after dividends is a new measure introduced from 1 January 2019, in
order to enhance the understanding of availability of cash generated after the payment of dividends.

The principal non-GAAP measures which the Group uses and that are contained in this announcement are
adjusted revenue, adjusted profit from operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are before the
impact of adjusting items and are reconciled from revenue, profit from operations and diluted earnings per
share, respectively. This announcement also contains New Category revenue, a non-GAAP measure reconciled
from revenue, and adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined as adjusted profit from operations
as a percentage of adjusted revenue.

This announcement also contains adjusted net debt and adjusted EBITDA. The Group uses adjusted net debt and
adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial capacity. The Management Board believes that these additional measures,
which are used internally, are useful to the users of the financial statements in helping them to see how business
financing has changed over the year.

Adjusting items, as identified in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, represent certain items of
income and expense which the Group considers distinctive based on their size, nature or incidence. These
include significant items in revenue, profit from operations, net finance costs, taxation and the Group's share of
the post?tax results of associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are
relevant to an understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance. Although the Group does not
believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe such results excluding
the impact of adjusting items provide additional useful information to investors regarding the underlying
performance of the business on a comparable basis.
The Group's management reviews a number of our IFRS and non?GAAP measures for the Group and its
geographic segments at constant rates of exchange. This allows comparison of the Group's results, had they
been translated at the previous year's average rates of exchange. The Group does not adjust for the normal
transactional gains and losses in operations that are generated by exchange movements. Although the Group
does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such
results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year?on?year provide additional useful information to
