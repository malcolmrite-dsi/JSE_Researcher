NASPERS’S SUBSIDIARY PROSUS ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF SHARE REPURCHASE AND SHARE PURCHASE


Shareholders are referred to the announcement issued by Naspers’s subsidiary Prosus N.V.
(Prosus) today in respect of the launch of:

   •   an on-market Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion
       from its free-float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

   •   an on-market Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of
       up to US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
       Transaction).

The board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) is of the view that the Transaction is,
among other things, an investment in the group’s current strong internet portfolio, which is
a sensible use of capital given full market valuations in consumer tech M&A, and the sizeable
discount to the group’s net asset value (NAV). Prosus has a track record of generating good
returns by investing across the consumer internet space. Prosus also takes a long-term
approach to capital allocation across its operations, investments, and this approach now
extends to its asset base – directly and indirectly via its own stock. The Prosus Board believes
that the Transaction will generate value for its shareholders.

Prosus has appointed intermediaries to execute the Transaction within parameters set by it,
allowing the execution of (re)purchases in the open market during open and closed periods.
These intermediaries will make their trading decisions independently from, and uninfluenced
by, Prosus and Naspers.

The Share Purchase will commence on 24 November 2020 and end on 26 November 2021, or
sooner if the maximum consideration under the Share Purchase is reached before then.

The Naspers N ordinary shares held by Prosus after having been purchased under the Share
Purchase will constitute treasury shares under the JSE Listings Requirements. Prosus intends
not to exercise any voting rights attaching to the Naspers N ordinary shares acquired under
the Share Purchase.

The Share Purchase will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law
and regulations, as well as the authorities granted by the general meeting of shareholders of
Naspers dated 21 August 2020, as it may be renewed.

The Share Purchase by Prosus constitutes a general repurchase of securities under the JSE
Listings Requirements and will be implemented accordingly.

Statement by the directors of Naspers

Having regard to the decision of the Prosus Board to implement the Share Purchase and after
considering the effects of the Transaction by Prosus, pursuant to the JSE Listings
Requirements the board of directors of Naspers states that:
                                                                                             
    -    Naspers and its group will be able, in the ordinary course of business, to pay their
         debts as they become due for a period of 12 months following the date of this
         announcement;

    -    the assets of Naspers and its group will be in excess of the liabilities of Naspers and
         its group for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement;

    -    the share capital and reserves of Naspers and its group will be adequate for ordinary
         business purposes for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement;

    -    the working capital of Naspers and its group will be adequate for ordinary business
         purposes for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement; and

    -    Naspers and its group have passed the solvency and liquidity test envisaged in the
         South African Companies Act, 2008, as amended, and since the test was performed
         there have been no material changes to the financial position of the Naspers group.

Interim results announcement
for the six months ended 30 September 2020

COMMENTARY
September 2020 marked the first anniversary of the listing of Prosus on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. 
This created Europe's largest consumer internet company and a new investment opportunity on the global technology 
stage, improving the group's access to international internet investors. A year on, ownership of Prosus continues 
to expand and diversify. The group's recent inclusion in Europe's leading index, the Euro Stoxx 50, is expected to 
attract additional European investor interest over time.

Given the wide geographical span of our operations and significant mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in
ecommerce, reported earnings are materially impacted by foreign exchange movements and the effects of acquisitions and
disposals. Where relevant in this report, we have adjusted for these effects. These adjustments (pro forma financial 
information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). 

The earnings for the period ended 30 September 2020 compared to 30 September 2019 are impacted by the contribution
from the Prosus group post its listing and creation of the free float resulting in a significant non-controlling 
interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of the earnings compared to 72.66% in the 
current period.

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which include consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The group delivered good results for the first six months ended 30 September 2020, despite Covid-19. Group revenue,
measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$13.0bn, reflecting growth of 27% (32%), a meaningful acceleration of 16pp
(12pp) over the same period last year. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (52%) year on year. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy
27% (28%). Group trading profit grew 38% (42%) to US$2.6bn. Tencent's contribution to the group's trading profit
improved 31% (32%).  

Core headline earnings were US$1.6bn - down 6% (5%). Core headline earnings are largely impacted by reduced earnings
contributions in the current year from the Prosus group, post its listing in September 2019 and the creation of the free
float resulting in a significant non-controlling interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of
the Prosus earnings compared to 72.66% in the current period. The non-controlling interest share in the core headline
earnings for the period is US$591m. We refer shareholders to the separate Prosus condensed consolidated interim financial
statements which are free of the impacts outlined in this paragraph and outline the good increases in headline earnings
and core headline earnings delivered by the group's operations. We remind shareholders that Prosus represents most of 
the group's operations. Overall, core headline earnings reflect strong performance of the group, driven by improved
profitability from our Ecommerce units and the growing contribution from Tencent.

We ended the period with a strong and liquid balance sheet. We had a net cash position of US$4.6bn, comprising
US$10.3bn in cash and cash equivalents (including short-term cash investments), net of US$5.7bn in interest-bearing debt
(excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We hold an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded 
net interest expense for the period of US$41m. 

In July 2020, Prosus, Naspers's 72.66%-owned subsidiary, successfully raised more than US$2bn in debt, comprising its
longest-dated US dollar offering to date and its debut euro notes offering. The offerings drew strong investor demand,
resulting in attractive pricing that reduced the group's average funding cost while extending the blended maturity
profile of its outstanding notes to almost 12 years. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including
future M&A activity, and to further augment the company's liquidity. Issuances consisted of 2050 US$1bn 4.027% notes, 
2028 Euro500m 1.593% notes and 2032 Euro500m 2.031% notes. The group has no debt maturities due until 2025. 

Consolidated free cash inflow was US$292m, a significant improvement on the prior year's free cash inflow of US$19m.
This reflects growth in our Ecommerce unit's profitability, dividends received from Tencent of US$458m (2019: US$377m)
and improved working capital management. 

There were no new or amended accounting pronouncements effective from 1 April 2020 with a significant impact on the
group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Effective 1 April 2020, the group made a voluntary change to its accounting policy on the subsequent measurement of
written put option arrangements with non-controlling shareholders. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of put option
liabilities previously recognised in the income statement in ""Other finance income/(costs) - net"" are now recognised
through equity. We believe the change in accounting policy will provide more relevant information about the effects of
underlying transactions with non-controlling shareholders. Written put option arrangements are considered equity
transactions because the settlement with non-controlling shareholders does not result in losing control over a subsidiary.
Furthermore, on initial recognition of the written put option liability, the group simultaneously recognises the 
non-controlling interest because the risks and rewards of ownership are not deemed to have transferred to the group 
until the written put option liability is settled. 

The group has adopted this change in accounting policy retrospectively, however, the impact is insignificant to the
consolidated statement of financial position as all previous remeasurements recognised through the income statement 
are already accumulated in equity as at the effective date of the change. The previous remeasurements accumulated in 
retained earnings have been reclassified to the ""existing control business combination reserve"". Consequently, comparative
figures on the statement of financial position have been restated for the reclassification between retained earnings and 
other reserves. The carrying value of the written put option liabilities and the total equity of the group in the comparative
periods remain unchanged. The condensed consolidated income statement and finance income/costs note have been restated
for the remeasurement of written put option liabilities as these are now recognised directly in equity. 

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this interim results
announcement.

We continue to explore growth opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and position the business
for sustainable growth. In our Classifieds segment, we merged letgo and OfferUp, resulting in a business with national
reach across the United States (US), well positioned for growth in a highly competitive market. The merger included a new
US$120m investment round led by Prosus. Furthermore, we injected our Middle Eastern Classifieds assets into Emerging
Markets Property Group (EMPG) and participated in a US$150m financing round that valued the business at over US$1bn. OLX
Brazil has subsequently completed the US$520m (BRL2.9bn) acquisition of leading real estate vertical Grupo ZAP, announced
in March 2020. In our Payments and Fintech segment, we made an additional investment of US$53m in Remitly to expand its
footprint in the US, United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. We participated in Mail.ru's capital raise to fund growth
initiatives, investing US$25m. Finally, we are focused on increasing our exposure to edtech (educational technology) by 
investing US$60m in Eruditus, a global professional higher-education online platform. In November we announced a total 
investment of US$500m in Churchill Capital Corp II's planned acquisition of Software Luxembourg Holding S.A. (Skillsoft) 
and Global Knowledge Training LLC (Global Knowledge). The transaction will create the world's leading digital learning 
company with a comprehensive suite of on-demand and live virtual content. 

COVID-19
We started the financial year in April 2020 responding to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has proven to be 
a global challenge. Despite the social and economic impact across the world, Naspers remained resilient and performed
well in the first half of the current financial year - accelerating revenue growth, improving profitability and cash 
flow generation, and growing customer numbers as consumers moved online. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (52%) year on 
year. Group trading profit grew 38% (42%). 

Like most companies, Naspers faced challenges, particularly in countries where government lockdown regulations were
extensive and protracted, reducing economic activity. We quickly implemented our contingency plans and we saw a sharp
recovery in all of our businesses as lockdown regulations began easing.

Throughout the crisis, we prioritised the health and wellbeing of our employees, safeguarded jobs as far as possible,
and protected and positioned our business for the long term. When necessary, we extended support to our partners to
ensure the supply chain remained strong, and donated to government Covid-19 response programmes. 

After the easing of lockdowns and curfews in many countries in the second quarter, almost all business activities have
resumed year-on-year growth. In addition, Tencent remained resilient throughout the pandemic and is performing well.
Unfortunately, a second Covid-19 wave is impacting some markets in which we operate, however, we remain confident that 
the plans we have put in place and our firm financial position will ensure that we manage the potential impacts going
forward. Longer term, we believe we will benefit from the acceleration of the underlying trends to online platforms 
which propel the growth of the consumer internet market, and we will ensure our businesses are positioned to emerge 
well from the crisis.

Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is finalising its condensed consolidated
interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2020.

As outlined in the table below, the Group is expected to deliver good results for the first half ended
30 September 2020 despite the impacts of Covid-19.

We have completed several acquisitions in the first six months and have continued to explore growth
opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and to position the business for
continued long-term growth.

More details will be published with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements on
Monday, 23 November 2020.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in earnings, headline earnings and core headline
earnings per share for the period ended 30 September 2019 as compared to 30 September 2020 in
the tables below:

                                                        30 September 2020

 Earnings per share(1)                   518                (34) – 3             (6.6%) – 0.6%
 Headline earnings per share(1)          326                  67 – 89             20.6% – 27.3%
 Core headline earnings* per             380                (28) – (5)           (7.4%) – (1.3%)
 share(1)

For the period ended 30 September 2020, the group’s earnings, headline earnings and core headline
earnings growth is impacted largely by reduced earnings contributions in the current year from the
Prosus Group, post its listing in September 2019 and the creation of the free-float resulting in a
significant non-controlling interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of the
Prosus earnings compared to 72.66% in the current period. The expected non-controlling interest
share in the core headline earnings for the period would be approximately US$600m. We refer
shareholders to the separate Prosus trading statement which is free of the impacts outlined in this
paragraph and outlines expected increases in headline earnings and core headline earnings of the
group’s operations. We remind shareholders that Prosus represents the majority of the group’s
operations.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator
of the operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline
earnings per share for the current period is expected to decrease by between 28 and 5 cents per share
(between 7.4% and 1.3%), driven mainly by the creation of the Prosus free float in September 2019
as described above. Adjusted for this, core headline earnings growth per share is expected to increase
in the same range as Prosus, between 23.8% - 30.5%, as illustrated in the Prosus trading statement.

Like most companies, in the period we faced some challenges due to Covid-19, particularly in countries
where government lockdown regulations were wide ranging and long lasting. However, we have seen
a sharp recovery in all of our impacted businesses as our contingency plans produced results once
lockdown regulations began easing. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation
to ensure we safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our
businesses for the long-term. While forward visibility remains difficult, given the challenges some
countries face in dealing with the longer-term effects of Covid-19, we continue to believe we will
benefit from the acceleration of the trends that have propelled the growth of the consumer internet.

Financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the company’s auditors.

*Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period, excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets, as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments and
unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) once-off gains and losses (including
acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses, as these items relate to changes in the composition of the group and are not
reflective of its underlying operating performance; and (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business combinations and acquisitions and (vi)
donations made to various governments in assisting with the Covid-19 pandemic, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments
are made to the earnings of combined businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent
that the information is available.

(1) Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.

NASPERS SUBSIDIARY PROSUS ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO ACQUIRE UP TO
US$5 BILLION OF NASPERS AND PROSUS SHARES

Shareholders are referred to the announcement issued by Naspers’s subsidiary Prosus N.V.
(Prosus) today in respect of its intention to implement:

    •    an on-market Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion
         from its free-float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

    •    an on-market Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of
         up to US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
         Proposed Transaction).

Prosus intends to launch the Proposed Transaction following the release of its results for the
six months ended 30 September 2020, expected to be announced on 23 November 2020.

The Share Purchase by Prosus constitutes a general repurchase of securities under the JSE
Listings Requirements and will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, the
relevant authorities granted by Naspers shareholders.

The board of directors of Naspers believes the purchase of Naspers N shares and the
repurchase of Prosus ordinary shares N represent a timely investment in the group’s strong
internet portfolio and a sensible use of capital given full market valuations evident in
consumer internet and the group’s sizeable consolidated discount to net asset value.

Summary of statements from the annual general meeting:


A transformational year
This was a truly transformational year: the successful listing of Prosus sets the company on a path to
generating even more value for our stakeholders in the future.


Clear focus and direction
For many years now, we have concentrated on creating value by improving people’s lives around the
world. At heart, we are entrepreneurs who want to make a positive impact. We do this through a
combination of being focused and disciplined, remaining open to opportunity and change, and always
looking to grow and create long-term sustainable value in a responsible way.


We continue to transform our group - investing in new and existing businesses and creating
innovative technology-enabled products and services. As ever, we focus on backing entrepreneurs,
technology and business concepts that meet fundamental human needs. This is at the core of how
we create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.


In our highly dynamic, fast changing, high-growth world, we never lose sight of our commitment to
good governance. We aim to conduct the group’s business with integrity, applying appropriate
corporate governance policies and principles. We are building on our commitment to sustainability
and we continually evaluate where to improve governance.


Strong performance
Naspers ended the year in a position of strength, with accelerating revenue in our e-commerce
portfolio, improved profitability and a substantial net cash position which provides us with ample
liquidity. This is an enviable position during normal times - but it is truly differentiating in today’s
climate. As the world continues to confront the global Covid-19 crisis, some core trends directly
related to our business are accelerating and solidifying. The data that we see shows that consumers
are consistently increasing their online activity and spending. We believe that this change is
structural, so as a 100% online business, we expect Prosus to emerge from the crisis even stronger.


                                                                                                      
Revenue grew 23% year on year, with e-commerce growing 32% to US$4.7 billion, a 6% acceleration
on last year. Profitability improved by (13%)17% even as we significantly stepped up our investment
in Food Delivery. Profitability was mainly driven by Classifieds and Payments & Fintech, which
remained profitable at the core. We are investing further to expand our ecosystem and routes in
both these segments. Excluding the increased investments in Food Delivery, and Payments and
Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals, ecommerce trading losses reduced by 24% or US$76m in
local currency.


Taking each of our core segments in turn: Classifieds grew revenues 48%(37%) year on year and
trading profit US$44 million despite the step up in the investment to build out our transaction
business, which is growing fast – up 282%(164%) year on year. Our Food Delivery business is scaling
driven by strong demand and order growth. We have also seen signs of improved efficiency and
customer acquisition. Revenue increased 99%(105%) to US$751 million. Trading losses increased to
US$624 million reflecting continued investment in growth. Turning to Payments & Fintech, PayU grew
revenue 19% (21%) year on year. In India, revenue grew even faster at 29%(31%) year over year.
India continues to be a key focus for Ventures - the underlying market drivers represent significant
potential. In the last financial year, we invested in Meesho and ElasticRun, and in the previous year
we invested in BYJU’S. So far, we have invested about US$855 million in our Ventures portfolio. Our
edtech investments, for example in BYJU’s and Brainly, are by a significant margin the largest in the
Ventures portfolio. Covid-19 is accelerating the demand and impact of edtech and this creates an
opportunity for us.


We had another good year with Tencent. The company continued to grow strongly. Our share of
Tencent revenue and trading profit grew 21% and 22% respectively.


Committed to our strategy
We remain firmly committed to our strategy – it is a real differentiator. We are active participants in
our investments and we have become increasingly close to our partners during the crisis, to ensure
we support them. Being both an operator and investor helps us to prioritise and share best practises
at a very concrete level. We always take a long-term view and our focus remains on building
sustainable leadership positions across our core segments. This is key to attaining profitability on a
                                                                                                     6
sustainable basis. Through the year, we invested US$1.3 billion in Food Delivery, Classifieds,
Payments & Fintech, and Ventures. We continue to be highly disciplined in our capital allocation.
During the year we considered over 5,000 potential deals and executed on 54. (We have also walked
away from high profile transactions where it was the right thing to do.)


Commitment to South Africa
Following the Prosus listing, Naspers is still the largest South African company on the JSE. We are one
of the foremost investors in the South African technology sector, with the country’s leading etailer
and its leading print and digital media business. Through Naspers Foundry we aim to invest R1.4bn in
the next generation of outstanding South African tech start-ups in the coming years. And Naspers
Labs is pioneering an innovative hyper-local programme to tackle youth unemployment.


We also continue to contribute significantly in terms of tax: in total, Naspers group paid R13.2bn in
taxes in South Africa during the year. In April 2020 we donated R1.5bn in emergency aid to the
government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis. This comprised R500m to the Solidarity Response Fund
announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, and R1bn of personal protective equipment and other
medical supplies, which we sourced in China, in partnership with the Chinese government and
Tencent, to support South Africa’s health workers. This included the logistics to fly the equipment to
South Africa and, in conjunction with the South African government, the distribution to medical
facilities across the country.


Aligning remuneration to performance and value creation
We aim to attract, motivate and retain the best people to create sustainable shareholder value. Our
people are at the heart of our success. We operate in a highly competitive global market for the
digital talent we need. To attract and retain the best and achieve our goals, we focus on pay for
performance, encourage ownership and an entrepreneurial spirit in our teams around the world, and
align management compensation with the creation of shareholder value over time.


As a strategic investor and operator we focus on long-term value creation by building leading
technology companies that improve people’s daily lives in high-growth markets. As a global consumer
internet group, we are one of the largest technology investors in the world. Our business moves fast


                                                                                                       
as technology trends and consumer adoption change, and we seek to run businesses that have broad
potential, can address big societal needs and can attain market leadership over time.
Our executives continue to be compensated based on both Naspers and Prosus performance.


This year, 60% of the longer-term incentive awards (LTIs) to senior executives will be made in
performance share units (PSUs), which will vest after three years only if key performance metrics are
met. PSUs, as part of our remuneration toolkit, including share options (SOs) and share appreciation
rights (SARs), create a truly balanced mix of LTIs with value-based performance hurdles that will help
drive the right longer-term outcomes for stakeholders.


Below the executive level, we are using restricted share units (RSUs) more broadly across the
organisation, to better align our compensation practices with our peers and increase opportunity for
employees to own shares in the company. RSUs will be complemented with SAR allocations on our
unlisted assets, to further align incentives to performance delivery and value creation.


Societal fairness is very important to us, particularly as we operate in developing economies where
socioeconomic disparity can be large. We take our responsibilities in that respect seriously and
ensure that our pay practices around the world are fair and competitive. And pay is an important
aspect, but not the only consideration. In general, our people join us because of the opportunity to
do meaningful work where they have the opportunity to make a difference, to learn and grow.


We will continue to engage closely with our stakeholders – listening and responding to feedback and
above all, focusing on strongly aligning our remuneration to Naspers’s strategy and performance.




                                                                                                    
Looking forward with confidence
Our core objectives are unchanged and strong market dynamics underpin our structural growth. We
are clear about where we are heading in the interests of our shareholders and all our stakeholders.
So, the fundamentals are strong and we have real momentum.

FINAL CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020,
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND PUBLICATION OF B-BBEE ANNUAL COMPLIANCE
CERTIFICATE

Dividend declaration

Further to the summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 as
released on SENS and the company’s website www.naspers.com, the board recommends an annual
gross dividend of 580 cents (2019: 715 cents) per listed N ordinary share, and 116 cents (2019: 143
cents) per unlisted A ordinary share.

In determining the proposed N ordinary share dividend, the board considered that shareholders who
held listed N ordinary shares last year at the time of listing Prosus would have received shares in Prosus
or additional shares in Naspers Limited. These, if they continued to hold those shares, would entitle
them to receive either an additional Prosus dividend of 11 euro cents (South African rand equivalent
to be determined at the time of payment, currently 213 South African cents, based on exchange rate
at 26 June 2020) per share, or dividends on their additional Naspers N ordinary shares received. The
combined Naspers and Prosus dividend represents an increase of around 10% on the prior-year
Naspers dividend per share. The Prosus summarised consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2020, final dividend declaration and details of the publication of the annual report
was released on SENS today, Monday, 29 June 2020, copies of which are available on the website
www.prosus.com.

If confirmed by shareholders at the annual general meeting on Friday 21 August 2020, dividends will
be payable to shareholders recorded in the books on Friday 27 November 2020 and paid on Monday
30 November 2020. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday 24 November 2020 (shares
trade ex-dividend from Wednesday 25 November 2020). Share certificates may not be dematerialised
or rematerialised between Wednesday 25 November 2020 and Friday 27 November 2020, both dates
inclusive. The dividend will be declared from income reserves.

It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, yielding a net dividend of 464 cents per listed N
ordinary share and 95.2 cents per unlisted A ordinary share to those shareholders not exempt from
paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 116 cents per listed N ordinary share and 20.8 cents per
unlisted A ordinary share.

The issued ordinary share capital as at 29 June 2020 was 435 511 058 N ordinary shares and 961 193
A ordinary shares. The company’s income tax reference number is 9550138714. All figures in South
African cents unless stated otherwise.
Distribution of integrated annual report and notice of annual general meeting

Shareholders are advised that the company’s integrated annual report (including the notice and proxy
of the annual general meeting) and annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 will
be posted on the company’s website www.naspers.com this evening, Monday 29 June 2020.

notice is hereby given that the 106th annual general meeting of the company will be held at 14:00 on

Commentary
The past financial year has seen the Naspers group transform as we executed several significant strategic initiatives,
which we believe will unlock value over time. Operationally, the group ended the year in a position of strength with
accelerating revenue growth in its ecommerce (online commerce) portfolio, improved profitability and a substantial net
cash position with sufficient liquidity. Underpinning these results, Tencent continued to report resilience in an uncertain
macro-environment. Most recently, the onset of a global pandemic has had a marked impact on the daily lives of people
globally and the economy at large. While the impact is likely to persist for some time, we are confident to weather the
storm. The group's focus is on safety, plus leveraging its financial flexibility to continue building a business that
grows strongly, generates high rates of return and provides employment for thousands over the long term. 

After many years of stock-price outperformance, Naspers now represents an outsized position on the JSE Limited's
shareholder weighted index (SWIX). To extend our shareholder base and reduce that outsized position, on 11 September
2019, we listed our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam as Prosus N.V. (Prosus). Prosus includes all
Naspers's operations and investments outside South Africa in online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech 
(financial technology), etail (online retail), travel, education, and social and internet platforms. As Europe's most 
valuable consumer internet company, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to our portfolio of international 
internet assets, as well as exposure to China, India and other high-growth markets. Prosus also has a secondary listing 
on the JSE Limited in South Africa. At the date of listing, Prosus was 73.84% owned by Naspers, with a free float of 26.16%. 
In January 2020, to fulfil an obligation to the South African Reserve Bank to repatriate US$1.5bn to South Africa, Naspers 
sold 22 million shares in Prosus, representing 1.35% of the issued Prosus N ordinary shares to institutional investors for 
gross proceeds of €1.5bn (US$1.64bn). Following the disposal, Prosus was 72.49% owned by Naspers with a free float of 27.51%.
We have no intention to sell additional shares of Prosus. 

All proceeds, net of expenses and costs, received by Naspers from this disposal were repatriated to South Africa as
required and used to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme. This was completed 
on 24 March 2020, with a total of 9 156 705 Naspers N ordinary shares being repurchased (representing 2.06% of the issued
Naspers N ordinary shares prior to the programme). A total of R22.4bn (US$1.4bn), including transaction costs, was paid
(representing an average cost of R2 447.11 per Naspers N ordinary share). The Naspers N ordinary shares repurchased have
been cancelled and delisted. We are pleased with the outcome which, through the sale of Prosus N ordinary shares with a
lower discount to net asset value and repurchase of Naspers N ordinary shares with a larger discount to net asset
value, realised around R3.3bn in shareholder value. As a result, Naspers had 435 511 058 N ordinary shares in issue at 
31 March 2020.

We ended the financial year facing the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets locking down in March 2020.
Our priority was the wellbeing of our 25 000 people and the communities we serve around the world. As a global company
operating in numerous local markets we take our responsibility seriously. We are helping our people and communities
navigate this crisis. In April 2020, we committed R1.5bn (US$84m) in emergency aid to the South African government's 
response to the crisis. We contributed R500m to the Solidarity Fund announced by the South African president, plus 
R1bn worth of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. This equipment was rapidly sourced - in partnership 
with the Chinese government and Tencent - to support South Africa's frontline health workers. It was delivered in multiple
shipments, with the final shipment delivered on 12 June 2020. Prosus also donated INR100crore (US$13m) to the Indian
government's response to the Covid-19 crisis via the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations 
Fund. In addition, at local level, many of our companies have made meaningful contributions. Across the group, we continue 
to identify ways in which our technological expertise, global networks and resources can be used to support the fight
against this virus. 

We will continue to respond quickly to the evolving situation to safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve
our customers and protect our businesses. While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular
growth trends, the global pandemic has affected operations and we need to draw attention to its potential impacts on 
2021's financial year. That said, we believe the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong. We have sufficient  
liquidity to run the company and the ability to invest in opportunities that may arise during this period.

Group revenue, measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$22.1bn, reflecting growth of 17% (23%) from continuing
operations. Measured similarly, and including the stepped-up investment in Food Delivery, group trading profit grew 
13% (17%) year on year to US$3.7bn. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy 16% (21%) year on year. Driven by Classifieds, 
Etail, and Payments and Fintech, the ecommerce business posted strong performance. Overall revenue growth in ecommerce,
adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, grew 32% in local currency, a 6% acceleration year on year. This was led by the 
Food Delivery segment, which grew orders 102% and revenues by 99% (105%), and strong growth in Classifieds, up 48% (37%).
Tencent's profitability improved 17% (22%). Trading losses in ecommerce rose to US$964m, reflecting our investment in 
Food Delivery to grow markets and sustain our leading positions. Excluding the increased investments in Food Delivery, 
and Payments and Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals, ecommerce trading losses reduced by 24% or US$76m in 
local currency.

Core headline earnings from continuing operations were US$2.9bn - down 5% (1%). Improving profitability in Tencent and
the more established ecommerce businesses were partially offset by increased taxation related to the Prosus investment.
Through listing Prosus and the subsequent sale of additional shares, minority shareholders with a 27.51% interest in
Prosus were introduced. This reduced the attributable share of Naspers shareholders in the Prosus core headline earnings
contribution for the year ended March 2020 by US$466m (2019: US$nil).

Across the group, we invested US$1.3bn to expand our ecosystem and reach. Notably: through PayU, an investment of
US$66m in Wibmo to expand our Indian footprint in payment security, mobile payment solutions and processing services; an
investment of US$163m in PaySense broadens our ecosystem in India as we now start to offer consumer credit, an investment
of US$199m in Iyzico, a leading payment service provider in Turkey, and US$48m in Red Dot Payment (Red Dot), providing
payment solutions in Singapore and expanding across Southeast Asia. In Classifieds, we acquired a controlling stake in
Frontier Car Group for US$320m and the contribution of certain subsidiaries, expanding our transactions business. Ventures
invested US$81m in Meesho Inc., a leading social commerce online marketplace in India, continuing our successful track
record of identifying Indian opportunities with the potential to become large businesses. We are also increasing our
exposure to the edtech (educational technology) businesses by investing a further US$25m and US$44m in our education
associates Brainly and Udemy respectively. In the Food Delivery business, we invested a further US$100m in our 
associate Swiggy.

At year-end, we had a solid net cash position of US$4.8bn, comprising US$8.3bn of cash and cash equivalents (including
short-term cash investments), net of US$3.5bn of interest-bearing debt (excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We
also have an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded net interest income of US$16m for the year.
In December 2019, Prosus established a US$6bn global medium-term note programme. In terms of this programme, Prosus may
periodically issue notes denominated in any currency, with a maximum outstanding aggregate nominal amount of US$6bn. 
The notes trade on the Euronext Dublin stock exchange. Under the programme, in January 2020, we successfully issued
US$1.250bn 3.68% notes due in 2030. The purpose of this offering was to raise proceeds to redeem the US$1.0bn 6.00% notes 
due in July 2020. The principal and interest accrued to the maturity date of these notes were repaid in February 2020. 
The group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

Consolidated free cash outflow was US$383m, compared to the prior-year outflow of US$120m from continuing operations
(excluding the Video-Entertainment segment). This change reflects increased investment in the Food Delivery business, 
as well as negative working-capital effects, offset by merchant cash timing differences of US$28m, and transaction costs 
of unbundling MultiChoice Group and listing Prosus of around US$113m. Dividend income received from Tencent increased
US$35m to US$377m. Cash extractions from our profitable Classifieds businesses continued to grow, increasing US$70m to
US$305m. Covid-19 may have a short-term impact on that trajectory, but the positive trend is expected to return.

We adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases on a prospective basis. Accordingly, comparative information has
not been restated.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form announcement.

Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is finalising its summarised consolidated financial statements
and consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.

We ended the financial year facing into the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets entering lockdown in the last
two weeks of March 2020. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation to ensure we safeguard our
people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our businesses for the long-term.

During the year ended 31 March 2020, all key ecommerce segments made good progress against financial and strategic
objectives. Classifieds again grew considerably faster than many of its peers and increased profits. Payments and Fintech
segments have now reached profitability at their core and continue to grow profits, while also investing to drive future growth.
Food Delivery was a key investment area during the year as we seek to grow the market and our position in it by investing in
technology and building out our first-party delivery capabilities, city and restaurant reach. Initial results are highly encouraging
as, to date, this investment has driven significant order and revenue growth in our Food Delivery operations. The progress of
our core ecommerce segments, which are growing fast and scaling well, gives us confidence in our ability to continue identifying
opportunities to create significant value into the future. Tencent delivered a solid financial performance. Further details will
be provided in the summarised consolidated financial results, due for release on 29 June 2020.

While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular growth trends, the global pandemic has negatively
impacted some operations and we need to caution against the potential impacts of Covid-19 on the 31 March 2021 financial
year. That said, it is important to note that the fundamentals of our businesses remain very strong and we believe that we are
well positioned to weather this unprecedented storm. We have sufficient liquidity to provide our businesses with the
appropriate level of funding as well as invest in external opportunities that may present themselves during this period.

After many years of strong growth and stock price outperformance, Naspers has come to represent a very significant and
overweight position on the JSE Limited’s Shareholder Weighted Index (SWIX). In an effort to extend our shareholder base and
reduce that overweight position, on 11 September 2019 the group listed its international internet assets on Euronext
Amsterdam. This listing created the largest listed consumer internet company in Europe, Prosus N.V. (Prosus), comprising the
group’s internet interests outside of South Africa. Prosus also has a secondary, inward listing on the JSE in South Africa. Prosus
is currently 72.49% owned by Naspers.

As a result of the listing of Prosus, the group’s earnings, headline earnings and core headline earnings for the year ended 31
March 2020 are expected to reduce as compared to the year ago period, reflecting the fact that the group will only recognise
a 72.63% contribution from Prosus for the year as compared to a 100% contribution in the prior year period.

Growth in earnings per share in the current period is expected to be reduced as a consequence of:
    -    A gain of approximately US$600m recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in MakeMyTrip Limited, compared
         to a gain of US$1.6bn in the prior period recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in Flipkart Limited. This
         negatively impacts the year-over-year comparison by approximately US$1bn
    -    The aforementioned reduced earnings contribution in the current year from Prosus, post its listing. The expected
         impact of this reduction amounts to approximately US$377m.
    -    US$167m in donations in response to the Covid-19 in March 2020. This comprised US$84m (ZAR1.5 billion) in
         emergency aid provided to the South African government’s response to Covid-19. The group also expensed its
         proportionate share of Covid-19 donations made by Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) up to end March 2020 of
         US$83m.

Growth in headline earnings per share in the current period is also negatively impacted by:
       -   Reduced headline earnings contribution from Prosus, post its listing and creation of the free-float. The expected
           impact amounts to approximately US$338m.

       -   Expected fair-value gains on investments held by Tencent (classified as at fair value through profit and loss) of
           approximately US$549m, compared to US$1.5bn recognised in the prior period.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline earnings per share from continuing operations
for the current period is expected to decrease by between 53 and 8 cents per share (between 8% and 1%). The above
mentioned gains on disposals of investments, fair-value losses and Covid-19 donations have been excluded from core headline
earnings. As such, growth in core headline earnings is expected to be impacted by:

       -   Continued healthy growth from Tencent and the group’s established ecommerce business.

       -   Offset by the additional investment to drive strong growth in the food delivery business; and

       -   The introduction of minority shareholders, through the listing of Prosus and subsequent sale of shares. This is expected
           to reduce the attributable core earnings of Naspers shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2020, by approximately
           US$465m.

In addition, the impact of the MultiChoice Group Limited (MultiChoice Group) listing during the 2019 financial year also
distorted the growth in earnings. The group distributed its interest in its video-entertainment business, MultiChoice Group, to
its shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie (the distribution). Following the distribution, we present the results of the
video-entertainment segment as discontinued operations in the prior period.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in core headline earnings per share, earnings and headline earnings per share
for the year ended 31 March 2019 as compared to 31 March 2020 for both total operations (as previously reported) and
continuing operations in the tables below:

*
  Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments
(including put option liabilities) and unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) one-
off gains and losses (including acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses as these items relate to changes in the
composition of the group and are not reflective of its underlying operating performance; (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business
combinations and acquisitions; and (vi) the donations due to Covid-19, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments are made
to the earnings of businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent that the information
is available.

(1)
       Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.
(2)
       Weighted average number of shares for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 have been adjusted to include
       those shares issued for no consideration from the start of the earliest period presented i.e. 1 April 2018, to permit
       comparability in accordance with IAS33 Earnings Per Share. Per share data has accordingly been recalculated for all periods
       presented.
Financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s

Update on impact of COVID-19



   -   Focusing on the health of its employees and communities

   -   Working hard to safeguard customers, partners and businesses

   -   Strong financial position to navigate uncertain times

Today, 8 April 2020, Naspers (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the ""Group"")
provides an update on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and outlines its actions to
safeguard its employees, customers and businesses as well as to support the communities
in which it operates.

The Group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors
in the world. The Group’s businesses serve customers in more than 90 markets. The Group
estimates that approximately one-fifth of the world’s population use products and services
of businesses that the Group has built, acquired or invested in. The Group's diversified
portfolio comprises businesses in high-growth sectors, including food delivery, online
classifieds, payments and fintech, etail, online education, and social and internet
platforms.

Safeguarding its employees, customers and businesses

The Group has monitored COVID-19-related developments in its markets and has
implemented measures to limit the potential spread of the virus among its employees, its
customers and persons connected to its businesses. The Group early-on implemented
work-from-home policies and travel restrictions for its employees to help protect the health
of its employees and those around them. For those employees directly serving customers,
the Group has implemented measures designed to safeguard both them and its customers.
In addition, the Group has implemented measures to support the key partners of its
businesses.

   -   Food delivery: the Group has implemented several initiatives, including iFood
       making available over R$50million in support to restaurants and couriers in Brazil
       affected by COVID-19. In some instances, the Group's businesses have also:
       waived commissions charged by it to restaurants; reduced restaurant payment
       cycles to boost restaurants' liquidity; provided masks, gloves and thermal checks
       for ""delivery-only kitchen"" staff; and provided best practice guidelines for the
       health and safety of restaurant staff and couriers.

   -   Classifieds: the Group has: extended payment and delivery services to more
       categories of users, where possible; offered cameras to users for virtual real estate
       tours; and piloted car inspections by video in some of its automotive businesses.
       To support sellers on some of its marketplaces, the Group has extended the
       duration of listings and provided financial relief to support their ongoing business
       viability.
   -   Payments and fintech: PayU has rolled out a number of initiatives to help
       merchant partners across its markets, including “Startups helping Startups”, which
       allows businesses to collaborate to support COVID-19 efforts. These initiatives
       include collecting donations for hospitals at points-of-sale, and rolling out free
       digital training webinars on how merchants can adapt to trading online.

   -   Etail: eMAG is offering customers alternative ways to receive their purchases.
       These include enabling customers to collect their goods from hundreds of
       conveniently located lockers, which are sanitised multiple times a day, and
       contactless delivery, where drivers deposit packages outside customers’ homes.
       eMAG is also adding new offline retailers to its marketplace to help drive business
       for them. Takealot has also put in place measures to safeguard its employees,
       partners, drivers and customers, including closing Takealot Pickup Points, providing
       contactless delivery and increasing hygiene procedures, guided by international
       best practice and the World Health Organisation (WHO), for all deliveries.

   -   Media: Media24 is committed to supporting South Africa’s response to COVID-19
       by publishing accurate information and keeping the public informed, contributing
       to the spirit of solidarity, compassion and positivity by also telling stories of hope.
       Media24 has implemented additional safety measures and temperature screenings
       at its warehousing and distribution facilities that remain open. In addition,
       enhanced safety measures apply to its journalists working in the field, and its
       distribution employees will adhere to its own measures and the measures
       implemented by its retail partners.

The Group continues to respond to the developing situation, adhering to official guidance
and applicable law and regulation to limit the potential spread of COVID-19.

Supporting the communities in which it operates

The Group is taking action at a group level and at a local company level to support its
communities, particularly where it can use its technological expertise, global networks and
resources to contribute to the response to COVID-19.

   -   Swiggy has launched a campaign to donate meals to persons in need in India. The
       public can also donate to this campaign. The campaign is currently donating
       approximately 35,000 meals per day, with a goal of distributing approximately
       500,000 meals per day in the short-term.

   -   OLX is using its marketplace to help find homes for doctors and arrange
       transportation for the elderly, and is moderating fake advertisements.

   -   Codecademy has awarded 85,000 free scholarships to learners in more than 80
       countries to the Pro version of its course catalogue, and BYJU’S has offered its
       learning platform for free in India.

Naspers is contributing ZAR1.5 billion in emergency aid to the South African government’s
response to COVID-19. Naspers was founded in South Africa over 100 years ago and it is
committed to working with the South African government and civil society to help
overcome the impact of COVID-19 and make a difference in the country. Naspers will
contribute ZAR500 million to the Solidarity Response Fund and will buy ZAR1 billion worth
of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies in China and fly these to
South Africa. Media24 has pledged a contribution of ZAR1 million to the Fund.

The Group continues to encourage the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit of its local
teams to identify additional opportunities to put its capabilities and expertise to work
across the world.

                                                                                            
Business and financial impact

The Group's leadership team is in communication with its businesses to anticipate the
impact of COVID-19 on operations. It is still too early to estimate the scope of any impact
on the Group's operations and financial information, particularly in view of rising global
infections and evolving government responses to the outbreak. The size of the impact on
operations will vary across sector and geography. The Group intends to continue to invest
in its businesses to position them for future recovery.

Importantly, the Group believes that it faces this challenging period from a position of
relative financial strength and with sufficient liquidity to both navigate the changing
environment and seek out new opportunities. The Group closed its financial year on 31
March 2020 with more than US$4 billion in net cash and a US$2.5 billion undrawn revolving
credit facility in place. Prosus's bond offering in January 2020 successfully priced US$1.25
billion 3.680% notes (due 2030) to raise proceeds to redeem its US$1.0 billion 6.000%
notes that are due in July 2020. The Group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

  -   The Group's largest investment, Tencent, continues to grow off a very large base
      and in a market, China, which appears to be emerging relatively well from the impact
      of COVID-19.

  -   In classifieds, the Group has seen a decline in traffic to its marketplaces. The
      Group, however, has taken a number of steps to assist customers and partners
      during this time. In the short-term, the Group expects to experience a negative
      impact on revenue and profitability in its Classifieds businesses.

  -   In payments and fintech, the Group's European businesses appear to be resilient.
      That, however, may change. It remains too early to estimate the impact of the
      recent lockdown in India on its Payments and Fintech business. India represents
      more than 50% of its Payments and Fintech business's transaction volume in
      payments and has initially seen a significant drop in transaction volume. In time,
      the payments and fintech business is expected to benefit across its markets from
      large sectoral trends, including more customers transacting online and more online
      transactions being executed through alternative forms of payment (rather than
      cash).

  -   In food delivery, while the Group is experiencing an increased demand for food
      delivery across its portfolio, it has not always been able to meet that demand due
      to supply issues as restaurants close. In India, Swiggy is permitted to continue to
      operate during the lockdown in India. The lockdown in India has, however, not been
      implemented uniformly across the country and Swiggy's service has been halted in
      some regions. Swiggy is engaging with the national and regional authorities in India
      to ensure the uniform implementation of the lockdown. In Brazil, iFood’s efforts to
      assist its restaurant and food delivery partners has helped mitigate some of the
      supply issues and, at this stage, order volume is holding up well. In South-Africa,
      although food delivery is allowed as an essential service, restaurants and their
      kitchens are barred from operating thereby limiting the items that Mr D Food can
      deliver. Mr D Food is, however, continuing to operate in a limited capacity through
      the delivery of essential goods, where it will use contactless delivery and hygiene
      protocols to ensure safety. In the longer-term, the Group believes that it is possible
      that the current environment may drive a structural shift in global consumption
      patterns in favour of food delivery.

  -   In etail, eMAG’s main market of operation, Romania, entered a lockdown on 26
      March 2020, however, the business is holding up well at this stage. In South Africa,
      Takealot has been impacted by a restriction on certain categories of goods that it
      can sell. Takealot had ceased trading in compliance with the full lockdown. As of the
      evening of Monday, 30 March 2020, Takealot.com, however, has reopened for the
      sale and delivery of essential goods. Takealot has put in place precautionary
      measures to prevent non-essential goods passing through the checkout process, and
      stock and price limitations on key essential goods. It is too early to estimate the size
      of the impact of such lockdown. Takealot has already enacted plans to broaden its
      offering into the non-restricted categories of goods, which are expected to mitigate
      such impact.

  -   In media, the South African government has included the majority of media formats
      as essential services that are allowed to continue operations during the full
      lockdown. As a leading media company in South Africa, Media24 continued with its
      24/7 news coverage and its viewership has increased since the onset of COVID-19.
      Additionally, Media24 is expected to continue to publish a number of its print
      newspapers and magazines for as long as it is practical to do so. The distribution
      footprint of such newspapers and magazines, however, has been reduced to comply
      with the full lockdown.

  -   All of the Group's businesses have continuity plans in place. The Group is actively
      assessing potential impacts and supporting its businesses as they take appropriate,
      market-specific action as needed. The challenges of COVID-19 will vary by sector
      and geography, but the Group believes it has the teams, the resources and the
      experience required to navigate them successfully. The Group believes it will emerge
      from this period well-placed to continue to deliver long-term growth in the markets
      it serves.

To give further context to the impacts of COVID-19 on the Group's businesses,
the Group invites stakeholders to attend a conference call tomorrow, Thursday,
9 April 2020 at 15:00 CET. To access the call please pre-register here. Once
registered, participants will be provided with the information needed to join the
conference, including the dial-in numbers and a passcode. It is also
recommended that participants dial-in 5 to 10 minutes prior to the start time to
ensure sufficient opportunity for assistance, should it be required. The recording
of the call will be made available on the website, www.naspers.com.

RESULTS OF THE SALE BY NASPERS LIMITED OF 22 MILLION N ORDINARY SHARES OF
PROSUS N.V. THROUGH AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING TO INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTORS

Naspers Limited (""Naspers"") has sold 22 million N ordinary shares (the ""Prosus N Ordinary
Shares"") in Prosus N.V. (""Prosus""), corresponding to c. 1.4% of the issued Prosus N Ordinary
Shares, at a price per Prosus N Ordinary Share of €67.50, resulting in gross proceeds of
approximately €1.5 billion for Naspers. The sale was effected through an accelerated bookbuild
offering to institutional investors (the ""Placing""). Following the Placing, Naspers holds c. 72.5%
of the issued Prosus ordinary shares.

Settlement of the Placing is expected to occur on 24 January 2020 (i.e., on a T+2 basis) on
Euronext Amsterdam.

As part of the Placing and in line with market practice for placements of this nature, Naspers has
agreed to a 90-day lock-up period with respect to its remaining interest in the Prosus N Ordinary
Shares, subject to customary exceptions and an ability to waive by the Joint Global Coordinators.

None of the proceeds raised from the Placing will be received by Prosus, and all of the proceeds
received by Naspers, net of expenses and costs, will be repatriated to South Africa as required
by the South African Reserve Bank. Naspers intends to use these net proceeds over time to
return capital to Naspers shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme.

IMPORTANT REGULATORY NOTICE

This announcement is not for publication, distribution or release, directly or indirectly, in or into
the United States of America (""United States"" or ""U.S."") (including its territories and
possessions, any state of the United States and the District of Columbia), or to U.S. persons as
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (as defined below), or into Canada, Australia or
Japan or any other jurisdiction where such an announcement would be unlawful. The distribution
of this announcement may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions and persons into whose
possession this document or other information referred to herein comes should inform
themselves about and observe any such restriction. Any failure to comply with these restrictions
may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

The securities referred to herein have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and may not be offered or sold
directly or indirectly, in or into the United States or to U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S
under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Any offer or sale of the securities referred
to herein in the United States will be made only to persons who are both “qualified institutional
buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and “qualified purchasers” as defined
in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither this document nor the
information contained herein constitutes or forms part of an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an
offer to buy, securities in the United States. There will be no public offer of any securities in the
United States or in any other jurisdiction.

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area (each a ""Member State""), no
Prosus N Ordinary Shares have been offered or will be offered pursuant to the Placing to the
public in that Member State, except that offers of Prosus N Ordinary Shares may be made to the
public in that Member State at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus
Regulation: (a) to any legal entity which is a ""qualified investor"" as defined under the Prospectus
Regulation (a ""Qualified Investor""); (b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than
Qualified Investors); or (c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the
Prospectus Regulation, provided that no such offer of Prosus N Ordinary Shares shall require
Naspers, Prosus or any Joint Global Coordinator to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of
the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus
Regulation. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ""offer to the public"" in relation
to any Prosus N Ordinary Shares in any Member State means the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any Prosus N Ordinary
Shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for any
Prosus N Ordinary Shares, and the expression ""Prospectus Regulation"" means Regulation (EU)
2017/1129.

In the United Kingdom, this announcement is being distributed exclusively to, and is directed
exclusively at Qualified Investors who are also: (i) persons having professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within the definition of “investment professionals” in
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005,
as amended (the ""Order""); or (ii) persons who are high net worth bodies corporate,
unincorporated associations and partnerships and the trustees of high value trusts, as described
in Article 49(2)(A) to (D) of the Order; or (iii) persons to whom it may otherwise be lawful to
distribute it.

In South Africa, the Placing will only be made by way of separate private placements to: (i)
selected persons falling within one of the specified categories listed in Section 96(1)(a) of the
South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008, as amended (the ""South African Companies Act"");
and (ii) selected persons, acting as principal, acquiring Prosus N Ordinary Shares for a total
acquisition cost of R1,000,000 or more, as contemplated in Section 96(1)(b) of the South African
Companies (""South African Qualifying Investors""). This announcement is only being made
available to such South African Qualifying Investors. Accordingly: (i) the Placing is not an offer
to the public as contemplated in the South African Companies Act; (ii) this announcement does
not, nor does it intend to, constitute a ""registered prospectus"" or ""advertisement"", as
contemplated by the South African Companies Act; and (iii) no prospectus has been filed with
the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (""CIPC"") in respect of the
Placing. As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance and form
requirements for a prospectus set out in the South African Companies Act and the South African
Companies Regulations of 2011, and has not been approved by, and/or registered with, CIPC.
The information contained in this announcement constitutes factual information as contemplated
in Section 1(3)(a) of the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of
2002, as amended, (the ""South African FAIS Act"") and should not be construed as an express
or implied recommendation, guide or proposal that any particular transaction in respect of the
Naspers N Ordinary Shares or the Prosus N Ordinary Shares or in relation to the business or
future investments of Naspers or Prosus is appropriate to the particular investment objectives,
financial situations or needs of a prospective investor, and nothing in this announcement should
be construed as constituting the canvassing for, or marketing or advertising of, financial services
in South Africa. Neither Naspers nor Prosus is a financial services provider licensed as such under
the South African FAIS Act.

This announcement is not an offer of securities or investments for sale, nor a solicitation of an
offer to buy, securities or investments in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would
be unlawful. No action has been taken that would permit an offering of the securities or
possession or distribution of this announcement in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose
is required. Persons into whose possession this announcement comes are required to inform
themselves about and to observe any such restrictions. No prospectus under the Prospectus
Regulation is required in respect of the Placing and no prospectus, offering circular or similar
document will be prepared.

In connection with the Placing, each of the Joint Global Coordinators and any of their affiliates
acting as an investor for their own account may take up as a proprietary position any Prosus N
Ordinary Shares and in that capacity may retain, purchase or sell for their own account such
Prosus N Ordinary Shares and other securities of Prosus or related investments in connection
with the Placing or otherwise. In addition, each of the Joint Global Coordinators or their affiliates
may enter into financing arrangements (including swaps or contracts for difference) with
investors in connection with each of the Joint Global Coordinators and any of their affiliates may
from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of Prosus N Ordinary Shares. None of the Joint Global
Coordinators or their affiliates intends to disclose the extent of any such investment or
transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so.

Each Joint Global Coordinator is acting on behalf of Naspers and no one else in connection with
the Placing. They will not regard any other person as their client in relation to the Placing and
will not be responsible to anyone other than Naspers for providing the protections afforded to
their respective clients nor for providing advice in relation to the Placing, the contents of this
announcement or any transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein. None of the
Joint Global Coordinators or any of their respective subsidiary undertakings, affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents, alliance partners or any other
entity or person accepts any responsibility or liability whatsoever for, or makes any
representation, warranty or undertaking, express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the information or opinions in this announcement (or whether any
information has been omitted from this announcement) or any other information relating to

NASPERS LIMITED LAUNCHES THE SALE OF C. 22 MILLION N ORDINARY SHARES OF
PROSUS N.V. THROUGH AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING TO
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS


Naspers Limited (""Naspers"") has launched the sale of c. 22 million N ordinary shares (the
""Prosus N Ordinary Shares"") in Prosus N.V. (""Prosus""), corresponding to c. 1.4% of the
issued Prosus N Ordinary Shares, through an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional
investors (the ""Placing"").

BACKGROUND

On 11 September 2019, Naspers listed its international internet assets on Euronext
Amsterdam under Prosus. These assets comprise its international internet interests outside of
South Africa, including operations and investments in online classifieds, food delivery,
payments and fintech, etail, education, and social and internet platforms. Prosus also has a
secondary, inward listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in South Africa. Prosus is
73.8% owned by Naspers, with a free float of 26.2%. As Europe’s largest listed consumer
internet company by asset value, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to
Naspers's portfolio of international internet assets through exposure to China, India and other
high-growth markets, as well as to the global tech sector. At the time of the listing, around
US$16 billion of value was unlocked for Naspers's shareholders by reducing the discount to the
combined net asset value of Prosus and Naspers.

PLACING

In the months following the Admission, Naspers has seen significant interest in Prosus from
new investors, in particular European institutions and global technology investors. The Placing
will offer an opportunity to the broad investment community to get exposure to the largest
listed European consumer internet stock by asset value and thereby continue to broaden
Prosus’s shareholder base.

Accordingly, Naspers is offering approximately 22 million Prosus N Ordinary Shares for sale
corresponding to c. 1.4% of the issued Prosus N Ordinary Shares in the Placing. The Placing is
expected to increase Prosus's free-float from c. 26.2% to c. 27.5% with Naspers expected to
hold c. 72.5% of the issued Prosus ordinary shares after the completion of the Placing
(assuming all the Prosus N Ordinary Shares offered in the Placing are placed).

                                                                                             
Institutional investors participating in the Placing will receive Prosus N Ordinary Shares trading
on Euronext Amsterdam in Euro.

The bookbuild will commence immediately following this announcement and Naspers reserves
the right to close the book at any time. Naspers will announce the outcome of the Placing upon
its completion.

As part of the Placing and in line with market practice for placements of this nature, Naspers
has agreed to a 90-day lock-up period with respect to its remaining interest in the Prosus N
Ordinary Shares, subject to customary exceptions and an ability to waive by the Joint Global
Coordinators.

None of the proceeds raised from the Placing will be received by Prosus, and all of the
proceeds received by Naspers, net of expenses and costs, will be repatriated to South Africa as
required by the South African Reserve Bank. Naspers intends to use these net proceeds over
time to return capital to Naspers shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme.

under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Any offer or sale of the securities

Shares shall require Naspers, Prosus or any Joint Global Coordinator to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an
""offer to the public"" in relation to any Prosus N Ordinary Shares in any Member State means
the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the
offer and any Prosus N Ordinary Shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe for any Prosus N Ordinary Shares, and the expression ""Prospectus
Regulation"" means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

In the United Kingdom, this announcement is being distributed exclusively to, and is directed
exclusively at Qualified Investors who are also: (i) persons having professional experience in

""advertisement"", as contemplated by the South African Companies Act; and (iii) no prospectus

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION

On 19 December 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the final increased offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the entire issued and to be issued
share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

As at 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020 (being the closing date of the Final Increased Offer),
Prosus had received valid acceptances of the Final Increased Offer in respect of 158,037 Just Eat Shares,
representing approximately 0.02 per cent. of the issued share capital of Just Eat. MIH does not own any Just
Eat Shares. As such, the Acceptance Condition has not been satisfied and the Final Increased Offer has
now lapsed.

As the Final Increased Offer has lapsed, it is no longer open to acceptances and any accepting Just Eat
Shareholders cease to be bound by their acceptances.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: ""We would like to thank the Just Eat board and management
team for their constructive engagement throughout the process. As stated in our Original Offer and
subsequently, we consider Just Eat an attractive business though one which will require significant
investment. We have been clear throughout that we would remain disciplined in how we allocate our capital
and the price that we would offer.

We have an outstanding track record of executing M&A at the right price for our shareholders and of
generating strong returns. Just Eat is not an acquisition we wanted to make at any cost and while we have
significant financial capacity, we believe that our final offer of 800 pence per share was appropriate in light of
the investment required and preserved our ability to create value for our shareholders.

Our core operating segments are growing fast with significant runway ahead of them. We will continue to
identify and pursue opportunities that will be both additive to our current strategy and generate high levels of
return for our shareholders.""

In respect of Just Eat Shares held in certificated form, the Form of Acceptance, Second Form of Acceptance
and/or Third Form of Acceptance (as applicable), share certificate(s) and/or other document(s) of title will be
returned by post (or by such other method as may be approved by the Panel) within 14 days of the Final
Increased Offer lapsing to the person or agent whose name and address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions
is set out in the relevant box on the relevant Form of Acceptance or, if none is set out, to the first-named or
sole holder of his registered address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions. No such documents will be sent to
an address in any Restricted Jurisdiction.

In respect of Just Eat Shares held in uncertificated form, Computershare, the Receiving Agent, will,
immediately (or within such longer period as the Panel may permit, not exceeding 14 days after the lapsing
of the Final Increased Offer), give instructions to Euroclear to transfer all Just Eat Shares held in escrow
balances and in relation to which it is the escrow agent for the purposes of the Final Increased Offer to the
original available balances of the Just Eat Shareholders concerned.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the
Final Increased Offer Document (including words or expressions defined in the Final Increased Offer
Document by reference to the Offer Document).

THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V
                                

PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 19 December 2019 relating to the final
increased offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to
acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final
Increased Offer), Prosus announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of
the Final Increased Offer and the procedures for its acceptance (the Final Increased Offer
Document) is being published and posted to the shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the
case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat Shares in certificated form, the related Third Form of
Acceptance to accept the Final Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer Document will also be
published on Prosus’s website at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Final Increased Offer is
subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Final Increased Offer Document and the Third Form
of Acceptance. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and should be construed
accordingly.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other European
markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as competitive
dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we would remain
disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an attractive
business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining acceptable
returns for Prosus shareholders.”

To accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Third Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to                                               
Computershare, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8AE, as soon as possible but in
any event so as to be received by not later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020.

To accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated Just Eat Shares, acceptance
should be made electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10
January 2020. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your CREST
sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer or the Increased Offer
will automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue
of their prior acceptance and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further
action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Final Increased Offer Document,
please contact the Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on

The Final Increased Offer will be being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Final
Increased Offer Document, which will contain further information about the Final Increased Offer.

This announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons
into whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Final Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be                                                  
affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who
are in any doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser
in their relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute
a violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Final Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Final Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or
within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the
laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to
the Final Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or
otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such
documents (including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward,
distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to
do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of
a Scheme (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in
favour of the Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Final Increased Offer will
not be capable of acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do
so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of
their respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States                                                   
disclosure and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable,
settlement procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on
which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or
arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in
the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply
with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about
such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a
Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Final Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United
States federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.

                                                  
Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final
Increased Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation
to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as
the case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore
subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
materially from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement
may be forward looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words
such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”,
“outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”,
“estimates”, “will look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance
or the negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain
actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur
or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties
surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or                                                   
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

UPDATE ON FINAL INCREASED CASH OFFER FOR JUST EAT PLC BY PROSUS N.V.
THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V

                          

Prosus notes the announcement by Just Eat’s board regarding its recommendation and
Takeaway.com’s announcement regarding the acceptance level for its offer.

Prosus has offered to acquire the entire share capital of Just Eat for 800p per share. This cash offer
remains open to acceptances from Just Eat shareholders. However, Prosus does not plan currently to
make market purchases of Just Eat shares in support of its offer.

Commenting, Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, said: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other
European markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as
competitive dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we
would remain disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an
attractive business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining
acceptable returns for Prosus shareholders.”

This announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect of
any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction,

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Final Increased
Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws
of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt
regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant
jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the
laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
companies and other persons involved in the Final Increased Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability
for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Final Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within
a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Final
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where
to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including
agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them                                                    
in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the
laws in that jurisdiction. If the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by
any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Final Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation
of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.


                                                     
The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on                                                     
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and any
person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance or
guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements in
this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations
(including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and each of the
foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent                                                     
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

   800 PENCE PER JUST EAT SHARE. ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED
                                    STATES
INTERESTED IN SELLING JUST EAT SHARES SHOULD CONTACT J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE /
             MORGAN STANLEY (USING THE CONTACT DETAILS BELOW)

1.      Final Increased Cash Offer

Prosus N.V. (Prosus) is pleased to announce the terms of an increased and final cash offer by its
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) for the entire issued and to be
issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Final Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             800 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Final Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital
of Just Eat at approximately £5.5 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       36 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019 (being
        the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement);

•       35 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       26 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July (being the last
        Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).

The financial terms of the Final Increased Offer are final and will not be increased. The closing date of
the Final Increased Offer has been extended to 1.00 p.m. on 10 January 2020 and will not be extended
beyond that time (save with Panel consent).

Save as set out in this announcement, the Final Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and
should be construed accordingly.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in
any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

Commenting on the Final Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We have been very clear from the beginning about our ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business. The acquisition of Just Eat, which brings its portfolio of good market positions, would
be a meaningful step in realising this goal. Following extensive discussions with Just Eat’s and Prosus’s
shareholders, we have decided to make a final increase in our cash offer to 800p per share. This level
delivers outstanding and certain value to Just Eat shareholders while also providing an appropriate
return for our own shareholders, given strong levels of competition and significant investment required
to reinvigorate growth. We urge Just Eat shareholders to accept this final offer and bring the uncertainty
around Just Eat’s future to a close.”

2.      MIH seeking to acquire Just Eat Shares

MIH is seeking to make market purchases of Just Eat Shares at a price of up to 800 pence per share.

Eligible Just Eat Shareholders, who are institutional investors outside the United States, interested in
selling their shares at the price of up to 800 pence per Just Eat Share should contact J.P. Morgan
Cazenove / Morgan Stanley (using their normal sales and trading contacts), who have authority from
Prosus and MIH to purchase Just Eat Shares other than pursuant to the Offer such as in the open
market or through privately negotiated purchases. Such purchases shall comply with the City Code, the
rules of the London Stock Exchange and Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act. Information about
such purchases will be disclosed as and if required by applicable securities laws. Retail investors should
contact their broker.

Due to regulatory requirements, MIH is unable to purchase Just Eat Shares from shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States, or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States.

3.      Overview of the Final Increased Offer

Following further investor engagement, and in the context of strong equity market performance and
consolidation in the sector since Prosus’s Increased Offer, Prosus is today pleased to announce a Final
Increased Offer of 800 pence in cash per Just Eat Share.

The Final Increased Offer represents a compelling proposition for Just Eat Shareholders with the
certainty of a cash exit at a substantial premium to Just Eat’s unaffected share price and to the value
of the Takeaway.com Offer.

The Final Increased Offer represents a premium of 36 per cent to Just Eat’s Closing Price on 21 October
2019 (the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which already includes
a premium from the Takeaway.com’s Offer and which Prosus believes compares favourably with
precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context.

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, its historically
strong market positions are being eroded by intensifying competition. Prosus is the right owner for Just
Eat and intends to provide the necessary investment in product, technology, marketing and own-
delivery capabilities to enable Just Eat to shift to an own-delivery focused hybrid model, protect its
market positions, and capitalise on its long-term opportunity. Prosus benefits from a long and successful
track record of investing in and building out market-leading hybrid and own-delivery businesses.

The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business and is the logical next step for Prosus’s and Just Eat’s partnership in iFood. Prosus
has the conviction and financial resources to help Just Eat achieve its long-term potential, whilst also
targeting an appropriate risk adjusted return on invested capital for Prosus shareholders.

Prosus believes that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will not address Just Eat’s issues
and carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders. In the context of slowing organic growth,
Takeaway.com’s share price is at an all-time high and trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than
Just Eat’s own unaffected multiple.

Takeaway.com has limited experience in competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.
Furthermore, Takeaway.com’s management lacks experience of operating own-delivery operations at
scale, and has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable. Prosus believes Takeaway.com will not be able to support Just Eat in competing
effectively in many of Just Eat’s core markets including the UK where Uber Eats and Deliveroo have
been operating at scale for years with large and growing market share.

Prosus believes that it is the right owner for Just Eat and Prosus’s Final Increased Offer provides
compelling and certain value to Just Eat Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s
all-share offer, which comes with significant risk.

Prosus urges Just Eat Shareholders to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible
and, in any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

4.      Financing of the Final Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Final Increased Offer will be financed: (a) by a
bridge loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders, providing for a term loan bridge facility; and (b) from the existing cash resources of Prosus.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources available
to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat Shareholders
under the terms of the Final Increased Offer.

5.      How to accept the Final Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Final Increased Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and
conditions to, the Final Increased Offer together with the associated revised form of acceptance (the
Third Form of Acceptance) will be posted to Just Eat Shareholders and be available, subject to certain
restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Prosus’s website at

Eat Shares should complete either: (a) the Second Form of Acceptance accompanying the

Just Eat Shares, should do so electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London
time) on 10 January 2020. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your
CREST sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction
to Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Offer or the Increased Offer will
automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue of
their prior acceptance and do not need take any further action.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in

Just Eat Shareholders who have accepted the Takeaway.com Offer should be aware that if the
Takeaway.com Offer has not become or been declared unconditional as to acceptances by 1.00
p.m. on 1 January 2020, they can withdraw their acceptance of the Takeaway.com Offer and
accept the Final Increased Offer.

6.      Level of acceptances and disclosure of interests in relevant securities

As at 1.00 p.m. on 19 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Increased Offer in
respect of 44,718 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0065 per cent. of the current issued
share capital of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own
any Just Eat Shares.

The percentages of Just Eat Shares referred to in this announcement are based on a figure of
682,985,706 Just Eat Shares in issue on 18 December 2019.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Final Increased
Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws
of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt
regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant
jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the
laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or

do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within

that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Final

otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by

of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

In relation to MIH’s intention to buy Just Eat Shares in the market outside the Final Increased Offer,
MIH and its affiliates and brokers cannot purchase Just Eat Shares from Just Eat Shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States. Any purchases will be made to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with Rule 14e-5(b)
under the US Exchange Act and in compliance with the City Code.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.

as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors

statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH

guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements in
this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations

Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and each of the
foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

    (b) All prices and Closing Prices for Takeaway.com Shares are closing middle market quotations
        derived from the Euronext Amsterdam Daily Official List.

    (c) The aggregate value of the Final Increased Offer consideration of approximately £5.5 billion is

        Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

    (d) The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,107,905 shares (as published by
        Takeaway.com in its circular to shareholders dated 9 December 2019).

    (e) The strong equity market performance since Prosus’s Increased Offer refers to the 4.2%
        increase in the FTSE 100 from market close on 6 December 2019 to the market close on 18
        December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this announcement).

    (f) Takeaway.com’s slowing organic order growth is illustrated by an order growth of 21 per cent
        in Q3 2019 vs 22 per cent in H1 2019 in Germany and an order growth of 15 per cent in Q3
        2019 vs 18 per cent in H1 2019 in the Netherlands.

    (h) Takeaway.com broker consensus is based on the following:

        i.    Takeaway.com consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July

    enterprise value of €5,655 million is calculated as Takeaway.com’s equity value of €5,468
    million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.5 million as per Takeaway.com’s circular to
    shareholders published on 9 December 2019 and share price of €88.90 as at 18 December
    2019 plus net debt of €166 million, and other adjustments of €21 million. 2020 revenue

         J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected
         advisors to Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as
         they are a connected advisor to Takeaway.com;

   ii.   the minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,247 million, the
         maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,301 million; and

   iii. in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
        with the agreement or the approval of Just Eat.

(k) Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 3.4x as at 26 July 2019 is based on:

         plus net debt of £118 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million; and

   ii.   2020 revenue reflects the arithmetic average broker consensus of £1,301 million as
         defined above.

(l) The statement that Takeaway.com is currently trading on a revenue multiple 3.0 times Just

11 December 2019

                              UPDATE ON INCREASED CASH OFFER

                                                  for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Publication of Investor Presentation

Further to the announcement on 9 December 2019 by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery
Holdings B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital
of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are today pleased to announce the
publication of an investor presentation (the Investor Presentation) in connection with the Increased
Offer.

A copy of the presentation is available at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat.

Prosus continues to believe that its superior cash offer represents compelling and certain value to
Just Eat Shareholders. The Increased Offer is at a premium to the look through value of the
Takeaway.com Offer, and provides certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the
significant risks associated with the Takeaway.com Offer. The presentation develops the arguments
set out in the offer document, and in addition, contains the following new information:

Illustrative Premium Calculation

•       Prosus Increased Offer of 740 pence per share in cash comes at a 44 per cent. illustrative
        premium assuming the 15% premium on announcement of the Takeaway.com offer in July
        remained embedded in Just Eat’s share price of 589 pence as at 21 October 2019 (implying
        an illustrative unaffected price for Just Eat of 512 pence adjusted for this 15% premium)

                                                
The illustrative premium of 44% is calculated by reversing the 15% premium on announcement of the
Takeaway.com offer out of the 589p Takeaway.com share price on 21 October 2019 (that being the
last business day prior to the date of Prosus’s Original Offer Announcement), to establish an
illustrative unaffected Just Eat share price for that day of 512 pence, which, compared to Prosus’s
increased cash offer of 740 pence implies a 44% premium.

Illustrative Value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple (updated
for the latest GrubHub share price as of 10 December 2019)

If Just Eat were to re-rate to GrubHub's current 2020 EV/Revenue multiple of 2.7x, this would result in
an illustrative share price for Just Eat of 502 pence, to which Prosus’s increased offer represents an
illustrative premium of 48%.

Prosus believes that the Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a significant premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risks.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer.

A    copy     of    this  announcement    will  be    available     on    Prosus’s   website   at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat, subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in
Restricted Jurisdictions.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

                                                  
Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality                                                   
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

                                                     
No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

Sources and Bases of Calculations

Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 2.7x as at 10 December 2019 is based on: Grubhub’s
enterprise value of US$4,007 million is calculated as Grubhub’s equity value of US$3,690 million
(based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.5 million and share price of US$39.04 as at 10 December
2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of
US$1,461 million.

The illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple is for
illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
the City Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue multiple (as
calculated above) of 2.7x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below)
to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of £3,501 million, and using net debt of £118 million, and
other adjustments of £(63) million to obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,446 million. Dividing by
shares outstanding of 687 million obtains the illustrative share price of 502 pence per share, to which
Prosus’s Increased Offer of 740 pence per share represents a 48% premium.

Just Eat consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July 2019 (the date of
Just Eat’s H1 2019 results statement) as at 10 December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the
publication of this Announcement) and includes group level estimates from the following analysts:
Arete Research Services (4 November 2019), Barclays (22 October 2019), Berenberg (9 August
2019), Credit Suisse (13 November 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019), HSBC (23
October 2019), Investec (04 November 2019), Jefferies (22 October 2019), Liberum (23 October
2019), Macquarie (2 October 2019), Numis Securities (31 October 2019), Peel Hunt (30 October
2019) and RBC Capital Markets (24 October 2019). Estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS have                                                 
been excluded from the consensus as they are connected advisors to Just Eat. Estimates from J.P.
Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected advisors to
Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as they are a connected
advisor to Takeaway.com.The minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,191
million, the maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,276 million. In accordance
with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown with the agreement or the
approval of Just Eat.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

10 December 2019

                             UPDATE ON INCREASED CASH OFFER

                                                 for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Update on Prosus’s Increased Offer to acquire Just Eat

Further to the announcement yesterday by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings
B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just
Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are pleased to confirm that the Spanish
Markets and Competition Commission have cleared the acquisition of Just Eat Shares by MIH under
the Spanish Competition Act.

This is an important milestone that further increases deal certainty of the Increased Offer following
yesterday’s reduction of the Acceptance Condition to a simple majority of the Just Eat Shares (50 per
cent. plus one Just Eat Share). In contrast, the Takeaway.com Offer remains subject to a 75 per cent.
acceptance condition and the approval of Takeaway.com’s own shareholders, and there can be no
certainty that the higher acceptance condition and/or shareholder approval will be obtained. The
Increased Offer is therefore clearly superior to the Takeaway.com Offer both in terms of value offered
and deal certainty.

Commenting on the receipt of clearance, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We are pleased to have cleared the competition hurdle which further underlines the certainty and
deliverability of our superior cash offer of 740p per share to Just Eat Shareholders.”

                                                
The Increased Offer remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining Conditions set out
in the increased offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer (the
Increased Offer Document).

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document.

A    copy     of    this  announcement    will  be    available    on     Prosus’s   website   at

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

                                                 
Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law

the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction

constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and    will    be    available   on    the    London    Stock    Exchange     website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.

                                                   
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service    and      will  be      available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will                                                   
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

                                                 
An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

                    PUBLICATION OF THE INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 9 December 2019 relating to the increased
offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the
entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus
announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of the Increased Offer and the
procedures for its acceptance (the Increased Offer Document) is being published and posted to the
shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat
Shares in certificated form, the related Second Form of Acceptance to accept the Increased Offer.
The Increased Offer Document will also be published on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Increased Offer is subject to the terms and conditions set out
in the Increased Offer Document and the Second Form of Acceptance. The Increased Offer is a
revision to the Offer and should be construed accordingly.

The level of acceptances required to satisfy the Acceptance Condition of the Increased Offer has
been reduced to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of the Just Eat Shares.

To accept the Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Second Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to

                                               
Computershare, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8AE, as soon as possible but in
any event so as to be received by not later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

To accept the Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated Just Eat Shares, acceptance should
be made electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27
December 2019. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your CREST
sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer will automatically be
deemed to have accepted the terms of the Increased Offer by virtue of their prior acceptance
and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Offer Document, please contact the
Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370 707 1066

time).

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document in respect of the Offer (including words or expressions defined in
the Increased Offer Document by reference to the Offer Document).

The Increased Offer Document also includes corrected share of orders from Low Competition Markets
for Takeaway.com for H1 2019 (69% as compared to 65% stated previously) and for a combination of
Takeaway.com and Just Eat for H1 2019 (27% as compared to 28% stated previously). These
corrected percentages highlight an even stronger decrease in the share of Low Competition Markets
for the combined entity.

Further information

This Announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect
of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
                                                 
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

                                                  
The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has

States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
                                                    
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


STATEMENT REGARDING TAKEAWAY.COM N.V. (“TAKEAWAY.COM”) INVESTOR CIRCULAR

The boards of Prosus N.V. (“Prosus”) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (“MIH”) note the release
this morning of an investor circular by Takeaway.com.

The investor circular includes the implausible claim that Just Eat’s shares could have an illustrative
trading value of up to around £11 under the Takeaway.com Offer. This is based on the unsubstantiated
claim that the combined business of Just Eat and Takeaway.com (the “Combined Group”) could re-rate
to Takeaway.com’s average trading revenue multiple since IPO of 8.3x.

Prosus believes that the combination could be highly value destructive. Given that Just Eat’s revenues
would account for 73% of the Combined Group’s business, and a significantly reduced proportion of
Combined Group’s business would operate in Low Competition Markets, Prosus believes that Just Eat’s
trading multiple would be much more relevant to the trading level of the Combined Group than
Takeaway.com’s above market multiple. If the Combined Group were to re-rate to Just Eat’s trading
revenue multiple prior to Prosus’s approach of 3.3x, the illustrative trading value of Just Eat’s shares
would be around £4 per share(1). Based on this calculation, the illustrative value of Takeaway.com’s
shares would be €47 per share(1). Prosus believes that this would be consistent with trends in other
comparable food delivery businesses. It would also represent a premium to GrubHub’s trading revenue
multiple of 2.9x.

Relative to these two potential outcomes, which in themselves illustrate the significant uncertainties for
shareholders presented by the Takeaway.com Offer, Prosus’s Increased Offer of £7.40 provides
compelling value and certainty to Just Eat’s shareholders.

Furthermore, Prosus believes that it is illogical for Takeaway.com to refer to Prosus’s Increased Offer
as “derisory”, when its own, inherently more risky offer, comes at a significant discount to Prosus’s
Increased Offer.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out
in Prosus’s offer document dated 11 November 2019 in respect of the Offer.

This Announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect of

This Announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and Wales
and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into whose
possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Increased Offer
or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws of the
relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding
such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant jurisdiction
without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the laws and/or
regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and
other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for any violation of
such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in,
into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a
national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do so would
violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased
Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do
so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any
other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly,
copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Increased Offer are not being, and
must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into
or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that
jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including agents, custodians, nominees and
trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and
regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form
and the Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any
other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United States by MIH
and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their respective affiliates
will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Increased
Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes
effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be
made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in
private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required
in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be
available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in
accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their affiliates may continue to
act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain
other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal and usual practice and applicable
law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the United
States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock
Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made
public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to                                                    
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and
are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward looking
statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments                                                     
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree                                                    
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at

Sources and Bases

   (a) The reference to the Just Eat share of value created by Combined Group re-rating to 3.3x being
       worth 412p per share is calculated as follows:

      i.   Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           calculated as:

               a. Takeaway.com’s expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of
                  £467m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular dated 9 December

     ii.   Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) £5,693m is calculated
           as Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           multiplied by a 3.3x multiple based on Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue as at 21
           October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement).

    iii.   Combined Group net debt of £267m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular
           dated 9 December 2019.

    iv.    Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m is calculated as
           Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,693m less
           Combined Group net debt of £267m.

     v.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m is calculated as Just Eat Shareholders’ share of the Combined
           Group of 52.12% sourced and based in paragraph 19.2(C)(i) multiplied by the Combined
           Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m.

    vi.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m divided by the fully diluted share capital of Just Eat of 687,107,905
           shares outstanding is equal to 412p.

   (b) Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

    vii.   Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
           US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
           US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million.

   viii.   2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million.

   (c) The reference to Just Eat’s revenues accounting for 73% of the total is based on:

       per cent. market share (based on Google Trends).

                                                
   (e) The value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 6 December 2019 of 710 pence per Just Eat Share

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


Increased cash offer for JUST EAT PLC by MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. a 
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Prosus N.V.
                                                  
                                       

1.      Increased Cash Offer

On 22 October 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the terms of a cash offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH), to acquire the entire issued and to be
issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Offer Announcement). On 11 November 2019,
the Offer Document setting out the full terms and conditions of the Offer was published.

Today, Prosus is pleased to announce the terms of an increased cash offer for the entire issued and
to be issued share capital of Just Eat by MIH (the Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             740 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of
Just Eat at approximately £5.1 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       25.6 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019
        (being the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       24.6 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement);


                                               
MIH also announces today that it has reduced the level of acceptances required to satisfy the
Acceptance Condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of Just Eat Shares,
thereby significantly increasing deal certainty.

As a consequence of today’s announcement, the closing date of the Increased Offer has been
extended to 1.00 p.m. on 27 December 2019.

Save as set out in this announcement, the Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Offer. The Increased Offer is a revision to the Offer and should be construed
accordingly.

Commenting on the Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“Following the announcement of our offer, we have had the opportunity to listen to the views of Just
Eat Shareholders, share our perspective on the global food delivery sector and reflect on the
unquestionable challenges Just Eat faces, as clearly seen in its Q3 results. We have also had
extensive discussions with our own shareholders with regards to our long term strategy for food
delivery and Just Eat’s role within that. We continue to believe in the sector and, as we have
demonstrated in Brazil, if you act decisively and invest effectively in technology as well as the
opportunities of own-delivery, then you can build an attractive growth business that is equipped to win
in the long-term. We believe the investment required is substantial and this impacts our view of
potential returns. As disciplined investors we obviously need to factor the required investment into our
value considerations.

Just Eat is a quality business, which we believe has all the ingredients to be transformed into a long-
term sector winner. In recognition of this potential, we have decided to increase our offer to 740 pence
per share, which we believe provides Just Eat Shareholders with compelling value and therefore good
reason to accept our all-cash offer. Unlike the Takeaway.com Offer, which relies on shares remaining
at an above sector multiple, our cash offer provides certainty of value to Just Eat Shareholders. We
urge shareholders to accept our offer, as it is the only one that delivers certainty in the face of
undeniable industry change.”

2.      Overview of the Increased Offer

Following Prosus’s offer for Just Eat, Prosus’s management have had extensive discussions with Just
Eat Shareholders to explain the rationale for the Offer and the compelling value it represents.
Prosus’s management have also had extensive discussions with Prosus’s own shareholders,
including at Prosus’s recent Capital Markets Day with regards to Prosus’s long-term strategy for food
delivery and Just Eat’s role in this strategy.

Prosus continues to believe that Just Eat is an attractive business, albeit one that requires investment
which has now also been acknowledged by the Just Eat Board, which Prosus has taken into account
when assessing the targeted return on investment for its shareholders and the price it can justify
offering for Just Eat.

Following careful consideration, and in the interest of bringing the process to a close, Prosus has
decided to increase its offer to 740 pence per Just Eat Share in cash, whilst also reducing its
acceptance condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share). Prosus believes the
Increased Offer underscores its commitment to the transaction and constitutes attractive and certain
value for Just Eat Shareholders, while allowing Prosus to target appropriate risk-adjusted returns for
its own shareholders.

The Increased Offer is at a 25.6 per cent premium to Just Eat’s closing share price on 21 October
2019 (the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which Prosus                                                
believes compares favourably with precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context when
taking into account that the Just Eat share price on the day before the Offer Announcement (21
October 2019) of 589 pence already included a premium from the Takeaway.com Offer. The
Increased Offer also represents a 10.4 per cent. premium to the initial offer of 670p made to the Just
Eat Board by Prosus. Further, the value of the Increased Offer comes at a premium to the value of the
Takeaway.com Offer when it was announced of 731 pence, which was recommended by the Just Eat
Board. Prosus encourages the Just Eat Board to recognise the superior value of Prosus’s Increased
Offer.

The Increased Offer is superior to the look through value of the Takeaway.com Offer and provides
certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the significant risks associated with
swapping into the shares of a company currently trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than
Just Eat’s own unaffected multiple.

2.1       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for a business that is
          facing substantial challenges

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, it is currently
facing significant challenges. Just Eat’s historically strong market positions are being eroded by
intensifying competition in the UK and other core markets, including Spain and Italy, with market
share loss recently accelerating in a number of markets. Just Eat has seen UK year-on-year order
growth deteriorate substantially from 30.9 per cent. in 2016 to 8 per cent. in Q3 2019 and UK EBITDA
margin decrease from 51.4 per cent. in 2016 to 35.2 per cent. in H1 2019. Just Eat has lost its leading
position in five of its thirteen markets. Unsurprisingly, shareholder returns have similarly suffered -
over the last two years Just Eat has delivered a negative shareholder return of -15.6 per cent. (versus
+4.3 per cent. for FTSE 350).

While the Just Eat price on the day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement (21 October
2019) was 589 pence, in Prosus’s view there is significant further downside risk to this share price.
The Just Eat Board has now acknowledged that increased investment is required and that this “may
impact” profitability. This statement was made after Prosus’s Offer Announcement and is not reflected
in the current Just Eat share price, which Prosus believes has decoupled from fundamentals and is
currently trading on M&A speculation. In a comparable context, Grubhub has seen significant
derating, and is now trading at 2.9x 2020 revenues – if Just Eat were trading at this multiple, the
illustrative share price would be 526 pence to which Prosus’s Increased Offer represents an
illustrative 40.7 per cent. premium (calculated by multiplying Just Eat’s consensus 2020 revenue by
2.9x and applying Just Eat’s enterprise value to equity bridge of -£31 million to get an illustrative
equity value of £3,614 million, then dividing by Just Eat’s fully diluted shares of 687 million to get an
illustrative share price of 526 pence per share).(1)

Prosus believes Takeaway.com’s claims about the lack of comparability between Just Eat’s and
Grubhub’s situations are flawed and fail to appreciate the competitive dynamics the two companies
are facing. Both companies are marketplace incumbents with a history of market leadership and
strong profitability. Both have been disrupted by intensifying competition from well-funded and rapidly
growing entrants operating an own-delivery led model. Despite attempts to defend their position by
rolling out own-delivery operations both companies have continued to lose market share and
experience slowing growth and decreased profitability.

(1)     This calculation is illustrative and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
      the Takeover Code
                                                       
2.2       Prosus’s Increased Offer takes into account significant investments required in own-
          delivery, product, technology and marketing

Prosus believes Just Eat has underinvested in addressing the challenges outlined above, with only
£51 million invested in growth initiatives in 2018, substantially less than peers including iFood,
Grubhub and Delivery Hero. Prosus believes that this underinvestment has prevented Just Eat from
effectively transitioning to a hybrid model.

In Prosus’s view the 25 per cent. share of own-delivery orders that the Just Eat Board quotes masks
Just Eat’s lack of traction with its own-delivery rollout as it represents a blend of Canada (acquired by
Just Eat in December 2016) with 100 per cent. own-delivery and other geographies where own-
delivery represented only 7.8 per cent. of orders in H1 2019. Notably, within Just Eat’s portfolio,
Canada (100 per cent. own-delivery), and Brazil (greater than 20 per cent. own-delivery) exhibit vastly
superior growth compared to other assets such as UK, Spain and Italy where Just Eat is losing
market share at an accelerating pace to own-delivery competitors with a superior customer
proposition.

Just Eat’s track record in Australia and New Zealand starkly demonstrates how underinvestment can
erode value. Just Eat acquired Menulog in May 2015 for £421 million. Prosus believes Menulog was
slow to react to the intensifying competitive pressure after Deliveroo and Uber Eats entered the
market, investing less than £10 million in 2018 to enhance its proposition. As a result, Menulog lost
market leadership and market share and suffered declining revenue. In 2017 Just Eat incurred a £180
million impairment relating to Menulog, and current broker consensus for Menulog’s SOTP value is
£104 million, 75 per cent. below the acquisition price.

This is in contrast to Brazil, where, with Prosus’s operating support and investment (in 2018, Prosus
announced an additional investment commitment of US$400 million in iFood) in partnership with Just
Eat, iFood has been able to swiftly react to competitive pressures, rapidly building out its own-delivery
capabilities and accelerating its growth.

As consistently stated by Prosus, and now acknowledged by Just Eat’s Board, Just Eat requires
increased investment, which Prosus intends to make in own-delivery, marketing, product and
technology. This investment need is taken into account in the value of the Increased Offer.

2.3       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides certainty whilst the Takeaway.com Offer carries
          significant risks for Just Eat Shareholders

The Takeaway.com Offer carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders with Takeaway.com’s
current share price of €86.50 marginally below its all-time high. Takeaway.com is trading at 9.9x
2020E enterprise value/revenue, two to three times the level of peers. This is in the context of
Takeaway.com’s Q3 2019 order growth slowing to 15 per cent. for the Netherlands and 21 per cent.
for Germany (by comparison, Prosus’s food assets are growing at 320 per cent. for Swiggy, 122 per
cent. for iFood and 92 per cent. for Delivery Hero). At these valuation levels, Prosus believes that
there is little room for execution missteps, further growth slowdown or increased competition.

Immediately prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price
was €44.90. Prosus believes that one of the key drivers of Takeaway.com’s strong share price
performance since the transaction has been an increase in the share of orders from Low Competition
Markets, which has increased from 37 per cent. in the nine months to September 2018 to 65 per cent.
in H1 2019. Combining with Just Eat would reduce Takeaway.com’s share of orders in Low
Competition Markets to 28 per cent., (2) which is materially below pre-Germany deal levels. Prosus
believes that this indicates that there is a very meaningful downside risk to the valuation of the
combined entity.
(2)   Based on H1 2019 orders

                                                
The limited synergies that Takeaway.com and Just Eat have announced represent just 1.6 per cent.
of the combined cost base. These limited synergies do not, in Prosus’s view, compensate for the risks
outlined above. These synergies also primarily come from “operational and technology efficiency”,
which Prosus believes relies on the 3 per cent. headcount reductions referenced by Takeaway.com.
This is in contrast to Prosus’s focus on investment.

2.4     Takeaway.com’s playbook developed in Germany and the Netherlands would not
        address Just Eat’s challenges

Prosus believes that Takeaway.com takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally
on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany. These markets have so far been relatively
insulated from innovative and well-funded global own-delivery competitors meaning Takeaway.com
has limited experience of competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.

In contrast, in the UK both Uber Eats and Deliveroo have been operating at scale for years with large
and growing market share and consumers have come to expect the superior selection and service
quality these platforms deliver. As just one example, 20 of the Tripadvisor top 50 ranked restaurants
in London are listed on Deliveroo or Uber Eats, compared to six of 50 listed on Just Eat. Prosus
believes this illustrates the ability of innovative own-delivery platforms to unlock superior selection for
customers, leading to increasing variety / frequency of delivery occasions and ultimately superior
growth compared to underinvesting marketplace incumbents.

Prosus believes that the severe market share loss suffered by Menulog in Australia at the hands of
the same two own-delivery competitors provides a cautionary tale for Just Eat in the UK and other
markets. If the consumer demand for superior selection and service quality provided through the own-
delivery model is not addressed, then Just Eat Shareholders may well face the same reality of
meaningful market share loss and value erosion, but on a much larger scale.

Prosus does not believe Takeaway.com is well-positioned to help Just Eat address this challenge. In
both Berlin and Amsterdam, Takeaway.com offers only four of the Tripadvisor top 50 restaurants on
its platforms. While this marketplace-driven approach has so far worked in Takeaway.com’s markets
given the absence or lack of focus of global own-delivery competitors, Prosus believes the UK
situation is different and Takeaway.com’s playbook will not help address the significantly higher
customer expectations in Just Eat’s markets.

2.5     Takeaway.com is not the right partner to help Just Eat transition to an own-delivery
        focused hybrid model

The Just Eat Board is now acknowledging that building a hybrid own-delivery / marketplace model is
required for long-term success. Takeaway.com has very limited own-delivery experience and no
meaningful track record, with an own-delivery order share of just 4.9 per cent. Takeaway.com’s
management has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable, which in Prosus’s view is not true and reflects Takeaway.com’s lack of own-
delivery experience and narrow view of the food delivery industry restricted to the European markets
Takeaway.com operates in. Prosus is confident that the own-delivery model is profitable at scale, as
shown by the performance of Swiggy, Just Eat Canada, Meituan Dianping and Wolt, which profitably
operates an own-delivery model in a number of European markets.

Furthermore, Just Eat and Takeaway.com appear not to be aligned on own-delivery strategy. Just Eat
plans to leverage their “world-class Skip technology and operational know-how to build own-delivery
capabilities” while Takeaway.com intends to roll-out its “Scoober restaurant delivery services in the                                             
UK”. Just Eat and Takeaway.com also appear to disagree on the expected impact of such growth
investments on profitability. Just Eat acknowledges the potentially negative impact on profitability,
whilst Takeaway.com claims that the roll out of own delivery (Scoober) will have “no material negative
impact on the bottom line”.

These contradictions demonstrate the reactive nature of Just Eat and Takeaway.com’s response to
the changing dynamics in the sector raised by Prosus and represent a lack of strategic alignment and
consistency, highlighting the operational execution risk attached to Takeaway.com’s offer. In contrast,
Prosus has been consistent throughout in its stated strategy for Just Eat.

Prosus believes that its initial Offer to Just Eat Shareholders provided fair and certain value.
The Increased Offer provides even more compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risk.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

3.      Financing of the Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Increased Offer will be financed by a bridge
loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders (the Original Lenders), providing for a term loan bridge facility. The proceeds of the bridge
facility will be used to fund the cash consideration payable by MIH to Just Eat Shareholders in
connection with the Increased Offer. Prosus has secured the fully committed bridge financing from the
Original Lenders.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources
available to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat
Shareholders under the terms of the Increased Offer.

4.      How to accept the Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Revised Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and conditions
to, the Increased Offer together with the associated revised form of acceptance (the Revised Form of
Acceptance) will be posted to Just Eat Shareholders and be made available, subject to certain
restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat, in due course.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat
Shares, should complete either (i) the Form of Acceptance accompanying the Offer Document
dated 11 November 2019? or (ii) the Revised Form of Acceptance which will accompany the
Revised Offer Document to be posted in due course.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated
shares should do so electronically through CREST.

Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, Just Eat Shareholders who have already accepted the Offer
will automatically be deemed to have accepted the Increased Offer, by virtue of their prior
acceptance and do not need to take any further action.                                                  
If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Offer Document, please contact the
Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370 707 1066
(if calling from outside the UK). Lines are open Monday to Friday 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. (London
time).

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

5.         Level of acceptances and disclosure of interests in relevant securities

As at 3.00 p.m. on 6 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Offer in respect of
12,295 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0018 per cent. of the current issued share
capital of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own any
Just Eat Shares.

The percentages of Just Eat Shares referred to in this announcement are based on a figure of
682,985,706(3) Just Eat Shares in issue on 6 December 2019.

(3)   Basic shares outstanding

6.         General

not form part of this announcement.

Code, the Panel, the Listing Rules, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.

The Increased Offer will be being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Revised Offer
Document, which will contain further information about the Increased Offer.

This Announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

                                                   
Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.



No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

            calculated by multiplying the offered amount of 740 pence in cash per Just Eat Share by Just
            Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

(d)         The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,127,131 shares (as published by Just Eat in
            its circular to shareholders dated 25 November 2019).

(e)         The references made to Just Eat’s Board acknowledging the need for additional investment
            refer to the Chairman’s Letter as published by Just Eat in the circular to its shareholders
            dated 25 November 2019.

(f)         The values of the Takeaway.com Offer are calculated as:

      i.         the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 21 October 2019 of 594 pence per Just Eat
                 Share is obtained by:

            a)       dividing Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 as at 21 October 2019 (being the
                     last Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement) by the exchange rate
                     of £:€ of £1:€1.165 as at 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the
                     date of the Offer Announcement) as derived from data provided by Bloomberg; and

            b)       multiplying the number obtained by the exchange ratio of 0.09744 Takeaway.com
                     Shares per Just Eat Share as set out in the announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of
                     the City Code released on 5 August 2019 in connection with the Takeaway.com
                     Offer; and

      ii.        the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 26 July 2019 of 731 pence is taken from the
                 announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the City Code released on 5 August 2019 in
                 connection with the Takeaway.com Offer.

(g)         Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

      i.         Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
                 US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
                 US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue
                 reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million; and

      ii.        the illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiples
                 is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or
                 profit forecast under the Takeover Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise
                 value / 2020 revenue multiple (as calculated above) of 2.9x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus
                 revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below) to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of
                 £3,699 million, and using net debt of £32 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million to                                                   
                 obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,614 million. Dividing by shares outstanding of 687
                 million obtains the illustrative share price of 526 pence per share.

(h)          Shareholder returns have been sourced from Bloomberg and reference the period from 21
             October 2016 to 21 October 2019.

(i)          Prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price was
             €44.90 (as at 20 December 2018).

(j)          Just Eat invested £51 million in growth initiatives in 2018 according to their H1 2019 investor
             presentation. This compares to a US$400 million multi-year investment commitment
             announced in November 2018 for iFood, US$200 million in marketing and delivery expansion
             in 2018 for Grubhub, and €350 million in growth initiatives in 2019 for Delivery Hero.

(k)          The less than £10 million investment in Menulog by Just Eat referenced by Prosus is calculated
             as their £19 million investment in Canada and Australia announced in Just Eat’s 2018 annual
             report, less the £12 million uEBITDA loss in Canada reported in their 2018 annual report. The
             Menulog writedown of £180 million was reported in Just Eat’s 2017 annual report. Menulog’s
             broker valuation of £104 million is the arithmetic average of the value assigned to Australia
             and New Zealand by those brokers available to Prosus which provide an SOTP valuation of
             Just Eat dated after 31 July 2019 (that being the date of Just Eat’s H1 2019 results). These
             brokers include:

       i.        Barclays (1 August 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019) and Macquarie (6
                 August 2019);

      ii.        the minimum ANZ valuation estimate per the consensus is £76 million, the maximum is
                 £128 million, and the arithmetic average is £104 million; and

      iii.       in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
                 with the agreement or the approval of Takeaway.com.

(l)          The source for Just Eat own-delivery orders referenced by Prosus is Just Eat’s H1 2019
             results presentation.

(m)          The source for Takeaway.com own-delivery orders referenced by Prosus is Takeaway.com’s
             H1 2019 results presentation.

(n)          Takeaway.com all time high share price is based on €86.85 (30 August 2019) which is
             defined as the highest Close Price on any given day after its first trading day following IPO on

             enterprise value of €5,481 million is calculated as Takeaway.com's equity value of €5,294
             million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.2 million as per the Just Eat Scheme
             Document and share price of €86.50 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of €166 million,

The Boards of Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) note the
publication earlier today of Just Eat's circular and Takeaway.com’s announcement in response to
MIH’s cash offer for Just Eat (the Prosus Offer). Neither of these documents change Prosus’s view
that the Prosus Offer is superior to the Takeaway.com Offer and removes the downside risk for
shareholders in Just Eat, a business that requires substantial investment to defend its position and
capitalise on its long-term opportunity.

Prosus continues to believe that Just Eat’s proposed combination with Takeaway.com will not fully
or effectively address the investment needs of Just Eat in the areas of product, technology,
marketing and own delivery capabilities.

Prosus will continue to engage with Just Eat shareholders to outline its reasons for recommending
that Just Eat Shareholders reject the Takeaway.com combination. Prosus urges Just Eat
Shareholders to accept the Prosus Offer as soon as possible and, in any event, by no later
than the First Closing Date, being 1.00pm (London time) on 11 December 2019.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, said:

""While historically Just Eat has been a strong business, today it is at an important inflection point.
Just Eat's board is now acknowledging the increased investment required and the impact that this
will have on their profit pool, but in our view continues to underestimate the severity of the
competitive pressure and the urgency of the investment need. We continue to believe that the
Takeaway.com offer represents significant risk to Just Eat shareholders based on Takeaway.com’s
very high multiple and the level of investment required to address what customers now expect.

We continue to believe our offer is the right one for Just Eat shareholders and provides compelling
and certain value.”

Further information

This announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not
constitute or form part of, an offer, invitation, inducement or the solicitation of an offer to purchase,
otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect
of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any

any securities pursuant to the Offer in any jurisdiction in contravention of any applicable laws.

The Offer is subject to English law and to the applicable requirements of the City Code, the Panel,
the Listing Rules, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.

The Offer is being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Offer Document (or, in the event
that the Offer is to be implemented by means of a Scheme, the Scheme Document), which, together
with the Form of Acceptance (in the case of certificated Just Eat Shares), contains the full terms
and conditions of the Offer, including details of how to accept the Offer. Just Eat Shareholders are

documentation in relation to the Offer carefully.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Offer to
persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and Wales and
the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into whose
possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or
the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Offer or
to accept or procure the acceptance of the Offer, may be affected by the laws of the relevant
jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding such
matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant jurisdiction
without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the laws
and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
companies and other persons involved in the Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for any
violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable transaction
under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in,
into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or
other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any
facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance
of the Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Offer will not be capable of
acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that
jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Offer
are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded,
distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do
so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including
agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send
them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would
violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme
by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance from or
within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of
the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales are contained in the Offer Document.

Notice to US investors

The Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and
compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act,
and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Offer is being made in the United States by MIH and no one
else.

The Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure and
other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Offer will comply with the
relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the Offer is
implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses
or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made they
would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private
transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as
required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and
will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In
addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US
Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their
affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock
Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal
and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as
required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and
will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To
the extent that such information is made public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly
disclosed in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the
tax consequences of the Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States federal,
state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws
of the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or
Just Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of
US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective
directors, officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Offer or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in
the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will
be made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or
instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange
of, the United States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in
accordance with the tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of
such other country, as the case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such
requirements.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward-looking statements,
including with respect to the Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are
not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from
the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be
forward-looking statements. Without limitation, forward-looking statements often include words
such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”,
“outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”,
“estimates”, “will look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance
or the negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain
actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken,
occur or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and
uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to
events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the
context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and
developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or
implied in any forward-looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this announcement. Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on
behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and
estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and no assurance can be given that such
opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or
written forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective
members, directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this
section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers
and any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-
looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their
legal or regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any
obligation, and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period.
No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow
from operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged
Group (as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed
the historic published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or
dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be,
solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer
period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions
in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii)
any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule
8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day
following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m.
(London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities
exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the
offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening
Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code,
any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the
offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the
person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror.
A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests
and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree
company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have
previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the
date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or
understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for
the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when
the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the
Panel’s Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you
are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

Interim results announcement

Commentary
The past six months have been transformational for the Naspers group. We completed several significant strategic 
initiatives to transition Naspers to a 100% consumer internet company.

Notably, on 11 September 2019, we listed our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam as Prosus N.V. 
(Prosus), comprising our international internet interests outside of South Africa, including operations and 
investments in online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech, etail, travel, education, and social 
and internet platforms. Prosus also has a secondary, inward listing on the JSE Limited (JSE) in South Africa. 
Prosus is 73.84% owned by Naspers with a free float of 26.16%. As Europe's largest listed consumer internet 
company by asset value, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to our portfolio of international 
internet assets through exposure to China, India and other high-growth markets, as well as to the global tech 
sector. At the end of the review period, the listing has already unlocked around US$10bn of value for 
shareholders by reducing the discount to the combined net asset value of Prosus and Naspers.     

Another significant moment was successfully listing our Video Entertainment business (MultiChoice Group) on the 
JSE in February 2019. This also unlocked over US$4bn of value for our shareholders and created another listed 
South African champion on the JSE. Accordingly, all income statement information from continuing operations 
excludes the contribution from MultiChoice Group which was reported as a discontinued operation in the 
previous financial year.

Tencent delivered a good financial performance. A strong performance in areas such as payments and cloud 
bodes well for continued growth over the long term. Tencent's expanding ecosystem continues to drive 
very strong user engagement which is significantly ahead of local and international peers. This positions 
Tencent well to continue to offer a number of new products and services for its users. In ecommerce all 
key segments made good progress against financial and strategic objectives in the period, and we believe 
each segment will continue to benefit from sectoral growth trends. The Classifieds as well as Payments and 
Fintech segments have now reached profitability at their cores and continue to grow strongly while investing 
to drive future growth. Food Delivery was the most significant investment area in the period. We believe 
this industry fits well into our strategy as it targets a significant consumer need that can be 
fundamentally transformed by technology. In addition, food delivery allows for strong local players, 
which suits our DNA. Encouragingly, investment in the period supported strong revenue and order growth. 
Food Delivery will remain the largest investment area for the group this year, underscoring our confidence 
in the strong underlying unit economics of this business.

As a result of these initiatives, the 2020 financial year reflects a streamlined group, with virtually all 
revenues now generated from online activities.

Naspers delivered solid results for the six months ended 30 September 2019. Group revenue, measured on an
economic-interest basis, was US$10.2bn, reflecting growth of 11% (or 20% in local currency, adjusted for
acquisitions and disposals). Measured similarly, and including the stepped-up investment in Food Delivery, group
trading profit grew 6% year on year (or 9% in local currency, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) to
US$1.9bn. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy 13% (18%) year on year. Driven by Classifieds, Etail (online retail), 
and Payments and Fintech, the ecommerce business posted a strong performance. Overall revenue growth in ecommerce, 
adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, grew a strong 27% in local currency, led by a strong performance in the 
Food Delivery segment which grew orders 110% and revenues by 69% (69% in local currency, adjusted for acquisitions 
and disposals). On a nominal basis, revenue grew 5%. Tencent's profitability improved by 11% (16%) year on year. 
Trading losses in ecommerce rose to US$433m, reflecting our investment in Food Delivery to grow the markets in 
which we operate and sustain our leading positions. Excluding this increased investment, ecommerce trading losses 
reduced by a healthy 26% or US$54m. 

Core headline earnings from continuing operations were US$1.7bn - up 8% (10%) on the back of improving 
profitability in Tencent and the more established ecommerce businesses. Trading profits in the Classifieds 
business reduced marginally year on year due to our investment in convenient transactions. However, in local 
currency, excluding acquisitions and disposals, trading profits increased on improved performance by letgo and 
higher trading profits from Avito. Year-on-year growth will continue to improve throughout the year, driven by 
strong revenue growth from growth in listings and margin improvement. Classifieds' revenue from convenient 
transactions grew nearly fivefold from the prior year. Our other ecommerce assets also continued to scale, 
with Etail's trading losses more than halving. In contrast, the Payments and Fintech business's trading loss 
margin increased from 12% last year to 19% in the current year. This was driven by continued improvement in 
profitability in the core payment services provider (PSP) business, offset by the investment in the payments 
platform technology. Outside the core PSP business, our Payments and Fintech businesses continue to invest 
to build a credit offering, primarily in India, which we believe has significant growth potential. 

We invested US$377m to accelerate growth and scale in several existing and new businesses. Notably: through
PayU, an investment of US$66m in Wibmo to expand our Indian footprint in payment security, mobile payment
solutions and processing services; and US$45m in Red Dot Payments, providing payment solutions across Asia. 
In Classifieds, we increased our exposure to the fast-growing Southeast Asian market with a stake in Carousell, 
one of the world's largest and fastest-growing classifieds marketplaces. Ventures invested US$80m in Meesho Inc.,
a leading social commerce online marketplace in India, and another US$25m in our education associate Brainly.

We had a strong net cash position of US$5.9bn.This comprises US$9.1bn of cash and cash equivalents
(including short-term cash investments) and primarily reflects proceeds retained from the Flipkart disposal and 
sale of Tencent shares in the 2018 financial year. We had US$3.2bn of interest-bearing debt, excluding capitalised
leases.This resulted in net interest income of US$40m. Following the announcement of the Just Eat offer, Prosus
secured a bridge loan facility that will be used to finance the cash consideration payable under this offer.
Naspers is fully committed to its investment-grade rating and confident it will have sufficient capacity at its
current ratings level to assume this additional debt to finance the offer. Prosus plans to replace the bridge
loan facility with long-term funding through new debt capital and using existing cash resources. 

The progress of our core segments, which are growing fast and scaling well, gives us confidence in our
ability to continue identifying opportunities to unlock significant value.

Consolidated free cash inflow was US$19m compared to the prior-year inflow of US$153m, from continuing
operations (thus excluding Video Entertainment). This change reflects the increased investment in the Food 
Delivery business as well as negative working-capital effects related primarily to merchant cash timing differences
and transaction costs incurred in unbundling MultiChoice Group and listing Prosus. Dividend income received from
Tencent increased US$45m to US$377m.

We adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases in the current period on a prospective basis and,
accordingly, comparative information has not been restated.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION




        STATEMENT REGARDING TAKEAWAY.COM N.V. (“TAKEAWAY.COM”) OFFER
                                DOCUMENT

The boards of Prosus N.V. (“Prosus”) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (“MIH”) note the
publication of the offer document in respect of the Takeaway.com Offer, the financial terms of which
are unchanged from those contained in Takeaway.com’s announcement on 5 August 2019.

Prosus makes the following points in response to the Takeaway.com Offer:

    •    Prosus believes that Takeaway.com takes a narrow view of the Food Delivery sector based
         principally on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany – markets that have so far
         been relatively insulated from innovative global own-delivery competitors. On the other
         hand, in the UK both Uber Eats and Deliveroo have been operating at scale for several
         years, and consumers have come to expect superior restaurant selection and service
         quality that Prosus believes would be difficult for Just Eat to match without substantial
         investment and innovation.

    •    Takeaway.com continues to underestimate the scale of Just Eat’s required transformation
         and the investment needed in own-delivery, marketing, product and technology. In
         particular, Takeaway.com’s claim that it can achieve a meaningful own-delivery rollout with
         no impact on the bottom line and through only tens of millions of investment is, in Prosus’s
         view, unrealistic and demonstrates their lack of experience with the own-delivery business
         model.

    •    The Takeaway.com Offer creates significant risks for Just Eat’s shareholders:
             o   Takeaway.com is trading at the highest valuation multiples amongst its peers.
                 Prosus believes that at these valuation levels there is little room for any slowdown
                 or missteps in execution.

             o   In the absence of required investment, Prosus believes that Just Eat’s operational
                 underperformance is likely to continue, putting the combined valuation under
                 pressure, as highlighted in a similar context in the US where Grubhub suffered a
                 43% share price decline in a day following its Q3 2019 results.

                                                                                            
Prosus will continue to engage with Just Eat shareholders to outline its reasons for recommending
that Just Eat shareholders reject the Takeaway.com combination. Prosus urges Just Eat
shareholders to accept the Prosus Offer as soon as possible and, in any event, by no later
than the First Closing Date, being 1.00pm (London time) on 11 December 2019.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, said:

“We are excited about the prospect of adding Just Eat to our portfolio of leading global Food
Delivery businesses and believe we are best positioned to address both the market opportunity and
the challenges facing the company. Prosus is at the forefront of the global transformation in Food
Delivery from marketplace to own-delivery and beyond, with the Food Delivery businesses in our
portfolio that are leaders in their markets delivering superior growth.

As a group, we have a proven track record in supporting the long-term growth and success of
companies that we invest in. As well as our ability to invest, we also bring the learning and expertise
we have gained over the past two decades across more than 120 countries and numerous leading
consumer internet businesses. We therefore believe that we are best positioned to help Just Eat
and its management team in the next phase of the company’s development.

Our cash offer provides compelling and certain value to shareholders at a premium to the
Takeaway.com Offer and removes the downside risk for Just Eat’s shareholders. Our offer also
reflects the substantial investment required in product, technology, marketing and own-delivery
capabilities to make the most of Just Eat’s long-term potential. We believe that the Takeaway.com
offer underestimates the substantial investment required in Just Eat to recapture market share and
improve performance in an increasingly competitive sector undergoing global transformation.”

applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate
in the Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Offer, may be affected by the laws of
the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt

or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable transaction
under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in,
into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or
other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any
facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance
of the Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Offer will not be capable of
acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that
jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Offer
are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded,
distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do
so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including
agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send
them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would
violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme
by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance from or
within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of
the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales are contained in the Offer Document.

Notice to US investors

The Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and
compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act,
and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Offer is being made in the United States by MIH and no one
else.

The Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure and
other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Offer will comply with the
relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the Offer is
implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses
or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made they
would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private
transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as
required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and
will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In
addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US
Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their
affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock
Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal
and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as
required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and
will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To
the extent that such information is made public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly
disclosed in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the
tax consequences of the Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States federal,
state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws
of the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or
Just Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of
US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective
directors, officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Offer or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in
the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will
be made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or
instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange
of, the United States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in
accordance with the tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of
such other country, as the case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such
requirements.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward-looking statements,
including with respect to the Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are
not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from
the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be
forward-looking statements. Without limitation, forward-looking statements often include words
such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”,
“outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”,
“estimates”, “will look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance
or the negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain
actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken,
occur or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and
uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to
events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the
context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and
developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or
implied in any forward-looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this announcement. Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on
behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and
estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and no assurance can be given that such
opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or
written forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective
members, directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this
section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers
and any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-
looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their
legal or regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any
obligation, and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period.
No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow
from operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged
Group (as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed
the historic published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or
dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH or Neptune or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

                                                                                                
Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be,
solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer
period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions
in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii)
any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule
8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day
following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m.
(London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities
exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the
offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening
Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code,
any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the
offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the
person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror.
A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests
and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree
company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have
previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the
date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or
understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for
the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when
the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the
Panel’s Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you
are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

statements for the six months ended 30 September 2019.

During the 2019 financial year the group distributed its interest in its video-entertainment business, MultiChoice Group Limited
(MultiChoice Group), to its shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie (the distribution). Following the distribution, the
previous results of the video-entertainment segment were presented as results from discontinued operations. The prior period
income statement has been restated to distinguish between continuing and discontinued operations.

On 11 September 2019, the group listed its international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam. This listing created the largest
listed consumer internet company in Europe, Prosus N.V.(Prosus), comprising the group's internet interests outside of South
Africa. Prosus also has a secondary, inward listing on the JSE in South Africa. Prosus is 73.84% owned by Naspers.

Earnings per share in the current period is expected to be reduced significantly as the prior period's earnings per share included
the gain of US$1.6bn recognised on disposal of the group's interest in Flipkart Limited in September 2018, which is non-
recurring in September 2019. Earnings per share in the current period included a gain of approximately US$600m recognised
on disposal of the group's interest in MakeMyTrip Limited. In addition, fair-value gains on investments held by Tencent
(classified as at fair value through profit and loss) of approximately US$400m is expected to be substantially less than the gains
of US$1.4bn recognised in the prior period, resulting in headline earnings per share decreasing considerably.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline earnings per share from continuing operations
for the six months ended 30 September 2019 is expected to increase by between 27 and 38 cents per share (between 7.6%
and 10.7%). The abovementioned gains on disposals of investments and fair-value losses have been excluded from core
headline earnings.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in core headline earnings, earnings and headline earnings per share for the
year ended 30 September 2019 as compared to 30 September 2018 for both total operations (as previously reported) and
continuing operations in the tables below:

                                              KEY BENEFITS OF MIH'S CASH OFFER

The following is a summary of the key benefits of MIH’s cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued
ordinary share capital of Just Eat.

•     Under the terms of the Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                                            710 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

•     The terms of the Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Just Eat at
      approximately £4.9 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

            o      20 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
                   on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business
                   Day before the date of the Announcement);

            o      20 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019
                   (being the last Business Day before the date of the Announcement); and

            o      12 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July 2019 (being
                   the last Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).

•     Since the start of the Offer Period the High-Growth Internet Sector has fallen 23.7 per cent. The
      Takeaway.com share price has fallen 12.4 per cent. during this period. Against this backdrop,
      continued market volatility and macro-economic uncertainty, the Offer provides Just Eat
      Shareholders with compelling and certain cash value at a premium to the Takeaway.com Offer.

•     MIH has reduced the level of acceptances required to satisfy the Acceptance Condition to 75 per
      cent. of the Just Eat Shares.

Overview of rationale for the Offer

•     Prosus believes that the Offer is attractive and fair for a business that requires substantial
      investment to defend its position and capitalise on its long-term opportunity.

             o      Since its inception, Just Eat has attained leading positions in many of the markets within
                    its footprint, and has for a number of years demonstrated profitable growth driven largely
                    by its best-in-class marketplace model.

             o      In recent years, Just Eat’s share price has come under pressure reflecting weakening
                    operational and financial performance, most recently highlighted by Just Eat's Q3 Trading
                    Update. Prosus believes that this is a result of Just Eat underinvesting to adapt to
                    consumer expectations, which has opened the door for well-funded own-delivery
                    challengers (e.g. Deliveroo, Uber Eats) and allowed them to rapidly gain market share in
                    Just Eat’s core markets.

             o      Prosus believes that Just Eat requires substantial investment in product, technology,
                    marketing and own-delivery capabilities to shift to an own-delivery focused hybrid model
                    (i.e. own-delivery and marketplace), protect its market position and capitalise on its long-
                    term opportunity. Prosus believes that financial markets1 are underestimating the urgency                                                        
                    of the requirement for and the scale of this transformation and its likely financial impact on
                    Just Eat. These risks to Just Eat Shareholders were highlighted in a similar context in the
                    US by Grubhub, which Prosus believes faces similar challenges from well-funded own-
                    delivery challengers and changing consumer behaviour, when Grubhub's share price
                    declined 43 per cent. in a single day following the release of Grubhub's Q3 trading update
                    on 28 October 2019.

•     Prosus believes that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will not fully or effectively
      address the challenges Just Eat is facing.

             o     Takeaway.com executives have consistently expressed pessimism about the merits of the
                   own-delivery business model. Takeaway.com’s own-delivery proposition Scoober
                   represented less than five per cent. of Takeaway.com’s reported total orders in the first
                   half of 2019.

             o     Takeaway.com’s valuation was near an all-time high when it made its offer for Just Eat,
                   with Takeaway.com trading at the highest multiples amongst its peers.2 Prosus believes
                   that the use of highly valued shares to acquire a business facing significant competitive
                   challenges presents significant downside risk for Just Eat Shareholders.

•     Prosus, with its global experience and own-delivery expertise, is best positioned to assist Just Eat
      and its management in the next phase of its development.

             o     Prosus is one of the leading global operators and investors in the Online Food Delivery
                   Sector, having invested approximately US$2.8 billion in the sector since FY16 to build a
                   portfolio of leading Food Delivery businesses.

             o     Having identified early the strategic need to invest in own-delivery capabilities, Prosus has
                   a long and successful track record of investing in and building out market-leading hybrid
                   and own-delivery businesses in some of the largest Food Delivery markets globally.

             o     Prosus has a long-standing track record of partnering with existing leadership teams to
                   successfully build and scale businesses. Prosus has focused on the long-term success of
                   its portfolio companies, supporting them with the investment required to compete
                   effectively.

             o     Prosus and Just Eat are partners in Brazil today through their iFood joint venture and both
                   companies and their management teams have worked in close collaboration and built a
                   long-standing relationship as co-investors in the business. Given the successful track
                   record and momentum of iFood, the proposed transaction is the logical next step in the
                   relationship between the two companies.

•     The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading
      Food Delivery business. Through this proposed acquisition, Prosus will back Just Eat’s
      management team and employees and support the next phase of Just Eat’s development. Prosus
      has the conviction and financial resources to invest in Just Eat’s product, technology, marketing
      and own-delivery capabilities and help Just Eat achieve its long-term potential, whilst also targeting
      an appropriate risk adjusted return on invested capital for Prosus shareholders.

Notice to US investors

The Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and
compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and
Regulation 14E thereunder. The Offer is being made in the United States by MIH and no one else.

The Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure and other
procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and procedural
requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and
timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Offer will comply with the
relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures, particularly
with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Offer, before
or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the Offer is implemented by
way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise
withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be made
outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at
negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US
Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the
Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London
Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK
practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and
Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal
traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing
activities consistent with their respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information
about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to
a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this Announcement and the Offer Document has been prepared in
accordance with accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and
may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial
statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Offer
may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable United
States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat Shareholder is urged to
consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Offer
applicable to them, including under applicable United States federal, state and local, as well as non-US
and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Offer or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the
United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not
based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts included in this Announcement may be forward looking
statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,

“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this Announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this Announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this Announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this Announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance
or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements
in this Announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory
obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and
Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and
each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this Announcement or incorporated by reference into this
Announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this Announcement or incorporated by reference into this Announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the

identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at

Cash Offer For Just Eat plc by Prosus N.V. through Its Wholly-Owned Indirect Subsidiary MIH
Food Delivery Holdings B.V.

Summary

•      The board of Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announces the terms of a cash offer pursuant to which its
       wholly-owned subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) shall offer to acquire the entire
       issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Offer).

•      Prosus has recently approached the board of directors of Just Eat with a number of indicative
       proposals to acquire Just Eat. Prosus and the Just Eat board have not managed to reach
       agreement. Consequently, Prosus is making this announcement in order to give Just Eat
       Shareholders the opportunity to consider the Offer.

•      Under the terms of the Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                           710 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

•      The terms of the Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Just
       Eat at approximately £4.9 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

           o   20 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share
               based on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business
               Day before the date of this Announcement) of €71.00;

           o   20 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019
               (being the last Business Day before date of this Announcement); and

           o   12 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July 2019
               (being the last Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).


Background to and reasons for the Offer
                                                


•   Having had access to, and reviewed, certain due diligence information made available by Just
    Eat in accordance with the City Code, Prosus believes that the terms of its all-cash Offer provide
    certainty and compelling value for Just Eat Shareholders. Since the start of the Offer Period the
    High Growth Internet Sector and Online Food Delivery Sector have fallen 16.9 per cent. and
    15.0 per cent. respectively. The Takeaway.com Share Price has fallen 15.0 per cent. during
    this period. Against this backdrop, continued market volatility and macro-economic uncertainty,
    the Prosus Offer provides Just Eat Shareholders the certainty of an all-cash Offer.

•   Just Eat operates a global marketplace for food delivery operating across 13 markets. Just Eat
    has leading market positions in many of these markets, with a history of profitable growth driven
    largely by its best in class marketplace model. We understand that Just Eat management
    considers growing its own delivery proposition an important part of their strategy for the
    business.

•   Based on Prosus’s global experience and having met Just Eat management and reviewed the
    information provided, Prosus believes that the business will require substantial investment, in
    excess of that planned by Just Eat management. Prosus believes that this investment is
    required to enhance product, technology and own delivery capabilities in order to maintain its
    growth and defend its market positions in the face of intense competition. Just Eat’s Q3 Trading
    Update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to
    accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage.

•   Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will fully or
    effectively address this investment need. Whilst Takeaway.com has invested in its own delivery
    proposition Scoober, it represented only 4.9 per cent. of Takeaway.com’s reported total orders
    in the first half of 2019. Furthermore, Takeaway.com executives have publicly expressed their
    lack of conviction in the ability of own-delivery operations to break even in either Continental
    Europe or the UK.

•   Prosus is one of the leading global operators and investors in the Food Delivery sector, with a
    portfolio of leading Food Delivery businesses and investments, including iFood, Delivery Hero
    and Swiggy. These businesses have a presence in over 40 countries with a number one
    position in 35 of these, and cover in excess of four billion people with over four hundred
    thousand restaurant partners.

•   Prosus has a strong track record of partnering with management teams to drive innovation and
    value creation and generate robust returns. Prosus has invested approximately US$2.8bn into
    the sector since FY16, and its investment and support have helped its portfolio companies to
    accelerate growth, product development and innovation. In Latin America, Prosus has
    supported iFood’s own delivery rollout, transforming it from a pure marketplace operator into
    the leading hybrid operator. In India, Prosus’s investment helped Swiggy to develop artificial
    intelligence technology to provide consumers with a personalised, local offering and develop
    new revenue opportunities such as cloud kitchens. Since Prosus’s investment, Delivery Hero
    has experienced strong growth, with Prosus generating an internal rate of return of c.19.3 per
    cent. as of 30 September 2019, on its investment.

•   Prosus intends to invest in Just Eat and believes that due to its global Food Delivery experience
    and own delivery expertise, it is better positioned to drive the next phase of Just Eat’s growth
    and deliver Just Eat’s long term potential.

•   The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading
    Food Delivery business and the next logical step for the longstanding, successful iFood
    investment partnership between Prosus and Just Eat in Latin America.
                                                                   

•   Prosus believes that with its support, Just Eat customers will ultimately benefit from greater
    choice and improved service delivery driven by the combined group’s global perspectives on
    product and technological innovation across the sector.

•   Prosus believes that its offer presents a compelling proposition to Just Eat Shareholders whilst
    delivering an appropriate return to Prosus shareholders.

General

•   If any dividend or other distribution is announced, declared, made, payable or paid in respect
    of the Just Eat Shares on or after the date of this Announcement and prior to all of the conditions
    to the Offer having been fulfilled or (if capable of waiver) waived and so long as the Offer
    remains open for acceptance, MIH reserves the right to reduce the consideration payable in
    respect of each Just Eat Share by the amount of all or part of any such dividend or other
    distribution. If MIH exercises this right or makes such a reduction in respect of a dividend or
    other distribution, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain that dividend or
    other distribution.

•   It is intended that the Offer will be implemented by way of a takeover offer under the City Code
    and within the meaning of Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006, further details of which are
    contained in the full text of this Announcement (and will be included in the Offer Document).
    However, MIH reserves the right, with the consent of the Panel, to implement the Offer by way

•   The Offer will be subject to the Conditions and certain further terms set out in Appendix I to this
    Announcement, including, amongst other things: (i) MIH receiving valid acceptances in respect
    of, or otherwise acquiring or agreeing to acquire (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise),
    shares which constitute not less than 90 per cent. (or such lesser percentage, as MIH may,
    decide after consultation with the Panel (if necessary)), being in any case more than 50 per
    cent. of the voting rights normally exercisable at a general meeting of Just Eat, including, for
    this purpose, any such voting rights attaching to Just Eat Shares that are unconditionally
    allotted or issued before the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional as to acceptances,
    whether pursuant to the exercise of any outstanding subscription or conversion rights or
    otherwise; and (ii) the receipt of merger control clearance (or the expiration or termination of
    any waiting period, as applicable) in Spain under the Spanish Competition Act.

•   The Offer Document and Form of Acceptance will include further details of the Offer and will
    specify the actions to be taken by Just Eat Shareholders. The Offer Document and Form of

    of principal events will be set out in the Offer Document.

•   Commenting on the Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

    “Prosus is one of the leading global operators in the Food Delivery sector having invested
    approximately US$2.8 billion across more than 40 markets since 2016 to build a global Food
    Delivery business in partnership with some of the leading players in the world, including iFood
    in Latin America, Swiggy in India, and Delivery Hero, which operates in 41 markets. We are
    very excited about the long-term potential of the Food Delivery space and it is a sector we are
    committed to.

    We believe our global experience and resources can help Just Eat to achieve its significant
    potential. Our plan is to support the Just Eat management team, with whom we have worked
    closely as joint investors in iFood, to deliver on the exciting opportunities to grow the business.
    We believe that Just Eat’s customers and restaurant partners will ultimately benefit from more
    delivery options, greater restaurant choice as well as improved service and delivery speeds
    driven by the combined group’s expertise in product and technology innovation supported by
    increased capital investment in the business. As a combined group, we see significant growth
    and value creation potential.

    We presented this idea to the Board of Just Eat, in good faith, but we have been unable to
    engage constructively in what we see as a compelling proposition for Just Eat shareholders.
    As an investor and operator with significant experience in this dynamic and competitive sector,
    both globally and on a local level, we believe we are best placed to support Just Eat through its
    next phase of essential investment. We aim to deliver value by eliminating operational
    execution risk and providing certainty for Just Eat’s shareholders today at an attractive
    premium.”

Notice to US investors

The Offer will be made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and
compliance with, Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Offer will be
made in the United States by MIH and no one else.

The Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure and other
procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and procedural
requirements.
                                                      
Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Offer will comply with the
relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures, particularly
with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

The Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Securities Act and Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act and Regulation 14E
thereunder. In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US
Exchange Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may
make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Offer, during the period in which the Offer would remain open for acceptance (or, if the Offer is
implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is
otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be
made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions
at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US
Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be
reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange
website at www.londonstockexchange.com.

Financial information included in this Announcement and the Offer Document has been or will be
prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as
applicable, and may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Offer
may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable United
States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat Shareholder is urged to
consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Offer
applicable to them, including under applicable United States federal, state and local, as well as non-US
and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities
laws, since Just Eat is organised under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised
under the laws of the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and
MIH are residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of
US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Offer or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the
United States.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not
based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts included in this Announcement may be forward looking
statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

22 October 2019




                                             CASH OFFER

                                                   for

                                            JUST EAT PLC

                                                   by

                                        PROSUS N.V.
         through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.




1.      Introduction

The board of Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announces the terms of a cash offer pursuant to which its wholly-
owned subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) shall offer to acquire the entire issued and to
be issued ordinary share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Offer).

Prosus has recently approached the board of directors of Just Eat with a number of indicative proposals
to acquire Just Eat. Prosus and the Just Eat board have not managed to reach agreement.
Consequently, Prosus is making this announcement in order to give Just Eat Shareholders the
opportunity to consider the Offer.

2.      The Offer

Under the terms of the Offer, which will be subject to the Conditions and certain further terms set out in
Appendix I and to the full terms and conditions which will be set out in the Offer Document, Just Eat
Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             710 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Just Eat at
approximately £4.9 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       20 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day before the
        date of this Announcement) of €71.00;

•       20 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019 (being
        the last Business Day before date of this Announcement); and
                                                   

•       12 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July 2019 (being the
        last Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).

The Offer is expected to become effective at the end of 2019 or early 2020, subject to satisfaction or
(where applicable) waiver of the Conditions and certain further terms set out in Appendix I to this
Announcement.

If any dividend or other distribution is announced, declared, made, payable or paid in respect of the Just
Eat Shares on or after the date of this Announcement and prior to all of the conditions to the Offer
having been fulfilled or (if capable of waiver) waived and so long as the Offer remains open for
acceptance, MIH reserves the right (without prejudice to any right MIH may have, with the consent of
the Panel, to invoke Condition 8(B) in Part A of Appendix I to this Announcement) at its sole discretion
to reduce the consideration payable in respect of each Just Eat Share by the amount of all or part of
any such dividend or other distribution. If MIH exercises this right or makes such a reduction in respect
of a dividend or other distribution, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain that
dividend or other distribution. Any exercise by MIH of its rights referred to in this paragraph 2 or
paragraph 10 of Part B of Appendix I to this Announcement shall be the subject of an announcement
and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not constitute a revision or variation of the terms of the Offer.

3.      Background to and reasons for the Offer

Prosus believes the Offer represents compelling and certain value for Just Eat Shareholders
which is superior to the current Takeaway.com Offer and reflects Prosus’s perspective on the
essential investments required to accelerate Just Eat’s growth strategy, strengthen its market
position and achieve its true long-term potential

Having had access to, and reviewed, certain due diligence information made available by Just Eat in
accordance with the City Code, Prosus believes that the terms of its all-cash Offer provide certainty and
compelling value for Just Eat Shareholders. Since the start of the Offer Period the High Growth Internet
Sector and Online Food Delivery Sector have fallen 16.9 per cent. and 15.0 per cent. respectively. The
Takeaway.com Share Price has fallen 15.0 per cent. during this period. Against this backdrop,
continued market volatility and macro-economic uncertainty, the Prosus Offer provides Just Eat
Shareholders the certainty of an all-cash Offer.

Just Eat operates a global marketplace for food delivery operating across 13 markets. Just Eat has
leading market positions in many of these markets, with a history of profitable growth driven largely by
its best in class marketplace model.

Based on Prosus’s global experience, and having met Just Eat management and reviewed the
information provided, Prosus believes that the business will require substantial investment, in excess
of that planned by Just Eat management, to enhance product, technology and own delivery capabilities.
Just Eat’s Q3 Trading Update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights
the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage.

Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will fully or effectively
address this investment need. Whilst Takeaway.com has invested in its own delivery proposition
Scoober, it only represented 4.9 per cent. of Takeaway.com’s reported total orders in the first half of
2019. Furthermore, Takeaway.com’s executives have publicly expressed their lack of conviction in the
ability of own-delivery operations to break even in either Continental Europe or the UK.

Prosus intends to invest in Just Eat’s business and believes that due to its global Food Delivery
experience and own delivery expertise, it is better positioned to drive the next phase of Just Eat’s growth
and deliver Just Eat’s long term potential.
                                                   

Prosus believes Just Eat will also benefit from the best practices, global insights and innovation that will
be shared across Prosus’s Food Delivery businesses.

Prosus is one of the leading global operators and investors in the Food Delivery sector, with its
businesses and investments having leading positions in some of the largest and most attractive
Food Delivery markets in the world

Prosus is a leading global technology investor, with a proven track record of creating long-term value
by building and scaling consumer internet businesses through organic growth and M&A.

Food Delivery is one of Prosus’s key sectors of focus. Prosus has invested approximately US$2.8bn in
the sector since FY16 to build a portfolio of leading Food Delivery businesses and investments,
including iFood, Delivery Hero and Swiggy. These businesses have presence in over 40 countries with
a number one position in 35 of these and cover in excess of four billion people with over four hundred
thousand restaurant partners.

Prosus believes that Food Delivery is a large, underpenetrated and growing market with significant
strategic potential for the Group and multiple growth opportunities.

Prosus aims to invest in and build large, market leading businesses that will shape the future of how
people around the world will source, consume and experience food. As one of the leading marketplaces
for Food Delivery, Just Eat has a key role to play in the future of the sector.

Prosus has a strong track record of partnering with management teams to drive innovation and
value creation and generate robust returns

Prosus has a long-standing track record of partnering with existing leadership teams to successfully
build and scale high growth, technology-enabled businesses. Prosus’s support and investment helped
its portfolio companies to accelerate product development and innovation and deliver superior value to
customers, restaurants and delivery partners.

As an example, Prosus has helped iFood to grow from a pure marketplace business with less than
100,000 monthly orders in 2013 to become the leading Food Delivery business in Brazil with more than
20 million monthly orders, 120,000 restaurant partners and 85,000 own delivery partners. With Prosus’s
support, iFood has been rapidly growing its own delivery service, and Prosus has recently announced
a US$400m investment in iFood to support its growth over the coming years.

With Prosus’s investment and support, Swiggy has built one of the leading and fastest growing Food
Delivery platforms in India serving more than 500 cities – and growing rapidly. Swiggy predominantly
operates an own-delivery model, and its platform is served by over 130,000 restaurant partners and
approximately 210,000 monthly active own delivery partners.

Prosus’s investment has also supported product innovation and the development of an artificial
intelligence (AI) driven platform to enable Swiggy to operate its hyperlocal Food Delivery platform at
scale. This AI platform helps to determine consumer demand in specific geographic areas and at certain
times of day, opening up opportunities for further innovative growth avenues such as cloud kitchens,
Swiggy private label brands and new services including convenience buying.

Since Prosus’s original investment in Delivery Hero, it has been experiencing strong recent growth,
increasing orders from 167 million per month in H1 2018 to 269 million per month in H1 2019, gross
merchandise value from €2.0 billion in H1 2018 to €3.2 billion in H1 2019 and segment revenue from
€292 million in H1 2018 to €582 million in H1 2019. So far, Prosus has generated an internal rate of
return on the Delivery Hero investment of c.19.3 per cent. as of 30 September 2019.
                                                                   

Through this potential acquisition, Prosus will back Just Eat’s management team and employees and
believes it will support the next phase of Just Eat’s innovation and growth.

Prosus believes that its offer presents a compelling proposition to Just Eat Shareholders whilst
delivering an appropriate return to Prosus shareholders.

The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading
Food Delivery business and the next logical step for the longstanding, successful iFood
investment partnership between Prosus and Just Eat in Latin America

Prosus’s vision is to build a leading global Food Delivery business with key strategic leadership
positions in some of the largest and most attractive takeaway markets globally with significant long-term
opportunities.

The addition of Just Eat will create a leading global Food Delivery business with a presence in over 50
Food Delivery markets and the number one position in over 40 of those markets. It also consolidates
Prosus’s ownership stake in iFood.

Prosus and Just Eat are joint venture partners in iFood today and both companies and their
management teams have worked in close collaboration and built a longstanding relationship as co-
investors in the business. Given the successful track record and momentum of iFood, the proposed
transaction is the next logical step in the longstanding relationship between both companies.

Prosus believes that with its support, Just Eat customers will ultimately benefit from greater
choice and improved service delivery driven by the combined group’s global perspectives on
product and technological innovation across the sector.

Prosus believes that, as a result of the acquisition of Just Eat and investment in Just Eat’s technology
and own delivery capabilities, customers will enjoy an improved experience and benefit from more
delivery options, greater restaurant choices and the best and latest technologies including machine
learning to improve customer service and delivery speeds.

Prosus’s current Food Delivery investments, iFood, Delivery Hero and Swiggy, are all using AI-enabled
technology to provide consumers with a personalised, local offering and to build next-generation Food
Delivery platforms. They also provide restaurants with marketing and visibility tools, help them optimise
their value chain, share data driven insights with them and provide them with order and delivery
technology.

4.        Information relating to Just Eat

The Just Eat Group operates a leading global hybrid marketplace for online Food Delivery, connecting
over 27 million consumers with more than 107,000 restaurant partners (2) across the UK, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and Brazil.

Founded in Denmark in 2001 by five entrepreneurs, Just Eat is a FTSE 100 listed company and one of
the leaders in online and mobile food ordering.(3) The Just Eat Group currently has over 3,600 full-time
employees spread across 19 offices throughout its operating markets. In 2018, the Just Eat Group
processed £4.2 billion worth of orders for its restaurant partners with an average of 2,107 orders per
restaurant.

The Just Eat Group derives its revenue principally from commissions paid by restaurant partners on
successful orders, service charges and delivery fees. Commission revenue is driven by the number of
orders placed, the average order value and commission rates, agreed with each restaurant. To a lesser
extent revenue is derived by eligible restaurant partners paying for promotional top placement on the
Just Eat Group’s platform and one-off connection fees to join the Just Eat Group’s network and other
services such as branded commodity products. The Just Eat Group’s core business model relies on
participating restaurants preparing food which either they deliver themselves, or the Just Eat Group
arranges delivery for, with the Just Eat Group’s platform serving as a source of consumers and orders,
and facilitating online payment processes.

Just Eat is the ultimate holding company of the Just Eat Group and a public company with limited liability
incorporated under the laws of, and is domiciled in, England and Wales. Just Eat is headquartered in
London, the United Kingdom. Just Eat is listed on the premium listing segment of the London Stock
Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.(4)

Prosus has a strong track record of investing in Food Delivery businesses and partnering with their local
management teams in more than 40 markets globally. With a strong position in 35 of those markets,
Prosus has significant expertise and global insights into this fast-developing industry.

Since FY16, Prosus has invested approximately US$2.8 billion to build a portfolio of strong Food
Delivery businesses and investments, including iFood (54.7 per cent. stake) – which is a market leader
in Brazil, Delivery Hero (22.3 per cent. stake) – which has a strong position in 33 of its 41 countries,
and Swiggy (38.8 per cent. stake) – which is one of the leading players in India. Prosus also holds
investments in Tencent (31.1 per cent. stake) – which is one of one of China’s most valuable companies,

in the food order and delivery sector through Meituan and Delivery Club (in China and Russia
respectively).

Looking forward, Prosus believes the global Food Delivery industry presents a large, underpenetrated
and growing market with strategic opportunities. For restaurants, it offers access to a larger customer
base, positioning them to benefit from incremental orders. For customers, it provides a local, large
selection of restaurants and food that is quickly and conveniently delivered. Prosus is investing to
accelerate the scale of its Food Delivery platforms, helping them to expand geographically into smaller
cities. It is also investing in its Food Delivery business to further build their technology platforms to utilise
data science and machine learning to continuously improve the service they provide to customers,
restaurants and couriers.

In FY19, the Food Delivery segment generated US$377 million in revenues and US$171 million in
trading loss, with revenue growth in local currency excluding acquisitions and disposals totalling 57 per
cent. The cumulative annualised gross merchandise value growth in the Food Delivery segment was
65 per cent. and cumulative annualised order volumes across all these companies increased by 100
per cent.

management teams. Through its investments Prosus has a presence in more than 40 markets globally.
With a leading position in many markets, Prosus has significant sectoral expertise and global insights
into this fast-developing industry. Prosus believes that there are meaningful opportunities to create
value through the acceleration of Just Eat’s growth strategy by sharing technology best practice from
elsewhere in the world, leveraging Prosus’s delivery expertise and increasing investment in developing
advanced product and technology and accelerating own delivery rollout. Prosus believes that with
Prosus’s support and investment, Just Eat’s customers will ultimately benefit from greater choice and
improved service delivery driven by the Prosus Group’s (as enlarged following the acquisition of Just
Eat) global perspective on product and technology innovation across the sector.

Prosus values Just Eat's strong brand and culture: Prosus already has a longstanding partnership with
Just Eat as co-investor in iFood in Brazil and regards the acquisition as a logical next step in their
relationship.

Prior to this Announcement, Prosus has been granted access to certain Just Eat information for the
purposes of conducting a confirmatory due diligence exercise. Following the Effective Date, Prosus
intends to consider carefully Just Eat’s business and operations in each of its markets and its plans for
those businesses. Prosus has not yet had access to sufficient information to make plans or make any
decisions in relation to actions regarding those markets and businesses.

Management and employees

Prosus attaches great importance to the skills and experience of the existing management and
employees of the Just Eat Group. Prosus plans to invest in Just Eat’s business and its employees. As
such, Prosus expects that existing employees of the Just Eat Group will benefit from the opportunities
that this investment will create as well as the best practice, global insights and innovation shared across
and within Prosus’s food businesses following the Effective Date, and will continue to contribute to the
success of Just Eat following the Effective Date.

Following the Effective Date, the existing contractual and statutory employment rights of the Just Eat
employees will be safeguarded and pension obligations complied with, in accordance with applicable
law. Based on the information Prosus has been provided with, Prosus does not intend to make any
changes with regard to the agreed employer contributions into Just Eat’s existing defined contribution
pension schemes. Prosus does not envisage making any material changes to the terms and conditions
of employment of Just Eat employees or the existing agreed pension contributions for existing members
of the Just Eat pension plans or admission of new members into the existing Just Eat pension plans in
connection with completion of the Offer, for a period of 12 months after the Effective Date.

Following the Effective Date, Prosus does not intend to make material headcount reductions at Just
Eat, save for a limited number of corporate, support or PLC-related functions at Just Eat's head office
that were required to support Just Eat’s public listing. Prosus also does not expect any material change
in the balance of skills and functions of employees and management of Just Eat.

It is expected that each of the non-executive Just Eat Directors will cease to be directors of Just Eat on
or shortly after the Effective Date. Prosus does not intend to make material changes to Just Eat’s
existing executive management, with which it already has a long track record of partnership through
Just Eat’s investment in iFood. Prosus may consider some focused changes or adding further talent
where appropriate, although no decisions have yet been taken in this regard. This is consistent with
Prosus’s stated strategy of supporting and working with existing leadership teams to successfully build
and scale high growth, technology-enabled businesses.

Management Incentive Arrangement

Following the Effective Date, Prosus intends to review the management, governance and incentivisation
structure of Just Eat. Prosus has not entered into, and has not had discussions on, any form of
incentivisation arrangements with members of Just Eat’s management team, but plans to
put in place appropriate arrangements for the management of Just Eat following completion of the
Offer.

Places of business and fixed assets

Prosus intends to maintain Just Eat’s corporate headquarters in London. A full assessment of Just Eat’s
other locations has not yet been conducted, and as a result, there are no plans in relation to these other
locations.

Prosus has no intention to redeploy fixed assets of Just Eat.

Research and development

Prosus does not expect to make material changes to Just Eat’s existing research and development
function. Prosus is committed to investment in innovation in the Food Delivery industry and expects to
bring the same commitment to the Just Eat Group. Prosus’s joint venture with Just Eat in Brazil, ""iFood""
and ""Sindelantal"" in Mexico are evidence of Prosus’s market-leading commitment to innovation to
create and expand on future opportunities.

Listing

Just Eat shares are currently listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the London Stock
Exchange. Prosus’s intentions with regard to Just Eat’s listing are set out in paragraph 7 below.

No statements in this paragraph 6 are ""post-offer undertakings"" for the purposes of Rule 19.5 of the
City Code.

7.        Compulsory acquisition, delisting and cancellation of trading and re-registration

If the Offer becomes, or is declared, unconditional in all respects and MIH receives valid acceptances
in respect of Just Eat Shares which, together with the Just Eat Shares acquired, or agreed to be
acquired, before or during the Offer by MIH, represent not less than 75 per cent. of the voting rights
attaching to the Just Eat Shares, Prosus intends to procure that Just Eat will make an application for
cancellation, respectively, of the trading in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange’s main
market for listed securities and of the listing of Just Eat Shares on the premium listing segment of the
Official List and Prosus will seek to re-register Just Eat as a private limited company.

A notice period of not less than 20 Business Days before cancellation will commence on the date on
which the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects provided MIH has attained 75 per
cent. or more of the voting rights as described above.

Delisting would significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of any Just Eat Shares not
assented to the Offer.
                                       
If MIH receives acceptances of the Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires not less than 90 per
cent. of the Just Eat Shares to which the Offer relates by nominal value and voting rights attaching to
such shares, MIH intends to exercise its rights pursuant to sections 974 to 991 of the Companies Act
2006 to acquire compulsorily, on the same terms as the Offer, the remaining Just Eat Shares in respect
of which the Offer has not at such time been accepted.

8.      Financing

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Offer will be financed by a bridge loan
agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch as Original Lender, providing for a term
loan bridge facility. The proceeds of the bridge facility will be used to fund the cash consideration
payable by MIH to Just Eat Shareholders in connection with the Offer. Prosus has secured the fully
committed bridge financing from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch as Original Lender.

Prosus remains fully committed to its investment grade rating and is confident that it will have sufficient
capacity at its current ratings level to take on this additional debt to finance the Offer. Prosus plans to
replace the bridge loan facility with long term funding through a combination of new debt capital and
utilising existing cash resources.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources available
to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat Shareholders
under the terms of the Offer.

Further details of the financing of the Offer will be set out in the Offer Document.

9.      Offer-related arrangements

Confidentiality Agreement

MIH and Just Eat have entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement dated 20 September 2019,
pursuant to which each of MIH and Just Eat has undertaken, amongst other things, to: (i) keep
confidential information relating to the other party and not to disclose it to third parties (other than certain
permitted disclosees) unless required by law or regulation; and (ii) use the confidential information for
the sole purpose of considering, evaluating, advising on or furthering the Offer.

The agreement also contains undertakings from both MIH and Just Eat that, should negotiations
between MIH and Just Eat terminate, then for a period of 12 months, subject to certain exceptions,
neither MIH nor Just Eat will approach or solicit certain of the other’s employees.

Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement

MIH and Just Eat have entered into a Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement dated 4 October 2019,
which sets out how any confidential information that is competitively sensitive can be disclosed, used
or shared for the purposes of due diligence, cost benefits evaluation, integration planning and regulatory
clearance. Such commercially sensitive information must only be made available to the party receiving
information through designated persons removed from day-to-day commercial and strategic operations
and decisions and external professional advisers. The findings of such designated persons and the
external advisers may only be relayed to other employees, officers and directors of the receiving party
in specified circumstances and subject to certain restrictions.

Panel Confidentiality Agreement

MIH, Just Eat and their respective legal advisers have entered into a Panel Confidentiality Agreement
dated 1 October 2019, the purpose of which is to ensure that the exchange and/or disclosure of certain
materials relating to the parties in relation to the anti-trust workstream only takes place between their
respective external legal counsels and external experts, and does not diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such materials and does not result in a waiver of any privilege, right or immunity that
might otherwise be available.

10.     Conditionality

The Offer will be subject to the Conditions and certain further terms set out in Appendix I to this
Announcement and to the full terms and conditions which will be set out in the Offer Document and
Form of Acceptance (or, if applicable, the Scheme Document), including, amongst other things, upon:

•       to the extent it has jurisdiction, the Spanish Markets and Competition Commission having
        issued a decision clearing the acquisition of Just Eat Shares under the Offer unconditionally, or
        with commitments or conditions that are on terms reasonably satisfactory to MIH, or the relevant
        deadline for the adoption of a decision foreseen in article 36.2 of the Spanish Competition Act
        having expired;

•       the Takeaway.com Offer not having become effective or (as the case may be) wholly
        unconditional in accordance with its terms (or any varied, revised or modified terms) on or prior
        to the date on which the Offer becomes wholly unconditional or (as the case may be) effective;

•       valid acceptances being received by no later than 1.00p.m. on the first closing date of the Offer
        (or such later time(s) and/or date(s) as MIH may, with the consent of the Panel or in accordance
        with the City Code, decide) in respect of Just Eat Shares which, together with all other Just Eat
        Shares which MIH acquires or agrees to acquire (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise),
        constitute no less than 90 per cent. of shares to which the Offer relates (or such lesser
        percentage, as MIH may decide after consultation with the Panel (if necessary)), being in any
        case more than 50 per cent. of the voting rights normally exercisable at a general meeting of
        Just Eat, including, for this purpose, any such voting rights attaching to Just Eat Shares that
        are unconditionally allotted or issued before the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional as
        to acceptances, whether pursuant to the exercise of any outstanding subscription or conversion
        rights or otherwise.

11.     Just Eat Share Plans and other remuneration arrangements

The Offer will extend to any Just Eat Shares unconditionally allotted or issued fully paid (or credited as
fully paid) to satisfy the exercise of existing options or vesting of awards under the Just Eat Share Plans
whilst the Offer remains open for acceptances.

If the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, to the extent that options or awards
under the Just Eat Share Plans remain unexercised or have not lapsed, MIH will make appropriate
proposals to option holders and the holders of awards under the Just Eat Share Plans in due course as
required by the City Code.

12.     Disclosure of interests in Just Eat

As at close of business on the Last Practicable Date, none of Prosus, MIH or any of their respective
directors, or, so far as Prosus is aware, any persons acting in concert (as such term is defined in the
City Code) with Prosus had:

•       any interest in, or right to subscribe for, any relevant securities of Just Eat;
                                                 

•       any short position in (whether conditional or absolute and whether in the money or otherwise),
        including any short position under a derivative, any agreement to sell or any delivery obligation
        or right to require another person to purchase or take delivery of, relevant securities of Just Eat;

•       procured an irrevocable commitment or letter of intent to accept the terms of the Offer in respect
        of relevant securities of Just Eat; or

•       borrowed or lent any such securities.

Furthermore, no arrangement exists between Prosus, MIH or any person acting in concert (as such
term is defined in the City Code) with Prosus or MIH and any other person in relation to Just Eat Shares.
For these purposes, an arrangement includes any indemnity or option arrangement, any agreement or
understanding, formal or informal, of whatever nature, relating to Just Eat Shares which may be an
inducement to deal or refrain from dealing in such securities.

In the interests of maintaining confidentiality, it has not been possible for MIH to complete its enquiries
in respect of the interests in Just Eat Shares (if any) of certain parties who may be deemed by the Panel
to be acting in concert with MIH for the purposes of the Offer. Enquiries of such parties will be made as
soon as practicable following the date of this Announcement, and MIH confirms that further disclosure
in accordance with Rule 8.1(a) and Note 2(a)(i) on Rule 8 of the City Code will be made as soon as
possible and, in any event, by no later than 12 noon on the date falling 10 business days after the date
of this Announcement.

13.     General

The Offer will extend to all Just Eat Shares unconditionally allotted or issued (including to satisfy the
exercise of options granted under the Just Eat Share Plans) after the date of this Announcement and
before the Offer closes (or such earlier date as MIH may, in accordance with the Conditions and further
terms of the Offer, decide).

The Just Eat Shares will be acquired by MIH fully paid and free from all liens, equitable interests,
charges, encumbrances, rights of pre-emption and any other third party rights of any nature whatsoever
and together with all rights attaching to them as at the date of this Announcement or subsequently
attaching or accruing to them.

It is intended that the Offer Document containing further details of the Offer (and, in the case of
certificated Just Eat Shares, the Form of Acceptance) will be despatched to Just Eat Shareholders
(other than to persons in a Restricted Jurisdiction) as soon as practicable after the date of this
Announcement, and in any event within 28 days of this Announcement (unless agreed otherwise with
the Panel). The Offer will be governed by the laws of England and Wales and will be subject to the
applicable requirements of the City Code, the FCA, the London Stock Exchange and other applicable
laws (including applicable US federal securities laws).

The acquisition of Just Eat Shares under the Offer is proposed to be implemented by way of a takeover
offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006 but MIH may, with the agreement of the
Panel, elect to implement the acquisition by way of a scheme of arrangement pursuant to Part 26 of the
Companies Act 2006.

The Offer will be subject to the Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix I to this Announcement,
and to the full terms and conditions which will be set out in the Offer Document. Appendix II to this
Announcement contains the bases of calculations and sources of certain information contained in this
Announcement. Appendix III to this Announcement contains definitions of certain expressions used in
this summary and in this Announcement.
                                                   

J.P. Morgan Cazenove has given and not withdrawn its consent to the publication of this Announcement
with the inclusion herein of the references to its name in the form and context in which it appears.

The Offer Document will not be reviewed by any federal state securities commission or regulatory
authority in the US, nor will any commission or authority pass upon the accuracy or adequacy of the
Offer Document. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful and may be a criminal offence.

any duty, liability or responsibility whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, whether in contract, in tort, in

connection with this Announcement, any statement contained herein, the Offer or otherwise.

Further information

This Announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not
constitute or form part of, an offer, invitation, inducement or the solicitation of an offer to purchase,
otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect of
any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction,
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of any securities
pursuant to the Offer in any jurisdiction in contravention of any applicable laws.

The Offer will be subject to English law and to the applicable requirements of the City Code, the Panel,
the Listing Rules, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.

The Offer will be implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Offer Document (or, in the event that
the Offer is to be implemented by means of a Scheme, the Scheme Document), which, together with
the Form of Acceptance (in the case of certificated Just Eat Shares), will contain the full terms and
conditions of the Offer, including details of how to accept the Offer. Just Eat Shareholders are advised
to read the Offer Document (including the related Form of Acceptance) (and/or, in the event that the
Offer is to be implemented by way of a Scheme, the Scheme Document) once this becomes available
because it will contain important information in relation to the Offer. Any decision in respect of the Offer
or other response in relation to the Offer, by Just Eat Shareholders should be made only on the basis
of the information contained in those documents (and/or, in the event that the Offer is to be implemented
by way of a Scheme, the Scheme Document). Just Eat Shareholders are advised to read the formal
documentation in relation to the Offer carefully once it has been dispatched.

This Announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in, and the availability of the Offer to
persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and Wales and the
Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into whose possession
this Announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable requirements. In
particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who
are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Offer or to accept or procure the
acceptance of the Offer (when made), may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which
they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding such matters should consult
an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to
comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such
jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and other persons involved
in the Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
                                                     

Announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable transaction under
applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just Eat Shareholder is
urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of the Offer
applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in, into or
from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a
national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do so would
violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of the Offer by
any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do so would
violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use,
means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if
to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this
Announcement and any documentation relating to the Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or
indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons
receiving such documents (including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or
otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Offer is implemented by way
of a Scheme(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour
of the Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute
a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales will be contained in the Offer Document.

Notice to US investors

The Offer will be made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance on, and
compliance with, Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Offer will be
made in the United States by MIH and no one else.

The Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure and other
procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and other procedural
requirements.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Offer will comply with the
relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures, particularly
with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

The Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Securities Act and Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act and Regulation 14E
thereunder. In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US
Exchange Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may
make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Offer, during the period in which the Offer would remain open for acceptance (or, if the Offer is
implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is
otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be
                                                    
made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions
at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US
Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be
reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange
website at www.londonstockexchange.com.

Financial information included in this Announcement and the Offer Document has been or will be
prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as
applicable, and may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Offer
may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable United
States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat Shareholder is urged to
consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Offer
applicable to them, including under applicable United States federal, state and local, as well as non-US
and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities
laws, since Just Eat is organised under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised
under the laws of the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and
MIH are residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of
US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Offer or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the
United States.

Forward looking statements

including with respect to the Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not
based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,

results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts included in this Announcement may be forward looking

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this Announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
                                                    
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this Announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this Announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

All forward looking statements contained in this Announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance
or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements
in this Announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory
obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and
Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and

looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

Nothing in this Announcement is intended as a profit forecast or estimate for any period and no
statement in this Announcement should be interpreted to mean that cash flow from operations, income
of persons (where relevant), earnings or earnings per share or dividend per share for Prosus, MIH or
Just Eat, as appropriate, for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the
historical published earnings or earnings per share or dividend per share for Prosus, MIH or Just Eat,
as appropriate.

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
                                                  
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

                    SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND BASES OF CALCULATION

Unless otherwise stated, in this Announcement:

1.     All prices and Closing Prices for Just Eat Shares are closing middle market quotations derived
       from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL).

2.     All prices and Closing Prices for Takeaway.com Shares are closing middle market quotations
       derived from the Euronext Amsterdam Daily Official List.

3.     The aggregate value of the consideration of approximately £4.9 billion is calculated by
       multiplying the offered amount of 710 pence in cash per Just Eat Share by Just Eat’s fully
       diluted share capital (as referred to in paragraph 5 below).

4.     The value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share is obtained by:

       (A)        dividing Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 as at the Last Practicable Date by
                  the exchange rate of £:€ of £1:€1.165 as at the Last Practicable Date as derived from
                  data provided by Bloomberg; and

       (B)        multiplying the number obtained by the exchange ratio of 0.09744 Takeaway.com by
                  Just Eat Shares announced by Takeaway.com in its Rule 2.7 announcement released
                  on 5 August 2019

5.     The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,127,131 shares (as published today in Just
       Eat’s circular to Just Eat Shareholders in respect of the Takeaway.com Offer).

6.     The performance of the Online Food Delivery Sector since the start of the Just Eat Offer Period
       is calculated using the performance of the median constituent in the Online Food Delivery
       Sector, when ranked by performance of their Closing Price, over the period between 26 July
       and the Last Practicable Date as follows (Closing Price on 26 July 2019, Closing Price on the
       Last Practicable Date): Takeaway.com (€83.6, €71.0); Delivery Hero (€40.9, €42.5); and
       Grubhub (US$74.6, US$55.8).

7.     The performance of the High-Growth Internet Sector Price since the start of the Just Eat Offer
       Period is calculated using the performance of the median constituent in the High Growth
       Internet Sector, when ranked by performance of their Closing Price, over the period between
       26 July and 21 October 2019 as follows (Closing Price on 26 July 2019, Closing Price on 21
       October 2019): boohoo (£2.3, £2.7); Carvana (US$66.5, US$77.3); Chewy (US$32.5,

PURSUANT TO THE NASPERS N SHARE CAPITALISATION ISSUE

Shareholders are referred to the circular issued by the Company on Friday, 19 July 2019 in relation
to, amongst other things, the Capitalisation Issue (Circular). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalised
words and terms contained in this announcement shall bear the same meanings ascribed thereto in
the Circular.

As set out in the Circular, only whole numbers of Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers M Ordinary
Shares will be issued in terms of the Capitalisation Issue and where fractional entitlements to Naspers N
Ordinary Shares arise in terms of the Capitalisation Issue, such fractions will be rounded down to the nearest
whole number with any remaining fractional entitlements being sold on behalf of such Naspers N
Shareholders with the proceeds payable in cash. The cash amount for such fractional entitlements will be
determined in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements and paid to the relevant Naspers N Shareholder
in its brokerage account or to a nominee account to be held on behalf and for the benefit of the relevant
Naspers N Shareholder as envisaged in the Circular and in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, this amount has been determined with reference
to the volume weighted average price in Rand of a Naspers N Ordinary Share traded on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 11 September 2019, ZAR 2,426.10 (being the first
day on which Naspers N Ordinary Shares trade  ex  the entitlement to participate in the Capitalisation
Issue), reduced by 10% (""Cash Proceeds""). On this basis, Shareholders are advised that the Cash
Proceeds due to Shareholders in respect of any fractional entitlements is ZAR 2,183.49

NASPERS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT PLAN - PERFORMANCE CONDITION FOR INITIAL PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT (PSU) AWARDS

At the annual general meeting of shareholders on 23 August 2019, shareholders
approved an amendment to the Naspers Restricted Stock Plan Trust Deed (""Trust
Deed"") to incorporate a performance stock unit plan (""PSU Plan""). At the time of the
publication of the Naspers FY19 remuneration report, the human resources and
remuneration committee (the ""Committee"") was still considering the final design of
the PSU performance condition and as such, was unable to disclose the details of the
performance condition for the initial PSU award to be granted to executive directors.
The committee has settled the final details.

Several equity indices such as MSCI Emerging Markets, Nasdaq, etc. were considered,
none of which reflected the global nature of Naspers' operations, without skewing too
much towards US or non-tech companies. Therefore, and after listening to
shareholders' input on the matter, the Committee settled on a bespoke peer group.
Originally disclosed in the Remuneration Report, however the Committee is satisfied
that a bespoke peer group is the most suitable approach. Full details of the
performance condition can be found on the company's website: www.naspers.com.

Under the Capital Restructure, Naspers shareholders whose addresses are shown in the securities register

Naspers N Shareholders must consider the Prospectus and Naspers Circular in full as action is required
from them and they should seek advice from their independent advisers in relation to the implications of
the Transaction and, in particular, the Election. In addition, Naspers N Shareholders are reminded that

Prospective investors are expressly advised that an investment in Prosus N Ordinary Shares entails
certain risks and that they should therefore carefully read and review the entire Prospectus. Prospective

the Prospectus or the Abridged Pre-listing Statement. Prospective investors should, in particular, read
the section of the Prospectus entitled ""Risk Factors"" when considering an investment in the Prosus N
Ordinary Shares. A prospective investor should not invest in Prosus N Ordinary Shares unless it has the
expertise (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Prosus N Ordinary Shares will
perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Prosus N Ordinary Shares and
the impact this investment will have on the prospective investor's overall investment portfolio. Prospective
investors should also consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposal of the Prosus N Ordinary Shares.

The content of this announcement, the Prospectus and the Abridged Pre-listing Statement should not
be construed as business, legal or tax advice. It is not intended to provide the basis of any credit or other
evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by any of the Company (or its directors),
the Prosus Group (or its Directors) or any of the Financial Advisers, the Euronext Listing and Paying Agent,
the JSE Sponsor or any of their respective representatives that any recipient of this announcement, the
Prospectus and/or the Abridged Pre-listing Statement should purchase any Prosus N Ordinary Shares.
None of the Company, the Prosus Group or any of the Financial Advisers, the Euronext Listing and Paying
Agent or the JSE Sponsor, or any of their respective representatives, is making any representation to any
prospective investor regarding the legality of an investment in the Prosus N Ordinary Shares by such
prospective investor under the laws and regulations applicable to such prospective investor. Prospective
investors should consult their own professional adviser before making any investment decision with regard
to the Prosus N Ordinary Shares, among other things, to consider such investment decision in light of
his or her personal circumstances and in order to determine whether or not such prospective investor is
eligible to purchase Prosus N Ordinary Shares. In making an investment decision, prospective investors
must rely on their own analysis, enquiry and examination of the Prosus Group and the Prosus N Ordinary
Shares, including the merits and risks involved.

Summary of statements from the annual general meeting:
Our strategy to create long-term shareholder value has not changed over time, despite a year of lively growth in the evolution of Naspers. In 2019, we completed our transition to a
global consumer internet company by listing and unbundling our video-entertainment unit, MultiChoice Group, into a standalone African entertainment powerhouse. In the process,
we unlocked around US$4bn in value for Naspers shareholders. Importantly in a South African context, MultiChoice Group shareholders include participants in Phuthuma Nathi who
benefited meaningfully from this transaction. We will also list our international internet assets as Prosus on Euronext Amsterdam with a secondary, inward listing on the JSE Limited.
These structural steps are closely tied to our strategy of pursuing growth by building leading companies that empower people and enrich communities by addressing big societal
needs. Globally, we operate in many markets around th world and support the development of local economies by investing in local entrepreneurs and their teams, encouraging
innovation and paying taxes locally – all of which create real value.

Naspers is now one of the world's top-10 internet companies by market capitalisation, with around a fifth of the people on the planet using our products and services to improve their
daily lives. We have laid a solid foundation to take our growth and success to the next level.

Looking at our key segments, our classifieds business was profitable in aggregate for the year while PayU's payments service provider business became operationally profitable. We
stepped up investment in online food-delivery services, a high-growth segment for the group. We believe this is one of the largest consumer internet opportunities in the world.

We have improved how we disclose information, and increased engagement with our stakeholders. Matters raised at the AGM and through various engagements are taken
seriously. This is evident in the progress summarised below.
                                                                                                                                                                                   
Discount
We acknowledge that investors are concerned about a discount of the Naspers share price to its sum-of-the-parts valuation. This discount has many drivers, common to most
composite companies, and only some are within our control. Factors where we have limited control include our size on the JSE, plus political issues driving foreign direct investment
flows into and out of South Africa. Listing and unbundling MultiChoice Group and listing our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam are actions designed to reduce the
discount over time.

We have also bolstered the balance sheet through asset sales to fund future growth. We remain focused and disciplined in how we allocate capital and evaluate existing assets.

Remuneration
We aim to pay for performance, align executive pay with shareholder outcomes, ensure our remuneration practices allow us to be competitive, and implement a fair, responsible and
consistent approach to pay.

Refinements in our 2019 remuneration report provide an even clearer view of this philosophy, and how it is implemented via the link between our business strategy, performance
and pay outcomes.

We continue to navigate the global shortage of digital skills, which means the best engineers and entrepreneurs can choose where to work and live. To succeed, we focus on
attracting, developing and retaining the best people in a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our employment policies aim to achieve that.

Over the last two years, we have refined our remuneration policy, including:
•        Changing the composition of the remuneration committee, strengthening its global orientation and technology exposure.
•       Improving our disclosure to show more clearly the connection between business strategy, operational results, pay design and pay outcomes. For short-term incentives, we
        have provided more information on performance goals and the level of achievement. For longer-term incentives, we disclosed the valuation process and governance of
        share appreciation rights, with core index-linked values.
•        Introducing clawbacks on both short-term and longer-term incentives for the CEO and all his executive direct reports. Plus a shareholding requirement for the CEO.
•        Purchasing Naspers shares on the market to cover our obligations for employees' long-term incentives to avoid dilution for shareholders.

In the current financial year, we plan to introduce a third longer-term incentive element for executives, namely performance share units (PSUs). For a participant to receive a share,
the performance condition must be met at the end of the three-year vesting period. If not, no shares are received. The performance condition for the 2019 grant relates to the three-
year compound annual growth rate on the ecommerce share appreciation rights scheme against an appropriate equity index. This scheme excludes Tencent.

Many of the refinements to our remuneration approach have been the result of shareholder feedback. We appreciate this dialogue with shareholders and while, practically, we
cannot action every suggestion, thematically the feedback has given us direction to address concerns.

Looking forward
We will continue to drive profitability in our established ecommerce segments, accelerate investment to scale food delivery and selectively invest in new opportunities. We will also
continue to invest in technology and product, particularly machine-learning capabilities.

Our plan to list our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam in September creates a new opportunity for international technology investors to access our unique portfolio.

    they choose to make the Election in accordance with the agreement between such Naspers
    N Shareholders and their respective CSDP, broker, or other nominee.

3.  Shareholders should note that, as transactions in Naspers N Ordinary Shares are settled in the
    Strate System, settlement of trades takes place three trading days after such trade. Therefore,
    persons who acquire Naspers N Ordinary Shares after the last day to trade in order to be
    recorded in the Naspers register to be eligible to vote at the General Meeting, being Tuesday
    13 August 2019, will not be able to vote at the General Meeting. Similar principles apply in
    relation to the last day to trade in order to participate in the Capitalisation Issue.

4.  Shareholders should note that, as the trading of Prosus N Ordinary Shares is settled through
    the Strate System, in the case of the JSE, and Euroclear Nederland, in the case of Euronext
    Amsterdam, settlement of the first trades in both the Strate System, in the case of the JSE,
    and Euroclear Nederland, in the case of Euronext Amsterdam will take place three trading days
    after the first trades are executed in order to accommodate the settlement cycle of the Strate
    System. Prosus N Ordinary Shares are expected to list and commence trading on the JSE and
    Euronext Amsterdam on an 'as-if-when-issued' basis on Wednesday 11 September 2019 and the
    trades executed on this first trading date are expected to settle on Monday 16 September 2019
    on both the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam. Following the first trading date of Prosus N Ordinary
    Shares on Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE, settlement of trades in Prosus N Ordinary Shares
    will take place two trading days after a trade is executed through Euroclear Nederland, in the
    case of Euronext Amsterdam, and three trading days after a trade is executed through the
    Strate System, in the case of the JSE.

5.  Forms of Proxy are to be received by not later than 11:15 on Wednesday 21 August 2019 for
    administrative purposes, or such later date if the General Meeting is postponed to allow for
    processing of such proxies. All other proxies must be handed to the chair of the General Meeting
    prior to a proxy exercising any right of the Shareholder at the General Meeting.

6.  No Naspers N Ordinary Shares may be rematerialised or Dematerialised from Wednesday
    11 September 2019 to Friday 13 September 2019, both days inclusive.

7.  If the General Meeting is adjourned or postponed, Forms of Proxy submitted for the initial
    General Meeting, scheduled for Friday 23 August 2019, will remain valid in respect of any such
    adjournment or postponement.

8.  All references to times are to South African Standard Time.

The Board remains fully supportive of the Proposed Transaction and the potential
benefits that could be realised by forming and listing a new, global consumer internet
group on Euronext Amsterdam, with a secondary, inward listing on the JSE.

Proposed Transaction and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company
and/or Prosus for providing the protections afforded to its clients nor for giving advice
in relation to the Proposed Transaction or any other transaction or arrangement
referred to in this announcement or the Circular. No representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, is made or given, and no responsibility is accepted, by or on behalf
of the Financial Advisers or any of their affiliates or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees or any other person, as to the accuracy, completeness, fairness
or verification of the information or opinions contained in this announcement or the

upon as, a promise or representation by the Financial Advisers or any of their respective
affiliates as to the past or future. Accordingly, the Financial Advisers and each of

The Naspers Shares and the Prosus Shares will not be registered under the
US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This announcement and the Circular contain statements about Naspers and/or Prosus
that are, or may be, forward-looking statements. All statements (other than statements
of historical fact) are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements, including,
without limitation, those concerning: strategy; the economic outlook for the industries
in which Naspers and/or Prosus operates or invests as well as markets generally;
production; cash costs and other operating results; growth prospects and outlook
for operations and/or investments, individually or in the aggregate; liquidity, capital
resources and expenditure; and statements in relation to the approval by Shareholders
or implementation of the Proposed Transactions. These forward-looking statements
are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect current expectations concerning
future results and events and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking
words or phrases such as ""believe"", ""aim"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""intend"", ""foresee"",
""forecast"", ""likely"", ""should"", ""planned"", ""may"", ""estimated"", ""potential"" or similar
words and phrases.

Examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding a future financial
position or future profits, cash flows, corporate strategy, implementation of the
Proposed Transaction, anticipated levels of growth, estimates of capital expenditures,
acquisition and investment strategy, expansion, prospects or future capital expenditure
levels and other economic factors, such as, among others, growth and interest rates.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or
may not occur in the future. Naspers cautions that forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance. Actual results, financial and operating conditions,
returns and the developments within the industries and markets in which Naspers or
Prosus operates and/or invests may differ materially from those made in, or suggested
by, the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and/or the Circular.

All these forward-looking statements are based on estimates, predictions and
assumptions, as regards Naspers or Prosus, all of which estimates, predictions
and assumptions, although Naspers believes them to be reasonable, are inherently
uncertain and may not eventuate or eventuate in the manner Naspers expects. Factors
which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
in those statements or assumptions include matters not yet known to Naspers or not
currently considered material by Naspers.

Shareholders should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made in this
announcement and/or the Circular or elsewhere is applicable only at the date on
which such forward-looking statement is made. New factors that could cause the
business of Naspers or Prosus not to develop as expected may emerge from time to
time and it is not possible to predict all of them. Further, the extent to which any factor
or combination of factors may cause actual results, performance or achievement
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement is not
known. Naspers has no duty to, and does not intend to, update or revise the forward-
looking statements contained in this announcement and/or the Circular or any other
information herein after the date of the Circular, except as may be required by law.

Forward-looking statements have not been reviewed or reported on by Naspers's
external auditor or any other expert.

Naspers N Shareholders that do not make an Election to participate in the
Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue in accordance with the terms of the
Circular, will be issued Naspers M Ordinary Shares in terms of the Naspers
M Share Capitalisation Issue in respect of all (and not some of) the Naspers
N Ordinary Shares held by them on the Record Date.

Naspers N Shareholders must consider the Circular in full as action is required
from them and should seek advice from their independent advisers in relation to the
implications of the Proposed Transaction and, in particular, the Election. In addition,
Shareholders are reminded that the Circular requires them to take certain actions and
provide certain information, including for example details of the Euronext Amsterdam
Brokerage Account if a Shareholder is a non-resident of the common monetary area
(CMA) for exchange control purposes and intends to participate in the Naspers M Share
Capitalisation Issue.

Shareholders are further advised that Prosus N Ordinary Shares are
expected to list and commence trading on Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE
on an 'as-if-when-issued' basis on Wednesday 11 September 2019 and the
trades executed on this first trading date are expected to settle on Monday
16 September 2019 on both Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE.

Summarised consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2019

Commentary

The past year was transformational for the Naspers group as we initiated and executed a number of significant
strategic initiatives. We invested to strengthen our ecommerce segments and broadened our ambitions in food delivery. 
All key segments made good progress against financial and strategic objectives.

We successfully listed our Video Entertainment business (MultiChoice Group) on the JSE Limited (JSE) and distributed
our shares in this business to our shareholders in February 2019. MultiChoice Group has been presented as a discontinued
operation in these summarised consolidated financial results and, accordingly, all income statement information from
continuing operations excludes the contribution from MultiChoice Group. Profit from discontinued operations in the income
statement includes results of MultiChoice Group for 11 months in the current year, as a single line. More information on
MultiChoice Group's results is available at https://www.multichoice.com/investors/.

As a result of these strategic initiatives, Naspers enters the 2020 financial year as a fundamentally different group,
with virtually all revenues now generated from online activities, and is well positioned as a global consumer internet
group.

Naspers delivered solid results for the year ended 31 March 2019. Group revenue, measured on an economic-interest
basis and excluding our Video Entertainment business, was US$19.0bn, reflecting growth of 16% (or 29% in local currency 
and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). Measured similarly, group trading profit increased 10% (or 22% in local
currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) to US$3.3bn. Driven by Classifieds, Etail (online retail), and 
Payments and Fintech, the ecommerce business posted a strong performance and reduced trading losses by a meaningful
14% (15%). Core headline earnings from continuing operations was US$3.0bn - up 26% (26%).

As noted, trading losses in ecommerce reduced significantly with the Classifieds business continuing its margin
improvement to become profitable in the aggregate for the year ended 31 March 2019. The other ecommerce assets also 
continued to scale, with Etail trading losses almost halving and the Payments and Fintech business narrowing its 
trading loss margin from 22% last year to 12%.

In March 2019, we announced our intention to list our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam. The listing
will create a new global consumer internet group Prosus N.V. (formerly referred to as NewCo), comprising our internet 
interests outside of South Africa and including investments in online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech, 
etail, travel, education and social and internet platforms, among others. Prosus N.V. will have a secondary, inward 
listing on the JSE in South Africa and is expected to be around 75% owned by Naspers with a free float of some 25%. 
As Europe's largest listed consumer internet company by asset value, Prosus N.V. will give global internet investors 
direct access to our unique and attractive portfolio of international internet assets. A circular to approve the 
transaction has been sent to shareholders ahead of the Naspers extraordinary general meeting to be held on 
28 June 2019. If approved at this meeting, the intention is for Prosus N.V. to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam 
on 17 July 2019.

We invested US$3.1bn to accelerate growth and provide further scale to several existing and new businesses. Notably
this includes: in Classifieds, acquiring minority interests in Avito, Dubizzle and letgo totalling US$1.5bn to increase
our stakes in these businesses as well as a US$89m investment in Frontier Car Group to further pursue the
convenient-transaction model; in Food Delivery, an additional investment in Swiggy of US$716m to expand its position in
India; a US$383m investment in BYJU'S to drive innovation and set new benchmarks for tech-enabled learning products; 
and through PayU, a US$60m investment in Zooz to boost our global merchant capabilities.

Given the wide geographical span of our operations and significant investments to scale the ecommerce business in
particular, reported earnings are materially impacted by foreign exchange volatility and the effects of acquisitions and
disposals. Where relevant in this report, adjustments have been made for the effects of foreign currencies and acquisitions
and disposals to reflect underlying trends. These adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets
after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A reconciliation of pro
forma financial information to the equivalent IFRS metrics is provided in note 17 of these summarised consolidated
financial results.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The contribution to group earnings by equity-accounted investments was up 4%. This includes investment disposal gains
of US$126m, impairment losses of US$799m and fair-value adjustments on financial instruments of US$1.5bn primarily
recognised by Tencent. 

A gain of US$1.6bn was recorded after disposing of our 12% interest in Flipkart in August 2018 for US$2.2bn, yielding
an internal annual rate of return of around 29%.

Following distribution of MultiChoice Group to shareholders, a gain on distribution of US$2.5bn was recorded. This has
been presented as part of the profit from discontinued operations in the income statement.

Impairment losses of US$123m related primarily to an equity-accounted investment focused on providing consumer lending
and financial services in the Payments business. We impaired this investment (including convertible debt funding
provided) as performance and the opportunity to leverage the investment in some of our core markets fell below our
expectations.

Put option liabilities totalled US$827m at 31 March 2019, compared to US$2.4bn a year ago, with an aggregate
remeasurement income of US$53m recorded in the income statement on these liabilities over the period. The significant 
decrease year on year relates primarily to the settlement of put option liabilities related to the Avito and 
Dubizzle businesses, as well as a portion of the put option liability in the Classifieds business, letgo.

We report a healthy net cash position (including short-term cash investments) of US$6.3bn at year-end, primarily as a
result of proceeds retained from the Flipkart disposal in August 2018 and the trim of our holding in Tencent last year.
The higher net cash position resulted in net interest income of US$82m. The progress made by our core segments, which
are growing fast and scaling well, gives us confidence in our ability to continue identifying opportunities that can
unlock significant value. The aggregate of free cash inflows generated by ecommerce and internet units that are free 
cash flow positive, increased from US$217m in 2016 to US$673m this year. This includes dividends received from Tencent 
and represents a compounded annual growth rate of 46% on the back of strong profitability gains in these businesses.

To offset the dilutionary impact of share options and restricted stock units granted to our employees, we invested
US$78m to acquire Naspers N ordinary shares on market and will continue to do so in future.

Consolidated free cash flow was US$184m, a substantial improvement on the prior year. This was driven by the increased
profitability of the ecommerce businesses, dividends received from Tencent of US$342m and positive working capital
effects in Video Entertainment. Consolidated free cash outflow from continuing operations (thus excluding Video
Entertainment) was US$120m - a 60% improvement on the prior year when measured on the same basis.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in these summarised consolidated
financial results.

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which includes consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
Internet revenues were US$18.7bn, up 18% (30%). Internet trading profits rose 11% (22%) as many ecommerce units
accelerated their profitability and Tencent delivered a stable performance.

Ecommerce
Overall ecommerce revenue was up 10% (26%) to US$3.9bn, with significant contributions from Classifieds, Food
Delivery, Payments and Fintech, and Etail. 

Ecommerce trading losses declined by 14% (15%), driven by a US$116m profitability improvement in Classifieds and
narrowing trading losses in the Etail, and Payments and Fintech businesses. This was partially offset as we invested 
more to capture the significant online food-delivery opportunity.

Our profitable ecommerce businesses generated revenues and trading profits of US$2.0bn and US$414m respectively. 
Like for like, this reflects growth of 15% (26%) and 29% (42%) respectively.

Classifieds
Classifieds delivered an exceptional performance, with revenue up 39% (37%) to US$875m. There was good growth across
the portfolio, including Avito, OLX Brazil, OLX Poland and the cars verticals (including Frontier Car Group) acquired 
in the current year. The segment was profitable overall (including letgo) with trading profit of US$2m, which was a
significant improvement from the US$114m trading loss in the previous year.

Avito increased revenue by 28% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals to US$322m as investment
in enhanced product features and an improved customer experience yielded stronger user engagement. OLX Brazil grew
revenue 22% (44%) on the back of expanded monetisation in its cars verticals. The business reported a profit - a marked
improvement on last year - as it started to scale. letgo's focus on product and customer satisfaction yielded record 
levels of users and an improved competitive position while starting its monetisation journey. 

Given the solid results and traction shown by these businesses, we invested an additional US$1.5bn during the year to
buy out minority investors in Avito, letgo in the United States, and Dubizzle.

Classifieds made several acquisitions during the year in its convenient-transaction models to deepen market presence
and enhance the consumer experience. This segment acquired a minority stake in Frontier Car Group and a controlling stake
in Aasaanjobs (online recruitment marketplace) in India. Classifieds also acquired the shares held by certain minority
shareholders in the Indonesian OLX business, thereby increasing Naspers's stake.

Payments and Fintech
PayU recorded another year of strong growth, driven by its Payments business. Payments and Fintech revenues were up
22% (28%) and trading losses narrowed by a meaningful 33% (67%). The payments service provider business achieved a
significant milestone by becoming profitable in aggregate and achieving profitability in each of its core markets, 
including India.

Volumes processed in the Payments business reached US$30bn, representing growth of 29% in local currency on the back
of over 920 million transactions. Among PayU's major markets, India was the fastest growing and accounted for almost half
of volumes processed. The Payments businesses across EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Latin America were
merged during the year, realising significant cost savings. Revenue scaling and cost compression as a result of these steps
drove the payment service provider business to profitability in the aggregate and in India. 

PayU continued to invest in building a credit platform in India. Its LazyPay product reached nearly 700 000 consumers
in the current year. Leveraging the data and credit profiles built on LazyPay, the business began trialling instalment
loans with selected consumers. The Indian credit portfolio minority investments, ZestMoney and PaySense, continued to
scale, reaching combined monthly loan issuances of US$15m at 31 March 2019.

Remitly, the minority investment capturing growth in the digital cross-border remittances market, expanded into Europe
after achieving success in the United States.

Food Delivery
Online food delivery is a high-potential sector, comprising a large area of consumer spend. The food market is
significant and transforming rapidly. People are spending on food differently, reallocating their budgets to food delivery,
especially online, and away from in-home preparation and in-restaurant consumption. At a macro level, global online
delivered food is expected to grow at four times the overall food market. Our investments in this segment include iFood, 
a leading online food-delivery business in Latin America via our majority investment in Movile; Delivery Hero, a leading
global online food-ordering and delivery marketplace operating in over 40 countries globally; and Swiggy, a leading player 
in India. In the review period, our online food-delivery services assets continued their strong growth trajectories,
resulting in cumulative annualised gross merchandise value (GMV) growth of 57%. Combined contributions from the portfolio
businesses saw segment revenues more than doubling (increasing 57% in local currency and excluding acquisitions and
disposals) to US$377m. However, as we invested further to provide these businesses with additional scale, trading losses
expanded to US$171m.

iFood remains the clear leader in Brazil and holds competitive positions in Mexico and Colombia. iFood processed more
than 17.4 million orders in March 2019 in Brazil, compared to 7.6 million orders in the same month last year, with a
network of over 66 000 active restaurants and 120 000 couriers. 

Swiggy, India's leading online food-ordering and delivery company, posted significant growth with annualised GMV
growth of 265% on the back of a 320% increase in annualised order volumes. Swiggy now operates in over 130 cities with its
more than 85 000 restaurant partners. In January 2019, we invested an additional US$637m in Swiggy, bringing our effective
interest to 39% (35% fully diluted).

For its year ended 31 December 2018, Delivery Hero reported revenue growth from continuing operations of 47% to €665m,
with order volumes climbing 49% to 369 million. More information on Delivery Hero's results is available at 
https://ir.deliveryhero.com.

Given the significant potential of this segment, its nascency and good portfolio of Naspers assets, in November 2018,
Naspers, Innova and Just Eat committed to invest US$500m in iFood to enable iFood to accelerate growth by expanding
coverage and investment in first-party delivery capabilities, speed up product development and innovation and deliver
personalised experiences to its customers. This commitment will result in increased investment in the year ahead. 
Swiggy will also continue to increase investment and Delivery Hero has recently, as part of its results announcements, 
outlined plans to invest further. These investment plans could create significant value for Naspers.

Etail
Etail recorded good growth, with revenues rising 20% to US$1.8bn, measured in local currency and adjusted for 
the disposals of Flipkart in August 2018 as well as Souq and Konga last year. On a similar basis, trading losses 
reduced 14% to US$150m as the business continued to scale. 

As outlined above, we disposed of our interest in equity-accounted online retailer Flipkart during the year and
accordingly include only seven months of its results for segmental reporting purposes, reflecting our share of 
Flipkart's earnings to the date of disposal.

Central and Eastern Europe's leading business-to-consumer (B2C) platform, eMAG, continued to outpace the market across
its footprint with GMV growing 25% in Romania, its home market. Both the retail and marketplace businesses continued to
contribute strongly to eMAG's overall results, reflected in year-on-year profitability rising 46% on the back of higher
gross profit margins.

In South Africa, Takealot further solidified its market presence as the country's leading B2C platform, growing GMV by
42% and revenue by 69%. Takealot also posted market share gains in its online food-delivery business, Mr D Food, which
recorded GMV growth of over 170%. The results of Mr D Food are reported as part of the Etail segment as its logistics
are closely integrated with Takealot. In October 2018, Takealot merged its online fashion brand, Superbalist, with Spree,
the online fashion brand owned by Media24. The combined business operates under the Superbalist brand and its results
are reported as part of Etail for segmental reporting purposes.

Travel
Our equity-accounted online travel investment in India, MakeMyTrip, reported increased revenues across its verticals.
Gross hotel bookings rose 17% in local currency terms and standalone room nights rose 23%. Air-travel transactions were
up 29%. MakeMyTrip continued to improve the unit economics of its hotels business, resulting in our share of its trading
losses declining by a meaningful 39%. Our share of MakeMyTrip's revenue increased 30% year on year. In April 2019, we
announced the exchange of our 43% interest in MakeMyTrip for a 5.6% interest in Ctrip.com International Limited. This
transaction is expected to be finalised in the second half of the 2019 calendar year and is subject to regulatory approval.

More information on MakeMyTrip's results is available at http://investors.makemytrip.com.

Tencent
For the year ended 31 December 2018, Tencent's revenues of RMB313bn were up 32%. Non-GAAP profit attributable to
shareholders (Tencent's measure of normalised performance) grew 19% to RMB77bn.

Revenues from value-added services increased 15% to RMB177bn, with online games revenues growing 6% to RMB104bn and
social networks revenues rising 30% to RMB73bn. Online advertising revenues rose 44% to RMB58bn. Other revenues 
(mainly payment and cloud-services revenues) rose 80% to RMB78bn.

Tencent continues to lead in China with 10 of the top 20 mobile apps. Weixin and WeChat's combined monthly active
users reached 1.1 billion and its super-app status was strengthened by the expansion of Weixin Mini Programs. Tencent
strengthened engagement with young users as QQ introduced innovative and artificial intelligence-empowered features 
that make the chat experience more fun and interactive. Leveraging its rich intellectual property portfolio, Tencent 
provides digital content to its users across online media platforms, with total subscriptions now exceeding 
100 million. The Tencent group achieved healthy advertising revenue growth by connecting more advertisers across 
more platforms with more accurate user-targeting capabilities. 

Despite a new regulatory dispensation that affected the rollout of online games generally and weighed on Tencent's
online games revenue growth, it maintained its leading position in the Chinese online games market and continued to grow
its global presence. Tencent extended its leadership in mobile payments in terms of active user accounts and number of
transactions with over 1 billion payment transactions per day in 2018, driven by rapid growth in commercial payments -
where revenue and transaction volumes more than doubled in 2018. 

Tencent is increasing investment in its core infrastructure and emerging technologies to embrace the trend of smart
retail, enabling its enterprise partners to better connect with its users via an expanding, open and connected ecosystem,
making the customer experience more satisfying and more personalised.

More information on Tencent's results is available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru's revenue for the year to December 2018 grew 33% to RUB75bn. Advertising revenue continued to grow strongly,
with mobile advertising on social networks still the fastest-growing area. Hustle Castle, a mobile game developed by
Mail.ru, became its largest game. War Robots and Warface continued to record solid growth and perform well. International
revenue now accounts for over 63% of Mail.ru's online games revenues.

Delivery Club remains the largest online food-delivery platform in Russia, with monthly active users growing 67% year
on year. Mail.ru acquired the remaining 80% of United Media Agency, an aggregator and distributor of digital content in
Russia. It now has the largest content subscription user base in Russia with 2.1 million paid and trial subscriptions.

More information on Mail.ru's results is available at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Prospects 
Our focus in the year ahead will remain on driving profitability in our established ecommerce segments, accelerating
investment to scale food delivery, extending products and services in our core segments, and using our strong balance
sheet to selectively invest in new opportunities. We will also improve the competitiveness of our platforms by continuing
to invest in tech and product and reinforce our artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

We intend to complete the listing of our international ecommerce assets on Euronext Amsterdam in July 2019, creating a
new opportunity for international technology investors to access our unique portfolio and reducing our weighting on the
JSE - a step we believe will help us maximise shareholder value over time.

DIRECTORATE
On 25 February 2019, Guijin Liu retired after several years of valuable contributions as a non-executive director. 
The board expresses its gratitude to Guijin Liu.

As a consequence of its listing on the JSE and the subsequent distribution of MultiChoice Group to shareholders, 
Nolo Letele became a non-executive director of the group.

Furthermore, we announced on 6 May 2019 that Manisha Girotra will be appointed as an independent non-executive
director of Naspers after the listing of Naspers's subsidiary Prosus N.V. on the Euronext Amsterdam, which is 
expected to be implemented in July 2019. Manisha will also serve on the board of Prosus N.V. and as a member 
of the Naspers and Prosus N.V. audit committees.

DIVIDEND NUMBER 90 
(All figures in South African cents)
The board recommends that the annual gross dividend be increased by 10% to 715 cents (2018: 650 cents) per listed 
N ordinary share and 143 cents (2018: 130 cents) per unlisted A ordinary share. If confirmed by shareholders at the 
annual general meeting on Friday 23 August 2019, dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the books on 
Friday 13 September 2019 and paid on Monday 16 September 2019. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on 
Tuesday 10 September 2019 (shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday 11 September 2019). Share certificates may not 
be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday 11 September 2019 and Friday 13 September 2019, both dates 
inclusive. The dividend will be declared from income reserves. It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, 
yielding a net dividend of 572 cents per listed N ordinary share and 114 cents per unlisted A ordinary share to 
those shareholders not exempt from paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 143 cents per listed N ordinary share 
and 29 cents per unlisted A ordinary share.

The issued ordinary share capital as at 21 June 2019 was 438 656 059 N ordinary shares and 907 128 A ordinary shares.
The company's income tax reference number is 9550138714.

    and the provisions of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008. The JSE Listings Requirements require provisional 
    reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the measurement and recognition requirements 
    of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the 
    Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards 
    Council, and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. 

    The summarised consolidated financial results do not include all the disclosures required for complete annual 
    financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
    Board (IASB). The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated annual financial 
    statements, from which the summarised consolidated financial results were derived, are consistent with 
    those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements, except as set out below.
    
    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective 
    for financial years commencing on 1 April 2018. The group has initially applied IFRS 15 Revenue from 
    Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
    (IFRIC 22) and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) from 1 April 2018. A number of other pronouncements 
    were also effective from 1 April 2018, however, these pronouncements did not have a significant impact on 
    the summarised consolidated financial results.
    
    The group's reportable segments reflect the components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the 
    chief executive officer and other senior executives who make strategic decisions. The group proportionately 
    consolidates its share of the results of its associates and joint ventures in its reportable segments.
    
    Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based 
    payment expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention 
    option expenses and other gains/losses, but includes the finance cost on capitalised finance leases.
    
    Core headline earnings excludes non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's 
    operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly 
    titled measures reported by other companies.
    
    The impact of adoption of new accounting pronouncements during the year is set out below.
    IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    IFRS 15 replaced IAS 18 Revenue. The group has applied IFRS 15 on a retrospective basis and has restated 
    the comparative information contained in the summarised consolidated financial results. Apart from providing 
    additional and more detailed disclosure around revenue recognition, IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact 
    on the group's existing revenue recognition practices and summarised consolidated financial results.
    
    The cumulative net impact of adopting IFRS 15 for the year ended 31 March 2018 was a reduction in 
    consolidated revenue of US$3m and an increase of US$1m in profit for the year. The impact of adoption 
    related to the group's Video Entertainment segment which has been presented as a discontinued operation 
    (refer to note 4), as the initial application of IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact on the group's 
    other operations.
    
    IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
    IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39). The group has applied 
    IFRS 9 from 1 April 2018 and elected not to restate comparative information on transition, with the impact 
    of adoption recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 April 2018. 
    The initial application of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the group. The specific impacts 
    relating to classification and measurement, impairment allowances and hedge accounting are outlined below.
    
    Classification and measurement
    The group recognised an increase in retained earnings of US$838m, as a transfer from other reserves, relating 
    to the impact of IFRS 9 on its associate Tencent Holdings Limited. The impact relates to cumulative net 
    gains on investments classified as available-for-sale financial assets in terms of IAS 39 that are now 
    accounted for as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in terms of IFRS 9. 
    
    In terms of IAS 39, the group previously classified equity investments as available-for-sale investments with 
    changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal or impairment, cumulative fair-value 
    changes recognised in other comprehensive income were reclassified to the income statement. Furthermore, 
    certain available-for-sale investments were measured at cost as their fair value could not be measured with 
    sufficient reliability. These investments are, however, not significant to the summarised consolidated financial 
    results and their remeasurement to fair value on transition to IFRS 9 was insignificant. The group has classified 
    these investments as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in terms of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 
    does not permit the reclassification of cumulative fair-value changes to the income statement on disposal or 
    impairment. Further, IFRS 9 no longer permits cost measurement where fair value cannot be measured with sufficient 
    reliability. The group, following the adoption of IFRS 9, accordingly no longer reclassifies cumulative fair-value 
    changes on these investments to the income statement on disposal or impairment, but transfers such cumulative 
    changes to retained earnings on disposal of an investment.

    Impairment
    The adoption of IFRS 9's impairment model resulted in an increase in impairment allowances on trade receivables 
    due to the requirement to consider forward-looking information when determining impairment allowances. The 
    cumulative net impact on the group was an increase of US$14m in impairment allowances on trade receivables and 
    a corresponding decrease of US$14m in retained earnings. The impact of adoption related primarily to the group's 
    Video Entertainment business, which has been presented as a discontinued operation (refer to note 4), as the 
    application of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the group's other operations.
    
    Hedge accounting
    IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the group's hedge accounting practices and accordingly previously 
    applied hedging practices continued unaffected.
    
    IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
    IFRIC 22 clarifies that non-monetary assets and liabilities arising from the payment/receipt of advance 
    consideration (eg prepaid expenses and deferred revenue) are not retranslated to the entity's functional 
    currency after initial recognition. The group applied IFRIC 22 on a prospective basis, with the impact of 
    adoption recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 April 2018.
    
    The impact of adoption was an increase in prepaid expenses of US$10m, a decrease in deferred revenue of 
    US$4m and a corresponding increase of US$14m in retained earnings. The adoption impact related primarily 
    to the group's Video Entertainment business, which has been presented as a discontinued operation (refer 
    to note 4), as the initial application of IFRIC 22 did not have a significant impact on the group's 
    other operations.
    
    The impact of the adoption of the above accounting standards during the current year is shown in 
    the following tables:

3.  INDEPENDENT AUDIT
    The summarised consolidated financial results have been audited by the company's auditor, 
    PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. (PwC). The individual auditor assigned to perform the audit is Brendan  
    Deegan. PwC's unqualified audit reports on the consolidated annual financial statements and the summarised 
    consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2019 are available for inspection at the 
    registered office of the company. The auditor's report does not necessarily cover all the information 
    contained in the summarised consolidated financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in 
    order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's work, they should obtain a copy of 
    that report, together with the consolidated annual financial statements from the registered office of 
    the company. These documents will be available from the company's registered office from 21 June 2019. 
    The consolidated annual financial statements will be available on www.naspers.com on or about 
    24 June 2019.

    (1) The group is subject to commitments which occur in the normal course of business. The group plans to 
        fund these commitments out of existing facilities and internally generated funds. Prior-period 
        commitments for programme and film rights and set-top boxes related to MultiChoice Group which was 
        distributed to shareholders during the current year (refer to note 13).

    The group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and pays tax in the countries in which it operates. 
    In certain jurisdictions uncertainty exists as to whether certain transactions or payments are subject to tax. 
    In these countries the group continues to seek relevant advice and works with its advisers to identify and/or 
    quantify tax exposures. Our current assessment of possible tax exposures, including penalties and interest, 
    amounts to approximately US$22.0m (2018: US$226.1m). No provision has been made as at 31 March 2019 (and 2018) 
    for these possible exposures. The current-year reduction in possible tax exposures relates primarily to the 
    distribution of MultiChoice Group to shareholders (refer to note 13). 

    Furthermore, the group has a contingent asset of US$177.0m (2018: US$nil) related to amounts receivable from 
    tax authorities.

12. DISPOSAL GROUPS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
    The group distributed its shareholding in MultiChoice Group Limited (MultiChoice Group) to shareholders during 
    the year (refer to note 13). As a consequence of this transaction, equity-compensation plans and other group 
    entities that held Naspers Limited N ordinary shares (as treasury shares) at the time of distribution received 
    MultiChoice Group shares. The group has classified a portion of these MultiChoice Group shares, with a fair 
    value of US$50.7m, as held for sale as at 31 March 2019 as it has committed to dispose of these shares within 
    12 months from the end of the current reporting period. The portion of MultiChoice Group shares not classified 
    as held for sale are presented as part of ""Other investments and loans"" in the statement of financial position.

    The assets and liabilities of the group's subsidiary Netrepreneur Connections Enterprises, Inc. (Sulit) were 
    also classified as held for sale during the year as the group signed an agreement to contribute this investment 
    to Carousell Private Limited (Carousell) in exchange for an equity interest in Carousell (refer to note 16).

13. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OTHER ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
    In August 2018 the group invested US$60m for a 100% effective and fully diluted interest in the issued share 
    capital of Zooz Mobile Limited (Zooz), a management and optimisation payment provider based in Israel. The 
    transaction was accounted for as a business combination with an effective date of August 2018. The purchase 
    price allocation: cash and deposits US$2m; trade and other receivables US$1m; intangible assets US$22m; trade 
    and other payables US$1m; loan liabilities US$1m; deferred tax liability US$5m and the balance of US$42m to 
    goodwill. The main intangible assets recognised in the business combination were technology and customer 
    relationships.
    
    In December 2018 the group invested US$36m for a 69% effective interest (65% fully diluted) in the issued 
    share capital of Aasaanjobs Private Limited (Aasaanjobs), an online recruitment marketplace based in India.

    Since the acquisition dates of the above business combinations, revenue of US$1m and net losses of US$9m 
    have been included in the income statement. Had the revenue and net losses of the above business combinations 
    been included from 1 April 2018, group revenue from continuing operations and group net profit from continuing 
    operations would have amounted to US$3.29bn and US$4.15bn respectively.
    
    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in these acquisitions was the acquirees' market 
    presence. The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total 
    acquisition-related costs of US$2m were recorded in ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in 
    the income statement regarding the above-mentioned acquisitions.

    non-controlling interest in this business. Following the acquisition, the group holds a 100% effective

    US$637m in January 2019. Following these investments, the group holds a 39% effective interest (35% 
    fully diluted) in Swiggy. The group continues to account for its interest as an investment in an 
    associate.
    
    In December 2018 the group invested US$383m in Think & Learn Private Limited (BYJU'S) for a 12% effective 
    (12% fully diluted) shareholding in India's largest education company and the creator of India's largest 
    personalised learning app. The group accounts for its interest as an investment in an associate.
    
    The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:

    During May 2018 the group announced the disposal of its 12% effective interest (11% fully diluted) in 
    Flipkart Limited - its equity-accounted Etail investment in India - to US-based retailer Wal-Mart 
    International Holdings, Inc. for US$2.2bn (inclusive of applicable withholding taxes and amounts held 
    in escrow). Amounts held in escrow following the disposal have been included as part of ""Other receivables 
    and loans"" in the statement of financial position. The transaction was concluded in August 2018 following 
    regulatory approval. A gain on disposal of US$1.6bn has been recognised as part of ""Gains/(losses) on 
    acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement. This gain includes the reclassification of a as part 
    of ""Taxation"" in the income statement.
    
    In September 2018 the group concluded the sale of its 52% interest in Tek Travels Private Limited, its online
    business-to-business (B2B) travel distribution business, for US$37m. A gain on disposal of US$6m has been 
    recognised as part of ""Gains/(losses) on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement.
    
    Following its listing on the JSE in February 2019, the group distributed its shares in its Video Entertainment
    business, MultiChoice Group Limited (MultiChoice Group), to shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie 
    (the distribution). MultiChoice Group and, accordingly, the group's Video Entertainment segment, has been 
    presented as a discontinued operation in these summarised consolidated financial results (refer to note 4).
    The group recorded a gain of US$2.49bn as part of ""Profit from discontinued operations"" in the income 
    statement following the distribution, being the difference between the fair value of the MultiChoice 
    Group shares distributed, measured using its listed share price, and the book value of the net assets 
    derecognised. The gain recognised is presented net of the reclassification of reserves (primarily foreign 
    currency translation and hedging reserves) of US$546m (losses) to the income statement following the 
    distribution. The distribution reduced retained earnings by US$3.83bn being the fair value of the 
    distributed MultiChoice Group shares. The group calculated the gain on distribution based on the fair 
    value of MultiChoice Group as at the date of distribution. In calculating the fair value, the group 
    determined that the share price of MultiChoice Group for the first 15 days of trading did not represent 
    an orderly transaction on account of the trading volumes during this period and the fact that there was 
    no exposure to the market before the measurement date. Consequently, the group used the 15-day volume-
    weighted average share price of MultiChoice Group and excluded the first 15 days of trading as this was 
    considered more representative of the fair value of MultiChoice Group in an orderly transaction. This is 
    consequently a level 2 fair-value measurement.

    There have been no transfers between levels 1 or 2 during the reporting period, nor were there any 
    significant changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value.

    Currency devaluation features related to clauses in content acquisition agreements within the Video 
    Entertainment business that provided the group with protection against significant currency 
    devaluations. The group distributed MultiChoice Group to shareholders during the current year 
    (refer to note 13). The fair value of currency devaluation features was measured through the use 
    of discounted cash flow techniques.

    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance 
    criteria will be met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified 
    earn-out payments are used.

    Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments.

    The fair value of level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates 
    quoted in active markets and interest rate extracts from observable yield curves.

    The group discloses the fair values of the following financial instruments as their carrying values 
    are not a reasonable approximation of their fair values:

    instruments as at the end of the reporting period.

17. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
    The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics in local currency, excluding the effects 
    of changes in the composition of the group (the pro forma financial information) in the following tables. 
    The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers 
    Limited and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been 
    extracted from the group's management accounts, the quality of which the board is satisfied with.
    
    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that 
    it has been extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial 
    position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.
    
    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange 
    rates and changes in the composition of the group on its results for the year ended 31 March 2019. The 
    following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:
    1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's 
       results to the prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly 
       exchange rates for that period. The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the 
       constant currency results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above, compared to the prior 
       period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) used 
       for the group's most significant functional currencies, were: South African rand (2019: 0.0723; 
       2018: 0.0774), Polish zloty (2019: 0.2684; 2018: 0.2794), Russian rouble (2019: 0.0153; 2018: 0.0173), 
       Chinese yuan renminbi (2019: 0.01485; 2018: 0.1517), Indian rupee (2019: 0.0143; 2018: 0.0155), 
       Brazilian real (2019: 0.2622; 2018: 0.3097), Angolan kwanza (2019: 0.0035; 2018: 0.0056) and 
       Nigerian naira (2019: 0.0028; 2018: 0.0028).

    2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of 
       subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its 
       equity-accounted investments. For mergers, the group composition adjustments include a portion of the 
       prior-year results of the entity with which the merger took place. The following significant changes 
       in the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods have been adjusted for in 
       arriving at the pro forma financial information:

    (5) The group historically allocated a portion of its corporate costs to the Video Entertainment segment. 
        Following the distribution of MultiChoice Group to shareholders in the current year, and the consequent 
        presentation of the Video Entertainment segment as a discontinued operation, corporate costs are now 
        only allocated to the ecommerce business. The group views these corporate costs as primarily relating 
        to the support of the ecommerce business. In line with IFRS 8 Operating Segments the group has accordingly 
        presented the comparative information contained in the segmental review on a similar basis.

Independent auditor's report on the summary consolidated financial statements

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF NASPERS LIMITED

OPINION
The summary consolidated financial statements of Naspers Limited, contained in the accompanying provisional 
report, which comprise the summary consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2019, the 
summary consolidated income statement and summary consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes
in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and related notes, are derived from the audited consolidated

Requirements for provisional reports, as set out in note 2 to the summary consolidated financial statements, and the

Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to annual

statements of the current period.

The directors are responsible for the preparation of the summary consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for provisional reports, set out in note 2 to the summary

WITHDRAWAL OF NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING

Naspers N shareholders and A shareholders (Shareholders) are referred to the announcement on
Wednesday 29 May 2019 regarding the Company's intention to form a new global consumer internet
group, comprising the Naspers Group's international internet assets (Proposed Transaction).
These assets will be held by the company we refer to as NewCo (formally Myriad International
Holdings N.V.), an existing subsidiary of Naspers incorporated in accordance with Dutch laws. The
N ordinary shares in NewCo are proposed to be admitted to listing and trading on Euronext
Amsterdam and, as a secondary inward listing, on the Main Board of the JSE Limited (JSE).

The announcement also advised Shareholders of the posting of a circular to Shareholders (Circular),
which included a notice to Shareholders convening a general meeting of Shareholders on Friday 28
June 2019 (General Meeting) to consider, and if deemed fit, to approve the resolution required to
implement the Proposed Transaction.

It has come to the attention of the Company that an administrative error by an external service
provider has resulted in certain of the copies of the Circular delivered to Shareholders being
incorrectly labelled. The service provider concerned has advised the Company that the error
occurred in pairing the names and addresses of some Shareholders for purposes of printing labels
on the envelopes in which the physical copies of the Circular were delivered to certain Shareholders.
This meant that some Circulars were sent to the correct addresses of the affected Shareholders, but
that incorrect names appeared on these envelopes (i.e. the name and address did not match). This
could in some cases lead to confusion.

So as to allow our Shareholders equal opportunity to fully consider the Circular and resolution, the
board has decided to withdraw the notice of the General Meeting and consequently cancel the
General Meeting to which the notice related. The new general meeting of Shareholders to consider,
and if deemed fit, approve the resolution required will now be held on the same date as the
Company's annual general meeting, scheduled for Friday 23 August 2019.
Shareholders are accordingly advised that all voting instructions, proxy forms and election forms
already submitted to brokers, central securities depositary participants or the Company in respect of
the General Meeting or elections in terms of the Circular, will be of no force or effect and will be
disregarded. New forms will be provided in due course when a new notice of general meeting is
issued.

The Company will keep Shareholders updated in relation to the revised timetable for implementation
of the Proposed Transaction. Subject to the valid adoption of the resolution required, the Company
expects the Proposed Transaction to be implemented in September 2019.
The board remains fully supportive of the Proposed Transaction and the potential benefits that could
be realised by forming and listing a new, global consumer internet group on Euronext Amsterdam,
with a secondary, inward listing on the JSE.

We apologise for inconvenience caused to Shareholders who have already responded.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (""the group"") is finalising its provisional report and consolidated annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the current year the group distributed its interest in its video-entertainment business, MultiChoice Group Limited
(MultiChoice Group), to its shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie (the distribution). Following the distribution, the results
of the video-entertainment segment have been presented as results from discontinued operations. The prior year income
statement has been restated to distinguish between continuing and discontinued operations.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in core headline earnings, earnings and headline earnings per share for the year
ended 31 March 2019 as compared to 31 March 2018 for both total operations (as previously reported) and continuing operations
in the tables below:

(1)
      Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
      performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items.
(2)
      Earnings per share was impacted significantly by the gain of US$1.6bn recognised on disposal of the group's interest in Flipkart
      Limited as well as by a gain recorded on the distribution of the MultiChoice Group to the group's shareholders. The latter gain
      is not part of earnings from continuing operations. The decline in earnings from the prior year was mainly due to the gain of
      US$9.1bn recognised on the sale of a 2% interest in Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) in March 2018, which is non-recurring
      in March 2019.
(3)
      Headline earnings per share increased considerably as a result of the group's share of fair-value gains recognised by Tencent
      on certain of its investments now classified as at fair value through profit and loss in terms of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
      These gains are not adjusted for when calculating headline earnings per share.

Further details will be provided in the summarised consolidated financial results, due for release on 21 June 2019. Financial
information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company's auditors.

1.  INTRODUCTION
    Shareholders are referred to the announcement made by the Company on 25 March
    2019 (Announcement) in relation to the Company's intention to form a new global
    consumer internet group, comprising the Naspers Group's international internet
    assets. These assets will be held by Myriad International Holdings N.V., an existing
    subsidiary of Naspers incorporated in accordance with Dutch laws and whose new
    name will be changed shortly (NewCo). The NewCo N Ordinary Shares are proposed to be
    admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam and, as a secondary inward
    listing, on the Main Board of the JSE Limited (JSE).

    The Naspers board of directors (Board) is pleased to announce that the structure
    of the proposed transaction referred to in the Announcement has now been
    finalised and the salient details thereof are set out below.

    Furthermore, Shareholders are hereby advised that a circular to Naspers N ordinary
    shareholders (Naspers N Shareholders) and Naspers A ordinary shareholders
    (Naspers A Shareholders) (Naspers N Shareholders and Naspers A Shareholders,
    collectively, Shareholders) dated 29 May 2019 (Circular) (and using the terms
    defined therein unless otherwise stated) has been made available today and will be
    posted to Shareholders. The Circular, inter alia:

    - explains what the Proposed Transaction is and why the Board believes it is in the
      best long-term interests of Shareholders;
    - provides Shareholders with further information regarding the Proposed
      Transaction and in particular the Capitalisation Issue;
    - explains why the Board unanimously supports and recommends that Shareholders
      vote in favour of the Resolution required to be approved by Shareholders in order
      to implement the Proposed Transaction; and
    - convenes the General Meeting in order to consider, and if deemed fit, to approve
      the Resolution required to be approved by Shareholders in order to implement the
      Proposed Transaction.

    The Circular is also available on the Company's website at www.naspers.com
    and additional copies of the Circular can be obtained from the Company and the
    Sponsor at their respective addresses provided in the ""Corporate Information"" section 
    of the Circular during normal business hours from today, 29 May 2019 up to and including 
    the date of the General Meeting, being Friday, 28 June 2019.

2.  OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    Naspers intends to implement the Proposed Transaction through the following key
    steps:

    - The Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue to be implemented in accordance
      with section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
      Incorporation, in terms of which, subject to the Election, Naspers N Shareholders
      will be issued with Naspers M Ordinary Shares which will be automatically
      contributed to NewCo in return for the issue of NewCo N Ordinary Shares to
      Naspers N Shareholders.
    - The Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue to be implemented in accordance
      with section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
      Incorporation, in terms of which Naspers N Shareholders can elect to participate
      in the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue and be issued with Naspers N
      Ordinary Shares instead of participating in the Naspers M Share Capitalisation
      Issue and being issued with Naspers M Ordinary Shares (and consequently
      NewCo N Ordinary Shares).
    - The Naspers A Share Capitalisation Issue to be implemented in accordance
      with section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
      Incorporation, in terms of which Naspers A Shareholders will be issued new
      Naspers A Ordinary Shares related to the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue.
    - A distribution in kind of NewCo A Ordinary Shares by the Company to Naspers A
      Shareholders through a pro rata distribution in kind for no consideration in terms
      of section 46 of the Companies Act.

3.  BACKGROUND TO, AND REASONS FOR, THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    Naspers has a long history of investing in technology companies to capture growth,
    transforming itself from a print media, pay-television and video-entertainment
    company into one of the top 10 global internet companies by market capitalisation.
    Through its growth, the Company has created significant value for its stakeholders.
    This rapid growth has, however, also created some unique market dynamics.
    The Company constitutes almost 25% of the JSE Shareholder Weighted Index,
    compared to 5% in 2013, and its outsized weighting on the JSE and in key FTSE/JSE
    indices exceeds most South African institutional investors' single stock limits. It is
    uncommon for a single stock to have such an outsized weighting when compared
    to other indices. As a result of their single company investment limits and mandate
    restrictions, many South African institutional investors have been forced to sell
    their shares in Naspers as Naspers grew.

    After careful and comprehensive evaluation of the merits of other strategic options 
    available to the Company, it was concluded that the Proposed Transaction is the most 
    promising way to attempt to address these market dynamics and to create further 
    Shareholder value. The Proposed Transaction is intended to address these market issues 
    and is the next significant action to be taken by Naspers management to create 
    further Shareholder value.

    Naspers believes that the Proposed Transaction is a significant step for Naspers
    and presents a new opportunity for global internet investors to access Naspers's
    unique portfolio of international internet assets. Naspers intends for the Proposed
    Transaction to reduce its index weighting on the JSE and at the same time create a new
    platform to attract incremental demand from a broader range of global investors.
    Naspers believes that the Proposed Transaction is well aligned to its continued
    growth ambitions and will help to maximise Shareholder value over time.

    Following the Proposed Transaction, Naspers will:

    - subject to the outcome of the Capitalisation Issue, hold not less than 73% of
      the issued NewCo N Ordinary Shares, with the balance being held by Naspers
      Shareholders as NewCo free float;
    - retain its primary listing on the JSE and secondary listing on A2X. Naspers is
      expected to remain the largest South African company listed on the JSE by
      market capitalisation;
    - remain included in the relevant JSE indices, subject to meeting the relevant
      eligibility criteria; and
    - continue to hold its media assets (primarily Media24) and ecommerce assets in
      South Africa (primarily Takealot and Property24) directly rather than through
      NewCo.

    After implementation of the Proposed Transaction, Naspers will continue to
    invest in South Africa and is committed to building its existing internet and
    ecommerce companies in the country, as well as stimulating the local tech start-
    up sector through Naspers Foundry, which is a R1.4bn investment commitment
    targeting technology start-ups in South Africa. This commitment is in addition
    to the commitment Naspers made in October 2018 at the inaugural South Africa
    Investment Conference to inject a further R3.2bn into its existing South African
    businesses, which is already under way.

4.  THE NEWCO GROUP
    These disclosures have been drafted as the NewCo Group is expected to exist on
    implementation of the Proposed Transaction.

    The NewCo Group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest
    technology investors in the world. The NewCo Group operates across a variety of
    platforms and geographies. The NewCo Group aims to build leading companies that
    create value by empowering people and enriching communities. The NewCo Group
    has grown by investing in, acquiring and building leading companies. The NewCo
    Group typically focuses on large consumer trends where it tries to identify changes
    early, invests in and adapts proven business models for the high-growth markets
    it is focusing on and leverages its skills and local knowledge and position to build
    businesses that have scale and benefit from local network effects. The NewCo Group
    believes that its platforms offer customers fast, intuitive and secure environments
    to communicate and conduct transactions. The NewCo Group focuses on several
    markets that present above-average growth opportunities when compared to mature markets
    due to their economic growth, scalability and fast-growing mobile internet penetration 
    levels. The NewCo Group's businesses and investments primarily operate in China, India, 
    Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, North America, Latin America, Southeast Asia, the 
    Middle East and Africa. The NewCo Group has developed strong brands in these markets 
    and believes that those global and local brands are an important way for each of its 
    businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, thereby driving organic 
    traffic through consumer word-of-mouth.

    The NewCo Group's consumer-facing internet services span the core focus segments
    of online Classifieds, Payments and Fintech, and Food Delivery, plus other online
    business segments, including Etail and Travel. Investing in new sectors is an inherent
    part of the NewCo Group's strategy and through the NewCo Group's Ventures team,
    it intends to continue investing in businesses that it believes have the potential to
    contribute towards its next wave of growth. The NewCo Group's investments in
    Tencent and Mail.ru cover a wide variety of internet services that are built around
    core communication and social networking platforms operating mainly in China and
    Russia.

    The NewCo Group's businesses and investments generate revenues through: online 
    sales of goods, listing fees, payment transaction fees and commissions, mobile 
    and other content revenue (from online mobile app-based services and content, 
    ticketing and logistics services), food-delivery charges and other sources 
    (such as travel-package revenue and commissions thereon and advertising revenue).

5.  RESOLUTION AND GENERAL MEETING
    A General Meeting of Shareholders will be held at the Protea Room, First Floor,
    Cape Town International Convention Centre 2, corner of Heerengracht and Rua
    Bartholomeu Dias, Foreshore, Cape Town, South Africa on Friday, 28 June 2019 at
    11:15 (subject to any adjournment, postponement or cancellation), to consider and if
    deemed fit, to pass, the Resolution (as more fully set out in the Circular).

    In particular, at the General Meeting, approval will be sought from Shareholders on
    the following matters required to be approved by Shareholders in order to implement
    the Proposed Transaction:

    - The amendment of the Memorandum of Incorporation in accordance with section
      36(2), section 16(1)(c) and section 16(5)(a) of the Companies Act and article 38
      of the Memorandum of Incorporation to: (i) create 500 000 000 unlisted Naspers
      M Ordinary Shares in the authorised share capital of the Company in order to
      facilitate the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue, and the issue of NewCo
      N Ordinary Shares to Naspers N Shareholders; and (ii) create the right for
      Naspers A Shareholders to receive the NewCo A Share Distribution.
    - The implementation of the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue in terms
      of section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
      Incorporation by the Company, by the Company issuing, subject to the Election, no
      more than 438 656 059 Naspers M Ordinary Shares on the terms and subject to the
      conditions set out in the Circular.
    - The implementation of the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue in terms
      of section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
      Incorporation, by the Company issuing, in accordance with the Elections made, no
      more than 61 343 941 Naspers N Ordinary Shares on the terms and subject to the
      conditions set out in the Circular.
    - To the extent required, the implementation of the Naspers A Share Capitalisation
      Issue in terms of section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the
      Memorandum of Incorporation, by the Company issuing no more than 173 671
      Naspers A Ordinary Shares on the terms and subject to the conditions set out
      in the Circular. As a result of the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue such
      number of Naspers A Ordinary Shares will be issued on a pro rata basis to
      Naspers A Shareholders so as to maintain the voting ratio that existed between
      the Naspers A Ordinary Shares and the Naspers N Ordinary Shares following the
      capitalisation issue implemented by Naspers on 26 November 2015, where-after
      Naspers A Ordinary Shares carried 68.37% of the total voting rights in the
      Company and Naspers N Ordinary Shares carried 31.63% of the total voting rights
      in the Company.
    - Approving the issue of up to 438 656 059 Naspers M Ordinary Shares, up to
      61 343 941 Naspers N Ordinary Shares and up to 173 671 Naspers A Ordinary
      Shares pursuant to the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue, the Naspers N Share
      Capitalisation Issue and the Naspers A Share Capitalisation Issue, respectively.
    
    The Resolution required to be approved by Shareholders in order to implement the 
    Proposed Transaction (Special Resolution 1 of the General Meeting Notice) is proposed 
    as a composite special resolution, notwithstanding that certain matters proposed to be 
    authorised in terms of the Resolution may qualify to be posed as ordinary resolutions. 
    In respect of any component of the Resolution which is posed as a special resolution, 
    but for which only an ordinary resolution is required, the passing of the special resolution 
    shall be deemed to include such component of the Resolution having been passed as an
    ordinary resolution.
    
    The adoption of the Resolution requires Shareholder approval of at least 75%
    of the aggregate voting rights exercised on the Resolution by the Shareholders
    (determined in accordance with the voting rights attaching to the Naspers
    N Ordinary Shares and the Naspers A Ordinary Shares in terms of the Memorandum
    of Incorporation, respectively), voting together, whether present in person or
    represented by proxy, at the General Meeting, and entitled to exercise voting rights
    on the Resolution.
    
    The General Meeting Notice and a Form of Proxy, for use by Certificated
    Shareholders and Dematerialised Shareholders with ""own-name"" registration who
    are unable to attend the General Meeting in person, are attached to the Circular.
    Dematerialised Shareholders who are not ""own-name"" Dematerialised Shareholders who 
    wish to attend the General Meeting (including to vote thereat) should instruct their 
    CSDP or broker to issue them with the necessary letter of representation to attend 
    the General Meeting in person, in the manner stipulated in the custody agreement 
    governing the relationship between them and their CSDP or broker.

6.  RECOMMENDATION
    The Board is of the view that the Proposed Transaction provides the potential to
    realise the benefits highlighted above in an efficient and effective manner through
    the creation of a vibrant listing and free float of NewCo on Euronext Amsterdam
    and, through its secondary inward listing, on the JSE, while allowing all Naspers N 
    Shareholders equal opportunity to participate directly in the potential future growth 
    of NewCo.

    The Board is of the view that the Proposed Transaction is in the best interests of the
    Company and recommends that all Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution
    to approve certain matters related to implementation of the Proposed Transaction. 
    Each of the Directors themselves intends to vote all of the voting rights attaching 
    to the Shares held by them in favour of the Resolution.

    Notes
    1.   The dates and times indicated in the table above are subject to change. Any material
         changes will be released on SENS.

    2.   Shareholders should note that, as transactions in Naspers N Ordinary Shares are settled
         in the Strate System, settlement of trades takes place three trading days after such trade.
         Therefore, persons who acquire Naspers N Ordinary Shares after the last day to trade in
         order to be recorded in the Naspers register to be eligible to vote at the General Meeting,
         being 18 June 2019 will not be able to vote at the General Meeting. Similar principles apply
         in relation to the last day to trade in order to participate in the Capitalisation Issue.
    
    3.   Forms of Election should be received by the Company or the Transfer Secretary by 12:00 on 
         Friday, 19 July 2019 in the case of the Certificated Naspers N Shareholders. Dematerialised 
         Naspers N Shareholders must inform their GSDP, broker or agent if they choose to make the 
         Election; in accordance with the agreement between such Naspers N Shareholders and their 
         respective GSDPs, broker, or agent.

    4.   Shareholders should note that, as the trading of NewCo N Ordinary Shares is settled
         through the Strate System, in the case of the JSE, and Euroclear Nederland, in the case
         of Euronext Amsterdam, settlement of the first trades in both the Strate System, in the
         case of the JSE, and Euroclear Nederland, in the case of Euronext Amsterdam, will take
         place three trading days after the first trades are executed in order to accommodate the
         settlement cycle of the Strate System. NewCo N Ordinary Shares are expected to list and
         commence trading on the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam on an ""as-if-when-issued"" basis
         on Wednesday, 17 July 2019 and the trades executed on this first trading date are expected
         to settle on Monday, 22 July 2019 on both the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam. Following
         the first trading date of NewCo N Ordinary Shares on Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE,
         settlement of trades in NewCo N Ordinary Shares will take place two trading days after
         a trade is executed through Euroclear Nederland, in the case of Euronext Amsterdam,
         and three trading days after a trade is executed through the Strate System, in the case of
         the JSE.

    5.   Forms of Proxy are to be received by no later than 11:15 on Wednesday, 26 June 2019 for
         administrative purposes only, or such later date if the General Meeting is postponed to
         allow for processing of such proxies. Proxies may, however, be handed to the chair of the
         General Meeting prior to such proxy exercising any right of the Shareholder at the General
         Meeting.
    
    6.   No Naspers N Ordinary Shares may be rematerialised or Dematerialised from Wednesday,
         17 July 2019 to Friday, 19 July 2019, both days inclusive.
  
    7.   If the General Meeting is adjourned or postponed, Forms of Proxy submitted for the initial
         General Meeting will remain valid in respect of any such adjournment or postponement.
  
    8.   All references to times are to South African Standard Time.

8.  CAPITALISATION ISSUE
    8.1 Implementation of the Capitalisation issue
        Subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Circular and the Naspers
        M Share Capitalisation Issue becoming operative, the Company intends to
        implement the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue. However, Naspers
        N Shareholders will be able to Elect to participate in the Naspers N Share
        Capitalisation Issue instead of participating in the Naspers M Share
        Capitalisation Issue.

        The implementation of the Capitalisation Issue will be subject to the fulfilment
        or waiver (in whole or in part), on or before the Longstop Date (1 July 2019), of
        the following conditions:
       
        - The Resolution relating to the implementation of the Proposed Transaction
          being adopted by the requisite majority of Shareholders (as indicated in the
          General Meeting Notice).
        - All Regulatory Consents being received on an unconditional basis, or to
          the extent that any such Regulatory Consents are subject to any obligation,
          undertaking, condition or qualification, such obligation, undertaking,
          condition or qualification is acceptable to the Company in its discretion.
        - The proposed amendments to the Memorandum of Incorporation being
          approved by the requisite majority of Shareholders at the General Meeting
          and being filed with, and accepted by, the CIPC.
       
        All of the above conditions are for the benefit of Naspers. The conditions may
        be waived, in whole or in part, by Naspers on or before the Longstop Date. The
        Longstop Date may be extended by Naspers from time to time by issuing an
        announcement to Shareholders on SENS. The Capitalisation Issue will be unconditional 
        for all purposes upon the issue of a finalisation announcement by Naspers on SENS.
       
        The Board reserves the right, in its discretion, to decide not to proceed
        with the Proposed Transaction until 14:00 on the last day to trade in Naspers N 
        Ordinary Shares in order to be able to participate in the Capitalisation Issue, 
        currently expected to be Tuesday, 16 July 2019. This discretion will include, 
        but not be limited to, the right to amend the timetable for the Proposed Transaction. 
        
        Naspers may at any time, after the Capitalisation Issue is implemented, depending on 
        market conditions and other factors, offer to sell NewCo N Ordinary Shares to new investors.
    
    8.2 The Election
        To achieve the objective of creating a NewCo N Ordinary Share free float of
        25%, or as close as possible thereto post implementation of the Proposed
        Transaction, while at the same time offering Naspers N Shareholders the
        ability to Elect to participate in the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue
        and receive Naspers N Ordinary Shares, the Board determined that 27%,
        representing 438 656 059 of the issued NewCo N Ordinary Shares (post
        implementation of the Proposed Transaction) would be made available to
        Naspers N Shareholders in terms of the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue.
        
        Consequently, in terms of the Capitalisation Issue a Naspers N Shareholder
        will ultimately receive, on a pro rata basis, either an additional direct or
        additional indirect interest in NewCo depending on whether they exercise the
        election to participate in the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue, whereby:
        
        - a Naspers N Shareholder that does not elect to participate in the Naspers N
          Share Capitalisation Issue will be issued with one Naspers M Ordinary Share
          and consequently one NewCo N Ordinary Share for every one Naspers N
          Ordinary Share held on the Record Date; or
        - a Naspers N Shareholder that elects to participate in the Naspers N Share
          Capitalisation Issue will be issued with 0.36986 additional Naspers N
          Ordinary Shares for every one Naspers N Ordinary Share held on the Record
          Date. Where such an election is made, Naspers will be issued the underlying
          one NewCo N Ordinary Share that would otherwise have been issued to the
          Naspers N Shareholder, thereby providing such Naspers N Shareholder with
          the same effective interest in NewCo through the Naspers N Ordinary Shares
          to be issued, as a Naspers N Shareholder that is issued one Naspers M
          Ordinary Share and consequently one NewCo N Ordinary Share.
   
    The ratio of 0.36986 Naspers N Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to an
    election made instead of being issued one Naspers M Ordinary Share (and
    consequently one NewCo N Ordinary Share) under the Naspers M Share
    Capitalisation Issue reflects the ratio between the 438 656 059 Naspers
    N Ordinary Shares and 1 185 996 011 NewCo N Ordinary Shares in issue
    immediately prior to the implementation of the Capitalisation Issue.

    Naspers N Shareholders that do not elect to participate in the
    Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue or do not submit their Election
    timeously, will be issued with Naspers M Ordinary Shares on the
    terms and conditions of the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue
    set out in the Circular and will, accordingly, be issued one NewCo N
    Ordinary Share in consideration for the automatic contribution of
    each Naspers M Ordinary Share held by them.

    8.3 Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue
        Subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Circular, the Company
        intends to implement a capitalisation issue in terms of which it will, subject
        to the Election, issue up to 438 656 059 Naspers M Ordinary Shares to Naspers
        N Shareholders as a capitalisation issue in terms of section 47 of the
        Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of Incorporation, with each
        Naspers N Shareholder entitled to be issued one Naspers M Ordinary Share
        for each Naspers N Ordinary Share held on the Record Date, expected to be
        Friday, 19 July 2019.
        
        Each Naspers M Ordinary Share issued pursuant to the Naspers M Share
        Capitalisation Issue will entitle the holder thereof to be issued one NewCo
        N Ordinary Share in consideration for the automatic contribution of every
        one Naspers M Ordinary Share to NewCo in accordance with the terms of the
        Naspers M Ordinary Shares.

    8.4 Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue
        Subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Circular, the Company
        intends to implement a capitalisation issue, in terms of which it will issue up to
        61 343 941 Naspers N Ordinary Shares to Naspers N Shareholders that Elect to
        participate in the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue instead of participating
        in the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue as a capitalisation issue in terms
        of section 47 of the Companies Act and article 14 of the Memorandum of
        Incorporation.
        
        Naspers N Shareholders Electing to participate in the Naspers N Share
        Capitalisation Issue shall be issued 0.36986 Naspers N Ordinary Shares for
        each Naspers M Ordinary Share that they would otherwise have been entitled
        to be issued as at the Record Date had they participated in the Naspers M
        Share Capitalisation Issue. Naspers N Shareholders who make an Election
        must do so in respect of all (and not part) of their Naspers N Ordinary Shares
        held as at the Record Date.
        
        The number of Naspers N Ordinary Shares that can be issued pursuant to
        the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue is limited to the number of Naspers
        N Ordinary Shares available in the authorised but unissued share capital
        of the Company, being 61 343 941 Naspers N Ordinary Shares as at the Last
        Practicable Date. Should the number of Naspers N Ordinary Shares to be
        issued under the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue exceed the number of
        authorised but unissued Naspers N Ordinary Shares available, then the number
        of Naspers N Ordinary Shares to which a Naspers N Shareholder exercising
        the Election would have been entitled if sufficient Naspers N Ordinary Shares
        were available in the authorised share capital of the Company will be scaled
        down on a pro rata basis to holdings of Naspers N Ordinary Shares on the
        Record Date, with the balance of such Naspers N Shareholders' entitlements
        under the Capitalisation Issue being issued in the form of Naspers M Ordinary
        Shares (and ultimately, NewCo N Ordinary Shares). 
        
        Only whole numbers of Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers M Ordinary Shares will 
        be issued and where fractional entitlements to Naspers N Ordinary Shares arise, 
        such fractions will be rounded down to the nearest whole number with any remaining 
        fractional entitlements to Naspers N Ordinary Shares being sold on behalf of the 
        relevant Naspers N Shareholder. The cash proceeds of such fractional entitlements 
        sold on behalf of such Naspers N Shareholders will be determined in accordance with 
        the JSE Listings Requirements and paid to the relevant Naspers N Shareholder in its 
        brokerage account or an to a nominee account to be held on behalf and for the benefit
        of the relevant Naspers N Shareholder, in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements.
       
        As outlined above, for every one Naspers N Ordinary Share issued pursuant
        to the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue, Naspers will be issued 2.70370
        NewCo N Ordinary Shares.
        
        All new Naspers N Ordinary Shares and NewCo N Ordinary Shares will be
        issued in Dematerialised Form. For further information on settlement please
        see the Circular. If you have any queries please contact the Naspers transfer
        secretary, including in relation to how to open an account for holding Naspers
        N Ordinary Shares or NewCo N Ordinary Shares in Dematerialised Form.

    8.5 Naspers A Share Capitalisation Issue
        In terms of article 14.1.6 of the Memorandum of Incorporation, if there is a
        capitalisation issue of Naspers N Ordinary Shares, a corresponding number of
        Naspers A Ordinary Shares is required to be issued through a capitalisation
        issue in order to maintain the voting ratio that existed between the Naspers
        A Ordinary Shares and the Naspers N Ordinary Shares prior to the relevant
        capitalisation issue of Naspers N Ordinary Shares. In this regard, Naspers
        implemented a capitalisation issue on 26 November 2015 as a result of which
        Naspers A Ordinary Shares carried 68.37% of the aggregate voting rights in
        Naspers and Naspers N Ordinary Shares carried 31.63% of the aggregate
        voting rights. Similarly, as it is proposed as part of the Proposed Transaction to
        implement the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue in terms of which Naspers
        N Ordinary Shares will be issued as a capitalisation issue, the Company will
        be required in terms of the Memorandum of Incorporation to implement a
        capitalisation issue of the Naspers A Ordinary Shares.
        
        Accordingly, the Naspers N Share Capitalisation Issue will be accompanied
        by a pro rata capitalisation issue of up to 173 671 Naspers A Ordinary Shares
        to Naspers A Shareholders on the register on the Record Date so that the
        percentage of voting rights entitled to be exercised at a general meeting on
        matters to be determined by the Naspers A Shareholders and the Naspers N
        Shareholders collectively, following implementation of the Naspers N Share
        Capitalisation Issue, shall be the same vis-a-vis Naspers A Shareholders and
        Naspers N Shareholders as they were immediately following the capitalisation
        issue implemented by Naspers on 26 November 2015. The effect of the Naspers
        A Share Capitalisation Issue will be that 68.37% of the total voting rights in the
        Company will be exercisable by the Naspers A Shareholders and 31.63% of the
        total voting rights in the Company will be exercisable by Naspers N Shareholders.

9.  NEWCO SHARE CAPITAL
    It is expected that, immediately following the implementation of the Proposed
    Transaction, NewCo's share capital will comprise NewCo A Ordinary Shares and
    NewCo N Ordinary Shares.
    
    -   The NewCo A Shares: (i) are not, and will not be admitted to listing and trading
        on a stock exchange as part of the Proposed Transaction; and (ii) carry one vote
        per share, save if Naspers's voting interest in the NewCo Shares drops below 50%
        plus one vote of the total voting interest of all NewCo Shares, which event would,
        pursuant to NewCo's Articles of Association, automatically result in the NewCo A
        Ordinary Shares carrying 1 000 votes per share.
    -   The NewCo N Ordinary Shares will, subject to having received the requisite
        approvals from Euronext Amsterdam and the JSE, be admitted to listing and
        trading on Euronext Amsterdam and, as a secondary listing, on the Main Board of
        the JSE and carry one vote per share.
    
    It is expected that immediately after implementation of the Proposed Transaction,
    NewCo will have 1 624 652 070 NewCo N Ordinary Shares in issue. Subject to the
    outcome of the Capitalisation Issue, which is uncertain, it is expected that Naspers
    will hold not less than 73% (1 185 996 011 NewCo N Ordinary Shares) of the issued
    NewCo N Ordinary Shares with not more than 27% (438 656 059 NewCo N Ordinary
    Shares) being held as free float at such time.
   
    Each NewCo A Ordinary Share and each NewCo N Ordinary Share issued and
    outstanding will rank equally with, and will be eligible for any dividends that may
    be declared on, the NewCo A Ordinary Shares and the NewCo N Ordinary Shares,
    respectively. Each holder of a NewCo A Ordinary Share shall be entitled to one-fifth
    of the dividend rights to which a holder of a NewCo N Ordinary Share is entitled
    multiplied by the percentage free float of NewCo (ie the percentage of NewCo
    N Ordinary Shares not held by Naspers).

10. NEWCO A SHARE DISTRIBUTION
    Naspers will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Circular and following the
    implementation of the Capitalisation Issue and the Naspers A Share Capitalisation
    Issue, distribute the NewCo A Ordinary Shares on a pro rata basis to Naspers A
    Shareholders on the Naspers register on the Record Date. In order to implement
    the NewCo A Share Distribution, an amendment is required to be made to the
    Memorandum of Incorporation so as to give Naspers A Shareholders the right to
    receive NewCo A Ordinary Shares in terms of the NewCo A Share Distribution.
    For further information on the proposed amendment to the Memorandum
    of Incorporation, please refer to the conformed copy of the Memorandum
    of Incorporation showing all proposed amendments thereto available on the
    Company's website at www.naspers.com.

11. TAXATION
    This paragraph highlights certain South African tax considerations in
    relation to the Capitalisation Issue. This brief summary does not purport to
    address all tax consequences associated with the Proposed Transaction,
    and does not take into account the specific circumstances of any
    particular investor or the tax laws of any country other than South Africa.
    For further information regarding certain Dutch and U.S. tax considerations
    related to the Proposed Transaction, please refer to paragraph 19 of the
    Circular titled ""Taxation"".

    The summary of South African income tax consequences set out below is for
    general information only. All Shareholders should consult their tax advisers
    regarding the particular tax consequences applicable to them in relation to the
    Proposed Transaction, including the applicability and effect of other tax laws and
    possible changes in tax law.

    The South African income tax system is a residence-based system of taxation,
    in terms of which South African tax residents are subject to tax in South Africa
    on their worldwide income. Persons that are non-resident for South African tax
    purposes are subject to tax on income derived from a South African source. This
    summary is based on the assumption that an investor is resident in South Africa for
    tax purposes, and that NewCo is not resident in South Africa for tax purposes.
    
    A natural person is a South African tax resident if he or she is ""ordinarily resident""
    in South Africa or, if not ""ordinarily resident"" in South Africa, was physically present
    in South Africa for certain prescribed periods within a continuous six-year period.
    These periods require a physical presence in South Africa of more than 91 days in
    each of the six years and more than 915 during the first five years.
   
    A person other than a natural person (ie a juristic person or a trust) is a South
    African tax resident if it is incorporated, established or formed in South Africa or if
    its place of effective management is located in South Africa.
   
    The definition of a resident specifically excludes any person who is deemed to be
    exclusively a resident of another country for purposes of an applicable agreement
    for the avoidance of double taxation entered into between South Africa and
    the other relevant jurisdiction. Shareholders with questions regarding their tax
    residency should consult their tax advisers.
   
    Capitalisation Issue
    The Capitalisation Issue by Naspers of Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers
    M Ordinary Shares is not a taxable event. Furthermore the issue of shares by a
    company is specifically excluded from the definition of a ""dividend"", as such there
    should be no dividend tax liability triggered as a result of the Capitalisation Issue.
    
    In the hands of the Shareholders, such Capitalisation Issue shares will, however,
    be deemed to have nil tax base cost, which implies that the full value of the shares
    may become taxable in the event that such shares are disposed of in future, to the
    extent that the Shareholder is subject to South African tax. In this regard, in terms
    of the Naspers M Share Capitalisation Issue a disposal of the Naspers M Ordinary
    Shares is triggered immediately for South African tax purposes when the Naspers
    M Ordinary Shares will be automatically contributed for the issue of NewCo N
    Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Naspers M Ordinary Shares
    (with proceeds being equal to the market value of the NewCo N Ordinary Shares
    at the time that the Capitalisation Issue is implemented). Effectively, this means
    that whereas the capitalisation issue by Naspers of Naspers N Ordinary Shares
    is tax free for South African tax resident Shareholders, the Naspers M Share
    Capitalisation Issue will be a taxable event for certain South African tax resident
    Shareholders (ie taxable). Non-South African tax resident Shareholders, whose
    shares are not attributable to a permanent establishment in South Africa, should
    fall outside the scope of South African capital gains tax insofar as it relates to the
    disposal of shares in Naspers - as Naspers is not a so-called ""land rich"" company,
    ie Naspers shares should not constitute an ""interest in immovable property situated
    in the Republic"" for South African capital gains tax purposes.

    contained in the Circular and/or this announcement is, or shall be relied upon as,

    Forward-looking statements
    This announcement and the Circular contain statements about Naspers and/or NewCo that are, or may
    be, forward-looking statements. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) are, or may be
    deemed to be, forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those concerning: strategy;
    the economic outlook for the industries in which Naspers and/or NewCo operates or invests as well as
    markets generally; production; cash costs and other operating results; growth prospects and outlook
    for operations and/or investments, individually or in the aggregate; liquidity, capital resources and
    expenditure, statements in relation to the approval by Shareholders or implementation of the Proposed
    Transactions. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect
    current expectations concerning future results and events and generally may be identified by the use of
    forward-looking words or phrases such as ""believe"", ""aim"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""intend"", ""foresee"",
    ""forecast"", ""likely"", ""should"", ""planned"", ""may"", ""estimated"", ""potential"" or similar words and phrases.
   
    Examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding a future financial position or
    future profits, cash flows, corporate strategy, implementation of the Proposed Transaction, anticipated
    levels of growth, estimates of capital expenditures, acquisition and investment strategy, expansion
    prospects or future capital expenditure levels and other economic factors, such as, among others,
    growth and interest rates.
   
    By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
    because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
    Naspers cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual
    results, financial and operating conditions, returns and the developments within the industries and
    markets in which Naspers or NewCo operates and/or invests may differ materially from those made in,
    or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and/or the Circular.
   
    All these forward-looking statements are based on estimates, predictions and assumptions, as regards
    Naspers or NewCo, all of which estimates, predictions and assumptions, although Naspers believes
    them to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain and may not eventuate or eventuate in the manner
    Naspers expects. Factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be
    materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in
    those statements or assumptions include matters not yet known to Naspers or not currently considered
    material by Naspers.
   
    Shareholders should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made in this announcement and/
    or the Circular or elsewhere is applicable only at the date on which such forward-looking statement
    is made. New factors that could cause the business of Naspers or NewCo not to develop as expected
    may emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict all of them. Further, the extent to which
    any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ
    materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement is not known. Naspers has no duty to,
    and does not intend to, update or revise the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement
    and/or the Circular or any other information herein after the date of the Circular, except as may be
    required by law.
   
    Any forward-looking statement has not been reviewed nor reported on by Naspers's external auditor or
    any other expert.
   
    NASPERS N SHAREHOLDERS MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE CONTENTS OF THE
    ENTIRE CIRCULAR IN RELATION TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND MUST
    TAKE APPROPRIATE ADVICE AS NECESSARY, PARTICULARLY, IN RELATION TO
    THE POTENTIAL TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THE CAPITALISATION ISSUE OR THE

Listing of International Internet Assets on Euronext Amsterdam,25 Mar 2019,"NPN 201903250017A

LISTING OF INTERNATIONAL INTERNET ASSETS ON EURONEXT AMSTERDAM

Naspers today announces its intention to form a new global consumer internet group (""NewCo"")
comprising Naspers' international internet assets and list NewCo on Euronext Amsterdam. NewCo will
also have a secondary, inward listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""JSE"") in South Africa
(""Proposed Transaction"").

NewCo will comprise all of Naspers' internet interests outside of South Africa including, among others, its
companies and investments in the online classifieds, payments, food delivery, etail, travel, education and
social and internet platforms sectors. These businesses are some of the world's leading and fastest-
growing internet brands, such as Tencent, mail.ru, OLX, Avito, letgo, PayU, iFood, Swiggy, DeliveryHero,
Udemy, eMAG and MakeMyTrip. NewCo is expected to be approximately 75% owned by Naspers and to
have a free float of approximately 25%.

As Europe's largest listed consumer internet company by asset value, NewCo will give global internet
investors direct access to Naspers' attractive and unique portfolio of international internet assets.

The Proposed Transaction will be subject to the requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals being
obtained. The requisite approval for the Proposed Transaction has been obtained from the Department
of National Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank on terms and subject to conditions customary
to international transactions of this nature. The Proposed Transaction is expected to be implemented no
earlier than H2 2019.

The Proposed Transaction is a significant step for Naspers and presents an appealing new opportunity to
global internet investors to have access to Naspers's attractive and unique portfolio of international
internet assets. It is intended for the Proposed Transaction to reduce Naspers' weighting on the JSE and
at the same time opening up investment in Naspers to a broader category of investors. The Company
believes that the Proposed Transaction is well-aligned to its continued growth ambitions and will help to
maximise shareholder value over time.

Naspers has a long history of investing in technology to capture growth, transforming itself from a print
media, payTV and video entertainment company into one of the top 10 global internet companies by
market capitalisation. In growing, the Group has created significant value for its many stakeholders,
however, this rapid growth has also created some unique market dynamics. Naspers now constitutes
almost 25% of the JSE SWIX index, compared to 5% just five years ago, and its outsized weighting on the
JSE exceeds most South African institutional investors' single stock limits. As a result, many South African
institutional investors have been forced to sell their shares in Naspers as Naspers grew.

After careful and comprehensive evaluation of the merits of strategic options available to the Group to
address this market issue, it was concluded that the listing of NewCo on Euronext Amsterdam envisaged
in the Proposed Transaction proved to be the most promising in addressing these market dynamics and
to create shareholder value. The listing on Euronext Amsterdam envisaged in the Proposed Transaction is
expected to help address this market issue and is the next significant action by management to create
shareholder value. Recently, several actions have been undertaken by Naspers, including increasing the
capacity of Naspers' US ADS programme, trimming its stake in Tencent, exiting several businesses, driving
growth across its core internet businesses and turning its online classifieds business and several of its
other early-stage investments to profitability. In addition, at the beginning of March 2019, Naspers                                                                                                    
unbundled MultiChoice Group Limited on the JSE to existing Naspers shareholders creating a new, top-40
listed company in South Africa with an initial market capitalisation of US$3.5 billion. The move completed
Naspers' transformation to a global consumer internet company, with effectively all revenues and profits
now coming from online.

Following the implementation of the Proposed Transaction, Naspers will retain its primary listing on the
JSE, and will continue to directly hold its South African assets, Takealot and Media24, alongside its
majority stake in NewCo. NewCo's free float is expected to be created by Naspers through a capitalisation
issue of NewCo shares to Naspers shareholders. Shareholders will also be able to choose to receive more
shares in Naspers instead of shares in NewCo, subject to certain limits. This is intended to provide
flexibility to shareholders. It is intended that the board and governance structures of NewCo will mirror
those of Naspers. Further details regarding the implementation of the Proposed Transaction will be
provided in due course.

After the listing of NewCo on Euronext Amsterdam, Naspers will remain the largest South African
company listed on the JSE by market capitalisation, and Naspers will continue to invest in South Africa.
Naspers is one of the foremost investors in the South African technology sector and is committed to
building its existing internet and ecommerce companies in the country, as well as stimulating the local
tech start-up sector through the Naspers Foundry. This is a R1.4 billion investment commitment targeting
technology start-ups in South Africa that seek to address big societal needs. This is in addition to the
commitment Naspers made in October 2018 at the inaugural South Africa Investment Conference to inject
a further R3.2 billion into its existing South African business, which is already underway.

Information related to the Proposed Transaction can be viewed at www.newglobaltechgroup.com from
09:30am CET on 25 March 2019 and further information will be available in the coming weeks and
months.

released on SENS on 21 January 2019, 19 February 2019 and 28 February 2019 (collectively
""Announcements"") which set out the details of the unbundling by Naspers of 438 837 468

Unless expressly defined, capitalised terms used in this announcement shall bear the same

Shareholders are advised that Naspers has successfully completed the Unbundling as described in
the Announcements following the listing of MultiChoice Group Limited on the JSE (Share Code:
MCG; ISIN: ZAE000265971) with effect from the commencement of trade on Wednesday,

ANNOUNCEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE APPORTIONMENT OF EXPENDITURE AND
MARKET VALUE IN RESPECT OF THE UNBUNDLING OF MULTICHOICE GROUP LIMITED

NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO
ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR
WOULD REQUIRE FURTHER ACTION FOR SUCH PURPOSE

1.    Introduction

Naspers ""N"" shareholders (""Naspers Shareholders"") are referred to the announcements released
by Naspers on SENS on 21 January 2019 and 19 February 2019 regarding the proposed
unbundling by Naspers, by way of a distribution in specie, of 438 837 468 ordinary shares in the
issued share capital of MultiChoice Group Limited (""MultiChoice"") held by Naspers (being 100% of
the issued share capital of MultiChoice) (""Unbundling"") in the ratio of one ordinary share in the
issued share capital of MultiChoice (""MultiChoice Share"") for every one Naspers ""N"" ordinary
share held at 17:00 on Friday, 1 March 2019, being the Unbundling Record Date, with the last
day to trade in Naspers ""N"" ordinary shares in order to participate in the Unbundling being
Tuesday, 26 February 2019 (""LDT Date"").

Unless expressly defined, capitalised terms used in this announcement shall bear the same
meanings ascribed to them in the Naspers Unbundling Announcement.

As previously advised, the Unbundling will be implemented in terms of section 46 of the Companies
Act No.71 of 2008 and section 46 of the Income Tax Act No.58 of 1962 (""Income Tax Act""). The
purpose of this announcement is to notify Naspers Shareholders of the apportionment ratio to be
applied by Naspers ""N"" Shareholders in determining the portion of their existing expenditure and/or
market value (if relevant) in their Naspers shares to be allocated to the Unbundled MultiChoice
Shares whilst the balance will be reflected in respect of the retained Naspers ""N"" Shares.

2.    Apportionment tax principles

Naspers Shareholders will have a combined expenditure in respect of Naspers ""N"" shares and the
MultiChoice Shares received pursuant to the Unbundling.

2.1         Naspers Shares held as trading stock

            Any Naspers Shareholder holding Naspers shares as trading stock will be deemed to
            acquire the MultiChoice Shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure (for the
            purposes of income tax) of such Naspers shares and MultiChoice Shares will be the
            amount originally taken into account by the Naspers Shareholder prior to the
            Unbundling in respect of those Naspers shares, as contemplated in section 11(a),
            section 22(1), or section 22(2) of the Income Tax Act.

            The original expenditure incurred in respect of the ""N"" ordinary shares will be
            apportioned between the MultiChoice Shares and the ""N"" ordinary shares by applying
            the ratio that the market value of MultiChoice Shares bears to the sum of the market
            value of the MultiChoice Shares and the ""N"" ordinary shares at the end of the
            business day after the LDT Date, being determined with reference to Naspers and
            MultiChoice closing share prices on the first business day after the LDT Date. This
            ratio must be used in the determination of any profits or losses derived on any future
            disposals of the MultiChoice Shares or Naspers ""N"" Shares.
                                                                                                   

             The expenditure so allocated to the MultiChoice Shares will reduce the expenditure of
             the Naspers Shares held, thus allocating the expenditure between the Naspers
             Shares and the MultiChoice Shares.

2.2          Naspers Shares as capital assets

             Any Naspers shareholder holding Naspers ""N"" shares as capital assets will be
             deemed to acquire the MultiChoice Shares as capital assets. The original expenditure
             incurred prior to the Unbundling in respect of the Naspers ""N"" shares, that is allowable
             in terms of paragraph 20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and (where
             applicable) the CGT valuation of the Naspers ""N"" shares, as contemplated in
             paragraph 29 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, will be apportioned
             between the MultiChoice Shares and the Naspers ""N"" Shares by applying the ratio
             that the market value of MultiChoice Shares bears to the sum of the market values of
             the MultiChoice Shares and Naspers ""N"" Shares at the end of the business day after
             the LDT Date, being determined with reference to Naspers and MultiChoice closing
             share prices on the first business day after the LDT Date.

             This ratio must be used in the determination of the capital gain or loss derived on any
             future disposals of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares or Naspers shares.

             The expenditure (and CGT valuation, where applicable) so allocated to the
             MultiChoice Shares will reduce the expenditure (and CGT valuation, where applicable)
             of the Naspers shares held, thus allocating this cost history between the Naspers
             shares and the MultiChoice Shares.

             The shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares
             on the date on which the Naspers shares were originally acquired.

Naspers Shareholders are hereby advised to consult their own professional tax advisors should
they have any queries regarding the taxation consequences of the Unbundling and the calculation
of their costs.

3.    Apportionment ratio

Naspers ""N"" Shareholders are hereby advised that the expenditure, in respect of their ""N"" shares,
as referred to above must be apportioned in the ratio of 96.6% to a Naspers ""N"" share held after
the Unbundling and 3.4% to a MultiChoice Share (Apportionment Ratio"").

The Apportionment Ratio is based on the closing price of 301,700.00 South African cents per
Naspers ""N"" share and 10,610.00 South African cents per MultiChoice Share on Wednesday,
27 February 2019.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNBUNDLING. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE
CONSIDERED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. NASPERS SHAREHOLDERS ARE ADVISED
TO CONSULT THEIR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVISERS ON THE TAXATION
CONSEQUENCES OF THE UNBUNDLING IN BOTH SOUTH AFRICA AND THEIR

1. INTRODUCTION
   Further to the announcement issued by Naspers on the JSE's Stock Exchange News
   Service (""SENS"") on 17 September 2018, Naspers proposes to unbundle its video
   entertainment business (""Business"") currently held by its wholly owned subsidiary,
   MultiChoice Group Limited (""MultiChoice""), to the holders of its ""N"" ordinary
   shares and ""A"" ordinary shares, respectively, and list the shares in MultiChoice on
   the JSE Limited (""JSE"") as a primary listing.
 
   To facilitate the Unbundling and Listing (as defined below), MultiChoice was
   incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of MIH Holdings Proprietary Limited
   and, subsequent to the restructuring contemplated in the MultiChoice pre-listing
   statement issued today (""Pre-listing Statement""), includes MultiChoice South
   Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (""MCSA""), Irdeto South Africa Proprietary
   Limited, Main Street 484 Proprietary Limited, Irdeto Holdings B.V., Showmax B.V.,
   MultiChoice Africa Holdings B.V., Digital Mobile Television Proprietary Limited,
   MultiChoice Botswana Proprietary Limited, MultiChoice Namibia Proprietary
   Limited and NMS Insurance Services (SA) Limited (and the subsidiaries, associates
   and/or affiliates of such entities as at the date on which the restructuring was
   implemented).

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE UNBUNDLING
   Naspers, its subsidiaries, affiliates and associates (""Naspers Group"") has evolved
   from a traditional media business into a global internet and entertainment group.
   The Naspers Group has gone through many investment cycles, building successful
   businesses that generate healthy cash flows to support the next investment cycle.
   One of these success stories has been MultiChoice, which is one of the fastest growing
   pay-TV broadcast providers globally, entertaining 13.9 million households (as at
   30 September 2018) in 50 countries across multiple platforms, including digital satellite
   television and digital terrestrial television, as well as over-the-top (""OTT"") content.

   Naspers has evolved in recent years into two distinct business lines: a high-growth
   global internet business with international focus; and a cash generative, African
   video entertainment business. The Naspers board of directors (""Board""), as part
   of its continuing review of the Naspers business operations, has determined that,
   given their divergent paths, there is no longer a strategic rationale for keeping both
   business lines together and there are no synergies between the two businesses.
   This also reflects the Naspers Group's continued shift towards becoming a global
   consumer internet company.

   As a result, the Board intends to unbundle (""Unbundling"") the Business currently
   held by MultiChoice through a pro rata distribution in specie for no consideration of
   all the issued shares in MultiChoice held by Naspers, to holders of the ""N"" ordinary
   shares and ""A"" ordinary shares in Naspers, in terms of section 46 of the South
   African Companies Act, 2008 (as amended) (""Companies Act"") and section 46 of
   the South African Income Tax Act, 1962 (""Income Tax Act""), and, simultaneously
   to list the issued shares in MultiChoice on the main board of the JSE as a primary
   listing (""Listing""). The Unbundling and Listing will result in Naspers shareholders
   holding a direct interest in MultiChoice rather than holding that interest through
   Naspers.

   The Board is of the view that the Unbundling could unlock value for Naspers
   shareholders. In particular, the Board expects the Unbundling and Listing to:

   - create an empowered, top 40 JSE-listed African entertainment company that is
     profitable and cash-generative, and therefore equipped to be at the forefront of
     the African digital transformation;

   - increase investment options for South Africans and international investors, while
     providing them with an opportunity to support a company focused on investment,
     growth and local community empowerment in South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa
     and the adjacent islands;

   - reinforce MultiChoice and Naspers's commitment to broad, socio-economic
     transformation in South Africa, through the allocation of an additional 5%
     stake in MCSA to, collectively, Phuthuma Nathi Investments (RF) Limited and
     Phuthuma Nathi Investments 2 (RF) Limited (""Phuthuma Nathi""), as detailed
     further below;

   - complete the transformation of Naspers into a global consumer internet
     company; and

   - improve focus of the respective management teams to pursue growth
     opportunities in the region for MultiChoice and Naspers.

   Both Naspers and MultiChoice will remain South African domiciled companies with
   their primary listings of shares on the JSE.

   In addition, Naspers will continue to operate and invest in several companies
   in South Africa, particularly in its core focus areas of consumer internet and
   ecommerce. Currently, these companies include Media24, Takealot, Mr D, OLX,
   Property24, AutoTrader SA, the Frontier Car Group and PayU. As an indication of
   Naspers's commitment to South Africa, Naspers has invested R6.9 billion over the
   past three years in developing its existing South African businesses and through
   M&A activity. In addition, Naspers also pledged (at the South Africa Investment
   Conference, that was held in October 2018) to invest a further R4.6 billion in new
   and existing technology companies in South Africa.

3. MULTICHOICE
   MultiChoice, its subsidiaries, affiliates and associates (""MultiChoice Group"") is
   one of the leading video entertainment operators on the African continent, and one
   of the fastest growing pay-TV broadcast providers globally, entertaining 13.9 million
   households (as at 30 September 2018) across 50 countries. Its carefully curated
   local and international content is distributed across multiple platforms, including
   digital satellite and terrestrial television, as well as through OTT solutions. The
   MultiChoice Group is structured around the following three business segments:

   - South Africa, the MultiChoice Group's division that offers digital satellite
     television and subscription video-on-demand services to 7.2 million subscribers in
     South Africa (as at 30 September 2018). Connected Video, which forms part of the
     South Africa segment from a financial reporting standpoint, delivers online video
     entertainment services to subscribers;

   - Rest of Africa, the MultiChoice Group's division which offers digital satellite,
     online services and digital terrestrial television services to 6.7 million subscribers
     across Africa (as at 30 September 2018); and

   - Technology, which includes the MultiChoice Group's leading digital platform and
     application security division, Irdeto.

   As set out in the Pre-listing Statement issued today, in the past two fiscal years,
   the MultiChoice Group has grown its subscriber base by 14% compound annual
   growth rate (""CAGR""), and generated resilient organic revenue growth, while
   its profitability has improved. For the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the
   MultiChoice Group's subscriber base was 13.5 million, which represented a 13%
   increase over the financial year ended 31 March 2017. The MultiChoice Group's
   revenues were R47.5 billion compared to R47.7 billion the year before. The table
   below is replicated from the Pre-listing Statement and summarises the MultiChoice
   Group's subscriber base, revenue, and trading profit over the past three years.

   As a pioneer in the African pay-TV ecosystem, the MultiChoice Group played
   an important role in making information and entertainment easily accessible

   communities in which it operates. Today, the MultiChoice Group employs more
   than 9 000 people in Africa and indirectly creates economic prosperity for over
   20 000 more who are employed by its various partners and suppliers across the
   continent. The MultiChoice Group remains committed to broad, socio-economic
   transformation in South Africa, most notably through its Phuthuma Nathi share
   schemes that are aimed at empowering local communities.

4. B-BBEE TRANSACTION
   In 2006 and 2007, Naspers undertook one of the largest Broad-based Black Economic
   Empowerment transactions (""B-BBEE"") in South Africa by enabling the acquisition
   of a stake in MCSA by black investors. Naspers arranged, structured and funded
   the sale of a 20% interest in MCSA to black investors through Phuthuma Nathi.
   Today Phuthuma Nathi comprises approximately 90 000 individual and institutional
   shareholders and its shares are listed on the Equity Express Securities Exchange.
   Through Phuthuma Nathi, MCSA has provided long-term, far-reaching benefits to
   B-BBEE shareholders, with an estimated return on investment of approximately
   17 times. Phuthuma Nathi shareholders have benefitted from:

   - Capital growth: Phuthuma Nathi shares have delivered meaningful share
     price appreciation - an initial investment of R10 per share (at the time of the
     B-BBEE transactions in 2006/2007) has increased to a price of approximately
     R130 per share as of the Last Practicable Date, which represents a CAGR of
     approximately 24%.

   - Cash flow: MCSA's strong financial performance (particularly cash
     generation) enabled meaningful dividend payments to Phuthuma Nathi
     shareholders which resulted in Phuthuma Nathi being able to repay its
     vendor funding in 2014, two years ahead of schedule. As such, Phuthuma
     Nathi now realises the full value of its MCSA dividends unencumbered,
     which has further driven the attractive cash flow profile. To date, Phuthuma
     Nathi shareholders have received approximately R6.2 billion in dividends,
     relative to a total investment of R675 million, which reflects an internal rate
     of return of approximately 30%.

   To underpin the MultiChoice and Naspers commitment to broad, socio-economic
   transformation and B-BBEE, Naspers and MultiChoice recently agreed to
   implement a new empowerment transaction at MCSA. This new transaction will be
   executed by allocating an additional 5% stake in MCSA to Phuthuma Nathi for no
   consideration (the ""2018 Empowerment Transaction""). The 2018 Empowerment
   Transaction will be implemented on the Unbundling Operative Date and upon
   implementation, the Phuthuma Nathi shareholders' indirect interest in MCSA will
   increase from 20% to 25% and result in a 25% increase in Phuthuma Nathi's dividend
   flows. The Listing of MultiChoice may also increase Phuthuma Nathi's and its
   shareholders' potential upside in future value creation as a result of having a listed
   reference point.

   Further, post-implementation of the Listing and subject to obtaining the necessary
   Phuthuma Nathi board and shareholder approvals, it is MultiChoice's intention
   to enable the exchange of 25% of the Phuthuma Nathi shareholders' original
   shareholding (before the allocation of the additional 5% discussed above) for
   MultiChoice shares that will be freely tradeable, which is expected to unlock
   incremental value for Phuthuma Nathi shareholders.

6. UNBUNDLING
   6.1 Ratio of entitlement
       The Board intends to implement the Unbundling by way of a pro rata distribution
       in specie of ordinary shares of no par value in MultiChoice (""MultiChoice
       Shares"") for no consideration to Naspers shareholders in terms of section 46 of
       the Companies Act and section 46 of the Income Tax Act. Naspers will distribute
       438 837 468 MultiChoice Shares (""Unbundled MultiChoice Shares"") (being
       100% of the issued MultiChoice Shares and all of the MultiChoice Shares held
       by Naspers) to Naspers shareholders on the Naspers securities register at 17:00
       South African standard time on Friday, 1 March 2019 (""Unbundling Record
       Date and Time"") on the terms as set out in this announcement. For more
       information on the MultiChoice American depository shares (""ADS"") facility,
       and the issue of MultiChoice ADSs to holders of Naspers ADSs, please see
       paragraph 11 below.

       Naspers shareholders holding ""A"" and ""N"" ordinary shares (""Naspers Shares"")
       on the Naspers securities register on the Unbundling Record Date and Time will
       be transferred one Unbundled MultiChoice Share for every one ""N"" ordinary
       share held and one Unbundled MultiChoice Share for every five ""A"" ordinary
       shares held. With effect from the Unbundling Operative Date (expected to
       be 09:00 on Monday, 4 March 2019), the Unbundling will be implemented and
       beneficial ownership in the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares will pass to Naspers
       shareholders.

       The transfer of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares to Naspers shareholders
       holding ""A"" ordinary shares could result in fractional entitlements for such
       shareholders. For more detail on the treatment of fractional entitlements,
       please see paragraph 6.2 below.

   6.2 Fractional entitlements, Cash Proceeds and Applicable Rate
       In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, fractional entitlements
       will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the aggregated excess
       fractions of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares to which a Naspers shareholder
       holding ""A"" ordinary shares on the Unbundling Record Date and Time would
       otherwise be entitled will not be transferred to them following the Unbundling,
       but will instead be sold on their behalf in the market as soon as practicable
       after the Unbundling. Fractional entitlements will only be paid to Naspers
       shareholders holding ""A"" ordinary shares.

       The cash proceeds of the sale of fractional entitlements payable to Naspers
       shareholders holding ""A"" ordinary shares in respect of MultiChoice Shares
       (""Cash Proceeds"") will be paid net of any applicable taxes or costs.
       Accordingly, to the extent that any shareholder is in doubt of his or her
       tax position, such shareholder should consult an appropriate independent
       professional adviser.

       The Cash Proceeds will be determined with reference to the volume weighted
       average price in South African Rand of a MultiChoice Share traded on the JSE
       on the first JSE trading day (expected to be Wednesday, 27 February 2019)
       after the last day to trade in the Naspers Shares in order to participate in
       the Unbundling (expected to be Tuesday, 26 February 2019) (""LDT Date"")
       discounted by 10%.

       The basis for the Cash Proceeds will be announced by Naspers on SENS two
       JSE trading days after the LDT (expected to be Thursday, 28 February 2019).

       Notes:
       (1) The expected dates and times listed above may be subject to change. Any material changes will
           be announced on SENS.
       (2) All references to times are to South African standard time, unless otherwise stated.

           27 February 2019 up to and including Friday, 1 March 2019.
       (4) The Unbundling will result in certain holders of ""A"" ordinary shares being entitled to fractions
           of Shares. Any fractional entitlements to Shares which holders of ""A"" ordinary shares are
           entitled to will be dealt with in accordance with the Naspers Announcement.

      Shareholders should anticipate their holdings of Naspers Shares on the
      Unbundling Record Date and Time by taking into account all unsettled trades
      concluded on or before the LDT Date to participate in the Unbundling which is
      due to be settled on the Unbundling Record Date and Time.

  6.4 Trading and settlement
      Naspers shareholders who hold their Naspers shares in certificated form,
      (""Certificated Naspers Shareholders"") will be issued their respective
      Unbundled MultiChoice Shares in certificated form. Pursuant to the
      Unbundling, share certificates will be posted, at the risk of the Certificated
      Naspers Shareholders, by registered post in South Africa on about the first
      business day after the Unbundling Record Date (""Operative Date"") to the
      addresses reflected in the securities register of Naspers on the Unbundling
      Record Date.
     
      Such Certificated Naspers Shareholders are advised that they will have
      to dematerialise the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares received by them in
      certificated form prior to trading in such MultiChoice Shares on the JSE.
      Naspers Shareholders who hold their Naspers Shares in dematerialised form
      (""Dematerialised Naspers Shareholders"") will have their accounts at their
      CSDP or broker updated on the Operative Date with the relevant Unbundled
      MultiChoice Shares pursuant to the Unbundling.
     
      Documents of title in respect of Naspers Shares (""Documents of Title"") are
      not required to be surrendered in order to receive the Unbundled MultiChoice
      Shares.
     
      To the extent that Certificated Naspers Shareholders wish to receive their
      Unbundled MultiChoice Shares in dematerialised form, those Naspers
      shareholders should contact Link Market Services Proprietary Limited
      (""Transfer Secretaries"") directly.

  6.5 Approvals
      Naspers shareholder approval is not required for the Unbundling under the
      Companies Act and the JSE Listings Requirements.
      
      Naspers has obtained approval from the South African Reserve Bank for the
      Unbundling and the Listing.
     
      The JSE has approved the admission of the entire issued share capital of
      MultiChoice in the ""5553 - Broadcasting and Entertainment"" sector of the
      main board of the JSE under the abbreviated name ""MC Group"" and share
      code ""MCG"" with effect from the commencement of trading on Wednesday,
      27 February 2019.
     
      As set out in the Pre-listing Statement, pursuant to a provision of the MultiChoice
      memorandum of incorporation, MultiChoice is permitted to reduce the voting
      rights of shares in MultiChoice (including MultiChoice Shares deposited in terms
      of the ADS facility) so that the aggregate voting power of MultiChoice Shares
      that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to South Africa (as envisaged
      in the MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation) will not exceed 20% of the
      total voting power in MultiChoice. This is to ensure compliance with certain
      statutory requirements applicable in South Africa. For this purpose, MultiChoice
      will presume in particular that all MultiChoice Shares deposited in terms of
      the MultiChoice ADS facility are owned or held by foreigners to South Africa,
      regardless of the actual nationality of the MultiChoice ADS holder. For further
      information in relation to the variable voting structure in place in respect of
      MultiChoice, please refer to the Pre-listing Statement.

7. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE UNBUNDLING
   The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the Unbundling.
   Based on Naspers's consolidated interim results for the period ended
   30 September 2018, the pro forma financial effects of the Unbundling on the earnings
   per share (""EPS""), diluted EPS, headline earnings per share (""HEPS""), diluted
   HEPS, core HEPS, net asset value (""NAV"") and tangible NAV (""TNAV"") of the
   Naspers Group are set out below.
   
   These financial effects are prepared for illustrative purposes only to assist
   shareholders to assess the impact of the Unbundling and, because of their nature,
   may not give a fair presentation of the effect of the Unbundling on Naspers's results
   of operations.
   
   The summarised pro forma financial effects have been prepared in a manner
   consistent in all respects with International Financial Reporting Standards
   (""IFRS""), the accounting policies adopted by Naspers as at 30 September 2018 and
   the JSE Listings Requirements. The summarised pro forma financial effects have
   not been audited, or reported on, by Naspers's auditors or reporting accountants.
   The pro forma financial effects are the responsibility of the Board. The material
   assumptions used in the preparation of the pro forma financial effects are set out in
   the notes following the table below.
                                                                Period ended

8. EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS
   The Unbundled MultiChoice Shares are not freely transferable from the common
   monetary area and must be dealt with in terms of the South African Exchange Control
   Regulations, 1961 (as amended) (""Exchange Control Regulations""). The following
   summary of the Exchange Control Regulations is intended as a guide only and is not a
   comprehensive statement of the Exchange Control Regulations or advice. Shareholders
   who are in any doubt regarding the Exchange Control Regulations should contact their
   own professional advisers. This summary is based on the laws and regulations as in
   force and as applied in practice as at the date hereof and is subject to changes to those
   laws and regulations and practices subsequent to such date.
 
 8.1  Emigrants from the Common Monetary Area consisting of South
      Africa, the Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and
      eSwatini (""CMA"")

      Any share certificates that may be issued by MultiChoice to emigrants from
      the CMA will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange
      Control Regulations.

      Uncertificated, Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and/or securities will be
      credited directly to the emigrants' respective emigrant share accounts at
      the CSDP or broker controlling their remaining portfolios and an appropriate
      electronic entry will be made in the relevant register reflecting a ""non-resident""
      endorsement. The CSDP or broker will ensure that the emigrant adheres to the
      Exchange Control Regulations.

      Any Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and/or securities issued in certificated
      form, cash dividends and residual cash payments based on emigrants'
      Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and/or securities controlled in terms of the
      Exchange Control Regulations will be forwarded to the authorised dealer in
      foreign exchange controlling their remaining assets.

  8.2 Residents outside of the CMA
      Any share certificates that may be issued by MultiChoice to non-residents of
      the CMA will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange
      Control Regulations.

      Uncertificated Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and/or securities will be
      credited directly to the non-resident's non-resident share accounts at the
      CSDP or broker controlling their portfolios and an appropriate electronic entry
      will be made in the relevant register reflecting a ""non-resident"" endorsement.
      The CSDP or broker will ensure that the non-resident adheres to the Exchange
      Control Regulations.

      Cash dividends and residual cash payments due to non-residents are freely
      transferable from South Africa, subject to being converted into a currency
      other than Rand or paid for the credit of a non-resident Rand account.

9. TAXATION
   The following summary describes certain tax consequences in connection with the
   Unbundling. This summary is based on the laws as in force and as applied in practice
   as at the date hereof and is subject to changes to those laws and practices subsequent
   to such date. In the case of persons who are non-residents of South Africa for income
   tax purposes, this summary should be read in conjunction with the provisions of any
   applicable double tax agreement between South Africa and their country of residence.
   Naspers has not attempted to qualify the Unbundling as a tax-free transaction to
   Naspers shareholders in terms of the rule of any jurisdiction other than South Africa.
   Accordingly, the Unbundling of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares may constitute
   a taxable transaction in any such jurisdiction. Non-resident Naspers shareholders
   are advised to consult their professional advisers regarding the tax treatment of
   the Unbundling in light of the tax laws in their respective jurisdictions and double
   taxation agreements concluded between South Africa and their countries of tax
   residence. The summary is intended as a general guide only and is not comprehensive
   or determinative and should not be regarded as tax advice. Accordingly, if you are in
   any doubt about your tax position you should consult an appropriate independent
   professional adviser.
 
   The Unbundling will constitute a disposal by Naspers of all of the Unbundled
   MultiChoice Shares to the Naspers shareholders. It is the intention that the disposal
   will be effected utilising the tax concessions provided for in section 46 of the
   Income Tax Act. The concessions provided for in section 46 of the Income Tax Act are
   outlined below:

   Disposal of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares by Naspers
   The distribution of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares by Naspers, in terms of the
   Unbundling, will be disregarded by Naspers in determining its taxable income or
   assessed loss in the tax year that the Unbundling takes place. On the basis that
   Naspers holds the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares as capital assets, the Unbundling
   should not attract capital gains tax as levied in terms of the Eighth Schedule of the
   Income Tax Act (""CGT"").

   Dividends tax and returns of capital
   In terms of sections 46(5) and 46(5A) of the Income Tax Act, the distribution of the
   Unbundled MultiChoice Shares must be disregarded in determining any liability for
   dividends tax and must also not be treated as a return of capital for the purposes of
   paragraph 76B of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

   Naspers Shares held as trading stock
   Any Naspers shareholder holding Naspers Shares as trading stock will be deemed
   to acquire the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares as trading stock. The combined
   expenditure (for the purposes of income tax) of such Naspers Shares and
   Unbundled MultiChoice Shares will be the amount originally taken into account
   by the Naspers shareholder prior to the Unbundling in respect of those Naspers
   Shares, as contemplated in section 11(a), section 22(1), or section 22(2) of the
   Income Tax Act.

   The original expenditure incurred in respect of the ""N"" ordinary shares will be
   apportioned between the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and the ""N"" ordinary
   shares by applying the ratio that the market value of Unbundled MultiChoice
   Shares bears to the sum of the market value of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares
   and the ""N"" ordinary shares at the end of the day after the LDT Date, being
   determined with reference to Naspers and MultiChoice closing share prices on the
   first business day after the LDT Date. Naspers will advise Naspers holders of ""N""
   ordinary shares of the specified ratio by way of an announcement to be released
   on SENS on the second business day after the LDT Date. This ratio must be used
   in the determination of any profits or losses derived on any future disposals of the
   Unbundled MultiChoice Shares or Naspers Shares.
   
   The expenditure so allocated to the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares will reduce the
   expenditure of the Naspers Shares held, thus allocating the expenditure between
   the Naspers Shares and the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares.

   Naspers Shares held as capital assets
   Any Naspers shareholder holding Naspers Shares as capital assets will be deemed
   to acquire the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares as capital assets. The original
   expenditure incurred prior to the Unbundling in respect of the Naspers Shares, that
   is allowable in terms of paragraph 20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act,
   and (where applicable) the CGT valuation of the Naspers Shares, as contemplated
   in paragraph 29 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, will be apportioned
   between the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and the Naspers Shares by applying
   the ratio that the market value of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares bears to the sum
   of the market values of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and Naspers Shares in
   relation to the ""N"" ordinary shares at the end of the day after the LDT Date, being
   determined with reference to Naspers and MultiChoice closing share prices on the
   first business day after the LDT Date.
   
   Naspers will advise Naspers holders of ""N"" ordinary shares of the specified ratio
   by way of an announcement to be released on SENS on the second business day
   after the LDT Date. This ratio must be used in the determination of the capital gain
   or loss derived on any future disposals of the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares or
   Naspers Shares.
   
   The expenditure (and CGT valuation, where applicable) so allocated to the
   Unbundled MultiChoice Shares will reduce the expenditure (and CGT valuation,
   where applicable) of the Naspers Shares held, thus allocating this cost history
   between the Naspers Shares and the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares.
   
   Naspers shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the Unbundled MultiChoice
   Shares on the date on which the Naspers Shares were originally acquired.

10. OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERS
    The following summary describes the restrictions applicable to Naspers shareholders
    in terms of the Unbundling who have registered addresses outside South Africa
    and/or who are nationals, citizens or residents of countries other than South Africa
    (""Overseas Shareholders"") or who are persons (including, without limitation,
    custodians, nominees and trustees) who have a contractual or legal obligation to
    forward this announcement to a jurisdiction outside South Africa, or who hold Naspers
    Shares for the account or benefit of any such Overseas Shareholder and will therefore
    hold MultiChoice Shares in a similar manner and hence may have an impact on
    shareholders.
    
    The Unbundling will be implemented as a pro rata distribution in specie for no
    consideration to all Naspers shareholders recorded as such in the register of
    Naspers on the Unbundling Record Date and Time.
   
    The distribution of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares to Overseas Shareholders
    in terms of the Unbundling may be affected by the laws of such Overseas
    Shareholders' relevant jurisdiction. Overseas Shareholders should consult their
    professional advisers as to whether they require any governmental or other consent
    or need to observe any other laws, requirements or formalities to receive or access
    this announcement and/or enable them to take up their entitlements and/or have
    Unbundled MultiChoice Shares transferred to them in terms of the Unbundling.
  
    It is the responsibility of any Overseas Shareholder (including, without limitation,
    nominees, agents and trustees for such persons) being notified by this
    announcement of the Unbundling and wishing to take up their entitlement to
    Unbundled MultiChoice Shares and/or have Unbundled MultiChoice Shares
    transferred to them in terms of the Unbundling to satisfy themselves as to the
    full observance of the applicable laws of any relevant territory, including obtaining
    any requisite governmental or other consents, observing any other requisite laws,
    requirements or formalities and paying any issue, transfer or other taxes due in
    such territories.
   
    Accordingly, persons (including, without limitation, nominees, agents and trustees)
    being notified in terms of this SENS announcement should not distribute or send
    the same to any person in, or citizen or resident of, or otherwise into any jurisdiction
    where to do so would or might contravene applicable law or regulation including
    local securities laws or regulations. Any person who does distribute this SENS
    announcement into any such territory (whether under a contractual or legal
    obligation or otherwise) should draw the recipient's attention to the contents of
    this paragraph.
  
    Naspers reserves the right, but shall not be obliged, to treat as invalid any
    distribution or transfer of Unbundled MultiChoice Shares in terms of the
    Unbundling, which appears to Naspers or its agents to have been executed, effected
    or dispatched in a manner which may involve a breach of the securities laws or
    regulations of any jurisdiction; or if Naspers believes (in its discretion) or its agents
    believe that the same may violate applicable legal or regulatory requirements;
    or if Naspers believes (in its discretion) that it is prohibited or unduly onerous or
    impractical to distribute or transfer the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares to such
    Overseas Shareholder in terms of the Unbundling.
   
    If an Overseas Shareholder is of the view that the distribution or transfer of
    Unbundled MultiChoice Shares in terms of the Unbundling to such Overseas
    Shareholder may involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations or violate
    applicable legal or regulatory requirements; such Overseas Shareholder must as
    soon as reasonably practicable notify Naspers of such fact or circumstance.
    Naspers shall be entitled (in its discretion), including in either of the aforementioned
    instances, to do all things necessary or desirable to ensure compliance with
    applicable law and/or regulation including selling Unbundled MultiChoice Shares
    that would otherwise have been transferred to the Overseas Shareholder under the
    Unbundling on their behalf and at their risk, with the net proceeds of such sale (after
    deduction of any applicable taxes, withholdings or costs) to be paid to the Overseas
    Shareholder. In this regard, the Unbundled MultiChoice Shares may be aggregated
    and disposed of on the JSE in an orderly manner by the Transfer Secretaries on
    behalf of and for the benefit of such Overseas Shareholders as soon as is reasonably
    practical after the implementation of the Unbundling at the best price that can
    reasonably be obtained at the time of sale.

11. ADS FACILITY
    Naspers has an ADS programme managed by Bank of New York Mellon as
    depository. MultiChoice expects to establish an ADS facility in the United States
    of America. Bank of New York Mellon, as depositary for the MultiChoice ADS
    facility, will deliver the MultiChoice ADSs. Each MultiChoice ADS will represent
    an ownership interest in MultiChoice Shares and a pro rata share of any other
    securities, cash or other property that may be held by the depositary, under the
    terms of the deposit agreement to be entered into between MultiChoice, the
    depositary and the registered holders, indirect holders and beneficial owners of the
    MultiChoice ADSs from time to time.

    Following implementation of the Unbundling, holders of the Naspers ADSs at
    the Unbundling Record Date and Time will be issued on the Operative Date with
    MultiChoice ADSs in respect of their entitlement to Unbundled MultiChoice Shares
    in terms of the Unbundling.

    On the Unbundling Operative Date, the MultiChoice Shares will not be listed on
    any securities exchange in the United States of America, and MultiChoice expects
    to rely on an exemption from registration under the US Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 (as amended) provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder.

    MultiChoice will not treat MultiChoice ADS holders as its shareholders and,
    accordingly, MultiChoice ADS holders will not have shareholders' rights, which are
    governed by South African law. The ADS holders' rights will be governed by the
    deposit agreement, which will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The
    deposit agreement will also set out the rights and obligations of the depositary.
    
    The depositary or its nominee will be the record holder of the MultiChoice Shares
    underlying the ADSs and, therefore, ADS holders must rely on the depositary to
    exercise shareholder rights on their behalf. ADS holders may exercise their voting
    rights with respect to the MultiChoice Shares underlying the ADSs in accordance
    with the provisions of the deposit agreement. The depositary will not itself exercise
    any voting discretion in respect of the MultiChoice Shares. Upon receipt of
    instructions from an ADS holder pursuant to the deposit agreement, if MultiChoice
    asked the depositary to solicit voting instructions, the depositary is required to
    endeavour (insofar as practicable and permitted under MultiChoice's memorandum
    of incorporation) to vote or cause to be voted the MultiChoice Shares represented
    by the ADSs in accordance with such instructions. If MultiChoice did not request
    the depository to solicit voting instructions, ADS holders can still give voting
    instructions and the depository may, but is not required to, endeavour to carry out
    those instructions.

    ADS holders will be required to pay fees under the terms of the deposit agreement,
    including fees for cancellation of ADSs and upon dividends and distributions. The
    depositary has agreed to reimburse MultiChoice for certain reasonably incurred
    expenses directly related to the ADS facility.
  
    ADS holders should read the entire deposit agreement and the form of the
    depositary receipt. A copy of the deposit agreement will be filed as an exhibit to the
    registration statement on Form F-6 to be filed by or on behalf of MultiChoice with
    the US Securities Exchange Commission. ADS holders may find the registration
    statement and the deposit agreement on the US Securities Exchange Commission's
    website at http://www.sec.gov.
  
    For further information on the ADS Facility, please refer to the Pre-listing Statement.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM REPORT 
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018

COMMENTARY
Naspers executed well in the first half of the 2019 financial year, generating group revenue, measured on an
economic-interest basis of US$11.0bn. Driven by ecommerce and Tencent, this represents growth of 23% (or 29% in local 
currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). On a similar basis, group trading profit of US$2.0bn reflects 
growth of 22% (or 34% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). Profitability in ecommerce 
improved on the back of strong contributions from the classifieds and business-to-consumer (B2C) units. Tencent's 
contribution further boosted trading profit growth. Core headline earnings, the board's measure of operating 
performance, was up a healthy 39% at US$1.7bn. 

Ecommerce reduced trading losses materially. The classifieds business (excluding letgo), which turned profitable in
the 2018 financial year, continued to show strong profit growth and is now profitable, including letgo. Trading-loss
margins in etail (online retail) and payments narrowed considerably as the businesses accelerated revenue growth and
continued to scale.

Acquisitions in the period totalled over US$700m as we continued to invest in existing and new businesses in
classifieds, payments and food-delivery verticals, as well as progressing our growth strategy through Naspers Ventures. 
The acquisition spend includes: solidifying our presence in online food-delivery services with an additional investment 
in Swiggy of US$79m; further expanding our global merchant capabilities in PayU through a US$60m investment in Zooz; 
additional investments totalling US$379m in letgo and Dubizzle to acquire minority interests, thereby increasing our 
stakes; and an investment of US$89m in Frontier Car Group to support classifieds' focus on the opportunities created 
by convenient transaction models. 

Following a US$2.2bn offer from US-based Walmart, we sold our 12% interest in Indian ecommerce company Flipkart in
August 2018, realising an internal annual rate of return of approximately 29%.

In September 2018 we reached an important milestone in our evolution into a global consumer internet company by
announcing our intention to separately list our video-entertainment business on the JSE Limited (JSE) and simultaneously
distribute our shares in this business (to be called MultiChoice Group) to our shareholders. We believe this will 
unlock value for our shareholders and, at the same time, create an empowered, top 40 JSE-listed African entertainment 
company, comprising MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, Showmax Africa and Irdeto. We believe the transaction 
will create further value for Phuthuma Nathi shareholders, who have participated in one of the most successful 
empowerment schemes in South Africa. On unbundling, Naspers will transfer 5% of its stake in MultiChoice South Africa 
to Phuthuma Nathi shareholders, for no consideration, to increase MultiChoice South Africa's broad-based black economic 
empowerment (BBBEE) participation. This significant step reinforces Naspers's transformation credentials.

Our earnings are significantly affected by foreign exchange volatility as our operations span over 120 countries and
markets globally. This volatility has the most pronounced impact in the video-entertainment business where revenues are
generated in local currencies while costs are predominantly US dollar-denominated. In the internet businesses, revenues
and costs are typically in the same currency, which softens this impact. Where relevant in this report, numbers have been
adjusted for the effects of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals to reflect underlying trends. These
adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets, after the equivalent metrics reported under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A reconciliation of pro forma financial information to the equivalent 
IFRS metrics is provided in note 16 of this condensed consolidated interim report.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Excluding equity-accounted investments (associates and joint ventures), consolidated revenue grew 8% (14%) to
US$3.3bn. Ecommerce was the main driver of growth, with revenues increasing 32% (29%). However, this performance was 
slowed by the contribution from video entertainment. The disposal of Novus in the media segment during the previous 
financial year also negatively impacted consolidated revenue growth. Consolidated trading profit improved considerably 
by 83% to US$128m as the ecommerce businesses continued to scale and improve profitability.

Consolidated development spend (representing the trading losses of businesses not yet at scale) was down 30% (27%), as
many of our developing ecommerce businesses continued to scale and move towards profitability. Development spend on
more mature investments was down 12%, however, we continue to invest to accelerate growth and develop incremental revenue
opportunities over the long term. We invested US$78m in our consolidated newer initiatives, including letgo.

Equity-accounted investments contributed US$2.1bn to group earnings, an increase of 45%. This includes investment
disposal gains of US$152m, impairment losses of US$771m and fair-value adjustments on financial instruments of US$1.4bn 
that have been recognised by these investees. In aggregate, equity-accounted investments contributed US$1.7bn to core
headline earnings - up 20%. 

Notably, following the disposal of our interest in Flipkart (outlined above), a once-off gain of US$1.6bn was
recorded. 

We recognised impairment losses of US$103m relating to an equity-accounted investment focused on the provision of
consumer lending and financial services. We impaired our investment (including convertible debt funding extended) as
performance and the opportunity to leverage the investment in some of our core markets fell below our expectations.

We had a strong net cash position of US$8.7bn (including short-term cash investments and net of interest-bearing debt,
excluding capitalised finance leases), primarily attributable to the proceeds retained from the Flipkart disposal and
sale of Tencent shares in the 2018 financial year. This resulted in net interest income of US$48m.

At 30 September 2018 put option liabilities were US$1.8bn. An aggregate remeasurement gain of US$239m was recognised
in the income statement on these liabilities in the period.

Consolidated free cash flow was US$271m, a marked improvement on last year. This reflects improved profitability in
the ecommerce businesses, dividend income of US$332m from Tencent and positive working capital effects in video
entertainment.

We adopted several new accounting standards in the period, including the new revenue recognition and financial
instrument guidance, and comparative information has been restated accordingly, where applicable. Refer to note 2 
for further details.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this condensed consolidated
interim report.

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which includes consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
Revenues in the internet segment, which now contributes 82% of total group revenue compared to 77% a year ago, were up
31% (36%) to US$9.0bn, while trading profits rose 30% (39%) as ecommerce and Tencent continued to stimulate growth.

Ecommerce
Ecommerce revenue increased 28% (29%) to US$2.0bn with meaningful contributions from classifieds, payments, food
delivery and B2C. 

Trading losses narrowed by a significant 34% (46%) to US$209m due to a noteworthy profit contribution from classifieds
and reduced trading losses at the payments, etail and travel units. Consequently, the trading-loss margin halved from
21% last year to 11% this year, continuing the trajectory of the prior financial year.

Revenues generated by our profitable ecommerce businesses totalled US$902m, with trading profits of US$223m. Compared
to US$465m and US$170m last year, this reflects growth of 94% (29%) and 31% (48%) respectively. eMAG Romania, which 
became profitable in the second half of the 2018 financial year, was a major driver of the revenue improvement.

Classifieds
Classifieds continued its strong growth trajectory, generating revenue of US$405m - up 40% (37%) - driven by Avito,
Brazil and the European markets (particularly Poland and the Ukraine). Trading profit (excluding letgo) grew by more 
than 100% (in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) to US$95m. Including letgo, classifieds 
was profitable in the first half of the year, although anticipated marketing spend may impact second-half results.

Avito's revenue increased 18% (31%) to US$162m, driven by enhanced product features and good traction in the cars
segment. 

In Brazil, OLX grew revenues 29% (54%) and expanded profit margins, benefiting from its market position in car
verticals. 

letgo began monetising, benefiting from continued growth in its user base, particularly the increase in retained users
due to product enhancements. 

To access greater opportunities in new and existing markets, the classifieds business broadened its presence in car
and real estate verticals through acquisitions. This addresses a sizeable consumer need. Given our focus on convenient
transaction models to deepen market presence and enhance the consumer experience, we acquired a minority stake in Frontier
Car Group and, after the reporting period, a controlling stake in WeBuyCars, which is subject to regulatory approval.

Etail
Etail revenues, measured in local currency and adjusted for the disposals of Souq last year and Flipkart in August
2018, grew 19%. On the same basis, trading losses reduced 22% as the business continued to scale and gain market share. 
We include seven months of results for Flipkart in our segmental results for the review period, representing our share 
of its earnings for the period up to disposal as well as a catch-up of the lag period applied in reporting Flipkart's
results. Going forward, overall etail revenues are expected to reduce, with trading losses narrowing, following the 
disposal of Flipkart.

eMAG, the leading B2C platform in Central and Eastern Europe, delivered a solid performance with revenue up 18% (18%).
In its home market of Romania, eMAG recorded gross merchandise value (GMV) growth of 31% with both the retail and
marketplace businesses contributing meaningfully to the result. eMAG improved profitability 52% (55%) year on year, 
boosted by increased gross profit margins and cost control.

Takealot, South Africa's number one B2C platform, extended its market leadership and grew GMV 58%. Its electronics,
home and kitchen categories recorded the highest growth, while its food-delivery service, Mr D Food, increased market
share and grew GMV by almost 200%. Takealot also announced the merger of its online fashion brand, Superbalist, with 
Spree, the online fashion brand owned by Media24. 

Travel
MakeMyTrip, the leading online travel agency in India, generated solid revenue growth across different verticals:
hotels and packages room nights increased 16% and standalone room nights were up 18%. Air travel transactions increased 
28%. Over the period, the business moved closer to sustainable growth by improving the unit economics of its hotels
business, reducing trading losses (measured in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) by 44% year 
on year. The group's share of MakeMyTrip's revenue, measured in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and 
disposals, was up a healthy 22%. More information on MakeMyTrip's results is available at http://investors.makemytrip.com.

Payments
PayU, our payments business, recorded strong growth in its core (payment service provider) business. A 35% increase in
the number of transactions processed, to over 400m, generated total payment transaction value exceeding US$14bn - with
India accounting for more than half. The business delivered revenue growth of 36% (33%) to US$171m. We merged the
Europe, Middle East and Asia (EMEA) and Latin American businesses, realising significant efficiencies and cost 
reductions. Revenue scaling, coupled with cost compression, enabled us to substantially improve profitability in 
the segment.

In India, we continue to build a broader credit platform, which is supporting encouraging progress across all our
initiatives: LazyPay gained significant traction, reaching over 450 000 consumers and issuing more than US$4m in 
loans per month. Our Indian credit-portfolio companies also continued to perform ahead of plan, with our minority 
investments PaySense and ZestMoney each issuing over US$7m in loans per month, a significant acceleration year 
on year.

The global merchant business grew 65% (85%) and, to accelerate it further, PayU acquired Zooz, an Israeli payments
technology company, in July 2018. This enables PayU to leverage the platform to serve its global merchants better. 

Food delivery
Online food-delivery services continued to grow strongly, recording cumulative annualised GMV growth of 51% year on
year. Strong contributions from all businesses (Delivery Hero, iFood and Swiggy) tripled revenue growth to US$181m.
Further investment in scaling these operations expanded trading losses to US$41m.

Delivery Hero reported strong revenue growth of 48% to EUR357m and order volume growth of 46% to 184m in its half-year
ended June 2018. More information on Delivery Hero's results is available at https://ir.deliveryhero.com.

In India, Swiggy continues to record robust growth. The company doubled its footprint over the past six months and now
operates across 34 cities in India and has over 40 000 restaurant partners on its platform. In July 2018 we invested 
an additional US$79m in Swiggy, bringing our effective interest to 25% (23% fully diluted) at 30 September 2018.

In Latin America, we invested US$124m in Movile to further expand and scale iFood, which continues to execute well and
deliver solid growth rates.

Tencent
Tencent grew total group revenue 39% year on year to RMB147.2bn for its six months to 30 June 2018. Key drivers were
payment-related services, digital-content subscriptions and sales, social advertising and smartphone games. Non-GAAP
profit attributable to shareholders (Tencent's measure of normalised performance) grew 23% to RMB47.5bn.

Revenues from value-added services increased 24% to RMB88.9bn, mainly driven by digital-content services such as video
streaming, live broadcast, music and in-game virtual item sales. Revenues from online advertising increased 46% to
RMB24.8bn as Tencent expanded its advertiser base and increased prices in Weixin Moments, QQ KanDian and other mobile
platforms. Other revenues were up a solid 95% at RMB33.5bn, reflecting continued strong growth in payment-related and 
cloud services. Overall, margins declined as the business mix evolved and as the significant investment in research and
development, cloud and other new services continued.

Swift growth of Mini Programs and Weixin Pay supported a 9.9% increase in Weixin's monthly active users to 1.1bn. User
activity in Weixin Mini Games and Moments continued to increase, driving up time spent per user. Daily active users of
Tencent's smartphone games grew by double digits year on year, but monetisation per user and online games revenues
declined in the second quarter of 2018 as users shifted time to certain tactical tournament games for which regulatory
approvals for in-game virtual item sales were still pending. Tencent recently implemented stringent self-imposed 
limitations on game-playing by minors and has introduced measures to enforce such policy.

Tencent continued to expand the user base of payment-related services, with monthly active users exceeding 800m at the
end of June 2018. Average daily transaction volume rose by over 40% year on year.

More information on Tencent's results is available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru grew total group revenue 29% year on year to RUB33.6bn. Advertising revenue was up 39% at RUB13.9bn, driven by
further user growth and engagement on Mail.ru's platform and the market's structural shift from traditional to online
advertising. Massively multiplayer online game revenue increased 33% to RUB10.4bn, driven by ongoing success in both
established and new titles. Warface and War Robots continued to perform well and Hustle Castle recorded significant 
growth. Internet value-added service revenue increased 1% to RUB7.1bn. EBITDA declined 17% to RUB7.7bn, mainly due to
consolidating new acquisitions in the online-to-offline space, which were still loss-making.

VKontakte launched VK Pay, offering users the ability to conveniently accept payment for goods and services. Mail.ru
created Russia's largest licensed digital music ecosystem with a subscriber base of 1.5m across three platforms:
VKontakte, Odnoklassniki and BOOM. 

In September 2018, Mail.ru announced that it will contribute its Pandao ecommerce business and cash in exchange for a
15% stake in AliExpress Russia. More information on Mail.ru's results is available at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Video entertainment
The video-entertainment segment had a steady six months, growing subscriber numbers by a sizeable 400 000 households
to 13.9m households. Revenue increased 3% (7%) to US$1.8bn and trading profit remained relatively flat (up 6%) at
US$211m.  The value strategy, aimed at growing the subscriber base and reducing costs, delivered a further US$15m in 
cost savings. The Fifa World Cup provided a significant opportunity to drive growth on the back of significant 
investment in content and subscriber acquisition (mainly through set-top box subsidies). This investment in the 
review period skews the year-on-year comparison and masks the improvement in operating performance, particularly in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Customers added by this promotion will contribute to second-half revenues and profitability, 
driving year-on-year improvements. 

The South African video-entertainment business delivered solid trading profits and generated meaningful cash flows.
Subscriber growth was strong in the middle- and mass-market segments, with some churn in premium subscribers as a 
number of households in this segment appear to be experiencing strains on their disposable income. The ongoing change 
in subscriber mix resulted in average revenue per user reducing from US$27 last year to US$25 this year.

In sub-Saharan Africa, subscriber growth accelerated and the business generated 9% (16%) growth in revenues to
US$524m. Trading losses were stable, with a decline in losses measured in local currency. This improvement would have 
been stronger but for the Fifa World Cup promotional drive discussed above. Results were affected by the 42% devaluation 
of the Angolan kwanza since January 2018. Despite ongoing economic and currency volatility, efforts to return these 
operations to profitability are gaining traction. 

We made significant progress with remittances from Angola over the period that has allowed us to reduce cash balances
and trade receivables impacted by illiquidity. Over the period, we were able to reduce the total balance of cash and
trade receivables affected by illiquidity from US$131m at 31 March 2018 to US$51m at 30 September 2018. However, the
limited availability of foreign currency in the Angolan and Zimbabwean economies continues to affect liquidity.

Media
Media24's revenue was down 7% (4%) due to pressure on advertising and circulation revenue (all figures exclude Novus,
which was distributed to shareholders last year). Revenue in Media24's ecommerce businesses increased 15% (19%) on
higher efulfilment volumes and satisfactory growth from Spree, ahead of the merger with Superbalist. The trading result 
for the segment was flat year on year due to lower printing costs, cost-containment initiatives across the business, and
progress with migrating audiences from print to digital platforms.

PROSPECTS
Over the remainder of the financial year, we will maintain our focus on driving profitability in the ecommerce units.
Our strong balance sheet provides a basis for driving growth across the portfolio and unlocking new opportunities that
fit our criteria. Containing costs and weathering challenging macro conditions will remain a priority for our more 
mature assets.

    expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses and

    Core headline earnings exclude once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's
    operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled

    revenue recognition guidance        IFRS 15 on the period ended 30 September 2017 was a reduction
    applied by the group as             in consolidated revenue of US$2m (31 March 2018: reduction of              
    contained in IAS 18 Revenue.        US$3m). IFRS 15 had no impact on the group's profit for the             
                                        period ended 30 September 2017 (31 March 2018: increase of

    tax exposures. Our current assessment of possible withholding and other tax exposures, including interest and 
    potential penalties, amounts to approximately US$194.3m (2017: US$155.5m and 31 March 2018: US$226.1m).

12. Business combinations, other acquisitions and disposals
    In August 2018 the group invested US$60m for a 100% effective interest in the issued share capital of Zooz 
    Mobile Limited (Zooz), a management and optimisation payment provider based in Israel. The transaction was 
    accounted for as a business combination with an effective date of August 2018. The provisional purchase price 
    allocation: cash and deposits US$2m; trade and other receivables US$3m; intangible assets US$2m; trade and 
    other payables US$2m; loan liabilities US$3m; and the balance of US$58m to goodwill. The main intangible 
    asset recognised in the business combination was technology.

    The revenue and net results of Zooz, had the acquisition taken place on 1 April 2018, were not significant 
    to the group's income statement.

    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is Zooz's market presence and 
    engineering capabilities. The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

    In April 2018 the group acquired the share capital held by non-controlling shareholders of its subsidiary
    Dubizzle Limited (Dubizzle) for US$190m. Following the acquisition, the group holds a 100% effective

    round in June 2018, the group's shareholding in Ambatana increased from an effective 73.4% at 31 March 2018

    International Holdings, Inc. (Walmart) for US$2.2bn. The transaction was concluded in August 2018 following 
    regulatory approval. A gain on disposal of US$1.6bn has been recognised as part of ""Gains/(losses) on 
    acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement. This gain includes the reclassification of a foreign 
    currency translation reserve of US$97m to the income statement. Related income tax expenses of US$177m have

    In September 2018 the group concluded the sale of its 52% interest in Tek Travels Private Limited (Travel

13. Financial instruments

    There have been no transfers between levels 1 or 2 during the reporting period, nor were there any significant 
    changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value.

    Currency devaluation features relate to clauses in content-acquisition agreements that provide the group with 
    protection against significant currency devaluations. The fair value of currency devaluation features is 
    measured through the use of discounted cash flow techniques.

    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance criteria 
    will be met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified earn-out 
    payments are used.

    Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments.

    The fair value of level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in active 
    markets and interest rate extracts from observable yield curves.

    The group discloses the fair values of the following financial instruments as their carrying values are not 
    a reasonable approximation of their fair values:

14. Related party transactions and balances
    The group entered into various related party transactions in the ordinary course of business. There have 
    been no significant changes in related party transactions and balances since the previous reporting period.

15. Events after the reporting period
    In September 2018 the group signed an agreement to invest R1.4bn (approximately US$99m) for a controlling 
    interest in We Buy Cars Proprietary Limited (WeBuyCars), a South African online used-car marketplace 
    offering a specialised car-buying service to sellers. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.

16. Pro forma financial information
    The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics in local currency, excluding the effects 
    of changes in the composition of the group (the pro forma financial information) in the following tables. 
    The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers 
    and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been extracted 
    from the group's management accounts, the quality of which the board is satisfied with.

    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that 
    it has been extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial 
    position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange 
    rates and changes in the composition of the group on its results for the period ended 30 September 2018. The 
    following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:
    1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results 
       to the prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates 
       for that period. The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency 
       results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above, compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results. 
       The relevant average exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) used for the group's most significant 
       functional currencies, were: South African rand (2018: 0.0741; 2017: 0.0757), Polish zloty (2018: 0.2728; 
       2017: 0.2714), Russian rouble (2018: 0.0156; 2017: 0.0172), Chinese yuan renminbi (2018: 0.1505; 2017: 0.1483), 
       Indian rupee (2018: 0.0145; 2017: 0.0155), Brazilian real (2018: 0.2612; 2017: 0.3134), Angolan kwanza 
       (2018: 0.0039; 2017: 0.0006) and Nigerian naira (2018: 0.0028; 2017: 0.0028).    
    2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of 
       subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its 
       equity-accounted investments. For mergers, the group composition adjustments include a portion of the 
       prior-year results of the entity with which the merger took place. The following significant changes in 
       the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods have been adjusted for in arriving 
       at the pro forma financial information.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT
on interim financial statements

To the shareholders of Naspers Limited
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited in the accompanying
interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2018 
and the related condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows for the six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes 1 to 15. 

Directors' responsibility for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA 
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued 
by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for 
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review 
in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in 
all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also 
requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements. 

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. 
We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, 
as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained. 

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit 
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion on these interim financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited for the six months ended 30 September 2018 are not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 
Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the 
Companies Act of South Africa.

Other matter
We have not reviewed future financial performance and expectations expressed by the directors included in the
commentary in the accompanying interim financial statements and accordingly do not express an opinion thereon.

Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (""the group"") is finalising its condensed consolidated interim report for the six
months ended 30 September 2018.

Compared to the group’s published results for the six months ended 30 September 2017, it expects core headline earnings per
share for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to be between 7% (25 US cents) and 13% (45 US cents) higher than the prior
period’s reported 350 US cents. However, as outlined in the group’s trading statement and financial results for the year ended
31 March 2018, the group has amended its calculation of core headline earnings and has restated the comparative period’s core
headline earnings per share to 277 US cents. Accordingly, we expect core headline earnings per share for the six months ended
30 September 2018 to be between 35% (98 US cents) and 43% (118 US cents) higher than the adjusted comparable period’s
277 US cents. Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the
operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to the group’s published results for the six months ended 30 September 2017, it expects earnings per share for the six
months ended 30 September 2018 to be between 209% (530 US cents) and 216% (548 US cents) higher than the prior period’s
reported 254 US cents. However, as outlined in the group’s trading statement and financial results for the year ended 31 March
2018, the group has restated the comparative earnings per share figure to 253 US cents as a result of its change in accounting
policy regarding written put option liabilities. Accordingly, it is expected that earnings per share for the six months ended 30
September 2018 will be between 210% (531 US cents) and 217% (549 US cents) higher than the adjusted comparable period’s
253 US cents.

Compared to the group’s published results for the six months ended 30 September 2017, it expects headline earnings per share
for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to be between 199% (421 US cents) and 206% (436 US cents) higher than the prior
period’s reported 212 US cents. However, as outlined in the group’s trading statement and financial results for the year ended 31
March 2018, the group has restated the comparative headline earnings per share figure to 211 US cents as a result of its change
in accounting policy regarding written put option liabilities. Accordingly, headline earnings per share for the six months ended 30
September 2018 is expected to increase by between 200% (422 US cents) and 207% (437 US cents) from the adjusted prior
period’s 211 US cents.

Earnings per share was impacted significantly by the once-off gain recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in Flipkart
Limited. Headline earnings and earnings per share increased considerably as a result of the group’s share of fair-value gains
recognised by Tencent on certain of its investments. Possible future gains on disposal and fair-value adjustments on investments
are by nature unpredictable.

Further details will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim report, due for release on 30 November 2018. Financial
information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s auditor.

LISTING AND UNBUNDLING OF VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS AS MULTICHOICE GROUP ON THE JSE

Naspers today announced its intention to list its Video Entertainment business separately on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and simultaneously to unbundle the shares in this business to its
shareholders. The new company will be named MultiChoice Group Ltd (""MultiChoice Group"") and will
include MultiChoice South Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd (and its subsidiaries, associates and/or affiliates),
MultiChoice Africa Holdings B.V. (and its subsidiaries, associates and/or affiliates), MultiChoice Botswana
(Pty) Ltd, MultiChoice Namibia (Pty) Ltd, NMS Insurance Services SA Ltd, (the aforesaid entities collectively
""MultiChoice""), the African division of Showmax B.V. (and its subsidiaries, associates and/or affiliates),
Irdeto Holdings B.V. (and its subsidiaries, associates and/or affiliates) and Irdeto South Africa (Pty) Ltd
(collectively ""Irdeto"").

This marks a significant step for the Naspers Group as it continues its evolution into a global consumer
internet company. Listing MultiChoice Group via an unbundling is expected to unlock value for Naspers
shareholders and at the same time create an empowered, top 40 JSE-listed African entertainment
company.


MultiChoice Group will remain committed to broad, socio-economic transformation in South Africa, most
notably through its Phuthuma Nathi Investments (RF) Limited and Phuthuma Nathi Investments 2 (RF)
Limited (collectively, “PN”) share schemes. The PN schemes are among the most successful broad-based
black economic empowerment (BBBEE) schemes in South Africa and have already created around ZAR12
billion in value for BBBEE shareholders.


In addition to the value created to date, the Naspers board believes that the unbundling transaction will
create further value for PN shareholders. This is due to Naspers’ intention to allocate – for no
consideration – an additional 5% stake in MultiChoice South Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd (“MCSA”) to PN
shareholders prior to the unbundling to increase MultiChoice Group’s BBBEE shareholding. This means
that the PN shareholders’ interest in MCSA and its dividend flows is expected to increase by 25%. The
additional 5% stake in MCSA is designed to reinforce MultiChoice Group’s commitment to black economic
empowerment, increase PN’s upside in future value creation and ensure the continued compliance with
regulatory requirements post unbundling. Further, post-listing and subject to obtaining the necessary PN
board and shareholder approvals, it is the ambition of MultiChoice Group to enable 25% of the PN
shareholders’ original shareholding (i.e. before the allocation of the additional 5%) to be exchanged for
MultiChoice Group shares that will be freely tradeable, thereby unlocking incremental value for PN
shareholders.
The listing and unbundling are intended to create a leading entertainment business listed on the JSE that
is profitable and highly cash generative – today, it is one of the fastest growing pay-TV operators globally
and its multi-platform business entertains 13.5 million households across Africa. In the last financial year,
the business added 1.5 million subscribers, and generated revenue of ZAR47.1 billion and trading profit
of ZAR6.1 billion. It employs more than 9,000 people in Africa and indirectly creates economic prosperity
for over 20,000 more who are employed by its various partners and suppliers across the continent.


The strong leadership team is diverse, experienced and well-positioned to take the company forward.
MultiChoice Group will continue to offer an unmatched selection of local and original content, as well as
a world-class sport offering. The business is also positioning itself for the future, and for changes in
technology by offering online streaming services, including Showmax and DStv Now. The combination of
MultiChoice’s reach, Showmax’s cutting-edge internet television service, and Irdeto’s 360 Security suite
will provide a unique offering.


MultiChoice Group is expected to be unbundled with limited leverage, providing it with the necessary
financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities in African video entertainment. Africa is one of the
fastest-growing continents by both GDP and population, its middle-class is rapidly expanding, and the
penetration of video entertainment is still relatively low.


The Naspers board expects that the listing and unbundling will deliver value to the South African economy
and Naspers and PN shareholders. Naspers will continue to invest in South Africa through its interests in
ecommerce businesses such as Takealot, Mr D Food, PayU, OLX, Property24, and AutoTrader SA, among
others. In South Africa, over the past three years, Naspers has invested a total of ZAR6.9 billion in M&A
activity and in developing its existing businesses. In the past financial year alone, ZAR3.3 billion was
allocated to its internet businesses. Naspers will also retain its primary listing on the JSE as well as its
interests in Media24.


MultiChoice Group is anticipated to list on the JSE in the first half of 2019, subject to the approval of the
requisite regulatory authorities.


To update investors about this transaction, Naspers management will be hosting a conference call today
at 18:00 SAT (16:00 GMT). Investors who would like to participate need to pre-register by visiting
Naspers.MultiChoice Announcement ahead of the call. A replay will be made available and dial-in details
are available on www.naspers.com.

Summary of statements from the annual general meeting:

Our strategy to create long term shareholder value has not changed over time. We pursue growth by building leading
companies that empower people and enrich communities. We identify big societal needs with strong local dynamics that can
transcend borders. We find great local businesses and then help the entrepreneurs accelerate their progress. We try and
invest in the best opportunities early and drive global scale over time. Today, our companies and associates operate in
more than 120 countries, affecting the everyday lives of millions of people. Around a fifth of the world's population 
uses the products and services of companies we've built and invested in, and many of these customers use the products of
more than one of our companies.

Over the past year we accelerated revenue growth, delivering a robust 39% YoY increase to just over US$20bn, with
ecommerce delivering almost US$3.6bn. Group trading profit rose at an even faster pace of 52% to US$3.4bn. Importantly,
ecommerce - particularly our classifieds, payments and travel businesses - improved profitability significantly. Core
headline earnings, the board's measure of operating performance, rose 72% to US$2.5bn.

We believe in the importance of engaging with and being responsive to our stakeholders and we have taken seriously the
matters raised at our last AGM and through various engagements. I want to outline the progress we are making:

At Naspers we relentlessly pursue growth through technology and entrepreneurship. In the technology sector in which we
operate competition is fierce, the pace of change is unprecedented, and the ability to anticipate change determines
success or failure. It is gratifying that Naspers has been so successful in reinventing itself, evolving from a South
African media company to one of the world's leading global tech companies.

Discount
We acknowledge that the discount of Naspers to its underlying assets is a source of frustration for shareholders. 
The discount has multiple drivers and will require multiple solutions, operationally and structurally. 

We are proactively looking at opportunities for further value creation of our underlying busineses and have taken
several steps over the past year to further lock in value. We have bolstered the balance sheet through asset sales 
to fund future growth have taken further steps to remove dilution for our shareholders from our share schemes and 
settling minority put option liabilities with Naspers shares. We remain focused and disciplined in how we allocate 
capital and evaluating existing assets. We have increased transparency, disclosure and engagement with shareholders. 

Remuneration
On remuneration, we aim to be fair and responsible in our approach and align executive pay with shareholder value
creation. We pay to attract and retain the best global tech talent because it is vital for our long-term success - 
these are the people who create great customer experiences that ultimately lead to shareholder returns. We also pay 
for performance and value creation - with bigger rewards for the highest contributions. 

Since our last AGM, we have made a number of changes including:
- Changing the composition of the remuneration committee, strengthening its global orientation and technology
  exposure. 
- Improving our disclosure to show more clearly the connection between business strategy, operational results, pay
  design and pay outcomes. 
- Introducing clawbacks on both short-term and longer-term incentives for the CEO and all his executive direct
  reports, and implementing a shareholding requirement for the CEO. 
- We announced a few months back that we would go to the market to purchase Naspers shares to cover the settlement of
  employee longer-term incentives, so that shareholders would not experience dilution as a result of these programmes.

We note the improvement in voting in respect of the remuneration policy and the majority of the N shareholders voting
in favour of the implementation thereof. We have listened to and have incorporated a number of ideas on remuneration
from our shareholders in the past 12 months which further align our interests. These are steps on a longer journey 
and we will continue to engage with our shareholders on these matters as we acknowledge there is more we can do.

Looking forward
In FY19 we will use our strong balance sheet to accelerate the growth of our classifieds, online food delivery and
payments and fintech businesses globally, and to pursue other growth opportunities when they arise. The focus will be on
innovation, particularly in the area of machine learning, navigating macroeconomic headwinds and managing costs in mature
businesses. This will take our revenues from internet and ecommerce businesses from 80% to 100% in the next few years.

Good governance is essential to our long-term sustainability and we will continue to evaluate where governance can be
improved. We will also take active measures to address the discount.

On behalf of the board I would like to thank everyone helping to grow this exceptional business.

Summarised consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2018

COMMENTARY
Naspers delivered robust growth for the year ended 31 March 2018. Group revenue, measured on an economic-interest
basis, was US$20.1bn, up 38% on last year (or 39% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). This is 
a meaningful growth acceleration of which ecommerce and Tencent were key drivers. On the same basis, group trading profit
rose 47% to US$3.4bn (or 52% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). Ecommerce - particularly the 
classifieds, payments and travel businesses - improved profitability. Tencent's strong performance contributed to the
trading profit acceleration. Core headline earnings, the board's measure of operating performance, was up 72% on last year 
at US$2.5bn. Refer to note 2 of these summarised consolidated financial results for details of the group's change in
calculation of core headline earnings and trading profit during the year.

In the ecommerce business, revenue growth accelerated 36% versus 27% last year, with meaningful reductions in trading
losses (both metrics in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). The classifieds business (excluding
letgo) became profitable during the year. The payments business reduced trading losses on its existing footprint, while
continuing to scale. The group strengthened its position in online food-delivery services by investing a combined US$1.4bn 
in Delivery Hero and Swiggy. The video-entertainment business contributed steady revenue and trading profit growth, with 
trading losses in the sub-Saharan Africa business stabilising despite further currency weakness in Nigeria and Angola.

To reinforce the balance sheet and pursue growth opportunities in, among others, the classifieds, online food-delivery
and fintech (financial technology) businesses, we sold a 2% interest in Tencent in March 2018, generating proceeds of
US$9.8bn. 

We operate in over 120 countries and markets, resulting in significant exposure to foreign-exchange volatility. This
can have a notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in video entertainment where
revenues are earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. Foreign-exchange exposure 
has a more muted impact on the internet businesses as both revenues and costs are generally denominated in local currency.
Where relevant in this report, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency and
acquisitions and disposals to reflect underlying trends. These adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in
brackets, after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A reconciliation 
of pro forma financial information to the equivalent IFRS metrics is provided in note 16 of these summarised consolidated
financial results.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Consolidated revenue (excluding equity-accounted investments) was up 9% (15%) to US$6.7bn as ecommerce continued to
scale. Ecommerce revenues grew 15% or 32% in local currency and adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and disposals
(including Allegro and Netretail). Group consolidated trading loss was US$41m - a marked improvement on last year.

Development spend - reflecting the trading losses of businesses yet to reach scale - continued the downward trend
reported at September 2017. Consolidated development spend was down 17%, when measured in local currency and excluding
acquisitions and disposals, as the ecommerce business improved its profitability and scaled. Development spend decreased
across several units, including Showmax and letgo, partially offset by additional investment to further expand Movile's
iFood business. When the US$271m invested in consolidated newer initiatives (including letgo and Showmax) is excluded,
development spend on older investments decreased 8%.

Our share of the results of equity-accounted investments (associates and joint ventures) was US$3.3bn - up 79%. This
includes once-off gains of US$692m and impairment losses of US$159m recognised by these companies. Equity-accounted
investments contributed a combined US$3.0bn to core headline earnings, an increase of 45%.

Several notable transactions were concluded during the year. We distributed the majority of our interest in Novus in
September 2017, recognising a loss on disposal of US$145m. Following the Tencent share sale (as discussed earlier), we
recorded a gain on disposal of US$9.1bn. The participation exemption in South Africa, which prevents double taxation,
applied to the sale itself, but any future distributions to shareholders and accretion in value from investment will be
taxed in the hands of shareholders at rates of 20% or sometimes more, as applicable.

Naspers and its South African subsidiaries paid and collected a total of US$769m on behalf of the tax authorities for
the 2018 year, making us one of the largest taxpayers in South Africa. We also contribute significantly to employment
and tax revenues in several countries.

Net interest expense on borrowings was US$122m, down 14%, due to lower use of credit facilities and the lower 4.85%
coupon achieved on the US$1.0bn bond issued in July 2017. Following the disposal of Tencent shares, Naspers had net 
cash of US$8.2bn at 31 March 2018.

We changed our accounting policy on put option liabilities during the year (refer to note 2 of these summarised
consolidated financial results). An aggregate remeasurement loss of US$252m was recognised in the income statement 
on these liabilities during the year and, at 31 March 2018, total put option liabilities were US$2.4bn.

Consolidated free cash outflow was US$242m with working capital movements, particularly the video-entertainment
business's prepaid content rights renewals, having a significant impact. These effects were partly offset by dividend 
income of US$247m from Tencent and improved profitability in the video-entertainment and ecommerce units.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in these summarised consolidated
financial results.

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which includes consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
Internet revenues grew 50% (51%) to US$15.9bn and trading profit was up 50% (56%) to US$3.1bn, fuelled by ecommerce
and Tencent's strong results. This segment now contributes 79% of group revenue - up from 73% last year.

Ecommerce
Ecommerce revenue increased 25% (36%) to US$3.6bn. Classifieds,  business-to-consumer (B2C), payments and food delivery 
all contributed meaningfully to the segment's 9% revenue acceleration. Increased scale resulted in trading losses
reducing 8% (24%) to US$673m and a considerable improvement in trading loss margins from 25% last year to 18% this year.

Profitable ecommerce businesses generated revenues of US$1.7bn and trading profits of US$352m (2017: US$699m and
US$229m respectively). In local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, this is growth of 77% and 52%,
respectively, on a like-for-like basis. The trading profit contribution from our profitable ecommerce businesses is 
now similar to that of our entire video-entertainment segment.

Classifieds
Classifieds had a solid year and strengthened its market positions. Revenues grew 47% (35%) to US$628m. Excluding the
investment to scale letgo, the classifieds business turned profitable. OLX Brazil delivered strong revenue growth and
reached break-even. Avito enhanced user engagement and expanded monetisation, growing revenue 28% in local currency
despite a competitive operating environment. The European markets, led by Poland, Ukraine and Romania, accelerated 
revenue growth on the back of expanded product offerings to sellers in key vertical categories and more than doubled 
trading profits. letgo continues to gain traction in the US with a significantly improved user experience and is starting 
to trial monetisation. Annualised monthly unique listers on the letgo platform were up 45%.

Etail
Etail (online retail) showed strong growth with revenues rising some 36% to US$2.1bn, when adjusted for the disposals
of Souq and Konga in the current year and Allegro and Netretail last year.

eMAG continued to outpace market growth across its footprint, with gross merchandise value (GMV) increasing by 38%.

Takealot, South Africa's leading etailer, extended its leadership, growing GMV by 70%, and expanding its reach outside
its core categories through Superbalist, its fashion and homeware business, and Mr D Food, South Africa's leading
food-delivery service.

Flipkart, our equity-accounted etail investment in India, increased market share by growing GMV 49% year on year.
During the year it also secured substantial capital from investors - including Tencent and Softbank. After year-end we
entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Flipkart to Walmart for approximately US$2.2bn, representing an internal
rate of return on our investment of some 32%. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.

During the year, to improve long-term returns, we disposed of our interests in equity-accounted online retailers Souq
in the Middle East and Konga in Nigeria, and finalised the closure of Markafoni in Turkey.

Travel
MakeMyTrip has solidified its position as the leading online travel agency in India and seized cost-saving opportunities 
created by the merger with ibibo last year. Our share of MakeMyTrip's revenue, in local currency and adjusted for the
merger with ibibo last year, grew by 21% year on year to US$222m on the back of healthy growth in its airline ticketing
and hotels and packages businesses. Measured on a similar basis, our share of MakeMyTrip's trading losses reduced by
19% as it benefited from healthy growth in gross bookings as well as transaction volume growth in its airline ticketing
and hotels and packages businesses.

Payments
The payments and fintech business, PayU, recorded healthy revenue growth of 58% (37%), driven by a 48% increase in
transactions processed. Total payment value exceeded US$25bn, with India accounting for 47%. India was also the
fastest-growing region, with payment volumes increasing 84%.

PayU has sustained growth while keeping the cost base in its core payments business stable, demonstrating the benefits
of scale efficiencies, automation and platform consolidation. The combined effect of revenue growth and a stable cost
base reduced the trading loss by a significant 42% on the existing footprint and in local currency.

The 2018 financial year was pivotal in PayU's transformation from a payments business to a broader fintech services
business. As part of this process, PayU invested US$99m (and €20m of convertible loan funding) in Kreditech, a
credit-scoring business, and US$100m in Remitly, a technology-driven remittance business. These investments are 
accounted for as associates.

Food delivery
We increased our focus on online food-delivery services with two notable minority investments: firstly, Delivery Hero
continues to build its leadership in the more than 42 countries in which it operates and also Swiggy, a leading online
food-delivery company in India. In LatAm, iFood continued to grow order volumes, average take rates and customer
retention metrics through additional investment, specifically in Brazil. 

Cumulative annualised GMV growth for the food-delivery segment was 65% and cumulative annualised order volumes across 
all three companies rose 65%.

For the year ended December 2017, Delivery Hero increased revenue by 60% to €544m, with order volumes growing 48% to
292m. Swiggy saw healthy increases in revenue and order volumes. iFood more than doubled its revenue to US$117m and
recorded order volume growth of 116%.

Tencent
For the year ended 31 December 2017, Tencent's revenues of RMB238bn were up 56% year on year. Non-GAAP profit
attributable to shareholders (Tencent's measure of normalised performance) grew 43% to RMB65bn.
 
Revenues from value-added services (VAS) increased 43% to RMB154bn, with online games revenues growing 38% to RMB98bn
and social networks revenue rising 52% to RMB56bn. Online advertising revenues rose 50% to RMB40bn. Other revenues
(mainly payments and cloud-services revenue) rose 153% to RMB43bn.

Tencent's Weixin platform strengthened its 'super-app' status, with monthly active users exceeding the 1bn mark in
February 2018. The group maintained its leading position in the Chinese online games market and continued to grow its
global presence. Tencent's presence in social media and utility products drove healthy growth in advertising revenues from
its various platforms. The group extended its leadership in mobile payments in terms of active user accounts and further
expanded commercial transactions, with offline transaction volumes more than doubling year on year.

Tencent is increasing its investment in select areas including video, payments, cloud, artificial intelligence
technologies and smart retail. The group is enhancing its development and innovation capabilities. 

More information on Tencent's results is available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 was up 34% to RUB57bn. Key drivers were online games and
advertising. Mail.ru's two largest games, Warface and War Robots, performed well. The online games division expanded
internationally and across new platforms. International revenue accounted for almost half of its online games revenues. 
Mail.ru's advertising revenues benefited from shifts towards online platforms and social networks. The integration of 
online food-delivery businesses Delivery Club and ZakaZaka with Mail.ru's social media properties is progressing. In 
January 2018, Mail.ru announced the acquisition of ESforce, one of the largest esports companies in the world.

More information on Mail.ru's results is available at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Video entertainment
Although the macroeconomic environment in sub-Saharan Africa was relatively stable in the second half of the year, the
video-entertainment business continues to face challenging conditions. Despite this, it recorded a stable performance,
adding just over 1m direct-to-home (DTH) subscribers and 520 000 digital terrestrial television (DTT) subscribers. The
total base across Africa stood at 13.5m households at 31 March 2018. The business continued to build on the success of
its value strategy to grow the subscriber base and further reduced costs. DTT subscriber growth was supported by a partial
analogue switch-off in Zambia and launch of a popular package, GOtv Max, which generated increased average revenue per
user from upgrades and new customers. 

Revenue for the segment increased 8% (7%) to US$3.7bn and trading profit rose 29% (24%) to US$369m. A stronger South
African rand impacted positively. Results were affected by the 25% devaluation of the Nigerian naira and 7% devaluation
of the Angolan kwanza over the period. However, losses stabilised. 

The focus of the business remains on optimising cost structures and reinvesting for its online future. Through continued 
efforts to save on content costs and overheads, it reduced operating costs by over US$70m. Sports rights investments
included renewing English Premier League, South Africa's Premier Soccer League and UEFA Champions League. Cost savings
were partially reinvested in subscriber acquisition, production of local content and scaling Showmax.

Constrained liquidity in Angola and Zimbabwe persists because of limited availability of foreign currency. Liquidity
conditions in Nigeria improved significantly during the year, resulting in us being able to remit funds. At 31 March 2018, 
cash balances and trade receivables of US$131m, held in Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, remain exposed to weakening
currencies - this is a 55% reduction on last year's balance.

Media
Most of Media24's interest in the listed South African print business, Novus, was distributed to Naspers shareholders
in September 2017, with Media24 retaining a 19% interest and no longer consolidating Novus after the distribution. 

Media24 (all figures excluding Novus) produced stable results, with revenue flat year on year at US$374m, against a
backdrop of declining revenues from traditional media streams. Investment to scale the segment's growth, particularly 
in ecommerce and digital media, saw trading losses up 43% (33%) to US$30m. These now account for 17% of total revenue.

PROSPECTS 
In the year ahead the group will use its strong balance sheet to accelerate the growth of its classifieds, food-delivery 
and fintech businesses globally, and to pursue other growth opportunities when they arise. The group will continue to
scale the ecommerce and sub-Saharan Africa video-entertainment businesses and drive them closer to profitability. The
focus will be on innovation, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, navigating
macroeconomic headwinds and managing costs in mature businesses.

DIVIDEND NUMBER 89 
(All figures in South African cents)
The board recommends that the annual gross dividend be increased by 12% to 650 cents (previously 580 cents) per listed
N ordinary share and 130 cents (previously 116 cents) per unlisted A ordinary share. If confirmed by shareholders at
the annual general meeting on Friday 24 August 2018, dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the books 
on Friday 14 September 2018 and paid on Monday 17 September 2018. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday 
11 September 2018 (shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday 12 September 2018). Share certificates may not be dematerialised
or rematerialised between Wednesday 12 September 2018 and Friday 14 September 2018, both dates inclusive. The dividend
will be declared from income reserves. It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, yielding a net dividend of 
520 cents per listed N ordinary share and 104 cents per unlisted A ordinary share to those shareholders not exempt from
paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 130 cents per listed N ordinary share and 26 cents per unlisted A ordinary share.
The issued ordinary share capital as at 22 June 2018 was 438 656 059 N ordinary shares and 907 128 A ordinary shares.
The company's income tax reference number is 9550138714.

DIRECTORATE
On 1 April 2018 the group's executive director and chief investment officer, Mark Sorour, retired after more than 20 years 
with the group. He has been at the forefront of the group's expansion efforts and has led some of its most meaningful 
transactions. Mark will remain on the board as a non-executive director and his appointment will be proposed for approval 
by shareholders at the next annual general meeting. He will also continue to serve as a non-executive director on the Mail.ru 
Group Limited board. The board thanks Mark heartily for his valuable contribution and looks forward to his insights as a 
non-executive director.

NOTES TO THE SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
for the year ended 31 March

1.  General information
    Naspers Limited (Naspers or the group) is a global internet and entertainment group and one of the largest 
    technology investors in the world. Founded in 1915, we now operate in more than 120 countries and markets 
    with long-term growth potential. Naspers builds leading companies that empower people and enrich communities. 
    It runs some of the world's leading platforms in internet, video entertainment and media.

2.  Basis of presentation and accounting policies
    The summarised consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2018 are prepared in accordance 
    with the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements (the JSE Listings Requirements) relevant to summarised 
    financial statements and the provisions of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008. The JSE Listings Requirements 
    require provisional reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the measurement and 
    recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting 
    Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
    Reporting Standards Council, and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim 
    Financial Reporting. The summarised consolidated financial results do not include all the disclosures required 
    for complete annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International 
    Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
    annual financial statements from which the summarised consolidated financial results were derived, are 
    consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements, except as set out 
    below.
    
    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective 
    for financial years commencing 1 April 2017. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are 
    effective for the financial year commencing 1 April 2017 had a material impact on the group.

    The group's reportable segments reflect the components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief 
    executive officer and other senior executives who make strategic decisions. The group proportionately 
    consolidates its share of the results of its associates and joint ventures in its reportable segments. 

    Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based 
    payment expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention 
    option expenses and other gains/losses, but includes the finance cost on transponder leases.

    Core headline earnings excludes once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the 
    group's operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with 
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

    Change in accounting policy regarding written put option liabilities
    As part of our commitment to build shareholder value and prevent dilution, we indicated recently that we 
    are unlikely to issue Naspers N ordinary shares to settle put option liabilities arising from mergers and 
    acquisitions agreements, employee share option obligations or similar arrangements. Instead, the intention 
    is to settle these items in cash, either through purchases of shares on the market or direct cash settlement.

    When investing, we frequently partner with founders who remain in the business as non-controlling shareholders. 
    To provide them with liquidity at a later date, agreements sometimes include put options that require the group 
    to purchase the shares of non-controlling shareholders in future, with the option to settle by issuing Naspers 
    N ordinary shares or in cash. In the past we selected to settle some of these by issuing Naspers N ordinary 
    shares.

    The recent change in commercial intent to settle put options in cash rather than Naspers N ordinary shares, 
    has prompted us to reassess our accounting policy to ensure it remains reflective of the underlying settlement 
    expectations. IFRS does not explicitly address accounting for put option liabilities that can be settled by 
    issuing a variable number of an entity's own shares, as evidenced in the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
    November 2016 rejection of this matter. As a result, an accounting policy choice exists - they can either be 
    accounted for as (i) derivative financial instruments (at fair value in terms of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
    Recognition and Measurement or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments), or (ii) as liabilities equal to the amount payable 
    on settlement (in terms of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation).

    Up to 30 September 2017, put option liabilities were accounted for as derivative financial instruments given 
    the historic intention to settle in Naspers N ordinary shares. All put option liabilities were measured at a 
    fair value of zero as these options are priced at fair value, consequently there was no impact on the statement 
    of financial position or income statement.

    Given the intention to now settle in cash, it is more appropriate to recognise them as liabilities in the 
    statement of financial position, at amounts reflecting the gross cash consideration payable on settlement. 
    Consequently, in accordance with IAS 8, we have changed our accounting policy in this respect. Going forward, 
    all remeasurements of these liabilities will be recognised in the income statement. These remeasurements will 
    be included in headline earnings but excluded from core headline earnings.

    The group has applied the change in accounting policy retrospectively and has restated the comparative 
    information presented in these summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
    The summarised impact of the change in accounting policy on prior year results is an increase in liabilities 
    of US$2.22bn as at 31 March 2017, as well as the recognition of a remeasurement expense (including foreign 
    exchange translation effects) in the income statement of US$640m for the year ended 31 March 2017.

    The impact of the change in accounting policy on the summarised consolidated financial statements is outlined 
    in the extracts that follow.

    In addition to headline earnings, we also calculate and present trading profit and core headline earnings. These 
    are non-IFRS, Naspers-defined metrics and are presented as additional information to shareholders as we consider 
    them more reflective of our operating performance. In arriving at core headline earnings, adjustments are made to 
    the earnings of consolidated businesses, as well as the underlying earnings of associates and joint ventures, to 
    the extent that the information is available.

    Ensuring that core headline earnings remains reflective of our future potential operating performance, a review 
    of the items adjusted for in the calculation is required as circumstances change.

    We have historically adjusted core headline earnings for all amortisation expenses, excluding software, as these
    expenses have primarily related to intangible assets resulting from business combinations and other acquisitions. 
    These expenses are not considered operational in nature.

    Our associate Tencent has, in recent years, made a strategic decision to develop a number of digital content 
    offerings (including video and music), with significant success. Consequently, content acquired now represents 
    a meaningful part of the overall cost base for the digital content business, resulting in an increase in intangible
    assets and related amortisation expenses. As a result of this development, we considered it prudent to refine the 
    treatment of amortisation within the core headline earnings calculation and to now include the digital-content 
    element of Tencent's amortisation expenses in core headline earnings. Only amortisation related to intangible 
    assets identified in business combinations and other acquisitions continues to be adjusted for in the core headline 
    earnings calculation. The effect is to adjust core headline earnings downward from US$1.8bn to US$1.5bn for the year 
    ended 31 March 2017 (refer to note 4).

    IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segmental reporting to reflect the manner in which financial information 
    is communicated internally to management. We therefore report trading profit on an economic-interest basis (ie 
    including a proportionate consolidation of the trading profits of associates and joint ventures) in the segmental 
    review which, similar to core headline earnings, excludes amortisation expenses on certain intangible assets. 
    For the reasons outlined above, we will similarly no longer adjust trading profit to exclude the amortisation 
    expenses recognised by Tencent on its digital content. The effect is to adjust trading profit downward from 
    US$2.7bn to US$2.3bn for the year ended 31 March 2017. Consolidated trading profit is unaffected by this change.

    To ensure comparability between reporting periods, we have updated the comparative information for trading profit 
    and core headline earnings (including basic and diluted per-share equivalents) in these summarised consolidated 
    financial statements. The change to trading profit and core headline earnings had no impact on the group's statement 
    of financial position and income statement presented in accordance with IFRS.

3.  Independent audit
    The summarised consolidated financial results have been audited by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
    Inc. (PwC). The individual auditor assigned to perform the audit is Brendan Deegan. PwC's unqualified audit reports 
    on the consolidated annual financial statements and the summarised consolidated financial results are available for 
    inspection at the registered office of the company. The auditor's report does not necessarily cover all the 
    information contained in the summarised financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to 
    obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's work, they should obtain a copy of that report, together 
    with the consolidated annual financial statements from the registered office of the company. These documents will 
    be available from the company's registered office from 22 June 2018. The consolidated annual financial statements, 
    together with the integrated annual report, will be available on www.naspers.com on or about 20 July 2018.

    The group operates a number of businesses in jurisdictions where taxes are payable on certain transactions 
    or payments. The group continues to seek relevant advice and works with its advisers to identify and quantify 
    such tax exposures. Our current assessment of possible withholding and other tax exposures, including interest 
    and potential penalties, amounts to approximately US$226.1m (2017: US$256.7m). No provision has been made as 
    at 31 March 2018 and 2017 for these possible exposures.

10. Disposal groups classified as held for sale
    During the year ended 31 March 2017 the group announced the unbundling of the majority of its shareholding 
    in its subsidiary Novus Holdings Limited (Novus), operating in the print industry in South Africa. The assets 
    and liabilities of Novus were classified as held for distribution as at 31 March 2017. In August 2017 the group 
    received regulatory approval for the unbundling which was finalised during September 2017. Refer to note 11 for
    further details.

    details.
    
    The group also concluded the disposals of various other smaller units of which the assets and liabilities were
    classified as held for sale as at 31 March 2017.

    The group recognised a loss of US$nil (2017: US$1.6m) as part of ""Other (losses)/gains - net"" in the income 
    statement on remeasuring the net assets of businesses classified as held for sale to their fair value less 
    costs of disposal during the year. The fair value of the businesses was determined based on third-party sales 
    prices. This represents a level 3 fair-value measurement.

11. Business combinations, other acquisitions and disposals
    In August 2017 the group invested US$74m to acquire a controlling interest in its associate Takealot Online 
    (RF) Proprietary Limited (Takealot), the leading etailer in South Africa. Following the investment, the group 
    held a 58% effective interest in Takealot. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination with 
    an effective date of August 2017. The total purchase consideration amounted to US$123m representing the fair 
    value of the group's previously held equity interest in Takealot. A gain of US$20m has been recognised in 
    ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the remeasurement of the group's 
    previously held equity interest in Takealot to its fair value. The US$74m cash invested remains within the 
    group following the transaction and is accordingly not disclosed as part of the consideration transferred by 
    the group or assets of Takealot acquired, although it did affect the amount of goodwill recognised in the 
    business combination. The purchase price allocation: property, plant and equipment US$13m; cash and deposits
    US$105m; inventories US$28m; trade and other receivables US$4m; intangible assets US$107m; trade and other 
    payables US$27m; deferred tax liabilities US$30m; and the balance of US$81m to goodwill. The main classes of 
    intangible assets recognised in the business combination were trade names and brands, customer relationships 
    and technology. The transaction gave rise to the recognition of non-controlling interest of US$83m, which has 
    been measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of Takealot 
    as at the acquisition date. 

    In December 2017 the group acquired an additional 38% interest in Takealot from non-controlling shareholders. 
    The transaction was settled in Naspers N ordinary shares, purchased on the open market, with a fair value of 
    US$128m on settlement date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net asset value acquired was 
    recognised in the ""Existing control business combination reserve"" in equity and totalled US$65m. An amount of 
    US$4m was recognised in the valuation reserve being the difference between the fair value and acquisition cost 
    of the shares transferred. Following the transaction, the group holds a 96% effective interest (91% fully 
    diluted) in Takealot.

    In November 2017 the group invested US$41m to acquire a 100% effective interest in The Car Trader Proprietary 
    Limited (AutoTrader), an online automobile classifieds vertical in South Africa. The transaction was accounted 
    for as a business combination with an effective date of November 2017. The total purchase consideration 
    amounted to US$41m. The purchase price allocation: property, plant and equipment US$1m; cash and deposits 
    US$3m; trade and other receivables US$1m; intangible assets US$27m; trade and other payables US$4m; loan 
    liabilities US$14m; deferred tax liabilities US$8m; and the balance of US$35m to goodwill. The main classes of 
    intangible assets recognised in the business combination were brands, customer relationships and technology. 

    Since the acquisition dates of the above business combinations, revenue of US$195m and net results (losses) 
    of US$41m have been included in the income statement relating to Takealot and AutoTrader. Had the revenue 
    and net results of Takealot and AutoTrader been included from 1 April 2017 group revenue and net profit 
    would have amounted to US$6.75bn and US$11.26bn respectively.

    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisitions is the acquirees' market presence. 
    The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total acquisition-related 
    costs of US$3m were recorded in ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement 
    regarding the above-mentioned acquisitions.

    The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:

    The group made various investments in Delivery Hero AG (Delivery Hero), a global online food-ordering and
    delivery marketplace, during the year. In May 2017 the group acquired its initial interest in Delivery Hero 
    through an investment of US$426m. On 30 June 2017 Delivery Hero successfully completed an initial public 
    offering of its shares, a process during which the group invested a further US$47m. Following these 
    investments, the group held an 11% effective interest (10% fully diluted) in Delivery Hero. In December 2017 
    the group invested an additional US$47m as part of a private placement in order to maintain its relative 
    shareholding. During March 2018 following the receipt of regulatory approval, the group acquired Rocket 
    Internet SE's interest in Delivery Hero for US$778m. The group's aggregate investment in Delivery Hero therefore
    amounts to US$1.3bn over the reporting period. Following the acquisition from Rocket Internet SE, the group
    holds a 23% effective interest (22% fully diluted) in Delivery Hero. The group accounts for its interest in 
    Delivery Hero as an investment in an associate.

    The group made two investments during June 2017 and February 2018 amounting to US$121m in total, in Bundl 
    Technologies Private Limited (Swiggy), the operator of a first-party food-delivery marketplace in India. 
    Following these investments, the group holds a 22% effective interest (21% fully diluted) in Swiggy. The 
    group accounts for its interest in Swiggy as an investment in an associate.

    In May 2017 the group invested US$99m in Kreditech Holding SSL GmbH (Kreditech), a provider of consumer 
    lending and financial services. The group has also provided convertible loan funding of €20m to Kreditech. 
    Following the investment, the group holds a 38% effective interest (31% fully diluted) in Kreditech. The 
    group accounts for its interest in Kreditech as an investment in an associate.

    During May 2017 the group invested US$132m in its associate MakeMyTrip Limited (MakeMyTrip) as part of a 
    funding round. In August and September 2017, following MakeMyTrip's issue of share options to its employees, 
    the group invested US$23m to maintain its relative shareholding. Following these transactions, the group 
    holds a 43% effective interest (40% fully diluted) in MakeMyTrip.

    The group invested US$71m for an additional interest in its associate Flipkart Limited (Flipkart) in 
    April 2017. The additional interest was acquired from existing shareholders of Flipkart. Flipkart undertook 
    various funding rounds during the year in which the group did not participate. These funding rounds resulted 
    in a dilution of the group's interest in Flipkart and in the recognition of an aggregate net dilution gain 
    of US$252m in ""Dilution gains/(losses) on equity-accounted investments"" in the income statement. Following 
    the dilutions, the group holds a 12% effective interest (11% fully diluted) in Flipkart.

    In November 2017 the group invested US$100m in Remitly, Inc. (Remitly), a global digital money-transfer 
    service. The investment resulted in the group acquiring a 23% effective interest (20% fully diluted) in 
    Remitly. The group accounts for its interest in Remitly as an investment in an associate.

    The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:

    During May 2017 the group disposed of its investment in its joint venture Souq Group Limited for a 
    consideration of US$173m. A gain on disposal of US$89m has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains on 
    acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following the transaction.

    In September 2017 following the receipt of regulatory approval, the group distributed the majority of its 
    shareholding in Novus Holdings Limited (Novus) to its shareholders. The group recognised the distribution 
    as an in specie dividend, reducing retained earnings by US$69m, being the fair value of the distributed 
    Novus shares. A loss on disposal of US$145m has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and 
    disposals"" in the income statement following the distribution, being the difference between the fair value 
    of the distributed Novus shares and the book value of the assets distributed as well as the reclassification 
    of reserves of US$112m. After the distribution, the group holds a 19% interest in Novus and accounts for this 
    interest as an available-for-sale investment.
    
    During February 2018 the group disposed of its investment in its joint venture Konga Online Shopping Limited. 
    A loss on disposal of US$38m, representing the reclassification of the group's foreign currency translation 
    reserve from other comprehensive income to the income statement, has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains on 
    acquisitions and disposals"". 

    In March 2018 the group disposed of approximately 6% of its interest in its associate, Tencent Holdings Limited
    (Tencent). The disposal was executed by way of an accelerated offering by private placement on the Hong Kong 
    Stock Exchange for a cash consideration of US$9.76bn. The disposal reduced the group's shareholding from 33.17% 
    to 31.17%. A dilution gain of US$9.1bn has been recognised in ""Dilution gains/(losses) on equity-accounted 
    investments"" following the transaction, resulting in a cumulative net dilution gain of US$8.98bn for the year 
    on the group's investment in Tencent.

12. Issue of listed bond
    The group issued a 10-year US$1.0bn international bond in July 2017. The bond matures in July 2027 and carries
    a fixed interest rate of 4.85% per annum. The proceeds were partially utilised to repay the group's US$700m 
    international bond which matured in July 2017. The remaining proceeds will be utilised for general corporate 
    purposes, including acquisitions.

13. Financial instruments
    The fair values of the group's financial instruments that are measured at fair value at each reporting period 
    are categorised as follows:
                                                                   Fair-value measurements

    There have been no transfers between levels 1 or 2 during the reporting period, nor were there any 
    significant changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value.

    Currency devaluation features relate to clauses in content acquisition agreements that provide the group 
    with protection against significant currency devaluations. The fair value of currency devaluation features 
    is measured through the use of discounted cash flow techniques.

    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance 
    criteria will be met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified 
    earn-out payments are used. Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these 
    financial instruments.

    The fair value of level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in 
    active markets and interest rate extracts from observable yield curves.

    Financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed:
                                                                         Carrying        Fair

    In April 2018 the group acquired the share capital held by non-controlling shareholders of its subsidiary 
    Dubizzle Limited (Dubizzle) for US$190m. Following the acquisition, the group holds a 100% effective 
    interest in Dubizzle.
    
    In May 2018 the group announced the sale of its interest in Flipkart Limited - its equity-accounted etail 
    investment in India - to US-based retailer Walmart Inc. for US$2.2bn. The transaction is subject to 
    regulatory approval.
    
    In May 2018 the group invested US$35m for a 16% effective interest in Honor Technology Inc., a 
    first-of-its-kind home care company providing in-home senior care.

16. Pro forma financial information
    The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics in local currency, excluding the effects 
    of changes in the composition of the group (the pro forma financial information) in the following tables. 
    The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers 
    Limited and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been 
    extracted from the group's management accounts, the quality of which the board is satisfied with. 
    
    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that 
    it has been extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial
    position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange 
    rates and changes in the composition of the group on its results for the period ended 31 March 2018. The 
    following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:

    1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's 
       results to the prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly 
       exchange rates for that period. The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the 
       constant currency results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above, compared to the prior 
       period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) used for 
       the group's most significant functional currencies, were South African rand (2018: 0.0774; 2017: 0.0713); 
       Polish zloty (2018: 0.2794; 2017: 0.2516); Russian rouble (2018: 0.0173; 2017: 0.0159); Chinese yuan
       renminbi (2018: 0.1517; 2017: 0.1483); Indian rupee (2018: 0.0155; 2017: 0.0149); Brazilian real 
       (2018: 0.3097; 2017: 0.3061); and Nigerian naira (2018: 0.0028; 2017: 0.0035).

    2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of 
       subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its 
       equity-accounted investments. For mergers, the group composition adjustments include a portion of the 
       prior year results of the entity with which the merger took place. The following significant changes in 
       the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods have been adjusted for in arriving 
       at the pro forma financial information:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
ON THE SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF NASPERS LIMITED

Opinion
The summary consolidated financial statements of Naspers Limited, contained in the accompanying provisional report,
which comprise the summary consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2018, the summary consolidated
income statement and summary consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the 
year then ended, and related notes, are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Naspers Limited 
for the year ended 31 March 2018.

In our opinion, the accompanying summary consolidated financial statements are consistent, in all material respects,
with the audited consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for provisional reports, as set out in note 2 to the summary consolidated financial statements, and the
requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary financial statements.

Summary Consolidated Financial Statements
The summary consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International Financial
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to annual financial
statements. Reading the summary consolidated financial statements and the auditor's report thereon, therefore, is not 
a substitute for reading the audited consolidated financial statements and the auditor's report thereon.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Our Report Thereon
We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on the audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated 
22 June 2018. That report also includes communication of key audit matters. Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the 
current period.

Directors' Responsibility for the Summary Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the summary consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for provisional reports, set out in note 2 to the summary
consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary
financial statements. 

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the summary consolidated financial statements are consistent,
in all material respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements based on our procedures, which were
conducted in accordance with International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 810 (Revised), Engagements to Report on Summary 
Financial Statements.

Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is finalising its provisional report and consolidated annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.

Compared to the group’s published results for the year ended 31 March 2017, it expects core headline earnings per share for the
year to be between 40% (162 US cents) and 45% (183 US cents) higher than the prior period’s reported 406 US cents. However,
as outlined below, the group has amended its calculation of core headline earnings and has restated the comparative period’s
core headline earnings per share to 337 US cents. Accordingly, we expect core headline earnings per share for the year ended
31 March 2018 to be between 70% (236 US cents) and 75% (253 US cents) higher than the adjusted comparable period’s 337 US
cents. Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to the group’s published results for the year ended 31 March 2017, it expects earnings per share for the year to be
between 280% (1 895 US cents) and 290% (1 963 US cents) higher than the prior period’s reported 677 US cents. However, as
outlined below, the group restated the comparative earnings per share figure to 542 US cents as a result of its change in
accounting policy. Accordingly, it is expected that earnings per share for the year will be between 380% (2 060 US cents) and
390% (2 114 US cents) higher compared to the adjusted prior period’s 542 US cents. The growth in earnings for the year was
significantly impacted by the gain recognised on the sale of a 2% interest in Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) in March 2018,
which is non-recurring.

Compared to the group’s published results for the year ended 31 March 2017, it expects headline earnings per share for the year
to be between 130% (233 US cents) and 135% (242 US cents) higher than the prior period’s reported 179 US cents. However, as
outlined below, the group restated the comparative headline earnings per share figure to 44 US cents as a result of its change in
accounting policy. Accordingly, headline earnings per share for the year is expected to increase by between 840% (370 US cents)
and 850% (374 US cents) from the adjusted prior period’s 44 US cents. Headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2017 was
restated and significantly reduced by the change in accounting policy for put options outlined below.

Further details will be provided in the summarised consolidated financial results, due for release on 22 June 2018. Financial
information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s auditors.

Shareholders should note that the group’s provisional report and consolidated annual financial statements will contain a change
in accounting policy. To assist shareholders in understanding the group’s trading update, these changes and their impact on the
group’s reporting for the comparative year ended 31 March 2017 and six months ended 30 September 2017 have been outlined
below.

Change in accounting policy for put option liabilities
As part of our commitment to build shareholder value and prevent dilution, we indicated recently that we are unlikely to issue
Naspers N ordinary shares to settle put option liabilities arising from mergers and acquisitions agreements, employee share
option obligations or similar arrangements. Instead, the intention is to settle these items in cash, either through purchases of
shares on the market or direct cash settlement.

When investing, we frequently partner with founders who remain in the business as non-controlling shareholders. To provide
them with liquidity at a later date, agreements sometimes include put options that require the group to purchase the shares of
non-controlling shareholders in future, with the option to settle by issuing Naspers N ordinary shares or in cash. In the past we
selected to settle some of these by issuing Naspers N ordinary shares.
        
Change in accounting policy for put option liabilities (continued)

The recent change in commercial intent to settle put options in cash rather than Naspers N ordinary shares, has prompted us to
reassess our accounting policy to ensure it remains reflective of the underlying settlement expectations. IFRS does not explicitly
address accounting for put option liabilities that can be settled by issuing a variable number of an entity’s own shares, as
evidenced in the IFRS Interpretations Committee November 2016 rejection of this matter. As a result, an accounting policy choice
exists – they can either be accounted for as (i) derivative financial instruments (at fair value in terms of IAS 39 Financial
Instruments Recognition and Measurement or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments), or (ii) as liabilities equal to the amount payable on
settlement (in terms of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation).

Up to 30 September 2017, put option liabilities were accounted for as derivative financial instruments given the historic intention
to settle in Naspers N ordinary shares. All put option liabilities were measured at a fair value of zero as these options are priced
at fair value, consequently there was no impact on the statement of financial position or income statement.

Given the intention to now settle in cash, it is more appropriate to recognise them as liabilities in the statement of financial
position, at amounts reflecting the gross cash consideration payable on settlement. Consequently, in accordance with IAS 8, we
have changed our accounting policy in this respect. Going forward, all remeasurements of these liabilities will be recognised in
the income statement. These remeasurements will be included in headline earnings but excluded from core headline earnings.

The group has applied the change in accounting policy retrospectively and has restated the comparative information presented in
the provisional report and consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017, as well as the
comparative information to be contained in its interim report for the six months ending 30 September 2018. The summarised
impact of the change in accounting policy on prior period results is an increase in liabilities of US$2.23bn and US$2.22bn as at
30 September 2017 and 31 March 2017 respectively, as well as the recognition of remeasurement losses (including foreign
exchange translation effects) in the income statement of US$18m for the six months ended 30 September 2017 and US$640m for
the year ended 31 March 2017.

Calculation of trading profit and core headline earnings – impact of digital content-related amortisation charges relating to
Tencent

The group is required to calculate and present headline earnings (and the related basic and diluted per-share equivalents) in
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. Headline earnings represents an earnings metric that is intended to provide a like-for-like
basis on which the earnings of entities can be compared.

In addition to headline earnings, we also calculate and present trading profit and core headline earnings. These are non-IFRS,
Naspers-defined metrics and are presented as additional information to shareholders as we consider them more reflective of our
operating performance. In arriving at core headline earnings, adjustments are made to the earnings of consolidated businesses,
as well as the underlying earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent that the information is available.

Ensuring that core headline earnings remains reflective of our future potential operating performance, a review of the items
adjusted for in the calculation is required as circumstances change.

We have historically adjusted core headline earnings for all amortisation expenses, excluding software, as these expenses have
primarily related to intangible assets resulting from business combinations and other acquisitions. These expenses are not
considered operational in nature.

Our associate Tencent has, in recent years, made a strategic decision to develop a number of digital content offerings (including
video and music), with significant success. Consequently, content acquired now represents a meaningful part of the overall cost
base for the digital content business, resulting in an increase in intangible assets and related amortisation expenses. As a result of
this development, we considered it prudent to refine the treatment of amortisation within the core headline earnings calculation
and to now include the digital-content element of Tencent’s amortisation expenses in core headline earnings. Only amortisation
related to intangible assets identified in business combinations and other acquisitions continues to be adjusted for in the core
headline earnings calculation. The effect is to adjust core headline earnings downward from US$1.5bn to US$1.2bn for the six
months ended 30 September 2017 and from US$1.8bn to US$1.5bn for the year ended 31 March 2017.

IFRS 8 Operating Segments require segmental reporting to reflect the manner in which financial information is communicated
internally to management. We therefore report trading profit on an economic-interest basis (i.e. including a proportionate
consolidation of the trading profits of associates and joint ventures) in the segmental review which, similar to core headline
earnings, excludes amortisation expenses on certain intangible assets. For the reasons outlined above, we will similarly no longer
adjust trading profit to exclude the amortisation expenses recognised by Tencent on its digital content. The effect is to adjust
trading profit downward from US$2.1bn to US$1.7bn for the six months ended 30 September 2017 and from US$2.7bn to
US$2.3bn for the year ended 31 March 2017. Consolidated trading profit is unaffected by this change.

To ensure comparability between reporting periods, we have updated the comparative information for trading profit and core
headline earnings (including basic and diluted per-share equivalents) in our provisional report and consolidated annual financial
statements. The change to trading profit and core headline earnings had no impact on the group’s statement of financial position
and income statement presented in accordance with IFRS.

The impact of the change is illustrated in the tables that follow.

CATEGORY 2 RESULTS OF ACCELERATED OFFERING OF TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED (""TENCENT"") SHARES
AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


1.    Introduction

1.1         Following approval by its board of directors, shareholders of the Company are advised that
            the Company has successfully concluded the sale of 189 978 300 shares in Tencent (the
            ""Tencent Sale Shares""), equal to approximately 2% of Tencent’s issued share capital, for
            an aggregate purchase consideration of US$9.8 billion on 23 March 2018 by way of an
            accelerated offering by private placement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the
            ""Accelerated Offering"" or ""Placing"").

1.2         The price of HKS405 per share achieved for the Tencent Sale Shares represents a 7.8%
            discount to the closing price of Tencent shares on 22 March 2018 and an 8% discount to
            the 30-day volume weighted average price of the Tencent shares for the 30-day trading
            period immediately preceding 22 March 2018.

1.3         Naspers has also announced its commitment not to dispose of any further shares in
            Tencent for a period of at least 3 years.

2.    Rationale and Use of Proceeds

2.1         The funds received from the Placing are intended to be: (i) utilised to reinforce and
            increase financial flexibility on Naspers’ balance sheet and (ii) invested over time to
            accelerate the growth of Naspers' classifieds, online food delivery and fintech businesses,
            and to pursue other exciting growth opportunities when they arise.

3.    Description of the Business of Tencent

3.1         Naspers invested in Tencent in 2001. Tencent is an investment holding company involved
            in the provision of internet value added services and online advertising in China. Tencent
            listed its shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during June 2004.

3.2         Tencent uses technology to enrich the lives of Internet users. Their social products Weixin
            and QQ link their users to a rich digital content catalogue including games, video, music
            and books. Tencent proprietary targeting technology helps advertisers reach out to
            hundreds of millions of consumers in China. Their infrastructure services including
            payment, security, cloud and artificial intelligence create differentiated offerings and
            support their partners’ business growth. Tencent invests heavily in people and innovation,
            enabling them to evolve with the Internet.

3.3         Since its establishment, Tencent has maintained steady growth under its user-oriented
            operating strategies and that it has, and continues, to perform well in a highly competitive
            and dynamic environment, thereby remaining the largest platform operator in China.

4.    The Accelerated Offering

4.1         The Tencent Sale Shares were sold to institutional investors globally through an
            accelerated bookbuild process, subject to customary selling restrictions. Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as the Joint Global-coordinators and
            Joint Book-runners to manage the Placing.

4.2         The Joint Global-coordinators and Joint Book-runners conducted the Placing on an
            undocumented basis. Accordingly, no prospectus, offering circular, pre-listing statement
            or other offering document was or will be published in connection with the Placing. The
            Placing agreement is governed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and is subject to
            certain customary conditions.

5.    Net Assets and profits attributable to the Tencent Sale Shares

      The value of the Tencent Sale Shares as at 30 September 2017, being the Company's most recent
      reporting period, was approximately US$8.176bn. The profit after tax attributable to the Tencent
      Sale Shares for the six months ended 30 September 2017 was approximately US$97.4m. The
      aforementioned information has been extracted from the interim financial information of the
      Company for the six-month period ended 30 September 2017, prepared in accordance with
      International Financial Reporting Standards.

                Accelerated Offering of Tencent shares and Cautionary Announcement

Naspers announces its intention to sell up to 190 million Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) shares,
equal to 2% of Tencent’s total issued share capital (the Tencent Sale Shares), reducing its stake in
Tencent from 33,2% to 31,2% (the Transaction).

The funds will be used to reinforce Naspers’ balance sheet and will be invested over time to accelerate
the growth of our classifieds, online food delivery and fintech businesses globally and to pursue other
exciting growth opportunities when they arise.

The Company has not previously sold any Tencent shares since it invested in 2001. The Company
considers Tencent to be one of the very best growth enterprises in any industry in the world, managed
by an exceptionally able team. Tencent understands and supports the intention to sell. Naspers will
not sell further Tencent shares for at least the next three years, in line with its long-term belief in
Tencent’s business.

The Tencent Sale Shares will be offered to institutional investors globally, subject to customary selling
restrictions. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have been appointed Joint
Global-coordinators and Joint Book-runners to manage the transaction. Books are open now and are
expected to close prior to the Hong Kong market opening. The Global Coordinators reserve the right to
accelerate closing of the books.
Cautionary announcement

Shareholders of Naspers are advised that the Transaction, if successfully implemented, is likely to
constitute a category 2 transaction in terms of the Listing Requirements of the JSE and may have a
material effect on the price of Naspers’ securities. Accordingly, Naspers shareholders are advised to
exercise caution when dealing in the Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM REPORT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2017

COMMENTARY

Naspers delivered a solid performance for the six months to 30 September 2017 with group revenue, measured on an economic-interest
basis, increasing 33% year on year to US$9.0bn (or 39% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals). 
This is a 17% increase on last year's growth rate with the ecommerce businesses being key drivers of the acceleration. 
Group trading profit increased by 40% (or 52% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) to US$2.1bn 
due to a healthy boost from Tencent and increased profitability in the ecommerce businesses - most notably classifieds. 
With this as backdrop, group core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable operating performance, was 
US$1.5bn - a 65% increase year on year.

Ecommerce accelerated its topline growth and reduced losses (in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) 
as it increased its scale. Classifieds (excluding letgo) turned profitable and our payment service platforms within 
PayU also scaled, reducing losses and moving closer to profitability. Notably, the group strengthened its presence in online 
food delivery with significant investments in Delivery Hero and Swiggy. Tencent produced another excellent set of results. 
Video entertainment, although still navigating weak African macroeconomic conditions - particularly weak currencies - stabilised 
its losses in sub-Saharan Africa and saw a significant improvement in cash remittances from Nigeria.

The group's geographic footprint, across more than 120 countries and markets, exposes it to significant foreign exchange 
volatility. This materially impacts on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, especially in video entertainment 
where revenues are earned in local currencies but costs are predominantly US dollar based. The internet businesses are less 
severely affected given their largely local currency denominated revenue and cost bases. Where relevant in this report we 
have adjusted amounts and percentages for the effects of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals to reflect 
underlying trends. These adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics 
reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A reconciliation of pro forma financial information to 
the equivalent IFRS metrics is provided in note 16 of this condensed consolidated interim report.

The following financial commentary and segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (including consolidated 
subsidiaries and a proportionate consolidation of associated companies and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

On a consolidated basis, excluding equity-accounted investments, group revenue increased 5% (15%) due to accelerating ecommerce 
growth, the latter growing revenue 33% in local currency and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals (notably the disposals 
of Allegro and Netretail). Consolidated trading profit improved by 56% (165%) to US$70m.

Development spend has reduced year on year on both a consolidated and economic-interest basis. 
Development spend of consolidated businesses was down 18% from the prior year as earlier-stage investments improved 
their competitive positions, therefore requiring lower investment while continuing to scale. Excluding the investment in 
controlled newer initiatives such as letgo and Showmax, which totalled US$155m, development spend on older investments decreased 12%.

The group's share of the results of associates and joint ventures increased 59% year on year to US$1.5bn. Included in this 
figure are once-off gains of US$414m and impairment losses of US$121m recognised by these entities. In aggregate, these 
equity-accounted investments contributed US$1.7bn to core headline earnings, an improvement of 52% year on year.

Net interest expense on borrowings was down 27% to US$54m due to lower utilisation of credit facilities, the impact of the 
proceeds from the Allegro disposal, and the 4.85% coupon achieved by the group on the US$1bn bond issued in July 2017. 
Net debt was US$140m at 30 September 2017, reflecting gearing of 1%.

Consolidated free cash outflow of US$96m was recorded, benefiting from dividend income of US$247m from Tencent. 

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in the condensed consolidated interim report.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW

Internet

Robust growth saw internet revenues increasing 42% (52%) year on year to US$6.9bn. Boosted by classifieds and another 
exceptional performance by Tencent, trading profit for the internet segment was US$1.8bn - up 47% (61%) year on year. 
This segment now contributes 77% of group revenue, compared to 72% last year.

Ecommerce

Revenue in ecommerce increased 15% year on year to US$1.6bn. However, when measured in local currency and adjusted for 
acquisitions and disposals, growth was 38% - an acceleration of 14 percentage points on last year's growth rate. This growth 
was fuelled by strong performances by classifieds, food delivery, payments and etail. Overall trading losses increased 9% 
to US$318m, with equity-accounted investments contributing 44% of the loss. Measured in local currency and adjusted for 
acquisitions and disposals - in particular the US$83m in trading profits generated by Allegro last year - ecommerce trading 
losses decreased by a meaningful 17%.

Trading losses declined in several ecommerce units including classifieds and payments. The group's profitable ecommerce 
businesses delivered US$465m in revenues and US$170m in trading profits, growing these metrics by 50% (36%) and 
55% (52%) respectively.

Classifieds continued to gain traction across the portfolio. Excluding the additional investment in letgo, the business 
turned profitable during the reporting period. Revenue grew 47% (38%) year on year with OLX Europe benefiting from tailwinds
in the vertical businesses, and Avito showing consistent growth. OLX Brazil is on track to reach break-even by the end of 
the financial year.

Etail revenues increased 16% year on year in nominal terms. However, in local currency and before the impact of acquisitions 
and disposals, revenue was up 37% with strong year-on-year growth from Takealot and Flipkart.

eMAG powered growth in its home market of Romania and across Central and Eastern Europe with gross merchandise value (GMV) 
increasing year on year by 33% in Romania, 50% in Hungary and 27% in Bulgaria.

Flipkart, the group's equity-accounted investment in India, continued its growth acceleration and further solidified its 
market leadership. During the recent festive season sales period, Flipkart captured around 70% of the total ecommerce market. 
Flipkart has also secured substantial capital from investors - including Tencent and Softbank - to continue building its 
position as a leading business-to-consumer (B2C) platform in the fast-growing Indian market.

In August 2017 the group invested an additional US$74m to acquire a controlling stake in South Africa's leading etailer, 
Takealot, resulting in the business now being consolidated. Takealot made strong progress over the reporting period, recording 
GMV growth of 72%, a significant acceleration on last year.

Since the merger of the group's travel business ibibo with MakeMyTrip in January 2017, the travel business has maintained its 
rapid growth - increasing revenue by 91% (24%) year on year.

The group's payments and financial services business, PayU, continued to perform well in the key regions of India, Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. Revenue growth of 52% (36%) was recorded on the back of a 75% increase in 
transaction volumes year on year. India is PayU's fastest growing market, representing 47% of total payment volumes and 
growing payment volumes by 120% year on year. Overall, PayU processed payment volumes of US$11.7bn during the first six 
months of the year.

PayU continues to realise scale efficiencies following the consolidation in India with Citrus Pay and from its drive to 
automate and consolidate platforms in other markets. With healthy revenue growth and a focus on cost management, the core 
payments service provider business is well on track to achieve break-even by the end of the financial year.

Executing on its strategy to expand into consumer credit, PayU invested US$99m for a non-controlling stake in Kreditech, 
a credit-scoring business. PayU plans to extend these consumer credit services in its key markets.

The group is expanding its online food-delivery footprint. iFood, majority-owned by Movile, generated revenue growth of 
145% (135%) year on year. The group also invested an initial US$426m in Delivery Hero in May 2017, followed by an additional 
US$47m top-up when Delivery Hero successfully listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Delivery Hero reported 96% year-on-
year revenue growth in its second quarter results. In September 2017 the group entered into a further agreement, subject to 
regulatory approval, to acquire an additional stake in Delivery Hero for EUR660m (approximately US$775m), taking the group's 
total ownership to around 24% on a fully diluted basis. The group also led an investment round in Swiggy, a leading online 
food-delivery business in India, in May 2017, investing US$61m for a 14.8% fully diluted interest.

Naspers Ventures has strengthened its position in the education technology sector with increased investments in Udemy and 
Brainly, both global learning platforms in which the group originally invested during the 2017 financial year.

Tencent

Tencent had an outstanding six months, with revenues growing 57% year on year to RMB106.2bn and non-GAAP operating profit 
increasing 37% year on year to RMB38.6bn. Smartphone and PC games, online advertising, digital content subscriptions and 
payment-related services, all remain growth drivers. Margins contracted due to high channel costs for smartphone games,
revenue mix changes to low-margin products and increased investments in content.

Online games revenue increased by 36% year on year to RMB46.7bn, primarily driven by more smartphone game users and a higher 
proportion of paying users, as well as increased average revenue per user (ARPU) from key PC games titles. In the second 
quarter of 2017, smartphone titles (including the titles attributable to the social network business) generated more revenue
than PC-based titles for the first time. It is expected that PC client game revenue growth will decelerate in future.

Online advertising revenues increased by 52% year on year, boosted by increased traffic on video and growth in advertising on 
Weixin, mobile browsers and other platforms. Digital-content revenue recorded rapid growth over the period, primarily driven 
by the strong performance of video and music services subscriptions and virtual gifting within live broadcasts.

At the end of June 2017, Weixin and WeChat monthly active users (MAU) reached 963m, growing 19% year on year. Total MAU for 
QQ was 850m, down around 5% from last year due to fewer casual users, while engagement with core users increased.

More information on Tencent's results is available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru

Mail.ru grew overall revenues 33% year on year to RUB26.3bn, reflecting an improving Russian economic environment and solid 
growth in advertising and online games revenues. Advertising revenue increased 26% over the period to RUB10.3bn, driven by 
growth in advertising on social networks, video and mobile. Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games revenue was up 53% to 
RUB7.8bn year on year, the result of both ongoing success in existing titles and new releases such as HAWK and the console 
version of Skyforge. Internet value-added services (IVAS) revenue declines were reversed and saw year-on-year growth of 19%, 
closing at RUB7.3bn, primarily on the back of cross-platform subscription offerings. VKontakte remains the largest social
network platform in Russia with 60m daily active users. Investments in leveraging Mail.ru's existing user engagement, 
including in food delivery and classifieds, are encouraging.

More information on Mail.ru's results is available at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Video entertainment

Overall, the video-entertainment business recorded modest subscriber growth over the period with the total subscriber base 
closing at 12.2m households on 30 September 2017.

In South Africa, DStv had a stable performance and continued to deliver healthy profits and cash flows. A further development 
was the combination of the group's Showmax offering with DStv Now, which is showing encouraging early results. However, the 
business still operates against a difficult and weakening economic backdrop.

Outside South Africa, losses in the sub-Saharan African video-entertainment business stabilised year on year, with most 
African currencies, except the Nigerian naira, showing less weakness than in the prior year. Assuming no further significant
currency weakness and continued momentum in subscriber growth, the group will be on track to bring the business back to 
profitability in the coming years.

In October 2017, Zambia commenced the process of migrating terrestrial television broadcasting from an analogue to a digital 
format - a process commonly referred to as analogue switchoff (ASO). The Zambian business is well prepared to capitalise on 
this opportunity. Digital terrestrial television (DTT) networks have been rolled out in Mozambique, Nigeria and Ghana although 
release dates for the ASO have not been confirmed in these territories.

Although monetary policy in several African economies continues to restrict liquidity due to the limited supply of foreign 
currency, there has been a marked improvement in liquidity in Nigeria. This has allowed the group to regularly remit cash. 
At 30 September 2017 cash balances of US$166m, held in Angola, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, remain exposed to weakening
currencies. This balance is down 43% since the end of March 2017.

The expansion of Showmax in Poland continued and a sharp focus on local content is showing traction in this market.

With the above as backdrop, the segment reported revenues of US$1.8bn, up 8% (7%) on the prior year. Trading profit was up 
marginally by 4% (3%). Persistent currency weakness in Nigeria, where the naira weakened significantly year on year,
translated to lower US dollar revenues.

Management continues to engage regulators and participate in several regulatory reviews in various markets.

Media

Media24 (excluding Novus) achieved satisfactory results with the structural decline in traditional revenue streams offset by 
significant cost-reduction initiatives throughout the business. Revenue increased 11% (5%) year on year to US$315m, while
trading profit grew 75%.

The growth businesses, largely the ecommerce and digital media initiatives, contributed 8% of total revenue and grew 24% over 
the period in local currency. The segment's focus on audience migration to digital formats and cost containment remains.

In September 2017 the group unbundled the majority of Media24's investment in the listed South African print business Novus, 
to Naspers's shareholders. Post unbundling, Media24 retained a 19% interest in Novus and accordingly no longer consolidates 
the business. Media24's remaining portfolio comprises newspapers, magazine and book publishing, ecommerce, digital media, 
online job classifieds and online travel.

Prospects

Going forward, the group will continue to drive scale to bring its ecommerce business to profitability and cash generation. 
In addition, it will manage macro challenges in the more mature businesses through tight cost controls and continued 
innovation and repositioning of businesses to counter increasing competition by global players. The group will also continue 
to invest in emerging businesses that may power future growth. Naspers's balance sheet remains strong and the group's current 
business plan is fully funded.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim report for the six months ended 30 September

1.  General information

    Naspers Limited (Naspers) is a global internet and entertainment group and one of the largest technology investors in
    the world. Founded in 1915, we now operate in more than 120 countries and markets with long-term growth potential,
    Naspers builds leading companies that empower people and enrich communities. It runs some of the world's leading
    platforms in internet, video entertainment and media.

2.  Basis of presentation and accounting policies

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2017 have
    been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IAS 34 Interim Financial
    Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, and Financial
    Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council as well as the requirements of the
    Companies Act of South Africa and the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the disclosures required for complete
    annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards
    Board (IASB). The accounting policies used in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are
    consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements.

    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective for
    financial years commencing 1 April 2017. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are effective
    for the financial year commencing 1 April 2017 had a material impact on the group.

    Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based payment
    expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses
    and other gains/losses, but includes the finance cost on transponder leases.

    Core headline earnings exclude once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's
    sustainable operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

3.  Review by the independent auditor

    This condensed consolidated interim report has been reviewed by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers
    Inc., whose unqualified report appears at the end of the condensed consolidated interim report.

    The group recognised a loss of US$nil (2016: US$1.6m and 31 March 2017: US$1.6m) on remeasuring the net assets
    of businesses classified as held for sale to their fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value was determined based on
    third-party sales prices and accordingly represent level 3 fair-value measurements.

11. Business combinations, other acquisitions and disposals

    In August 2017 the group invested US$74m to acquire a controlling interest in its associate Takealot Online (RF)
    Proprietary Limited (Takealot), the leading etailer in South Africa. Following the investment, the group holds a 58%
    effective interest (54% fully diluted) in Takealot. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination with
    an effective date of August 2017. The total purchase consideration amounted to US$123m representing the fair value
    of the group's previously held equity interest in Takealot. A gain of US$20m has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains
    on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the remeasurement of the group's previously held equity
    interest in Takealot to its fair value. The US$74m cash invested remains within the group following the transaction
    and is accordingly not disclosed as part of the consideration transferred by the group or assets of Takealot acquired,
    although it did affect the amount of goodwill recognised in the business combination. The purchase price allocation:
    property, plant and equipment US$13m; cash and deposits US$105m; inventories US$28m; trade and other
    receivables US$4m; intangible assets US$107m; trade and other payables US$27m; deferred tax liabilities US$30m
    and the balance of US$81m to goodwill. The main classes of intangible assets recognised in the business combination
    were trade names and brands, customer relationships and technology. The transaction gave rise to the recognition of
    non-controlling interest of US$83m, which has been measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of
    the identifiable net assets of Takealot as at the acquisition date.

    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is Takealot's market presence. The goodwill
    that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

    The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:

    In May 2017 the group invested US$426m in Delivery Hero AG (Delivery Hero), a global online food-ordering and
    delivery marketplace. On 30 June 2017, Delivery Hero successfully completed an initial public offering of its shares,
    a process during which the group invested a further US$47m. Following these investments, the group holds an 11%
    effective interest (10% fully diluted) in Delivery Hero. In June 2017 the group invested US$61m in Bundl Technologies
    Private Limited (Swiggy), the operator of a first-party food-delivery marketplace in India. Following the investment,
    the group holds a 16% effective interest (15% fully diluted) in Swiggy. The group accounts for its interests in these
    investees as investments in associates on account of its board representation.

    In May 2017 the group invested US$99m in Kreditech Holding SSL GmbH (Kreditech), a provider of consumer lending
    and financial services. The group has also committed to provide convertible loan funding of up to EUR20m to Kreditech
    in future. Following the investment, the group holds a 38% effective interest (31% fully diluted) in Kreditech. The group
    accounts for its interest in Kreditech as an investment in an associate.

    During May 2017 the group invested US$132m in its associate MakeMyTrip Limited (MakeMyTrip) as part of a funding
    round. In August and September 2017, following MakeMyTrip's issue of share options to its employees, the group
    invested US$23m to maintain its relative shareholding. Following these transactions, the group holds a 43% effective
    interest (40% fully diluted) in MakeMyTrip.

    The group invested US$71m for an additional interest in its associate Flipkart Limited (Flipkart) in April 2017. The
    additional interest was acquired from existing shareholders of Flipkart. Flipkart undertook various funding rounds
    during the reporting period in which the group did not participate. These funding rounds resulted in a dilution of the
    group's interest in Flipkart and in the recognition of an aggregate net dilution gain of US$11m in ""Dilution losses on
    equity-accounted investments"" in the income statement. Following the dilutions, the group holds a 14% effective
    interest (13% fully diluted) in Flipkart.

    The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:

    During May 2017 the group disposed of its investment in its joint venture Souq Group Limited for a consideration of
    US$173m. A gain on disposal of US$89m has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in
    the income statement following the transaction.

    In September 2017, following the receipt of regulatory approval, the group distributed the majority of its shareholding
    in Novus Holdings Limited (Novus) to its shareholders. The group recognised the distribution as an in specie dividend,
    reducing retained earnings by US$69m, being the fair value of the distributed Novus shares. A loss on disposal of
    US$145m has been recognised in ""(Losses)/gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following
    the distribution, being the difference between the fair value of the distributed Novus shares and the book value of
    the assets distributed as well as the reclassification of reserves of US$112m. After the distribution, the group holds a
    19% shareholding in Novus and accounts for its interest as an available-for-sale investment.

12. Issue of listed bond

    The group issued a 10-year US$1bn international bond in July 2017. The bond matures in July 2027 and carries a fixed
    interest rate of 4.85% per annum. The proceeds were partially utilised to repay the group's US$700m international
    bond which matured in July 2017. The remaining proceeds will be utilised for general corporate purposes, including
    acquisitions.

13. Financial instruments

    The group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks such as market risk (including currency risk, fair-value
    interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 

    The condensed consolidated interim report does not include all financial risk management information and
    disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group's annual
    financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017. There have been no material changes in the group's credit,
    liquidity, market risks or key inputs used in measuring fair value since 31 March 2017.

    The fair values of the group's financial instruments that are measured at fair value at each reporting period, are
    categorised as follows:
                                                                            Fair-value measurements at

    Currency devaluation features relate to clauses in content acquisition agreements that provide the group with
    protection against significant currency devaluations. The fair value of currency devaluation features is measured
    through the use of discounted cash flow techniques.

    The fair value of shareholders' liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Business-specific
    adjusted discount rates are applied to estimated future cash flows.

    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance criteria will
    be met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified earn-out payments are used.
    Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments. The fair value of
    level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in active markets and interest rate
    extracts from observable yield curves.

16. Pro forma financial information

    The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics on a constant currency, organic basis
    (the pro forma financial information) in the tables below. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility
    of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers Limited and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information
    presented on a pro forma basis has been extracted from the group's management accounts, the quality of which
    the board is satisfied with.

    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that it has been
    extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes
    in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange
    rates and changes in the composition of the group on its results for the periods ended 30 September 2017
    and 30 September 2016 respectively. The following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma
    financial information:

Independent auditor's review report on interim financial statements

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF NASPERS LIMITED

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited in the accompanying
interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2017 and
the related condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows for the six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes 1 to 15.

Directors' responsibility for the interim financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting
Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial
Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review in
accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with
the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and
applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these interim
financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited for the six months ended 30 September 2017 are not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim
Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and
Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies
Act of South Africa.

Other matter

We have not reviewed future financial performance and expectations expressed by the directors included in the
commentary in the accompanying interim financial statements and accordingly do not express an opinion thereon.

INCREASED STAKE IN DELIVERY HERO

Naspers today announced a transaction to obtain 22,359,857 shares in Delivery Hero (FRA:
DHER.GR) from Rocket Internet (FRA: RKET.GR) for €660m (US$775m) at a price of €29.50 per
share.

The additional 13% stake increases Naspers’s shareholding to 23.6% and positions the group
as the largest shareholder in Delivery Hero.

Growing its position in online food ordering and delivery is consistent with Naspers’ strategy
to invest in platforms with global potential that offer online marketplace services in high-
growth markets. The increased stake in Delivery Hero adds to the group’s investments in
iFood in Latam and Swiggy in India.

Founded in February 2008 and listed in June 2017, Delivery Hero offers online food delivery
services across more than 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East & North Africa (MENA),
Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. It also operates its own last-mile food delivery
primarily in more than 50 high-density urban areas around the world.

The online food delivery sector is still underpenetrated and growing rapidly across the world.
Delivery Hero is already the leading online food ordering and delivery marketplace in most of
the countries in which it operates and Naspers’ increased investment is due to its confidence
in the long-term prospects of the company.

Many markets have experienced significant traction already, but the potential in high-growth
markets is expected to be greater than that observed in the West.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, will be funded from existing resources, and
is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.

1.   Introduction

Naspers “N” and “A” shareholders (“Naspers Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released on SENS on
5 September 2017 (“Detailed Announcement”) in terms of which Naspers Shareholders were advised that the
Company will unbundle 151,786,287 Novus Holdings Limited (“Novus”) shares (“Unbundled Novus Shares”) to
Naspers Shareholders (“Unbundling”).

Under the terms of the Detailed Announcement, eligible Naspers Shareholders (which term excludes certain foreign
shareholders affected by the laws of their relevant jurisdiction) were entitled to receive the Unbundled Novus Shares in
the intended ratio of 0.34588 Novus shares and 0.06918 Novus shares for every one Naspers N share and every one
Naspers A share respectively held at the close of business on the Unbundling record date on 22 September 2017.

A number of such foreign shareholders elected to follow procedures that allowed them to receive Unbundled Novus
Shares, notwithstanding the exclusion referred to above. On 22 September 2017, Link Market Services South Africa
Proprietary Limited, notified Naspers that a number of foreign Shareholders (the “Sellers”) had indicated their inability

APPORTIONMENT OF TAX COST FOR SOUTH AFRICAN INCOME TAX PURPOSES IN RESPECT OF
THE UNBUNDLING


1. Introduction

Naspers “N” shareholders (“Naspers Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released on SENS
on 5 September 2017 in terms of which Naspers Shareholders were advised that the Company will
unbundle 151,786,287 Novus Holdings Limited (“Novus”) shares to Naspers Shareholders (“Unbundling”).

Naspers Shareholders are hereby advised that the Unbundling was implemented in terms of section 46 of
the Companies Act No 71 of 2008 and section 46 of the Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 (“Income Tax Act”).

The purpose of this announcement is to notify Naspers Shareholders of the apportionment ratio to be
applied by Naspers Shareholders in determining the portion of their existing expenditure and/or market
value (if relevant) to be allocated to the unbundled Novus shares whilst the balance of these costs will still
be reflected in respect of the retained Naspers “N” shares.

2. Apportionment tax principles

Naspers Shareholders will have a combined expenditure in respect of the Naspers “N” shares and the
Novus shares received pursuant to the Unbundling.

Naspers “N” shares held as trading stock:

Any Naspers Shareholder holding Naspers “N” shares as trading stock will be deemed to acquire the
unbundled Novus shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure (for purposes of income tax) of such
Naspers and Novus shares will be the amount originally taken into account by the Naspers Shareholder in
respect of those Naspers “N” shares, as contemplated in section 11(a), section 22(1), or section 22(2) of
the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure to be allocated to the unbundled Novus
shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the market value of the Novus shares bears to the sum
of the market value of Naspers and Novus shares as at the end of the day after the last day to trade, being
20 September 2017. The expenditure so allocated to the unbundled Novus shares will reduce the
expenditure relating to the Naspers “N” shares so retained.

Naspers shares held as capital assets:

Any Naspers Shareholder holding Naspers “N” shares as capital assets will be deemed to acquire the
unbundled Novus shares as capital assets. The combined expenditure of such Naspers and Novus shares
will be the original expenditure incurred in respect of the Naspers “N” shares, in terms of paragraph 20 of
the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and where the Naspers “N” shares were acquired before
October 1 2001, also the market value, (where relevant), adopted or determined as contemplated in
paragraph 29 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

The portion of the above combined expenditure and/or market value to be allocated to the unbundled Novus
shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the market value of the Novus shares bears to the sum
of the market value of Naspers and Novus shares at the end of the day after the last day to trade, being 20
September 2017.The expenditure and/or market value, as the case may be, so allocated to the unbundled
Novus shares will reduce the expenditure and/or market value of the Naspers “N” shares that are retained.

Naspers Shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the unbundled Novus shares on the date on which
the Naspers “N” shares were originally acquired.

Naspers Shareholders are advised to consult their own professional tax advisors should they have any
queries regarding the taxation consequences of the Unbundling and the calculation of their costs for
taxation purposes.

3. Apportionment ratio

Naspers Shareholders are hereby advised that the expenditure and market value, as the case may be, of
their Naspers “N” shares as referred to above must be apportioned in the ratio of 99.80861% to a Naspers
“N” share held after the Unbundling and 0.19139% to an unbundled Novus share (“Apportionment Ratios”).

The Apportionment Ratios are based on the closing price of R2 972.44 per Naspers “N” share and R5.70
per Novus share on 20 September 2017.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE TAX
IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNBUNDLING. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE
CONSIDERED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. NASPERS SHAREHOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO

AND THE CALCULATION OF THEIR COSTS FOR TAXATION PURPOSES.

Unbundling of Novus Holdings Limited Shares to Naspers Shareholders,5 Sep 2017,"NPN 201709050044A
Unbundling of Novus Holdings Limited Shares to Naspers Shareholders

Naspers Limited
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
Registration number: 1925/001431/06
Share code: NPN
ISIN: ZAE000015889
(“Naspers”)

UNBUNDLING OF NOVUS HOLDINGS LIMITED SHARES TO NASPERS SHAREHOLDERS

1.   Background and rationale for the Unbundling
     1.1. Naspers “N” and “A” shareholders (“Naspers Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released on
          SENS on 3 August 2017 in terms of which Naspers Shareholders were advised that the Competition Tribunal
          had approved the merger filing by Media24 Proprietary Limited (“Media24”) concerning the change of control
          in Novus Holdings Limited (“Novus”) (“Merger Filing”). The Merger Filing includes a condition that Media24
          divest itself of the majority of its shareholding in Novus whilst permitting Media24 to retain a non-controlling
          minority stake in Novus of 19% (“Merger Condition”).
     1.2. Media24 has subsequently approved the unbundling of the majority of its shareholding in Novus, being
          151,786,287 Novus shares (“Unbundled Novus Shares”), to Naspers.

2.   Further details of the Unbundling
     2.1. In order to comply with the Merger Condition, the Naspers board of directors has resolved to unbundle all of
          the Unbundled Novus Shares it receives from Media24 to Naspers Shareholders (“Unbundling”) by way of
          a distribution in specie in terms of section 46(1)(a)(ii) of the South African Companies Act, 2008 (“Companies
          Act”) and section 46 of the South African Income Tax Act, 1962 (“Income Tax Act”).
     2.2. The Unbundled Novus Shares will be unbundled in the intended ratio of 0.34588 Novus shares and 0.06918
          Novus shares for every one Naspers N share and every one Naspers A share respectively (“Unbundling
          Ratio”) held at the close of business on the Unbundling record date (“Record Date”).
     2.3. Accordingly, Media24 will first distribute the Unbundled Novus Shares to Naspers following which Naspers
          will unbundle the Unbundled Novus Shares on the terms as set out in this SENS announcement to Naspers
          Shareholders.

3.   Implementation of the Unbundling
     3.1. Naspers Shareholders, who hold their “A” and “N” Naspers shares (“Naspers Shares”) in certificated format,
          (“Certificated Naspers Shareholders”) will be issued their respective Unbundled Novus Shares in
          certificated form. Pursuant to the Unbundling, share certificates will be posted, at the risk of the Certificated
          Naspers Shareholders, by registered post in South Africa on about the first business day after the Record
          Date (“Operative Date”) to the addresses reflected in the share register of Naspers on the Record Date.
     3.2. Such Certificated Naspers Shareholders are advised that they will have to dematerialise the Unbundled
          Novus Shares received by them in certificated form prior to trading in such Novus shares on the JSE Limited
          (“JSE”).
     3.3. Naspers Shareholders, who hold their Naspers Shares in dematerialised format (“Dematerialised Naspers
          Shareholders”) will have their accounts at their Central Securities Depository Participant (“CSDP”) or broker
          updated on the Operative Date with the relevant Unbundled Novus Shares pursuant to the Unbundling.
     3.4. Documents of title in respect of Naspers Shares (“Documents of Title”) are not required to be surrendered
          in order to receive the Unbundled Novus Shares.
     3.5. To the extent that Certificated Naspers Shareholders wish to received their Unbundled Novus Shares in
          dematerialised format, those Naspers Shareholders should contact Link Market Services Proprietary Limited
          (“Transfer Secretaries”) directly.

4.   Fractional entitlements
     4.1. Where a Naspers Shareholder’s entitlement to Unbundled Novus Shares distributed in terms of the
          Unbundling, calculated on the basis of the Unbundling Ratio, results in a fractional share entitlement, such
          fraction of an Unbundled Novus Share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, resulting in
          allocations of whole Unbundled Novus Shares and a cash payment will be made to the Naspers Shareholder
          for the fraction.
     4.2. The applicable cash payment will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price
          (“VWAP”) of an Unbundled Novus Share traded on the JSE on the first business day after the last day to
          trade in Naspers Shares in order to participate in the Unbundling (“LDT Date”), (being the day on which
          Naspers Shares begin trading “ex” the entitlement to receive the Unbundled Novus Shares), discounted by
          10%. The basis for the applicable cash payment will be announced on SENS two business days after the
          LDT Date.
     4.3. For illustrative purposes, this SENS announcement assumes the VWAP of an Unbundled Novus Share
          traded on the JSE on the first business day after the LDT Date to be 725 cents. The basis for the applicable
          cash payment would therefore be 653 cents (725 cents discounted by 10%).
     4.4. Example of fractional entitlement:
          This example assumes that a Naspers Shareholder holds 100 Naspers N shares at the close of business on
          the Record Date.
          Unbundled Novus Share entitlement = 100 x 0.34588 (being the Unbundling Ratio for Naspers N shares) =
          34.588 Unbundled Novus Shares. The rounding provision described above is then applied and the
          Shareholder will receive:
          34 Unbundled Novus Shares in respect of the 100 Naspers N shares held and a cash payment for the
          fractional entitlement based on the 653 cents noted above of 653 x 0.588 = 384 cents.

5.   Distributions to foreign Naspers Shareholders
     5.1. The distribution of Unbundled Novus Shares to persons resident in jurisdictions outside of South Africa
          (“Foreign Naspers Shareholders”) in terms of the Unbundling may be affected by the laws of such Foreign
          Naspers Shareholders’ relevant jurisdiction. Those Foreign Naspers Shareholders should consult their
          professional advisers as to whether they require any governmental or other consent or need to observe any
          other formalities to enable them to take up their entitlements.
     5.2. This paragraph sets out the restrictions applicable to Naspers Shareholders who have registered addresses
          outside South Africa, who are nationals, citizens or residents of countries other than South Africa, or who are
          persons (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) who have a contractual or legal
          obligation to forward this document to a jurisdiction outside South Africa or who hold shares for the account
          or benefit of any such Foreign Naspers Shareholder.
     5.3. It is the responsibility of any Foreign Naspers Shareholder (including, without limitation, nominees, agents
          and trustees for such persons) being notified by this SENS announcement of the Unbundling and wishing to
          take up their entitlement to Unbundled Novus Shares to satisfy themselves as to the full observance of the
          applicable laws of any relevant territory, including obtaining any requisite governmental or other consents,
          observing any other requisite formalities and paying any issue, transfer or other taxes due in such territories.
     5.4. Foreign Naspers Shareholders are obliged to observe the applicable legal requirements of their relevant
          jurisdictions.
     5.5. Notification in terms of this SENS announcement will not constitute an offer of Unbundled Novus Shares in
          those jurisdictions in which it would be illegal to make such an offer and, in those circumstances, this SENS
          announcement, will only be for information purposes. No person being notified in terms of this SENS
          announcement in any territory, other than South Africa, may treat the same as constituting an offer to such
          person unless, in the relevant territory, such an offer could lawfully be made to him without contravention of
          any registration or other legal requirements.
     5.6. Accordingly, persons (including, without limitation, nominees, agents and trustees) being notified in terms of
          this SENS announcement should not distribute or send the same to any person in, or citizen or resident of,
          or otherwise into any jurisdiction where to do so would or might contravene local securities laws or
          regulations. Any person who does distribute this SENS announcement into any such territory (whether under
          a contractual or legal obligation or otherwise) should draw the recipient’s attention to the contents of this
          paragraph.
     5.7. Naspers reserves the right, but shall not be obliged, to treat as invalid any distribution of Unbundled Novus
          Shares, in terms of the Unbundling, which appears to Naspers or its agents to have been executed, effected
          or dispatched in a manner which may involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction
          or if Naspers believes or its agents believe that the same may violate applicable legal or regulatory
          requirements.
     5.8. An excluded Foreign Naspers Shareholder (“Excluded Foreign Naspers Shareholder”) includes any
          Foreign Naspers Shareholder who is unable to receive any of the Unbundled Novus Shares to be distributed
          to him because of the laws of the jurisdiction of that Naspers Shareholder, or any Foreign Naspers
          Shareholder that Naspers is not permitted to transfer any of the Unbundled Novus Shares to because of the
          laws of the jurisdiction of that Foreign Naspers Shareholder. The Unbundled Novus Shares to which Excluded
          Foreign Naspers Shareholders would be entitled in terms of the Unbundling may be aggregated and disposed
          of on the JSE in an orderly manner by the Transfer Secretaries on behalf of and for the benefit of Excluded
          Foreign Naspers Shareholders as soon as is reasonably practical after the implementation of the Unbundling
          at the best price that can reasonably be obtained at the time of sale.
     5.9. CSDPs will be responsible for informing the Transfer Secretaries of all dematerialised Naspers Shares held
          by them on behalf of such Excluded Foreign Naspers Shareholders.
     5.10. Excluded Foreign Naspers Shareholders will, in respect of their entitlement to the Unbundled Novus Shares,
           receive the average consideration per Unbundled Novus Share (net of transaction and currency conversion
           costs) received by the Transfer Secretaries pursuant to the sale process as set out in the preceding sub-
           paragraph. The average consideration per Unbundled Novus Share due to each Excluded Foreign Naspers
           Shareholder will only be paid once all such Unbundled Novus Shares have been disposed of.

6.   South African exchange control
     The Unbundled Novus Shares are not freely transferable from the common monetary area and must be dealt with
     in terms of the South African Exchange Control Regulations, promulgated in terms of section 9 of the South African
     Currency and Exchanges Act, 1933 (“Exchange Control Regulations”). The following is a summary of the
     Exchange Control Regulations, is not comprehensive and is intended as a guide only. In the event that Foreign
     Naspers Shareholders have any doubts in respect of their obligations in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations
     they should consult their professional advisers.
     Emigrants from the common monetary area
     6.1. The Unbundled Novus Shares received by the Foreign Naspers Shareholders who are emigrants from the
          common monetary area and whose registered address is outside the common monetary area will:
           6.1.1.   in the case of Dematerialised Naspers Shareholders be credited to their blocked share accounts at
                    the CSDP controlling their blocked portfolios; or
           6.1.2.   in the case of Certificated Naspers Shareholders whose Documents of Title have been restrictively
                    endorsed under the Exchange Control Regulations, be endorsed “Non-Resident” and will be sent
                    to the authorised dealer in foreign exchange controlling their blocked assets.
     6.2. The CSDP or broker will ensure that all requirements of the Exchange Control Regulations are adhered to in
          respect of their clients falling into this category of investor, whether shares are held in dematerialised or
          certificated form.

     All other non-residents of the common monetary area
     6.3. The Unbundled Novus Shares received by the Naspers Shareholders who are non-residents of the common
          monetary area and who have never resided in the common monetary area and whose registered address
          are outside the common monetary area will:
           6.3.1.   in the case of Dematerialised Naspers Shareholders be credited to their share accounts at the
                    CSDP controlling their portfolios; or
           6.3.2.   in the case of Certificated Naspers Shareholders whose Documents of Title have been restrictively
                    endorsed under the Exchange Control Regulations, be deposited with an Authorised Dealer in
                    foreign exchange in South Africa nominated by such Naspers Shareholder. It will be incumbent on
                    the Naspers Shareholder concerned to nominate the Authorised Dealer and to instruct the
                    nominated Authorised Dealer as to the disposal of the relevant Naspers Shares. If the information
                    regarding the Authorised Dealer is not given, the Unbundled Novus Shares will be held in trust for
                    the Naspers Shareholder concerned pending the receipt of the necessary information or instruction.
     6.4. The CSDP or broker will ensure that all requirements of the Exchange Control Regulations are adhered to in
          respect of their clients falling into this category of investor, whether held in dematerialised or certificated form.

7.   Taxation considerations relating to the Unbundling
     7.1. This paragraph is intended to provide a general guide and is not intended to constitute a complete analysis
          of the taxation consequences of the unbundling provisions in terms of South African taxation law. It is not
          intended to be, nor should it be considered as legal or taxation advice. Naspers and its advisers cannot be
          held responsible for the taxation consequences of the Unbundling and therefore, Naspers Shareholders are
          advised to consult their own taxation advisers in this regard.
     7.2. The Unbundling will constitute a disposal by Naspers of all of the Unbundled Novus Shares to the Naspers
          Shareholders. It is the intention that the disposal will be effected utilising the tax concessions provided for in
          section 46 of the Income Tax Act.
     7.3. The concessions provided for in section 46 of the Income Tax Act are outlined below:
          Disposal of Unbundled Novus Shares by Naspers
          The distribution of Unbundled Novus Shares by Naspers, in terms of the Unbundling, will be disregarded by
          Naspers in determining its taxable income or assessed loss in the tax year that the Unbundling takes place.
          On the basis that Naspers holds the Unbundled Novus Shares as capital assets, the Unbundling should not
          attract capital gains tax as levied in terms of the Eighth Schedule of the Income Tax Act (“CGT”).
          Dividends tax and returns of capital
          In terms of sections 46(5) and 46(5A) of the Income Tax Act, the distribution of the Unbundled Novus Shares
          must be disregarded in determining any liability for dividends tax and must also not be treated as a return of
          capital for the purposes of paragraph 76B of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.
          Naspers Shares held as trading stock
          Any Naspers Shareholder holding Naspers Shares as trading stock will be deemed to acquire the Unbundled
          Novus Shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure (for the purposes of income tax) of such Naspers
          Shares and Unbundled Novus Shares will be the amount originally taken into account by the Naspers
          Shareholder prior to the Unbundling in respect of those Naspers Shares, as contemplated in section 11(a),
          section 22(1), or section 22(2) of the Income Tax Act.
          The original expenditure incurred in respect of the Naspers Shares will be apportioned between the
          Unbundled Novus Shares and the Naspers Shares by applying the ratio that the market value of Unbundled
          Novus Shares bear to the sum of the market value of the Unbundled Novus Shares and the Naspers Shares
          at the end of the day after the Unbundling, being determined with reference to Naspers and Novus’ closing
          share prices on the first business day after the LDT Date. Naspers will advise Naspers Shareholders of the
          specified ratio by way of an announcement to be released on SENS on the second business day after the
          LDT Date. This ratio must be used in the determination of any profits or losses derived on any future disposals
          of the Unbundled Novus Shares or Naspers Shares.
          The expenditure so allocated to the Unbundled Novus Shares will reduce the expenditure of the Naspers
          Shares held, thus allocating the expenditure between the Naspers Shares and the Unbundled Novus Shares.
          Naspers Shares held as capital assets
          Any Naspers Shareholder holding Naspers Shares as capital assets will be deemed to acquire the Unbundled
          Novus Shares as capital assets. The original expenditure incurred prior to the Unbundling in respect of the
          Naspers Shares, that is allowable in terms of paragraph 20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act,
          and (where applicable) the CGT valuation of the Naspers Shares, as contemplated in paragraph 29 of the
          Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, will be apportioned between the Unbundled Novus Shares and the
          Naspers Shares by applying the ratio that the market value of Unbundled Novus Shares bears to the sum of
          the market values of the Unbundled Novus Shares and Naspers Shares at the end of the day after the
          Unbundling, being determined with reference to Naspers and Novus’ closing share prices on the first
          business day after the LDT Date. Naspers will advise Naspers Shareholders of the specified ratio by way of
          an announcement to be released on SENS on the second business day after the LDT Date. This ratio must
          be used in the determination of the capital gain or loss derived on any future disposals of the Unbundled
          Novus Shares or Naspers Shares.
          The expenditure (and CGT valuation, where applicable) so allocated to the Unbundled Novus Shares will
          reduce the expenditure (and CGT valuation, where applicable) of the Naspers Shares held, thus allocating
          this cost history between the Naspers Shares and the Unbundled Novus Shares.
          Naspers Shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the Unbundled Novus Shares on the date on which
          the Naspers Shares were originally acquired.

8.   Approvals
     8.1. In terms of the listing requirements of the JSE, where listed assets are unbundled, shareholder approval is
          not required per se. Accordingly, Naspers Shareholders will not be required to vote on the Unbundling.
     8.2. In addition, as the Unbundling does not constitute a section 112 disposal in terms of the Companies Act,
          Naspers Shareholders will not be required to vote on the Unbundling.
9.   Governing law
     The Unbundling will be governed by the laws of South Africa.

11. Brief overview of Novus
     Detailed information regarding Novus can be found on its website: https://novus.holdings/. For
     information purposes, Naspers has included a brief overview of Novus below from its publically available
     information.
     11.1. Novus is a market leader in the high-volume, high-quality print markets in South Africa, with very few national
           and other African competitors that can offer the same portfolio of products and services.
     11.2. Novus has ten printing plants and one tissue producing plant situated throughout South Africa. With the
           commissioning of a second tissue mill and quality enhancing equipment for the production of jumbo reel
           tissue wadding, Novus is positioned as a growing supplier of this product.
     11.3. Novus’ national network of plants allows it to attract a diverse customer base. Due to its scale, favourable
           terms can be negotiated with suppliers. New entrants to the market face high barriers to entry due to high
           capital investment, specialised skills and experience requirements.
     11.4. Clients benefit from seamless access to volume resources and extensive print and manufacturing capability
           through Novus’ modern operations across the country, providing a single source for all their requirements.
           Through the implementation of faster, more advanced technology and highly efficient, fully automated
           production processes, Novus is able to offer printing and manufacturing of a variety of high-quality products.

In his AGM address to shareholders, Koos Bekker, chair of Naspers, noted highlights as follows:


“Welcome to the many long-term investors and shareholders I see in the audience: thank you for
your generous support over many years. Which of you were shareholders when Naspers listed in
1994? And when, after the dotcom bubble bust, our share price dropped to below R12 in March
2002? The value of such long-term loyalty is that we could take risks that other companies dared
not: some of those paid off. Thank you for your support through thick and thin, through hell and
high water.


A few highlights of performance:
        •     Revenue rose 29%. So that’s how much faster the engine turned.
        •     In the view of our board, the single best benchmark for profit is core headline
              earnings, where accounting funnies are removed. Last year that grew 41% to
              US$1.75bn.
        •     Some drivers of growth stand out: firstly, our interest in listed investments
              Tencent, and to a lesser extent, Mail.ru, both companies that themselves publish
              extensive information.
        •     Secondly, growth in ecommerce. Our classified businesses – that some media
              were skeptical of – are starting to shape up nicely in several markets. And a few
              other internet segments like payments, food delivery and e-tailing hold promise if
              we can beat some tough competitors.
        •     Our video business felt the impact of economic volatility in South African and the
              oil producers in Africa. We do hope that Africa will surmount its problems and rise
              as a great continent.
        •     Our smaller Media24 business is in the process of transferring its technology from
              print to electronic.
        •     We will ask your approval to list the annual gross dividend by 12% to R5.80 per
              listed N ordinary share. A fifth of that per unlisted A ordinary share.


                                                                                                  
Some comments on the environment:


         •     Around the world, Naspers competes against the likes of Google, Facebook and
               Amazon – all many times our scale. However, regulators in some markets still
               think in terms of setting up competitors in each sector in their country. That’s not
               how things work anymore: we are competing against monsters from California.
               Please support us because we create employment locally!
         •     We also pay taxes locally. Last year we paid US$825 million (or R10 billion rand) to
               various countries where we do business – five times the amount we distributed to
               shareholders in dividends. I repeat: five times.
         •     Across 120 countries and markets, millions of people are using our services to
               improve their quality of life.      Sometimes we entertain or inform families,
               sometimes we enable people to communicate or to trade with each other.


The corporate climate for public companies is also changing, and not always for the better. For
example, our practices are now rated by agencies some of whom never visit us, never ran
internet or media companies themselves, but compare our various ratios off the shelf with those
of property companies or mines. And then several institutional investors follow their guidance
blindly. That is truly not wise.


Companies very seldom go under because of a failure of governance. The latter is a hygiene
factor: necessary but not sufficient. Most enterprises that fail were outperformed by tougher
fighters, or lost their consumers, or fell behind technologically. To use a sports metaphor: of
course Real Madrid needs governance, but washing their hands after going to the toilet doesn’t
by itself make them the best football club in the world. What really differentiates them is
Christiano Ronaldo and his mates, their relentless practice and invention: their flair and risk-
taking on the field. And if you want Ronaldo, you’re gonna pay for him. The competition for the




                                                                                                   
best engineers and entrepreneurs is fierce and expensive, but in our game without good players
you’re dead.


We have always enjoyed engaging with shareholders and getting their views, some quite useful.
May I briefly deal with 3 recurrent themes that are less productive.


            -  Firstly, for two decades we have received advice from short-term traders to buy
                back our own shares. Of course such action will spike our share price for a few
                weeks, then investors will work out that a growth company like ours consumes
                cash and can’t keep on buying back its own stock. Whereupon the share price
                will drop back. By that time, of course, the short-term operator that planted this
                idea would have long ago sold his Naspers shares and run off. And loyal long-
                term shareholders like you will be left holding the can, which can will then be
                empty of cash.


            -   A second recurrent theme is that we should sell Tencent shares. We started
                getting that advice from the day Tencent listed in 2004, at the equivalent of less
                than one HK$ (considering the later share split). Then the shares went to HK$20,
                then 100. We kept getting the same demand, even from people who had never
                visited China. For example, had we given in to that advice even 5 years ago, we
                would have sold at the equivalent of HK$ 45. Except today the price is HK$ 325.
                Fact is: each time our board evaluated Tencent, we concluded at that moment
                it’s still the best use for our money. And today we see no reason yet to change.


           -    A third and last theme is obsessing about the so-called “discount” of the Naspers
                share price to theoretical calculations of its sum-of-the-parts. If one broke up the
                company, you could instantly get more for the constituents. That would also be
                true of most composite companies like ours. But there is strength in being one
                large group rather than a series of small outfits. The best evidence: over the past
                years the big 5 tech companies in Silicon Valley far, far outperformed the
                aggregate of their small competitors. The same was true of the tech big 3 in
                China. This theoretical problem of a so-called discount need not bother the
                long-term investor. Let me give an example. If we broke up Naspers 5 years ago,
                and we then got a premium of 33% more for the various parts, each Naspers
                shareholder would have received $77 in cash. But today your Naspers share is
                worth three times more.Which would a sensible long-term investor prefer?
                And over five years hence the share will hopefully appreciate further. In short,
                your Naspers share that opened at $6 on listing in 1994, had grown to $220
                today.



                                                                                                   
                         

And that’s what we are aiming for on behalf of our shareholders: long term growth. We are
really not interested in fads and funnies to make a quick buck.


Let me thus thank you with great sincerity for your constant support as long-term shareholders
over many years.


We also thank our partners, our suppliers and associates around the world.


Most importantly, we deeply appreciate what our thousands of skilled people in many countries
have contributed over the past year in enthusiasm, in energy and enterprise.”

COMPETITION TRIBUNAL APPROVAL – MEDIA24: NOVUS MERGER

Naspers shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement released on 3 April 2017 in which they
were advised that the Competition Commission had recommended Media24 Proprietary Limited’s
(“Media24”) merger filing concerning Novus Holdings Limited (“Novus”) (“Merger Filing”) to the
Competition Tribunal for approval. The Merger Filing includes a condition that Media24 divest itself of the
majority of its shareholding in Novus whilst permitting Media24 to retain a non-controlling minority stake
in Novus of 19% (“Merger Condition”).

On 3 August 2017 (“Approval Date”), the Competition Tribunal approved the Merger Filing, including the
Merger Condition. Accordingly, Media24 is now required to unbundle the majority of its shareholding in
Novus to Naspers, its ultimate holding company, and thereafter to Naspers’s shareholders
(“Unbundling”).

In terms of the Merger Condition, Media24 is required:
-    within 20 business days from the Approval Date, to lodge any amendments required to its
     Memorandum of Incorporation (“MOI”) to give effect to the Unbundling with the Companies and
     Intellectual Property Commission (""CIPC""); and

-    within 40 business days after the amended MOI has been approved by CIPC, to implement the
     Unbundling.

The Company is announcing a ratio change on its American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”)
programme from ten (10) ADRs representing one (1) Class N ordinary share to the new
ratio of five (5) ADRs representing one (1) Class N ordinary share.

affected by this change.

Effective 11 August 2017, holders of ADRs will be required on a mandatory basis to

Summarised consolidated financial results
for the year ended 31 March 2017

COMMENTARY
Naspers produced positive results for the year
to 31 March 2017. Tencent delivered strong
earnings, while the group continued to scale its
ecommerce businesses. Video entertainment has
become both more mature and more competitive.
Against this backdrop, core headline earnings
grew 41% to US$1.8bn.

The internet segment expanded, particularly
in classifieds, payments and travel, which all
achieved solid traction. These businesses were
further strengthened during the year by additional
investments to scale and grow, including mobile
app-only classifieds platform, letgo, acquiring
Citrus Pay in the Indian online-payments market
and merging the group's ibibo platform with
MakeMyTrip in India. On the back of contributions
from Tencent and ecommerce, group revenue
(measured on an economic-interest basis) grew
19% to US$14.6bn (or 29% in local currency,
adjusted for acquisitions and disposals).

The video-entertainment segment continued
to face the effects of weakened African currencies
and higher content costs. This translated into a
marginal decrease in year-on-year revenue and
significant pressure on profitability, although
the business recorded strong subscriber growth,
particularly outside South Africa.

Foreign currencies affect the group's segments
to varying degrees. In video entertainment, weak
currencies have a large impact on earnings
(given pricing in local currencies, but a high
US dollar cost base). In the internet segment,
the impact is lessened by the geographic
dispersion of the businesses and a cost base
generally denominated in local currencies.

Where relevant in this report, we have adjusted
amounts and percentages for the effects of
foreign currency, as well as acquisitions and
disposals. These adjustments (pro forma
financial information) are quoted in brackets
after the equivalent metrics reported under
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). A reconciliation of pro forma financial
information to the equivalent IFRS metrics
is provided in note 16 of these summarised
consolidated financial results.

The following financial commentary and
segmental reviews are prepared on an
economic-interest basis (including consolidated
subsidiaries and a proportionate consolidation
of associated companies and joint ventures),
unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Consolidated revenue (thus excluding
equity-accounted companies) increased 3%
(13%), mainly due to strong performances by the
ecommerce businesses which grew 11% (32%).
Significant disposals during the year, notably
the Allegro business in Poland and the Czech
ecommerce units, Netretail and Heureka, reduced
revenues. In addition, the merger of the online
travel business, ibibo, with MakeMyTrip in January
2017 resulted in the group's travel investment no
longer being consolidated. From the 2018 financial
year, the group will equity-account for its share
of the results of MakeMyTrip, given its 40%
shareholding in the merged business.

Consolidated development spend was up 22%
(13%) to US$861m as letgo, Showmax and
the travel business accelerated their growth.
Total aggregate development spend on these
businesses was US$427m. Excluding the
stepped-up investment in these businesses,
development spend decreased by 16% as several
ecommerce businesses, including classifieds
and the business-to-consumer (B2C) operations,
improved profitability.

Group trading profit, measured on an economic-
interest basis, rose 22% (37%) to US$2.7bn. This
was driven by strong growth from Tencent as well
as contracting trading losses in the B2C business,
offset by higher development spend and an
operating loss from the sub-Saharan African
video-entertainment business.

IFRS operating losses were higher at US$360m,
mainly due to the effects of currency weakness
and higher content costs in the video-
entertainment segment.

The group's share of equity-accounted results
increased 42% year on year to US$1.8bn.
This includes once-off gains of US$381m and
impairment losses of US$268m recognised by
associates and joint ventures. The contribution
to core headline earnings by associates and joint
ventures was up 50% to US$2.4bn after adjusting
for these non-recurring items.

Net interest expense on borrowings was down
17% to US$142m, due to lower utilisation of credit
facilities and, to a lesser extent, cash retained
from the US$3.2bn Allegro disposal. Consequently,
the group was in a net cash position of US$1.1bn
at year-end.

The combination of higher development spend
and lower profit contribution from the video-
entertainment business resulted in consolidated
free cash outflow of US$125m. These effects were
partially offset by higher dividend income from
Tencent and improved working capital.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed
or reported on forecasts included in the
summarised consolidated financial results.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
Solid growth was evidenced in this segment with
revenues up 29% (41%) year on year to US$10.6bn.
Fuelled in particular by excellent results from
Tencent and increased profitability of the more
mature ecommerce assets, overall internet segment
trading profits increased 52% (65%) to US$2.5bn.
At year-end, this segment contributed 73% of total
Naspers revenue measured on an economic-interest
basis, an increase from 67% last year.

Ecommerce
Ecommerce growth saw revenues 11% (27%)
higher at US$2.9bn. Trading losses increased 5%
year on year, as the group invested to scale letgo
and continued expanding the hotels segment
of the online travel business. The group now
has 21 profitable businesses in ecommerce,
excluding those disposed of during the year,
delivering US$699m in revenues and US$229m
in trading profits.

Classifieds performed well, growing revenues by
96% (64%) to US$426m. In Russia, Avito generated
firm revenues in the first full year of consolidating
its results. Growth also accelerated in European
markets, led by Poland, Ukraine, Romania and
Portugal due to increased levels of monetisation.

In May 2016 the US operations of letgo were
merged with Wallapop, and shareholders invested
a collective US$100m in the combined business.
Following lively user engagement after the merger,
an additional US$175m was raised to solidify
letgo's competitive position. Results to date are
encouraging and investment in the US market and
elsewhere will continue for several years.

Solid progress was made in other classifieds
markets as OLX invested to improve its mobile
product offerings and drive synergies across
product and technology platforms. Excluding
letgo, trading losses declined significantly.

In B2C, revenue growth was fuelled by eMAG,
which improved revenue by 35% and increased
market share in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
In Romania, which accounted for the bulk of
eMAG's revenues, the growing private-label
business delivered firm margins and the company
improved cash flow from working capital
management.

The group's Indian etail associate, Flipkart,
remains a large opportunity, with market
estimates expecting the online retail market in
India to reach US$50bn by 2020. Competition has
intensified in the past year, with Amazon gaining
market share in the early part of the year. Flipkart
has maintained its leadership position, with recent
market share trends suggesting gains.

Two further significant transactions took place
with respect to the group's equity-accounted etail
investments. In March 2017 the group signed an
agreement for the sale of its interest in Souq, in
the Middle East, to Amazon. In April 2017, post
year-end, the group agreed to invest US$73m in
Takealot, subject to regulatory approval.

In January 2017 the group concluded the merger
of its online travel businesses ibibo and redBus
with Nasdaq-listed MakeMyTrip, creating India's
leading online travel business. Post merger,
Naspers holds a 40% fully diluted stake in
MakeMyTrip. To fund further expansion, the group
invested an additional US$132m in MakeMyTrip
after year-end.

In Poland the disposals of Allegro and Ceneo
concluded in January 2017, generating net
proceeds of US$3.2bn. These businesses
contributed revenue of US$327m and a trading
profit of US$137m to the results for the year.

The payments business generated lively revenue
growth of 33% (32%) year on year. Six markets
served by PayU recorded operational growth
of over 50%. Total payments volume exceeded
US$16bn, up 36% on last year, with over 400m
transactions processed over the period.

The acquisition of Citrus Pay in India
consolidated PayU's position and will allow it to
build a franchise in ecommerce while growing
vertical market positions in the airline and
telecommunications industries.

After year-end, PayU invested EUR110m in
Kreditech - a leading technology group for digital
consumer credit. This transaction combines
PayU's strong international footprint with
Kreditech's technology to bring innovative credit
services to underserved markets.

As previously reported, Naspers Ventures - tasked
with identifying new growth opportunities for
the group - made a number of investments in
educational technology companies.

Movile's subsidiary, iFood, the Latin American
online food-delivery business operating mainly
in Brazil, made excellent progress with order-
number growth accelerating 164% year on year.
iFood revenues grew 229% and trading profit
156%. The group's online food-delivery portfolio
was strengthened after year-end by a EUR387m
investment in Delivery Hero, the largest online
food-delivery company by orders globally.

Tencent
For the year ended December 2016 Tencent's
revenues were RMB151.9bn, up 48% year on year.
Non-GAAP profit attributable to shareholders
(Tencent's measure of normalised performance)
grew 40% to RMB45.4bn.

QQ and Weixin reinforced their positions as the
ubiquitous social platforms for users in China to
communicate, socialise, and enjoy online content
and services. Weixin continued to develop as a
'super app', with monthly active users on Weixin
and WeChat up 28% to 889m. Tencent launched
several successful self-developed and licensed
games and expanded its position as a leading
global game company by investing in companies
such as Supercell and Paradox. The popularity of
its digital-content platforms and number of paying
users grew well.

Looking ahead, Tencent will focus on delivering
superior experiences to its users and creating
business opportunities for its ecosystem partners
by implementing its 'connection' strategy.
Heavy investment in innovative, cutting-edge
technologies (including cloud services and artificial
intelligence) and partnerships will continue as
Tencent positions itself for long-term growth.

Extensive information on Tencent's results is
available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru's revenue for the year to December 2016
was up 15% to RUB42.8bn, including the results
of newly acquired Pixonic and Delivery Club
(the online food-ordering business in Russia).
Key revenue drivers were online games and
advertising. Warface remains Mail.ru's largest
game, followed by War Robots from Pixonic.
Mail.ru recorded strong advertising-revenue
growth in mobile, especially from VKontakte and
in-feed native formats.

Group aggregate segment EBITDA (Mail.ru's
measure of normalised performance) was down
1% to RUB17.9bn, mainly due to a non-recurring
value-added tax charge.

Towards the end of its financial year, Mail.ru made
a number of acquisitions aimed at expanding its
ecosystems and leveraging its user base, most
notably Pixonic and Delivery Club. These have the
potential to sustain long-term revenue growth and
profitability.

More information on Mail.ru's results is available
at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Video entertainment
Last year tough economic conditions led to
significant churn in subscribers, but 2017 saw a
return to modest growth. A value strategy was
successful at expanding the business over the
long term. This focused on bouquet restructuring
and reduction of non-performing content, holding
subscription prices steady in key markets, better
customer focus and retention, reducing set-top
box prices and rightsizing operations. These
initiatives resulted in net direct-to-home (DTH)
subscriber growth of 935 000 homes, compared
to 38 000 last year. A total of 597 000 digital
terrestrial television (DTT) subscribers were
added to the base, bringing the combined closing
base (DTT and DTH) to 11.9m households at
year-end. The DTT business continued to grow,
despite analogue switchoffs not being mandated
as anticipated. Development of the DTT content
offering and improved retention capabilities
contributed to solid growth over the year.
As a result, this business will not be included in
development spend in future.

At a macroeconomic level, muted economic
growth and continued currency weakness,
contributed to video-entertainment revenues
declining marginally year on year to US$3.4bn
(but increasing 7% after excluding the impact of
foreign exchange). Content costs lifted due to
increased competition, and the business is
responding by removing or renegotiating non-
essential content. Trading profit of US$287m
declined 53% (32%) year on year due to the impact
of currency weakness in the main operating
markets, where customers are billed in local
currency but the bulk of the cost base is US dollar
denominated. Given the high fixed-cost base,
continued subscriber growth is key to improving
profitability.

Liquidity in Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique remained 
constrained with limited availability of foreign currency. 
At year-end, we had cash balances of US$289m in these 
countries that are exposed to currency depreciation. We
were able to extract US$133m up to 31 March 2017.
Subsequent to year-end, we have extracted a
further US$113m up to 31 May 2017.

The subscription video-on-demand (SVOD)
service, Showmax, completed its first full year
of operations, culminating in its launch in
Poland in February 2017. Showmax is now fully
localised in South Africa, Kenya and Poland and
available in over 60 other countries. Consolidated
development spend for the video entertainment
segment was US$102m (2016: US$85m) - up 20%
year on year. Increased investment in Showmax
was offset by scaling of the DTT platform.

Regulations in the video-entertainment business
are under constant review and we continue to
engage with regulators across the continent.

Media
Although substantial growth of 14% (16%) was
recorded in the ecommerce and digital segments of
our media businesses, overall revenues decreased
by 3% (1%) to US$588m. Besides ongoing challenges
from structural changes in the print media
industry, the segment also continues to face tough
macroeconomic conditions due to a weak South
African rand. Consumer spending was subdued
and, as a consequence, subscription and advertising
income. The focus remains on restructuring the
mature print businesses, migrating audiences to
digital platforms and scaling ecommerce interests
while containing costs.

Prospects
During the 2018 financial year the group will
keep scaling its ecommerce businesses to drive
profitability and cash generation. The focus
for the more mature businesses - media and
video entertainment - will be on managing
macroeconomic and sectoral headwinds through
ongoing cost containment. Competition from
global platforms across the markets where
Naspers operates is increasing and the group
will respond through continued innovation and
transformation of existing businesses, while
investing to fuel the next wave of growth.

DIVIDEND NUMBER 88
(all figures in South African cents)
The board recommends that the annual gross
dividend be increased by 12% to 580 cents
(previously 520 cents) per listed N ordinary share,
and 116 cents (previously 104 cents) per unlisted
A ordinary share. If confirmed by shareholders at
the annual general meeting on Friday 25 August
2017, dividends will be payable to shareholders
recorded in the books on Friday 15 September 2017
and paid on Monday 18 September 2017. The last
date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday
12 September 2017 (shares trade ex dividend from
Wednesday 13 September 2017). Share certificates
may not be dematerialised or rematerialised
between Wednesday 13 September 2017 and
Friday 15 September 2017, both dates inclusive.
The dividend will be declared from income
reserves. It will be subject to the dividend tax rate
of 20% (previously 15%), yielding a net dividend
of 464 cents per listed N ordinary share and 93
cents per unlisted A ordinary share to those
shareholders not exempt from paying dividend tax.
Dividend tax will be 116 cents per listed N ordinary
share and 23 cents per unlisted A ordinary share.
The issued ordinary share capital as at 23 June
2017 was 438 265 253 N ordinary shares and 907
128 A ordinary shares. The company's income tax
reference number is 9550138714.

Notes to the summarised consolidated financial results
for the year ended 31 March

1.  General information
    Naspers Limited (Naspers) is a global internet and entertainment group and one of the largest technology investors in
    the world. Founded in 1915, we now operate in more than 120 countries and markets with long-term growth potential.
    Naspers builds leading companies that empower people and enrich communities. It runs some of the world's leading
    platforms in internet, video entertainment and media.

2.  Basis of presentation and accounting policies
    The summarised consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2017 are prepared in accordance
    with the JSE Limited's (JSE) Listings Requirements (the Listings Requirements) relevant to summarised financial
    statements and the provisions of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008. The Listings Requirements require provisional
    reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the measurement and recognition requirements
    of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
    Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards
    Council, and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The
    summarised consolidated financial results do not include all the disclosures required for complete annual financial
    statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
    The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated annual financial statements, from which
    the summarised consolidated financial results were derived, are consistent with those applied in the previous
    consolidated annual financial statements.

    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective for
    financial years commencing 1 April 2016. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are effective
    for the financial year commencing 1 April 2016 had a material impact on the group.
 
    The group's reportable segments reflect the components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief
    executive officer and other senior executives who make strategic decisions. The group proportionately consolidates
    its share of the results of its associates and joint ventures in its reportable segments.

    Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based payment
    expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses
    and other gains/losses, but includes the finance cost on transponder leases.

    Core headline earnings exclude once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's
    sustainable operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

3.  Independent audit
    The summarised consolidated financial results have been audited by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers
    Inc. (PwC). The individual auditor assigned to perform the audit is Brendan Deegan. PwC's unqualified audit reports
    on the consolidated annual financial statements and summarised consolidated financial results are available
    for inspection at the registered office of the company. The auditor's report does not necessarily cover all the
    information contained in the summarised financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to
    obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's work, they should obtain a copy of that report, together with
    the consolidated annual financial statements from the registered office of the company. These documents will be
    available from the company's registered office from 23 June 2017. The consolidated annual financial statements,
    together with the integrated annual report, will be available on www.naspers.com on or about 21 July 2017.

    was recognised as a transaction separate from the business combination. This amount will be expensed in the
    income statement over the service period. The purchase price allocation: net debt US$1m; net working capital
    US$2m; intangible assets US$15m; deferred tax liability US$5m and the balance of US$105m to goodwill. The main
    classes of intangible assets recognised in the business combination were trademarks, customer bases and
    technology.

    As part of its strategy to consolidate the growing US online classifieds market, the US operations of Wallapop S.L.
    (Wallapop) were absorbed into the group's letgo business during July 2016. As consideration for the contribution of
    Wallapop's business and cash of US$45m, Wallapop was issued with a 45% interest in a newly formed entity in the
    US, with the group holding the remaining 55% interest. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
    The total deemed purchase consideration amounted to US$126m, representing the fair value of the equity interest
    issued to Wallapop. Given the early-stage nature of the business model, the transaction gave rise to the recognition of
    goodwill of US$126m. A non-controlling interest of US$45m was recognised following the business combination.

    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in these acquisitions is the acquiree's market presence.
    The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total acquisition-related costs
    of US$2m were recorded in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement regarding the above
    acquisitions.

    Since the acquisition dates of the above transactions, revenue of US$8m and net losses of US$182m have been
    included in the income statement relating to the acquired businesses. Had the revenue and net results of the acquired
    businesses been included from 1 April 2016, group revenue and net profit would have amounted to US$6.11bn and
    US$2.80bn respectively.

    The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:

    The group made its first investment targeting the education technology market by investing US$13m (23.6% fully
    diluted interest) in Brainly (May 2016), a social learning network. The group also invested US$70m (10.6% fully diluted
    interest) in Udemy (June and October 2016), an online education marketplace with over 7m students enrolled, and
    US$22m (19.2% fully diluted interest) in Codecademy (June 2016), a leading global platform focused on online coding
    education. The group accounts for these interests as investments in associates.

    In January 2017 the group merged its Indian online travel business, ibibo, with Nasdaq-listed MakeMyTrip Limited,
    in exchange for a 40% fully diluted interest in MakeMyTrip Limited. A gain on disposal of US$228m was recognised
    in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following the transaction. The group accounts for
    its interest as an investment in an associate.

    The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:

    In May 2016 the group disposed of its Czech online comparison-shopping platform, Heureka, for a cash consideration
    of US$67m, following the receipt of regulatory approval. A gain on disposal of US$61m was recognised in ""Gains on
    acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following the transaction.

    During July 2016 the group disposed of its Czech online retail and ecommerce platform Netretail for a cash
    consideration of US$102m. A loss on disposal of US$28m has been recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and
    disposals"" in the income statement.

    During January 2017, following the receipt of regulatory approval, the group concluded the disposal of Allegro pl and
    Ceneo.pl, the leading online marketplace and price comparison businesses in Poland for net proceeds of US$3.21bn.
    A gain on disposal of US$1.94bn was recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement
    following the transaction.

    Investments acquired and funding rounds participated in, were funded through the utilisation of existing credit
    facilities and proceeds received from disposals during the reporting period.

    There have been no transfers between levels 1 or 2 during the reporting period, nor were there any significant
    changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value.

    Currency devaluation features relate to clauses in content acquisition agreements that provide the group with
    protection against significant currency devaluations. The fair value of currency devaluation features is measured
    through the use of discounted cash flow techniques.

    The fair value of shareholders' liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Business-specific
    adjusted discount rates are applied to estimated future cash flows.

    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance criteria will
    be met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified earn-out payments are used.
    Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments. The fair value of
    level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in active markets and interest rate
    extracts from observable yield curves.

    forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers Limited and is
    presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been extracted from the group's
    management accounts with the quality of which the board is satisfied.

    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that it has been
    extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes in
    equity, results of operations or cash flows.

    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange
    rates and changes in the composition of the group on its results for the period ended 31 March 2017. The following
    methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:

    1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's
       results to the prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange
       rates for that period. The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency
       results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above, compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results.
       The relevant average exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) used for the group's most significant functional
       currencies, were South African rand (2017: 0.0713; 2016: 0.0721); Polish zloty (2017: 0.2516; 2016: 0.2604); Russian
       rouble (2017: 0.0159; 2016: 0.0156); Chinese yuan renminbi (2017: 0.1483; 2016: 0.1572); Indian rupee (2017: 0.0149;
       2016: 0.0152); Brazilian real (2017: 0.3061; 2016: 0.2753); and Nigerian naira (2017: 0.0035; 2016: 0.0050).

    2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of
       subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-
       accounted investments. The following significant changes in the composition of the group during the respective
       reporting periods have been adjusted for in arriving at the pro forma financial information:

Trading Statement

Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is presently finalising
its consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.

We expect core headline earnings per share to be between 33% (98 US cents) and 39%
(116 US cents) higher than the comparable period’s 298 US cents. Shareholders are
reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of
the sustainable operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-recurring and
non-operational items.

It is expected that earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2017, will be between
181% (431 US cents) and 187% (445 US cents) higher compared to the prior period’s
238 US cents.

Headline earnings per share for the year is expected to increase by between 4% (7 US
cents) and 10% (17 US cents) from the prior period’s 168 US cents.

to be released on or about 23 June 2017. Financial information on which this trading

UPDATE ON MEDIA24 PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“MEDIA24”) COMPETITION APPEAL COURT
RULING ANNOUNCEMENT

Naspers shareholders (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released by Novus Holdings
Limited (“Novus”) on SENS on 26 November 2015 in terms of which Novus shareholders were advised
that the Competition Appeal Court on 25 November 2015 upheld an appeal by Caxton and CTP Publishers
and Printers Limited (“the Appeal”). In terms of the Appeal, Media24 was required to notify the Competition
Authorities of a change of control, which arose from the implementation of the restated management
agreement dated 23 February 2015 (“Merger Filing”). The Merger Filing was filed with the Competition
Commission in February 2016.

The Competition Commission has decided to recommend the Merger Filing for approval to the Competition
Tribunal subject to the condition that Media24 divest itself of the majority of its shareholding in Novus;
permitting Media24 to retain a non-controlling minority stake in Novus of 19% (“Merger Condition”). The
Merger Condition, including the proposed 19%, remains subject to the final approval of the Competition
Tribunal. If the Competition Tribunal approves the Merger Condition, Media24 will unbundle the majority of
its shareholding in Novus to the Shareholders of Naspers, its ultimate holding company (“Unbundling”).
The Unbundling will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible after the approval date.

Naspers will provide further details of the Unbundling to Shareholders at the appropriate time.

Condensed consolidated interim report
for the six months ended 30 September 2016

COMMENTARY

Naspers had a strong six months to 30 September 2016. Operating performance, mainly driven by continued performance from the ecommerce
businesses and Tencent, is encouraging. As part of regular portfolio reviews, four notable transactions were concluded by the date of this report.
In Poland the agreed sale of the Allegro business for US$3.25bn realises a solid return on investment. The merger of the ibibo platform
with MakeMyTrip creates a leading business in the Indian travel segment. The acquisition of Citrus Pay drives consolidation in the Indian
online payments space, while the consolidation with Wallapop gives mobile-only classifieds platform, letgo, increased scale in the United States
(US). The video-entertainment segment experienced weak African currencies. However, the team delivered a pleasing return to subscriber growth, 
with subscribers closing at 11m.

Currency has again had a significant impact. Unlike the earnings effect of falling currencies on the video-entertainment segment, in ecommerce
this impact is diffused by the group's diverse geographic spread and the fact that costs are mainly incurred in local currencies. Where relevant
in this report, we have adjusted amounts and percentages for the effects of foreign currency moves as well as acquisitions and disposals.
Such adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). A reconciliation of pro forma financial information to the equivalent IFRS metrics is provided in note 15 of this
condensed consolidated interim report.

Tencent and the ecommerce businesses, excluding currency impacts, accelerated our revenue growth. Revenues were US$6.8bn on an economic-
interest basis, growing 16%. Excluding the impact of currency translation, and acquisitions and disposals, growth was 27%. In ecommerce, the
classifieds operations, ibibo, Allegro and eMAG, all improved topline growth and earnings as a result of increased scale. PayU delivered
good results across its portfolio in Eastern Europe, India and Latin America. Core headline earnings, which the board believes to be the best
measure of sustainable operating performance, was US$914m - up 31% on the prior period.

The following financial commentary and segmental reviews were prepared on an economic-interest basis (including consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associated companies and joint ventures) unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
On a consolidated basis, revenue declined marginally by 1% (up 11%), largely due to the effects of currency translation. Disposals concluded in
the first six months of the year, notably the Czech ecommerce units, Netretail and Heureka, also reduced year-on-year revenue growth.

Consolidated development spend increased 38% (42%) year on year to US$387m as new growth initiatives were pursued. This includes
letgo, predominantly operating in the US, building the hotel offering in the Indian travel business and our subscription video-on-demand
unit, ShowMax, launched in August 2015. Development spend on these new initiatives totalled US$188m. Across the rest of the portfolio,
development spend declined by US$40m, as the ecommerce businesses, particularly classifieds, increased scale and profitability.

Trading profit increased 21% (42%) to US$1.5bn, boosted by the group's share of Tencent's trading profit. Trading profit was further boosted by
a contraction in losses of etail assets and increased profitability in Allegro. A lower opening subscriber base in sub-Saharan Africa, coupled with
the effects of foreign exchange, saw video-entertainment trading profits decline some 43% (14%) to US$226m.

IFRS operating profit declined from a positive US$67m to a negative US$30m, mainly due to currency weakness in the video-entertainment
segment and increased development spend to pursue growth initiatives.

The group's share of equity-accounted results increased 44% year on year to US$912m and includes once-off gains of US$206m and impairment
losses of US$145m. Once-off gains relate primarily to dilutions of Tencent's interest in certain of its associates, and gains arising on disposals of
other investees and impairment losses relate to writedowns by Tencent of certain of its investments. The contribution to core headline earnings
by associates and joint ventures was up 47% to US$1.1bn after adjusting for these non-recurring items.

Net interest expense on borrowings was down 18% to US$74m after the repayment of the group's revolving credit facility. On 30 September 2016
net gearing stood at 13%.

Lower profitability of the sub-Saharan Africa video-entertainment business and higher consolidated development spend were the main causes
of a marginal US$1m consolidated free cash outflow.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this condensed consolidated interim report.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
Ecommerce businesses and Tencent contributed to strong growth in the internet segment with revenues of US$4.9bn - up 30% (40%) year on
year. After adjusting for the impact of currency translation and acquisitions and disposals, it is 12% better than last year's growth. Trading profits
increased 54% (71%) on the back of Tencent's performance as well as contraction of losses in many of the ecommerce businesses. The internet
segment now contributes 72% of group revenues measured on an economic-interest basis, up from 64% a year ago.

Tencent
Tencent continues to expand its ecosystem with excellent revenue and user growth recorded in the social network, online games, digital
content, advertising as well as payment platforms. Revenues were RMB67.7bn for the period, up 48% year on year.

Tencent's social networks business grew revenues through growth in mobile games and payments, and a solid 24% increase in subscribers to
its digital content subscription services. Online media platform traffic and advertising revenue continue to lift with most traffic, representing 
about 80% of revenue, now generated on mobile platforms.

Tencent implemented several strategic initiatives to advance its ecosystem and improve entertainment content for users. Tencent invested in
Supercell, the Finnish-based mobile game studio, thereby expanding its upstream presence in the global game industry. QQ Music was merged
with China Music Corporation to create a more useful online music platform. Tencent also boosted its online video offerings via 
investments in content.

During the reporting period, Tencent made good progress in building its mobile ecosystem by growing monthly active Weixin/WeChat users
by 34%. It also improved Weixin/WeChat's enterprise communications products, expanded its cloud services capabilities and simplified its
payment solutions for merchant transactions.

Mail.ru
Despite continued challenges to the Russian economy, Mail.ru revenues grew 11% year on year to RUB18.8bn. Advertising revenue, especially
that of mobile, grew as a result of higher mobile audiences and advertising inventory as well as the implementation of new advertising
technologies. The social network VK grew engagement and audiences, however, online games and internet value-added services revenues
were weaker.

Ecommerce
Volatility of emerging-market currencies reduced performance when translated to US dollars. Ecommerce businesses are growing rapidly,
with revenues increasing 14% (24%) to US$1.4bn. Trading losses declined to US$292m, a 1% (14%) improvement on the prior year. Higher
development spend on new opportunities was offset by growth in established businesses. Within this portfolio, the group now has 23 profitable
businesses - up from 18 a year ago.

Classifieds revenue grew 115% (76%) year on year, driven by strong performances across the portfolio and boosted in particular by Avito.
Excluding the investments in letgo, trading losses (and thus development spend) reduced across the classifieds portfolio as we grew and gained
market share. Solid results were evident, particularly in monetising markets.

Avito performed ahead of expectations and improved its presense in Russian ecommerce.

In May 2016 the US operations of letgo merged with the local component of Wallapop. Shareholders collectively injected US$100m into the
merged business to accelerate growth. Results to date are encouraging and further substantial investment will follow.

Growth in car, and in some markets, real estate verticals, coupled with the launch of mobile apps, combined to strengthen classifieds.

Etail revenues grew 3% (16%), powered by assets in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where online penetration is rising. Growth was lower in
etail associates, as third-party sales (where we book a take rate only) continued to grow faster than first-party sales. There was also a reduction
in subsidies and a focus on improving gross margins.

In CEE, the consolidated etail platform eMAG performed well, growing revenues year on year by 33%. Romania is approaching sustained profitability.

Amazon, on the back of heavy investment, closed the gap on Flipkart by taking significant share from Snapdeal in the Indian etail
segment. Flipkart nevertheless maintains its firm lead on the mobile app. Recent strategic initiatives delivered healthy numbers over the peak
Diwali sales period. In the Middle East, Souq continued to gain share in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while remaining the market leader in the
United Arab Emirates.

Allegro, the marketplace platform in Poland, grew revenue by 30% to US$193m. In October 2016 the group announced the sale of Allegro and
Ceneo for US$3.25bn. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in 2017.

ibibo, the Indian travel business, had an excellent six months with revenue increasing 68% (75%) to US$67m. This was fuelled by growth in hotel
room nights and a profitable air-travel business. After the reporting period the group entered into a transaction to merge ibibo with MakeMyTrip
Limited. The merger will result in a combined business that provides a one-stop shop for Indian travellers. Through a jointly owned holding
company (91% held by Naspers and 9% by Tencent), the group will have a 40% stake in the merged business as its single largest shareholder.

The group's payments business, PayU, performed well across all operating regions. Revenue grew 22% (29%) year on year to US$83m on the
same cost base. This was achieved through improved operating leverage which, in turn, was driven by transaction volumes and ticket-size
improvements. In India, PayU acquired a controlling interest in Citrus Pay after the reporting period. This will see PayU becoming a leading
payment service provider in India.

We are now identifying new pockets of long-term growth for the group in one entity, Naspers Ventures. Ventures invested in three early-stage
educational technology companies: Udemy, an online marketplace for learning; Codecademy, a leading online interactive coding platform; and
Brainly, a social learning network. Each company focuses on a different section of the education market and has an innovative approach to
increasing the utility and value of education.

Movile, the leading Latin American mobile services platform, continues to grow its offline-to-online businesses. Brazilian online food-delivery
business, iFood, expanded successfully into Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. After growing revenues by some 211% year on year, the business
turned profitable during this reporting period.

Video entertainment
Action taken in response to a weaker macroeconomic backdrop yielded positive results with the direct-to-home (DTH) business recording positive growth, 
adding some 591 968 subscribers. This is an improvement on the decline of 164 300 subscribers for the same period in the previous year. The DTT business 
also added 149 875 subscribers. The total customer base closed at 11m on 30 September 2016. 

The segment reported revenues of US$1.6bn, down 8% (up 6%) on the prior year. Trading profit declined by 43% year on year to US$226m. As the group bills 
in local currencies, the continued weakness of currencies and economies in many African countries resulted in lower US dollar revenues. A sizeable portion 
of content costs are US dollar-denominated which, coupled with the reduction in revenues and our investment in ShowMax, impacted trading profit. 
Constrictions in foreign exchange availability in Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique have resulted in cash balances of US$202m being trapped in these countries. 
These balances remain exposed to further currency depreciation.

Development spend was US$40m, down marginally year on year. This was attributable to the decrease in spend as a result of the completion
of the digital terrestrial television (DTT) rollout, offset by new investments to scale ShowMax.

ShowMax is growing steadily in a very competitive environment. It is available on all major platforms and can now be accessed through
connected Explora devices. ShowMax was also launched in a number of sub-Saharan markets.

Our focus remains on providing the best quality local and international content while managing costs, improving customer service and
retaining subscribers in an environment where there is intensifying competition from global players such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Google.
DStv Catch Up was made available to Compact customers, as well as a decoder payment plan, which boosted the uptake of our personal video
recorders (PVRs). Connecting the PVR to the internet delivers a better user experience. The 'TV everywhere' product, DStv Now, is showing
good levels of adoption across all platforms.

Management continues to engage regulators and participate in a number of regulatory reviews in various markets.

Media
Revenue in the media segment declined 13% (1%), with trading profit down 25% (31%). Although Media24 continues to face the effects
of structural declines in its traditional print business, revenue performance of its ecommerce initiatives was positive, benefiting from fresh
product offerings.

Prospects
In the second half of the financial year we hope to deliver revenue growth and scale the more established ecommerce businesses. The group
will continue to invest in long-term opportunities such as letgo, and seek further promising models within the internet segment. We expect
to accelerate letgo's development spend to further strengthen its position in the US classifieds market. In African video entertainment, a
tough environment at present, we aim to grow DTH customers by offering increased value and reducing costs to counter the impact of falling
currencies. Earnings and cash flows in this segment will continue to be constrained in the foreseeable future.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM REPORT

1.  General information
    Naspers Limited (Naspers) is a global internet and entertainment group and one of the largest technology investors in the world. Founded
    in 1915, we now operate in more than 130 countries and markets with long-term growth potential. Naspers builds leading companies that
    empower people and enrich communities. It runs some of the world's leading platforms in internet, video entertainment and media.

2.  Basis of presentation and accounting policies
    The condensed consolidated interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2016 is prepared in accordance with International
    Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
    Practices Committee, and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council as well as the requirements of
    the Companies Act of South Africa and the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.
    
    The condensed consolidated interim report does not include all the disclosures required for complete annual financial statements prepared
    in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting policies used in preparing the
    condensed consolidated interim report are consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements.
    
    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective for financial years
    commencing 1 April 2016. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are effective for the financial year commencing
    1 April 2016 are expected to have a material impact on the group.
    
    Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based payment expenses relating to
    transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses and other gains/losses, but includes the
    finance cost on transponder leases.
    
    Core headline earnings exclude once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's sustainable operating
    performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported 
    by other companies.

3.  Review by the independent auditor
    This condensed consolidated interim report has been reviewed by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., whose unqualified
    report appears at the end of the condensed consolidated interim report.

      The group recognised a loss of US$1.6m (2015: US$nil and 31 March 2016: US$87.7m) on remeasuring the net assets of businesses
      classified as held for sale to their fair value less costs of disposal during the period. The fair value of the businesses was determined based
      on third-party sales prices. This represents a level 3 fair-value measurement.

12.   Business combinations, other acquisitions and disposals
      As part of its strategy to consolidate the growing US online classifieds market, the US operations of Wallapop S.L. (Wallapop) were absorbed
      into the group's letgo business during July 2016. As consideration for the contribution of Wallapop's business and cash of US$45m, Wallapop
      was issued with a 45% interest in a newly formed entity, with the group holding the remaining 55% interest. The transaction was accounted
      for as a business combination. The total deemed purchase consideration amounted to US$126m, representing the fair value of the equity
      interest issued to Wallapop. Given the early-stage nature of the business model, the transaction gave rise to the recognition of goodwill of
      US$126m. A non-controlling interest of US$45m was recognised following the business combination.

      Various acquisitions were made within the Movile group during the reporting period. Most notably the acquisition by iFood of a controlling
      interest in Brazilian food-ordering business Hellofood Brazil and the acquisition by LBS Global Holdings of controlling interests in Optilogistics
      S.A.S., a major French specialist in transportation issues and logistics and Systems Teamwork S.R.L., a provider of software solutions and
      consulting in supply chain management. The aggregate purchase consideration in these business combinations amounted to US$8m. The purchase price 
      allocation: intangible assets US$1m, trade and other payables US$1m and with resulting goodwill of US$8m.

      The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in these acquisitions is the acquiree's market presence. The goodwill that arose is
      not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total acquisition-related costs of US$2m were recorded in ""Gains on acquisitions
      and disposals"" in the income statement regarding the above acquisitions.

      Had the revenue and net results of the businesses acquired been included from 1 April 2016, it would not have had a significant effect on
      the group's consolidated revenue or net results.

      The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:

      In May 2016 the group, through Naspers Ventures, announced its first investment targeting the education technology market by investing
      US$13m (23.6% fully diluted interest) in Brainly, a social learning network. Over 60m students in 35 countries interact with Brainly every
      month. In line with this strategy, the group also invested US$60m (8.9% fully diluted interest) in Udemy, an online education marketplace
      with over 7m students enrolled, and US$22m (19.2% fully diluted interest) in Codecademy, a leading global platform focused on online
      coding education, both during June 2016. The group accounts for these interests as investments in associates.

      In July 2016 the group acquired a 49% interest in El Cocinero a Cuerda, S.R.L., the owner and operator of online food-ordering
      platforms including Just Eat, Do Eat, and SinDelantal in Latin America for US$15m. The group accounts for its interest as an investment in
      a joint venture.

      The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:

      In May 2016 the group disposed of its Czech online comparison-shopping platform Heureka for a cash consideration of US$67m, following
      the receipt of regulatory approval. A gain on disposal of US$61m has been recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the
      income statement following the transaction.

      During July 2016 the group disposed of its Czech online retail and ecommerce platform Netretail for a cash consideration of US$102m.
      A loss on disposal of US$28m has been recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following the transaction.

13.  Financial instruments
     The group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks such as market risk (including currency risk, fair-value interest rate risk, cash
     flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

     The condensed consolidated interim report does not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in
     the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group's annual financial statements as at 31 March 2016.
     There have been no material changes in the group's credit, liquidity or market risks or in key inputs used in measuring fair value since
     31 March 2016.

     The fair values of the group's financial instruments that are measured at fair value at each reporting period are categorised as follows:

     In October 2016 the group acquired a 100% interest in Citrus Pay, a leading Indian payments technology player, for US$130m. Citrus Pay
     will form part of the Indian operations of PayU, the group's global online payment service provider.

     During October 2016 the group announced the sale of its interests in Allegro.pl and Ceneo.pl, the leading online marketplace and price
     comparison businesses in Poland, for US$3.25bn. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval with closing expected in early 2017.

     A merger of the group's Indian travel business with that of MakeMyTrip Limited, another leader in the Indian travel sector, was announced in
     October 2016. Following the merger, the group will hold a 40% stake in MakeMyTrip. The transaction is subject to approval by MakeMyTrip
     shareholders and regulatory authorities.

15.  Pro forma financial information
     The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics in local currency, excluding the effects of changes in the composition
     of the group (the pro forma financial information) in the tables below. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board
     of directors (the board) of Naspers Limited (Naspers) and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis
     has been extracted from the group's management accounts, the quality of which the board is satisfied with.

     Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that it has been extracted from
     the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or
     cash flows.

     The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and changes in the
     composition of the group on its results for the period ended 30 September 2016. The following methodology was applied in calculating the
     pro forma financial information:

     1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results to the prior
        period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates for that period. The local currency
        financial information quoted, is calculated as the constant currency results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above,
        compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates (relative to the US dollar) used for the most
        significant currencies, were: South African rand (2016: 0.0690; 2015: 0.0789); Polish zloty (2016: 0.2572; 2015: 0.2672); Russian rouble
        (2016: 0.0154; 2015: 0.017); Chinese yuan renminbi (2016: 0.1512; 2015: 0.1598); Indian rupee (2016: 0.0149; 2015: 0.0155); Brazilian
        real (2016: 0.3000; 2015: 0.2958); and Nigerian naira (2016: 0.0037; 2015: 0.0050).

     2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and equity-accounted
        investment as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-accounted investments. The following significant changes in

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the shareholders of Naspers Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited in the accompanying interim report, which 
comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2016 and the related consolidated income 
statement and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the six-months then ended, 
and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' responsibility for the interim financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard 
on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude 
whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in 
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting 
of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these interim financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial 
statements of Naspers Limited for the six months ended 30 September 2016 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting 
Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the 
Companies Act of South Africa.

Other matter
We have not reviewed future financial performance and expectations expressed by the directors included in the commentary in the accompanying 
interim financial statements and accordingly do not express an opinion thereon.

Trading Statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is presently finalising

its condensed consolidated interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2016.



We expect core headline earnings per share to be between 23% (39 US cents) and 28%

(47 US cents) higher than the comparable period’s 169 US cents. Shareholders are

reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of

the sustainable operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-recurring and

non-operational items.


It is expected that earnings per share for the six months ended 30 September 2016 will

be between 10% (15 US cents) and 15% (22 US cents) lower compared to the prior

period’s 148 US cents.
                                           


Headline earnings per share is expected to increase by between 10% (11 US cents)

and 15% (17 US cents) from the prior period’s 114 US cents.



Further details will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim report, due to be

released on or about 25 November 2016. Financial information on which this trading

statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s auditors.

MAKEMYTRIP LIMITED AND IBIBO GROUP TO COMBINE


Investors are advised that terms have been agreed for Naspers Limited’s Indian travel business, Ibibo
Group (ibibo), to enter into a transaction with Nasdaq-listed MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT),
which will combine the two businesses under MMYT to create one of the largest travel groups in
India.

Naspers and Tencent (700: Hong Kong), through their jointly-owned holding company (91% owned by
Naspers and 9% owned by Tencent), are selling 100% of ibibo to MMYT in exchange for the issuance
of new shares by MMYT. Naspers and Tencent will become the single largest shareholder in
MakeMyTrip, owning a 40% stake, and will contribute proportionate working capital upon closing.

The combination of ibibo and MMYT will bring together a bouquet of leading consumer travel brands,
including MakeMyTrip, goibibo, redBus, Ryde and Rightstay. The Transaction is expected to unlock
value for customers, supply partners and shareholders, by combining the complementary strengths
of each travel group. MMYT brings its strong brand, robust mix of domestic and outbound hotels and
packages business, and the strong position of its air ticketing business. ibibo, via its goibibo and redBus
brands, comes with strong presence in the fast-growing hotel market, bus ticket-booking segment and
a fast-growing air ticketing business.

The Transaction is expected to close by the end of December 2016, and is subject to approval by MMYT
shareholders, and regulatory approvals.

SALE OF GRUPA ALLEGRO SP. Z O.O. AND CENEO SP. Z O.O.

Naspers announces the sale of its 100% interest in Grupa Allegro Sp. z o.o. (“Allegro”) and Ceneo Sp. z o.o. (“Ceneo”), the
leading online marketplace and price comparison businesses in Poland, to funds advised by private equity firms Cinven,
Permira and Mid Europa for a total consideration of US$3.253bn.

Naspers acquired Allegro in 2008 for US$1.485bn as part of the US$1.9bn Tradus transaction. Since then Allegro
strengthened its position as the leading ecommerce and marketplace platform in Poland. It achieved substantial growth in
revenues and profits, generating US$714m in cash flows over time. Allegro’s success also helped Naspers develop a broader
ecommerce footprint in the region. Leveraging the Allegro platform, Naspers was able to build fast-growing businesses like
OLX.pl and PayU.pl, which are valuable and contributing to enhanced returns.

The decision to sell Allegro Group is consistent with the Group’s strategy to find and unlock value for shareholders. From
time to time the Group exits earlier investments to realise a return on capital invested, and Allegro is a good example of this.
Naspers remains committed to its remaining assets in Poland (OLX, PayU, Otomoto and Otodom) and will continue to develop
them with a goal to generate good returns in the future.

Naspers and Cinven, Permira and Mid Europa see the transaction as the beginning of a strong partnership; in particular, PayU
will continue to provide payment processing services to Allegro under a multi-year agreement.

The transaction is subject to approval by anti-trust authorities with closing expected before the end of fiscal 2017. Proceeds
will be used to repay debt, fund the continued scaling of ecommerce businesses, and finance new acquisitions.

In his AGM address, chairman Koos Bekker reported that Naspers delivered a solid performance
for the year against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop. He noted while shareholders had already
received copies of Naspers’s summarised financial results, these were also available on the group
website www.naspers.com.


Highlights of 2016 included:

-   In constant currency core headline earnings, a reliable indicator of sustainable
    earnings, grew 49% in dollars to US$1.2bn.

-   Revenue rose 22%, driven by strong growth especially in ecommerce and via our
    interest in Tencent.

-   With your approval, the annual gross dividend will be increased by 11% to 520c per
    listed N ordinary share, and to 104c per unlisted A ordinary share.

However, we also faced some challenges:

-   Our video-entertainment segment bore the brunt of falling commodity prices, which
    drove African currencies down. Angola and Nigeria were tough. We had to lower
    some prices to help our loyal customers.

-   The South African economy slowed.

-   We are no longer competing against local players: these days our competitors are
    Google, Facebook and Amazon, boxers many times our size and scale. Competition
    is now global, while regulators still think in terms of countries. We need to change
    their mindset.


We invested heavily in engineers, technology, content and marketing. We are proud of a
few achievements:

-   Supersport is the main funder of sport on the African continent.
-   We paid taxes of R9.8bn to various countries where we do business.
-   Our ownership profile in MultiChoice has reached the remarkable point where
    black South Africans and white South Africans now own equal percentages of the
    company. We were quite surprised when we did the latest calculation: this shows
    the country is moving faster in rebalancing ownership than previously thought.

Taking a longer view, our market capitalisation has grown from US$622m on listing in
1994 to US$73.9bn today.

We appreciate the constant support of our shareholders. We also thank our partners,
suppliers and associates around the world. Most importantly, we deeply appreciate what
our friends and employees have contributed over the past year in enthusiasm, energy and
enterprise.

COMMENTARY
Naspers delivered a satisfactory performance. Core
headline earnings (which the board regards as the best
indicator of sustainable earnings) grew 21% to US$1.2bn.
Consolidated development spend reduced 14% to US$708m.
The internet segment continued to expand. Improved
competitive positions and scale provide a foundation
for sustainable future returns. The video-entertainment
segment, however, bore the brunt of a sharp fall in
commodity prices, which weakened both African currencies
and consumer sentiment.

In the internet segment Tencent again shone on the back
of healthy mobile engagement. In classifieds, monetisation
plans are on track and resulted in a reduction in trading
losses for the core portfolio (excluding new markets,
primarily through the mobile app-only classifieds platform,
letgo). Avito is delivering ahead of plan. In etail, eMAG
expanded with improved operating leverage. Equity-
accounted etail investments Flipkart and Souq invested
more than prior years to drive revenues and improve product
offerings. PayU made progress in its payment service
provider (PSP) business, as it consolidated technology and
drove efficiencies which, in turn, reduced operating losses.
ibibo's air business turned profitable and we boosted our
investment to build a leadership position in the hotels
segment in India. In LatAm, Movile's mobile food-ordering
platform, iFood, expanded and consolidated its leadership.

In the video-entertainment segment, the South African
customer base grew by 325 000 homes despite a tough
economy. However, recently the South African rand
(SA rand) has weakened substantially and a weak
macroeconomic outlook could reduce growth and
profitability. This segment earns revenues in local currency
while incurring a major portion of costs (content and
transponder capacity) in United States dollar (US dollar).
When local currencies weaken, both margins and financial
performance thus suffer. In sub-Saharan Africa, we implemented 
substantial price increases, given the large US dollar cost base 
and weakening currencies. This combination of higher prices and 
weaker consumer sentiment resulted in a loss of 288 000 
direct-to-home (DTH) customers. To reinvigorate growth, 
the focus is now on managing costs, minimising further 
price increases to the consumer and strengthening content 
in the mid and lower segments. The digital terrestrial 
television (DTT) customer base reached 2.4m homes at year-end, 
and development spend has declined. Our new subscription 
video-on-demand service, ShowMax, recorded a good start in 
South Africa with a deeper and more customised content 
offering than competitors and a focus on service delivery.

The media segment (previously print) faced the negative
effect of structural and macroeconomic challenges on
revenue. The focus on cost containment has, however,
enabled Media24 to improve profitability while investing
further in digital and ecommerce initiatives.

As announced on 18 April 2016 and in view of the
growing international spread of its business, the group
has changed its presentation currency for financial
reporting purposes from SA rand to US dollar. In these
consolidated numbers the financial performances of our
businesses were consolidated in their respective functional
currencies and translated to US dollar. The weakness
in emerging-market currencies over the past year
means year-on-year performance was dampened by the
translation impact. Unlike the severe earnings impact of
falling currencies on the video-entertainment segment,
in ecommerce this impact is less of a concern given the
group's diverse geographic spread, plus the fact that costs
are also usually incurred in local currencies.

Where relevant in this report, we have adjusted amounts
and percentages for the effects of foreign currency and
acquisitions and disposals. Such adjustments (pro forma
financial information) are quoted in brackets after the
equivalent metrics reported under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The following financial commentary and segmental review
has been prepared on an economic-interest basis, including
consolidated subsidiaries and a proportionate consolidation
of associated companies and joint ventures.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenues grew 6% (22%) to US$12.2bn, driven by growth
from Tencent and from ecommerce on the back of revenue
growth in classifieds, travel and etail. Consolidated
revenues were US$5.9bn – down 10% year on year –
primarily due to the impact of currency translation.
Excluding currency translation, as well as the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals, consolidated revenues 
improved 11%.

Development spend, measured on an economic-interest
basis, was stable at US$961m, while consolidated
development spend reduced 14% to US$708m. Classifieds
development spend, excluding investment in new markets
through letgo, declined by a meaningful US$59m, DTT
development spend in the video-entertainment segment
reduced US$143m and consolidated etail platforms
development spend dropped US$26m, as all three
businesses continued to increase monetisation and scale.
New areas of investment include: ibibo's hotels offering;
building new classifieds markets (primarily the US) via the
mobile app-only letgo platform; ShowMax; and developing
consumer-facing offerings in PayU. Together these
accounted for development spend of US$192m. Losses
in our equity-accounted etail investments widened by
US$68m as they build their platforms and grow revenues
to outpace competition.

Trading profit increased 18% (38%) to US$2.2bn, driven
by expansion of 39% (43%) in the group's share of
Tencent's trading profit. Lower losses in classifieds and
DTT, combined with ibibo's air-travel business turning
profitable and a reduction in PayU's PSP losses as it
scales, also boosted growth. These positives were offset
by new investments discussed above and a decline in video

entertainment's profitability. With significant US dollar
costs, local currency revenues and a loss in sub-Saharan
DTH customers, trading profit in the video-entertainment
segment declined 17%.

IFRS operating profit declined from a positive US$161m to
a negative US$177m in the current year, mainly due to the
effects of currency weakness in the video-entertainment
segment and impairments, as discussed below.

The group's share of equity-accounted results was
13% lower at US$1.3bn, largely due to one-off gains of
US$498m in the prior-year figure. In the current year the
group's share of equity-accounted earnings includes one-off
gains of US$251m and impairment losses of US$180m
recognised by our associates and joint ventures. The
contribution to core headline earnings by equity-accounted
investments, adjusted for these capital items, was up 25%
to US$1.6bn.

The group recognised impairment losses of US$251m
during the year, including US$53m relating to Nigerian
equity-accounted etail investment, Konga. As reported in
the first half, the group wrote off US$140m on its Brazilian
online comparison shopping (OCS) business, Buscapé,
which faced headwinds. As announced in February 2016,
the group waived the preference share debt owed by
Welkom Yizani Investments, the largest black economic
empowerment structure in the South African print-media
industry. This gave rise to an impairment of US$29m.

The group's Czech etail and ecommerce business, Netretail,
and OCS platform, Heureka, were classified as held for sale
on 30 September 2015. At year-end, the group recognised
a writedown to fair value less costs of disposal of US$88m
for Netretail. The sale of these businesses was subject
to regulatory approval as at 31 March 2016. Subsequent
to year-end, approval was received for the Heureka sale
and we consequently recognised a gain on disposal of
approximately US$61m.

Net interest expense on borrowings rose 19% to US$170m
due to increased interest obligations after the US$1.2bn
bond issued in July 2015.

Core headline earnings increased by 21% (49%) to US$1.2bn
on the back of Tencent's contribution.

Consolidated free cash outflow of US$38m was recorded,
marginally higher year on year. Lower capital expenditure
in the video-entertainment business, a US$118m reduction
in development spend and higher dividends from associates
were offset by weaker cash flow from the sub-Saharan
Africa video-entertainment business.

Following the US$2.5bn equity raise in December 2015,
consolidated net gearing dropped to 12%. Some US$1.2bn
of the proceeds was used for the acquisition of a controlling
stake in Avito.

The company's external auditor has not audited, reviewed
or reported on any forecasts in these summarised
consolidated financial results.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Internet
The internet segment benefited from good growth in
Tencent and ecommerce to deliver revenues of US$8.2bn,
up 18% (31%) year on year. Trading profit was 38% higher
year on year at US$1.6bn.

Tencent
For the year ended 31 December 2015, Tencent revenues
were RMB102.9bn, up 30% annually. Non-GAAP profit
attributable to shareholders (Tencent's measure of
normalised performance) grew by 31% to RMB32.4bn.
Strong mobile engagement is at the core of Tencent's
continued growth. Weixin monthly active users increased
39% year on year to 697m, while mobile games and online
advertising revenues were up 53% and 110% respectively,
with mobile accounting for 65% of total advertising
revenues. The rapid adoption of Tencent's mobile wallet
has come at some cost because of subsidising bank fees.
Tencent recorded expansion of services embedded in Weixin
as use of Weixin Pay grew, as well as from services provided
by online and offline partners. Enhancements to premium
content provided via subscription services such as video and
music, boosted QQ subscription services and drove a 30%
year-on-year increase in social network revenues.

Excellent leadership, continued investment and innovation,
together with building strategic partnerships across
its businesses, position Tencent well for the long term.
More information on Tencent's results is available at
www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru's revenue for the year ended December 2015 was
up 11% to RUB36.3bn. Group aggregate segment EBITDA
– Mail.ru's measure of normalised performance – was 8%
higher at RUB18.1bn.

Improved monetisation in VKontakte and expansion of
targeted advertising were key drivers. A weaker rouble and
higher share-based compensation expenditure drove the
decline in aggregate net profit. More information on Mail.ru's
results is available at https://corp.mail.ru/en/investors/.

Ecommerce
This segment recorded a bright year. Revenue grew 6%
(24%) to US$2.6bn. The general decline in emerging-market
currencies versus the US dollar had a significant impact on
translating the segment's performance into US dollars.

The ecommerce business model relies on the continued
success of existing businesses and on integrating new
acquisitions. Continued investment to drive growth and
innovation, develop new markets and deliver superior
customer experiences resulted in development spend of
US$854m and a trading loss of US$693m.

Progress was made in the classifieds unit, which generated
strong revenue growth of 35% (46%). Naspers has
demonstrated its ability to outperform direct competitors

and gained share in India, Argentina and other markets.
Performance indicators in most businesses are trending
ahead of expectations.

We continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities,
as evidenced by an additional US$1.2bn for a controlling
stake in Avito in December 2015. Given the evolution
towards mobile, we spent US$100m on a controlling interest
in letgo, a contemporary app-only product, allowing us to
pursue new markets such as the US. The consolidation with
Wallapop in the US subsequent to year-end will give letgo
increased scale. The existing classifieds businesses have
solid mobile positions, with listings primarily from mobile
devices.

Marketplaces continued to deliver stable revenue, positive
margins (39%) and surplus cash flow (US$104m). The focus
remains on the mobile experience, expanding products
and services, and extending consumer reach. The most
recognised brand in Polish ecommerce, Allegro, has grown
from a consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace to a
predominantly business-to-consumer (B2C) third-party
(3P) marketplace, and is now transitioning to a structured
marketplace that includes first-party (1P) sellers as well.
The group concluded the sale of its Swiss marketplace business,
the Ricardo group, in September 2015 with proceeds of
CHF240m.

Etail grew revenue by 12% (27%) and remains a driver
of revenue in the ecommerce segment. This is a solid
performance given the aggressive competition in many of
our markets. A big share of the growth came from Flipkart
(India), Souq (Middle East and North Africa) and eMAG
(Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)).

eMAG, the group's consolidated consumer platform in
CEE, expanded gross margins through better supplier terms,
a more favourable category mix and additional revenue
streams such as advertising. The group's CEE fashion
business, Fashion Days, merged with eMAG towards
the end of the financial year.

Built through organic growth and selective acquisitions,
the payments business now operates under one global
brand, PayU, across 16 countries. It is organised in three
regions: Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa
(EMEA); and India. PayU reported revenue growth of 1%
(20%). In the payment services provider (PSP) area, the
focus was on consolidating and migrating technology
platforms, increased automation and creating new features.
This has allowed the PSP business to scale and reduce
losses.

Online travel in India is a business opportunity for us – the
estimated US$9bn current market size is expected to
double by 2020. Improving its position in air ticketing and
hotel bookings, our Indian online travel business, ibibo,
generated revenue of US$91m. This is 67% higher in local
currency, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals. While
registering growth ahead of competitors, ibibo's air-ticketing
business turned profitable in the review period. The priority
for ibibo is now to expand its hotel segment. Currently only

13% of hotel transactions are online. This is expected to
grow to 40% in the next two to three years, creating a large
and profitable opportunity.

ibibo's bus-ticketing business, redBus, recorded robust
revenue growth of 37% in local currency and is looking at
opportunities to expand its footprint. Given the success
of redBus in India, the ibibo team has internationalised
the platform and strategy, and launched in Singapore and
Malaysia.

Movile, a leading mobile services platform in Latin
America, exceeded expectations despite the downturn
in the Brazilian economy and a deteriorating Brazilian
real. Additional investments during the year were focused
around iFood (a leading food-delivery platform in Brazil) and
PlayKids (mobile app for children). Movile has also made
some promising investments in a number of offline-to-online
platforms in Brazil and across Latin America.

Video entertainment
The video-entertainment segment generated revenues of
US$3.4bn – down 11% (up 10%) year on year. As customers
are billed in local currencies, the rapid weakening of
currencies in many African markets, driven by a rout in
commodity prices, resulted in lower US dollar revenues.
However, costs did not decline in a similar way as a
significant portion (content and transponder capacity) is
US dollar-denominated. Increased competition for content
also pushed up costs. The combination of lower revenues
and a higher cost base saw trading profit decrease to
US$610m – down 17% on the prior year.

Consolidated development spend of US$85m
(2015: US$206m) declined year on year, due to DTT scaling
further. ShowMax and DTT in sub-Saharan Africa comprise
the bulk of the current year's development spend.

The total base closed at 10.4m customers – 185 000 net
growth year on year. Macroeconomic headwinds are likely
for a while longer. During the year ahead we will absorb the
full impact of sub-Saharan currency and customer declines,
which will continue to depress financial performance in the
near term. Our strategy is to focus on the mid and lower
segments of the market, where there is still room for growth.
Early signs from consumers after content changes and
a commitment to maintain pricing in most sub-Saharan
markets are encouraging, but the outlook remains unclear
given current volatility.

Given uncertainty related to analogue switchoffs (ASOs) –
the process of migrating terrestrial television broadcasting
from analogue to digital format – we have chosen to focus
on content, service delivery, decoder sales and retention.
ASOs in several African markets are expected to take place
in the medium term and will then boost DTT customer
growth.

Further enhancements were made to the ShowMax product
in the second half of the year. The introduction of prepaid
vouchers, download functionality and Apple AirPlay
functionality has helped ShowMax. It offers deeper and

more compelling content than both local and international
competition. International and local players continue
to invest in this market, with global online players like
Netflix launching during the year and others in the process
of doing so.

Delivering great local and international content on
multiple platforms, developing innovative products,
driving customer retention, improving the total customer
experience and driving general cost controls remain focus
areas. Enhancements, competitive pricing and introducing
bundled packages (subscriptions bundled with the Explora
and installation) have seen personal video recorder (PVR)
penetration increase to 20.6% of South African customers
and 11% of customers in the rest of Africa.

Investing in local content remains important. We are proud
to be the largest producer of and investor in local content in
Africa. Over the past year we contributed US$325m to sport
and general entertainment content.

The Eutelsat 36C satellite was successfully launched
on 24 December 2015, providing additional capacity to
MultiChoice Africa. More capacity was also acquired from
Intelsat, with a new satellite expected to be launched in the
2017 financial year.

Our operations are regulated by various bodies across
the continent. A number of competition and consumer
investigations are under way and we continue to cooperate
with regulators.

Media (previously print media)
Sectoral and macroeconomic headwinds affected
Media24's topline growth with revenues declining 20% (2%).
Year-on-year trading profit improved marginally to US$29m,
despite continued investment in new initiatives. Media24's
digital media and ecommerce businesses delivered topline
growth of 8%.

Prospects
In the year ahead, the focus will be on continuing to
deliver topline growth while scaling the more established
ecommerce businesses. Naspers will invest in long-term
growth opportunities such as ShowMax, letgo and ibibo and
seek further new promising models. In video entertainment,
the loss of DTH subscribers and falling currencies in sub-
Saharan Africa will have a significant impact on earnings
and cash flows. It could take some time before the plans
implemented to reinvigorate growth and cut costs have a
material positive impact.

DIVIDEND NUMBER 87
(all figures in South African cents)
The board recommends that the annual gross dividend be
increased by 11% to 520 cents (previously 470 cents) per
listed N ordinary share, and 104 cents (previously 94 cents)
per unlisted A ordinary share. If confirmed by shareholders
at the annual general meeting on Friday 26 August 2016,
dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the
books on Friday 16 September 2016. It will be paid on Monday
19 September 2016. The last date to trade cum dividend
will be on Tuesday 13 September 2016 (shares therefore
to trade ex-dividend from Wednesday 14 September
2016). Share certificates may not be dematerialised or
rematerialised between Wednesday 14 September 2016
and Friday 16 September 2016, both dates inclusive.
The dividend will be declared from income reserves.
It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 15%, yielding
a net dividend of 442 cents per listed N ordinary share
and 88.4 cents per unlisted A ordinary share to those
shareholders not exempt from paying dividend tax. Such
dividend tax will amount to 78 cents per listed N ordinary
share and 15.6 cents per unlisted A ordinary share.

437 920 115 N ordinary shares and 907 128 A ordinary shares.

Notes to the summarised consolidated financial results
1.   General information
     Naspers Limited (Naspers) is a global internet and entertainment group and one of the largest technology investors in the
     world. Founded in 1915, we now operate in more than 130 countries and markets with long-term growth potential. Naspers
     builds leading companies that empower people and enrich communities. It runs some of the world's leading platforms in
     internet, video entertainment and media.

2.   Basis of presentation and accounting policies
     The summarised consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 March 2016 are prepared in accordance with the
     JSE Limited's stock exchange (JSE) Listings Requirements (the Listings Requirements) relevant to summarised financial
     statements and the provisions of the Companies Act. No 71 of 2008. The Listings Requirements require provisional
     reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the measurement and recognition requirements of
     International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
     Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and to also,
     as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The summarised consolidated
     financial results do not include all the disclosures required for complete annual financial statements prepared in
     accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting policies applied
     in the preparation of the consolidated annual financial statements from which the summarised consolidated financial
     results were derived, are consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements except as
     set out below.

     On 18 April 2016 Naspers announced that it had changed the presentation currency in its consolidated financial
     statements from the South African rand (SA rand) to the United States dollar (US dollar) with effect from the financial
     year ended on 31 March 2016.

     Over the past 100 years the group has evolved from a single-country newspaper business and early investor in pay
     television to a video-entertainment leader and global internet and ecommerce group with operations in over 130 countries.
     Today more than 75% of revenue measured on an economic-interest basis (which includes the group's proportionate share
     of the revenue of associates and joint ventures) is sourced from outside of South Africa.
     Coupled with the evolution of the business, the group's shareholder base now largely comprises foreign investors to whom
     financial reporting in SA rand is of limited relevance. Internally, the board also bases its performance evaluation and many
     investment decisions on US dollar financial information.

     The board therefore believes that US dollar financial reporting provides more relevant presentation of the group's financial
     position, funding and treasury functions, financial performance and its cash flows.

     Dividends will continue to be declared in SA rand, with the relevant exchange rate announced at the time of the dividend
     payment.

     A change in presentation currency represents a change in an accounting policy in terms of IAS 8 Accounting Policies,
     Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors requiring the restatement of comparative information. In accordance with
     IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the following methodology was followed in restating historical
     financial information from SA rand into US dollar:
     •   Non-US dollar assets and liabilities were translated at the relevant closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting
         period. Non-US dollar items of income and expenditure and cash flows were translated at actual transaction date
         exchange rates.
     •   The foreign currency translation reserve was reset to nil as at 1 April 2006, the date on which the group adopted IFRS,
         in line with IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. Share capital and premium and
         other reserves, as appropriate, were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of underlying transactions.
     •   The effects of translating the group's financial results and financial position into US dollar were recognised in the
         foreign currency translation reserve.

     Although actual transaction date exchange rates were used to translate previously reported SA rand earnings and cash
     flows into US dollar, the group has provided the average exchange rates of its major trading currencies relative to the
     US dollar as an approximation for these rates for reference in the following table. The closing exchange rates of the group's
     major trading currencies relative to the US dollar, used when translating the statements of financial position presented in
     this release into US  dollar, are also detailed in this table.

     The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective for
     financial years commencing 1 April 2015. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are effective for
     the financial year commencing 1 April 2015 had a material impact on the group.

     The group's reportable segments reflect the components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief executive
     officer and other senior executives who make strategic decisions. The group proportionately consolidates its share of the
     results of its associates and joint ventures in its reportable segments.

     Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based payment
     expenses relating to transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses and
     other gains/losses, but includes the finance cost on transponder leases.

     Core headline earnings exclude one-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's
     sustainable operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with
     similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

3.   Independent audit
     The summarised consolidated financial results have been audited by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers
     Inc. (PwC). The individual auditor assigned to perform the audit is Brendan Deegan. PwC's unqualified audit reports on the
     consolidated annual financial statements and summarised consolidated financial results are available for inspection at
     the registered office of the company. The auditor's report does not necessarily cover all the information contained in the
     summarised financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature
     of the auditor's work, they should obtain a copy of that report, together with the consolidated annual financial statements
     from the registered office of the company. The consolidated annual financial statements, together with the integrated
     annual report, will be available on www.naspers.com on or about 22 July 2016.

The impairment loss recognised during the current reporting period relates primarily to the group's investment in its online
comparison shopping business, Buscapé. Buscapé forms part of the ecommerce segment. The impairment loss has been
calculated on a value-in-use basis using a 10-year projected cash flow model, a growth rate of 4% and a discount rate of
20%. If the discount rate applied to cash flows were to increase by 5% and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows
were to decrease by 5%, there would be no further significant impairments that would have to be recognised.

    The group classified the net assets and liabilities of Netretail, its Czech etail and ecommerce platform; Heureka, the
    group's Czech online comparison shopping platform, as well as the assets and liabilities of other smaller businesses as
    held for sale during the year ended 31 March 2016. The above-mentioned transactions are subject to regulatory approval.
    The group concluded the disposals of its subsidiaries Ricardo.ch AG and Korbitec Proprietary Limited following the receipt
    of regulatory approval during September and November 2015 respectively. These businesses were previously classified as
    held for sale. Refer to note 12 for additional details regarding these disposals.

    The group recognised a loss of US$87.7m (2015: US$nil) on remeasuring the net assets of businesses classified as held
    for sale to their fair value less costs of disposal during the year. The fair value of the businesses was determined based
    on third-party sales prices. This represents a level 3 fair-value measurement.

12. Business combinations and other acquisitions
    The group acquired an additional 49.0% interest in its associate Avito AB (Avito), the leading online classifieds platform
    in Russia, during December 2015. The additional investment resulted in the group holding a 67.5% interest in Avito on
    a fully diluted basis and was accounted for as a business combination. The total purchase consideration amounted to
    US$1.67bn representing cash paid to the former owners of Avito of US$1.23bn, the fair value of the group's previously
    held equity interest in Avito of US$411m, as well as the acquisition-date fair value of Avito's vested share-based incentive
    awards of US$22m. A gain of US$324m has been recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income
    statement on the remeasurement of the group's previously held equity interest in Avito to its fair value. The purchase
    price allocation: property, plant and equipment US$6m; cash US$24m; trade and other receivables US$9m; deferred
    tax assets US$2m; intangible assets US$812m; trade and other payables US$18m; deferred tax liabilities US$161m and
    the balance of US$1.19bn to goodwill. The main classes of intangible assets recognised in the business combination
    were brand names, customer bases and software. The transaction gave rise to the recognition of a non-controlling
    interest of US$195m, which has been measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the identifiable
    net assets of Avito as at the acquisition date.

    In May 2015 the group invested US$10m in Ambatana Holdings B.V. (Ambatana), an entity operating a hyperlocal
    classifieds marketplace app under the letgo brand. The investment resulted in Ambatana being accounted for as an
    associate of the group. A further US$50m was invested in Ambatana during September 2015, resulting in the group
    holding a 67.5% interest on a fully diluted basis following the investment. The additional investment was accounted for
    as a business combination with an effective date of 30 September 2015. The total purchase consideration amounted to
    US$58m, representing the fair value of the group's previously held equity interest in Ambatana of US$34m and the fair
    value of a call option granted to the former owners of Ambatana amounting to US$24m. The cash invested and cash
    consideration still payable, in aggregate amounting to US$50m, remains within the group following the transaction and
    is accordingly not disclosed as part of the consideration transferred by the group or assets of Ambatana acquired,
    although it did affect the amount of goodwill recognised in the business combination. A gain of US$24m has been
    recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the remeasurement of the group's
    previously held equity interest in Ambatana to its fair value. The purchase price allocation: cash US$1m; other
    receivables US$1m; trade and other payables US$3m and the balance of US$74m to goodwill. The transaction gave rise
    to the recognition of a non-controlling interest of US$15m, which has been measured at the non-controlling interest's
    proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of Ambatana as at the acquisition date. On 31 March 2016 the call option
    granted to the former owners of Ambatana was settled, resulting in the group holding a 55.0% interest in Ambatana on a
    fully diluted basis at year-end.
    
    Since the acquisition dates of the above business combinations, revenue of US$31m and net results (losses) of US$60m
    have been included in the income statement relating to Ambatana and Avito. Had the revenue and net results of Ambatana
    and Avito been included from 1 April 2015, group revenue and net profit would have amounted to US$6.01bn and US$1.02bn
    respectively.
    
    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisitions is the acquiree's market presence. The goodwill
    that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total acquisition-related costs of US$8m were
    recorded in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement regarding the above-mentioned acquisitions.
    
    The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:
    
    During April 2015 the group invested US$41m in its joint venture Konga Online Shopping Limited (Konga). Following the
    additional investment, the group continues to exert joint control over Konga with its 50.9% interest on a fully diluted basis.
    
    The group's associate Flipkart Limited (Flipkart) undertook two funding rounds during April and July 2015 in which the
    group did not participate. The funding rounds resulted in a dilution of the group's interest in Flipkart and in the recognition
    of an aggregate net dilution gain of US$61m in ""Dilution gains on equity-accounted investments"" in the income statement.
    Following the dilutions, the group now holds a 15.0% interest in Flipkart on a fully diluted basis.
    
    During May 2015 the group invested US$10m in its joint venture Souq Group Limited (Souq) as part of a funding round.
    Souq undertook further funding rounds during the year in which the group did not participate. These funding rounds
    resulted in a dilution of the group's interest in Souq and in the recognition of an aggregate net dilution gain of US$75m
    in ""Dilution gains on equity-accounted investments"" in the income statement. Following the dilutions, the group now holds
    a 36.4% interest in Souq on a fully diluted basis.
    
    The group also recognised dilution losses of US$42m during the year relating to dilutions in its shareholding in Tencent
    on account of the exercise of share-based incentive awards by Tencent's employees.
    
    The group invested US$20m in its available-for-sale investment Avenida Inc. (Avenida) during July 2015. The transaction
    resulted in Avenida becoming an associate, and the group now holds a 23.4% interest in Avenida on a fully diluted basis.
    
    The group invested US$54m as part of a funding round of its associate Takealot Online (RF) Proprietary Limited (Takealot)
    during August 2015. The group holds a 42.4% interest in Takealot on a fully diluted basis.
    
    The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:
    
    During September 2015 the group disposed of its interest in its subsidiary Ricardo.ch AG following approval of the
    transaction by regulatory authorities. The proceeds on sale amounted to US$248m and a gain of US$76m was recognised
    in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement following the transaction.
    
    The group disposed of its interest in its subsidiary Korbitec Proprietary Limited during November 2015 for US$33m
    following the receipt of regulatory approval. A gain of US$24m was recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals""
    in the income statement following the transaction.
    
    During March 2016 the group disposed of its interest in its subsidiary PayProp Group Services Proprietary Limited for
    US$10m. The disposal gave rise to the recognition of a gain of US$4m in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the
    income statement.
    
    The group disposed of its 9.9% interest in Beijing Media Corporation during August 2015 for a cash consideration of
    US$12m. The transaction resulted in the recognition of an aggregate gain on disposal of US$11m, which has been
    recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement.
    
    Investments acquired and funding rounds participated in were funded through the utilisation of existing credit facilities,
    proceeds received from disposals during the reporting period as well as the proceeds from the equity raise during
    December 2015.

13. Proceeds from placement of N ordinary shares and issue of listed bond
    During December 2015 the group placed 18 167 848 new N ordinary shares with qualifying institutional investors at a price
    of R1 975 per share, thereby raising gross proceeds of approximately US$2.5bn before transaction costs. The placing
    represented approximately 4.3% of Naspers's issued N ordinary share capital prior to the share issuance. The proceeds
    raised were utilised to fund the group's acquisition of a controlling interest in Avito AB (refer to note 12), to repay certain
    amounts on the group's offshore revolving credit facility and the remainder will serve to fund the group's future growth
    strategy.
    In July 2015 the group issued a 10-year US$1.2bn bond. The bond matures in July 2025 and carries a fixed interest rate of
    5.5% per annum. The proceeds were utilised for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain amounts
    on the group's offshore revolving credit facility and to fund acquisitions and growth.

Currency devaluation features relate to clauses in content acquisition agreements that provide the group with protection
against significant currency devaluations. The fair value of currency devaluation features is measured through the use of
discounted cash flow techniques.

The fair value of shareholders' liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Business-specific adjusted
discount rates are applied to estimated future cash flows.

For earnout obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance criteria will be met,
discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified earnout payments are used. Changes in
these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments. The fair value of level 2 financial
instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in active markets and interest rate extracts from
observable yield curves.

15. Related-party transactions and balances
    The group entered into various related-party transactions in the ordinary course of business. There have been no
    significant changes in related-party transactions and balances since the previous reporting period.

16. Events after the reporting period
    On 12 May 2016 the group announced the merger of the US operations of its mobile marketplace for second-hand
    goods, letgo, with Wallapop, another leader in the mobile classifieds sector. The transaction resulted in the absorption of
    Wallapop's US operations into letgo. The group retains control over letgo following the merger and will account for the
    absorption of Wallapop as a business combination in the 2017 financial year.
    On 11 May 2016 the group announced its first investment targeting the education technology market by investing US$13m,
    through Naspers Ventures, in Brainly – a social learning network. Over 60m students in 35 countries interact with Brainly
    every month. In line with this strategy, the group also invested US$60m in Udemy, an online education marketplace with over 
    7m students enrolled and US$22m in Codecademy, a leading global platform focused on online coding education, both during 
    June 2016.
    In June 2016 the group received regulatory approval for the sale of its business classified as held for sale, Heureka.
    The group consequently recognised a gain on disposal of approximately US$61m.

17. Pro forma financial information
    The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics in local currency, excluding the effects of changes
    in the composition of the group (the pro forma financial information) in the following tables. The pro forma financial
    information is the responsibility of the board of directors (the board) of Naspers Limited and is presented for illustrative
    purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been extracted from the group's management accounts, the
    quality of which the board is satisfied with.

    Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that it has been
    extracted from the group's management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes in
    equity, results of operations or cash flows.

    The review report issued by the group's external auditor and which appears at the end of these summarised consolidated
    financial results does not extend to the pro forma financial information. An assurance report issued in respect of the pro
    forma financial information, by the group's external auditor, is available at the registered office of the company.

    The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
    changes in the composition of the group on its results for the periods ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 respectively.
    The following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:

     1. Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results to
        the prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates for that
        period. The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency results, arrived at using
        the methodology outlined above, compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange
        rates used for the group's most significant functional currencies are listed in note 2.

     2. Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries
        and equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-accounted
        investments. The following significant changes in the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods
        have been adjusted for in arriving at the pro forma financial information:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF NASPERS LIMITED

The summarised consolidated financial statements of Naspers Limited, contained in the accompanying provisional
report, which comprise the summarised consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2016, the
summarised consolidated income statements, and summarised consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and related notes, are derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of Naspers Limited for the year ended 31 March 2016. We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on
those consolidated financial statements in our report dated 24 June 2016. Our auditor's report on the audited
consolidated financial statements contained an Other Matter paragraph: ""Other Reports Required by the Companies Act""
(refer below).

The summarised consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International Financial
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to annual financial
statements. Reading the summarised consolidated financial statements, therefore, is not a substitute for reading the
audited consolidated financial statements of Naspers Limited.

Directors' Responsibility for the Summarised Consolidated Financial Statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation of these summarised consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for provisional reports, set out in note 2 to the
summarised consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa as applicable
to summary financial statements, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of summarised consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the summarised consolidated financial statements based on our
procedures, which were conducted in accordance with International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 810, Engagements to
Report on Summary Financial Statements.

Opinion

In our opinion, the summarised consolidated financial statements derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of Naspers Limited for the year ended 31 March 2016 are consistent, in all material respects, with those
consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for
provisional reports, set out in note 2 to the summarised consolidated financial statements, and the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa as applicable to summary financial statements.

Other Reports Required by the Companies Act

The ""Other Reports Required by the Companies Act"" paragraph in our audit report dated 24 June 2016 states that as part
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, we have read the Directors'
Report, the Audit Committee's Report and the Company Secretary's Certificate for the purpose of identifying whether
there are material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited consolidated financial statements. These reports
are the responsibility of the respective preparers. The paragraph states that, based on reading these reports, we have not
identified material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited consolidated financial statements. The
paragraph furthermore states that we have not audited these reports and accordingly do not express an opinion on these
reports. The paragraph does not have an effect on the summarised consolidated financial statements or our opinion
thereon.

CHANGE IN PRESENTATION CURRENCY

Naspers Limited today announced that it will change the presentation currency in its consolidated financial statements from
the South African rand (ZAR) to the United States dollar (USD) with effect from the financial year ended on 31 March 2016.

Over the past 100 years, the group has evolved from a single-country newspaper business and early investor in pay television
to a video-entertainment leader and global internet and ecommerce group with operations in over 130 countries. Today,
more than 70% of revenue measured on an economic interest basis (which includes the group's proportionate share of the
revenue of associates and joint ventures) is sourced from outside South Africa.

Coupled with the evolution of the business, the group's shareholder base is now largely comprised of foreign investors to
whom financial reporting in ZAR is of limited relevance. Internally, the board also bases its performance evaluation and many
investment decisions on USD financial information.

The board therefore believes that USD financial reporting provides more relevant presentation of the group's financial
position, funding and treasury functions, financial performance and its cash flows.

It should be noted that the functional currencies of the group's underlying businesses – functional currencies referring to the
currencies of the primary economic environments in which underlying businesses operate – remain unchanged and that
foreign exchange exposures will therefore be unaffected by the change, albeit that the effects of such exposures will be
presented in USD.

Dividends will continue to be declared in ZAR, with the relevant exchange rate announced at the time of the dividend
payment.

To assist investors in understanding the change, the group has provided summarised, restated USD financial information for
the financial years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014 as well as for the six-month interim periods ended 30 September 2015
and 2014. An analyst presentation with restated information is also available on the group's website www.naspers.com. The
summarised, restated information presented, has been prepared in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and will form the basis of the comparative financial information expected to be included in the consolidated annual
financial statements of the group, presented in USD, for the year ended 31 March 2016.

A change in presentation currency represents a change in an accounting policy in terms of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes
in Accounting Estimates and Errors requiring the restatement of comparative information. In accordance with IAS 21 The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the following methodology was followed in restating historical financial
information from ZAR into USD:

    -   Non-USD assets and liabilities were translated at the relevant closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting
        period. Non-USD items of income and expenditure and cash flows were translated at actual transaction date
        exchange rates;
    -   The foreign currency translation reserve was reset to nil as at 1 April 2006, the date on which the group adopted
        IFRS, in line with IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. Share capital and
        premium and other reserves, as appropriate, were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of
        underlying transactions; and
    -   The effects of translating the group's financial results and financial position into USD were recognised in the foreign
        currency translation reserve.

Although actual transaction date exchange rates were used to translate previously reported ZAR earnings and cash flows into
USD, the group has provided the average exchange rates of its major trading currencies relative to USD as an approximation
for these rates for reference in the table below. The closing exchange rates of the group's major trading currencies relative
to USD, used when translating the statements of financial position presented in this release into USD, are also detailed in the
table below.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
changes in the composition of the group on its results for the periods ended 31 March 2015 and 30 September 2015,
respectively. The following methodology was applied in calculating the pro forma financial information:

1.   Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results to the
     prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates for that period.
     The organic pro forma financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency results, arrived at using the
     methodology outlined above, compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates
     used for the group's most significant trading currencies are listed in the introductory commentary to this release.
2.   Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and
     equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-accounted investments.
     The following significant changes in the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods have been
     adjusted for in arriving at the pro forma financial information:

RESULTS OF THE EQUITY CAPITAL RAISE

Investors are referred to the announcement released by Naspers through SENS and RNS on
3 December 2015 regarding Naspers’s launch of a capital raising of up to US$2.5bn (the
“Capital Raising”) by way of a private placement to institutional investors (the “Placing”).

Naspers is pleased to announce that it has successfully priced the Placing, raising gross
proceeds of US$2.5bn.

A total of 18,167,848 new Naspers N ordinary shares (the “Placing Shares”) were successfully
placed with qualifying institutional investors at a price of ZAR 1,975 per share. The Placing
Shares being issued represent approximately 4.3% of Naspers’s issued N ordinary share capital
prior to the Capital Raising.

Subject to approval by the JSE Limited (“JSE”), listing and trading of the Placing Shares is
expected to commence on 11 December 2015.

The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with
the existing N ordinary shares in the share capital of Naspers, including the right to receive all
dividends and other distributions declared, after the date of issue of the Placing Shares.

LAUNCH OF AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OF UP TO US$2.5BN

1. Introduction

Naspers is launching a capital raising by way of a private placement to institutional investors, of
approximately 17.1 million new Naspers N ordinary shares (the ?Shares?), to raise up to
US$2.5bn (the ""Capital Raising""). The Shares will be issued under Naspers?s existing general
authority to issue shares for cash and pursuant to a vendor consideration placing.

2. Rationale for the Capital Raising and use of proceeds

The Capital Raising will provide Naspers with additional capacity to execute its successful
strategy of investing in high-growth internet and ecommerce companies with proven business
models, including Naspers?s proposed acquisition of Avito. On 23 October 2015, Naspers
announced that it had reached an agreement to increase its stake in Avito from 17.4% to 67.9%
for a consideration of US$1.2bn (""Avito Acquisition""). Since then, Naspers has received
approval from the South African Reserve Bank and the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service
for the Avito acquisition, and Naspers expects such transaction to close before the end of this
calendar year.

Up to US$1.2bn of the Capital Raising will be raised under the vendor consideration placing and
these funds will be used to settle the cash consideration payable to vendors under the Avito
Acquisition.

Commenting on the Capital Raising, Bob van Dijk, the Chief Executive Officer of Naspers, said:
""As a company we are very proud of how we have grown Naspers into one of the leading multi-
national internet and media groups and the returns we have delivered to all of our stakeholders.
The Capital Raising will finance the Avito acquisition as well as provide us with the financial
flexibility to continue to deliver on our strategy of investing in high-growth internet and
ecommerce companies to continue to drive returns for our shareholders"".
3. Launch of the bookbuild

The Capital Raising will take place at a price to be established through an accelerated
bookbuilding process to be conducted by Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley
& Co. International plc acting as joint bookrunners (collectively, the ?Joint Bookrunners?).

Bookbuilding will begin with immediate effect. The timing of the closing of the book, the pricing
of the Shares and the making of allocations are in the absolute discretion of Naspers and the
Joint Bookrunners.

Absa Bank Limited, acting through its Corporate and Investment Banking division, BNP Paribas
and ING Bank N.V. are acting as co-lead managers and Rand Merchant Bank, a division of
FirstRand Bank Limited is acting as co-manager (together with the Joint Bookrunners and the
co-lead managers the ?Banks?).

The Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects
with the existing issued N ordinary shares of Naspers, including the right to receive future
dividends and other distributions declared after the date of their issue. Trading of the Shares on
the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (the ""JSE"") is expected to commence at the start of
trading, 5 business days after closing.

The bookbuild process will be subject to normal share trading practices, the relevant rules,
regulations and procedures of the JSE, applicable laws and regulations and the settlement
authority of Strate Proprietary Limited.

We announced a transaction on 23 October 2015 to increase our stake in Avito from 17,4% to
67,9% for cash of US$1,2bn. At the time we noted that the transaction would not materially
increase our existing debt profile in the medium term. Therefore we are considering a capital
raise of up to US$2,5bn which, including the Avito acquisition, will enhance financial flexibility
over the next few years to invest in attractive growth opportunities. Any capital raise is expected
to be within existing shareholder authorities.

We have appointed Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM REPORT
for the six months ended 30 September 2015

Naspers continues to make progress in building consumer destinations and platforms in
fast-growing markets. These interim results, in the aggregate, are in line with the board's
expectations. Currency has had a material impact and, where possible, meaningful currency effects
have been isolated in this commentary.

Driven by growth in the ecommerce segment, revenue measured on an economic interest
basis grew 24% to R74,3bn, while in US dollar terms, revenue grew 5% to US$5,9bn. On an
organic basis, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions, revenue grew by
20%. Core headline earnings increased 45% to R8,8bn, with Tencent and the South African
video-entertainment business being the main contributors. In US dollar terms, core headline
earnings were up 22% to US$693m.

In ecommerce, the marketplace and established classifieds businesses also delivered year-
on-year earnings growth. These earnings improvements were partly offset by increased
development spend of R5,1bn, measured on an economic interest basis – a 17% year-on-year
increase.

The classifieds business has made solid progress, outpacing competition. Naspers further
strengthened its position in classifieds with the recently announced transaction, subject to
regulatory approval, to take a controlling stake in Avito in Russia. The etail, marketplace and
travel businesses continue to make progress and are widening the gap in operating metrics
relative to competitors.

The digital terrestrial television (DTT) business and the South African video-entertainment
group continue to deliver customer growth and improved financials. The direct-to-home (DTH)
business in sub-Saharan Africa faced headwinds, mainly from a challenging macroeconomic
environment and currency weakness. In August we launched ShowMax, a subscription video-
on-demand (SVOD) service in South Africa.

Media24 has returned to a modest trading profit growth. The impact of sectoral declines in
its traditional print and media revenues is being offset by growth in its online and ecommerce
initiatives.

The following financial commentary and segmental review have been prepared on an
economic interest basis, including consolidated subsidiaries and a proportionate consolidation
of associated companies and joint ventures. Where relevant throughout this report, amounts
and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency and acquisitions and
disposals. Such adjusted items (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets after
the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
A reconciliation of the pro forma financial information to the equivalent IFRS metrics is provided
in note 16 of this condensed consolidated interim report.

COMMENTARY

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Consolidated revenues of R37,8bn grew by 10% (10%), driven
by good growth in our ecommerce segment. In US dollar terms,
consolidated revenues were US$3,0bn – a decrease of 7% (increase
of 10%) compared to the prior year, caused by currency.

Revenue growth remained strong with the internet segment, which
grew 33% (28%), outpacing growth in other segments. Internet
revenues now account for 64% of group revenues, up from 60%
a year ago. Businesses outside South Africa now contribute 75% of
revenues, up from 71% a year ago.

Consolidated development spend declined by 13% (20%) year on
year and by 32% compared to the second half of 2015. Reduced
development spend in the classifieds and DTT businesses was
offset by investments in new areas, notably ShowMax, mobile-only
classifieds (Letgo) and travel in India.

Trading profit grew 34% (19%) to R15,3bn on the back of solid earnings
contributions from Tencent, South African video entertainment and
the Allegro marketplace.

The group's share of the results of equity-accounted investments,
mainly Tencent and Mail.ru, was R8,0bn for the period, and includes
non-recurring gains of R1,5bn relating primarily to once-off gains
recognised by Tencent on changes in its shareholding in certain
associates. Tencent's performance was driven by improved advertising
and mobile platform monetisation. Mail.ru contributed R296m to core
headline earnings.

Ecommerce trading losses increased by 55% (46%) year on year, mainly
due to costs incurred by our etail equity-accounted investments to
scale their businesses. The classifieds segment delivered lower losses,
partly due to benefits from the transaction concluded with Schibsted
in January 2015, but also steady progress towards monetisation and
improved profitability by classifieds businesses already at scale. The
marketplace business grew its trading profits.

The video-entertainment segment saw more or less the same
trading profit. In South Africa steady growth was recorded, while
results in sub-Saharan Africa were impacted by weakening
currencies. A number of initiatives have been implemented to deal
with rising input costs.

An impairment loss of R1,9bn has been recognised during the period
for the group's investment in its Latin American online comparison
shopping (OCS) business, Buscapé. This has been recognised as
part of ""Other gains/(losses) – net"" in the condensed consolidated
income statement. Adverse economic developments, combined
with pressure on OCS's share of ecommerce, led us to revise future
expectations resulting in an impairment. The OLX, PayU and
Movile investments in Latin America are performing well.

The consolidated net interest expense on borrowings rose 46%
to R1,2bn, primarily as a result of the foreign exchange effects of
a weakened rand, use of credit facilities to fund growth and the
US$1,2bn bond issued in July 2015. Net gearing, measured on a
consolidated basis, remained low at 32%.

Consolidated free cash inflow for the period was R1,3bn (2014:
outflow of R428m) largely due to a substantial drop in capital
expenditure in the video-entertainment segment having built the 
significant part of the DTT network in prior years, and increased 
dividend income from equity-accounted investments.

We announced a transaction on 23 October 2015 to increase our
stake in Avito from 17,4% to 67,9% for cash of US$1,2bn. At the
time we noted that the transaction would not materially increase
our existing debt profile in the medium term. We are considering a 
capital raise of up to US$2,5bn that, including the Avito acquisition, 
will enhance financial flexibility over the next few years to invest 
in attractive growth opportunities. Any capital raise is expected to 
be within existing shareholder authorities.

Naspers has an obligation in terms of its memorandum of
incorporation (MOI) to maintain its control structure. The voting
percentage of the control structure companies, Naspers Beleggings
(RF) Beperk and Keeromstraat 30 Beleggings (RF) Beperk, is close
to falling below 50% as a result of the issue of Naspers N ordinary
shares. The board therefore approved a capitalisation award
of 194 607 A ordinary shares to A ordinary shareholders to be
implemented on 26 November 2015. The effect of the capitalisation
issue is to increase the voting percentage of the control structure
companies to 54,68%, and restore the voting percentage of the
A ordinary shareholders to 68,38% – the percentage it was when
the new MOI of Naspers Limited was adopted in August 2012.

Forecasts included in this condensed consolidated interim report
have not been reviewed or reported on by the company's
external auditor.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW

Internet
The internet segment delivered revenues of R47,7bn, an increase
of 33% (28%) year on year. Trading profit was R10,2bn – a 57%
(33%) year-on-year increase on the back of a strong Tencent
performance.

Tencent
Tencent's excellent leadership team entrenched its position across
its social, online games and media platforms to remain well
positioned in an expanding internet ecosystem in China. Revenues
were RMB45,8bn for the period, up 20% year on year.

Online advertising revenue, especially in the performance-based
and online video segments, grew rapidly and benefited from an
expanded advertising inventory and advertiser base. Tencent is
encouraging improved content on its media platforms by sharing
advertising revenues with content developers, leading to enhanced
user engagement in its ecosystem.

Tencent delivered growth in its mobile payment solutions by
leveraging a wider base of users who have bundled their bank cards
with Mobile QQ Wallet and/or Weixin Payments. A growing number of
partner companies are adopting Tencent's mobile payment solutions
which is improving the convenience of these services. Investment
in new online-to-offline services continued, albeit in a fiercely
competitive environment where a large number of well-funded
newcomers seek to establish a footprint.

The mobile subscriber base for premium reading, music and
video services has continued to grow with increasing smartphone
penetration in China. Tencent has made progress across its portfolio
of mobile utilities, with its mobile security solution, browser and
app store developing well.

Tencent has continued to build strategic partnerships by investing in
several verticals, including film and online media, and a number of
offline-to-online ventures.

Mail.ru
Mail.ru's growth was affected by the macroeconomic environment in
Russia and the weak rouble. Despite these challenges, Mail.ru achieved
revenue growth of 7% year on year to RUB18,3bn, with improved
growth in targeted and mobile advertising revenues. Revenues from
online games grew and new game launches are planned in the
second half of this year. The integration of VK.com, the leading social
network in Russia, is on track and the team continues to execute well.

Ecommerce
Over the review period, the ecommerce segment grew revenue
by 26% (27%) to R15,3bn. Continued investments to drive growth
and innovation, develop new markets and deliver superior customer
experiences resulted in a trading loss of R3,8bn, with development
spend of R4,3bn.

Classifieds delivered a strong performance with revenue growth of
36% (43%) year on year. On the back of joint-venture agreements
with Schibsted, the classifieds joint-venture businesses are reporting
steady revenue growth. Key performance indicators in most of the
businesses are trending ahead of expectations.

Our recently announced step-up to acquire a controlling stake (67,9%)
in Avito, the leading online classifieds platform in Russia – one of
the world's largest classifieds markets – will further solidify Naspers's
position as a global leader in classifieds.

The classifieds platforms have very strong mobile positions, with
listings from mobile reaching as much as 80% in certain markets.
We are experimenting with new formats to expand the classifieds
segment's geographic footprint and strengthen the existing business.
In September 2015 we committed to a US$100m investment in the
mobile-only classifieds platform Letgo. It is intended to leverage the
Letgo platform to expand into markets that do not have a strong
mobile classifieds incumbent.

Powered by Flipkart in India, Souq in the Middle East and North Africa,
and eMag in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), etail continues to fuel
growth in the ecommerce segment. The etail business delivered 39%
(35%) revenue growth, despite aggressive competition in many of
these markets. We continue to expand selectively and in July 2015 we
invested in Avenida in Argentina.

In CEE the consumer offering was consolidated through eMag's
platform. As a consequence, the group's 79% stake in Netretail, as
well as in Heureka, the wholly owned OCS business in the region,
were sold for US$201m, subject to regulatory approval. Additionally,
to streamline operations and support further growth, we plan to
merge Fashion Days into eMag in several CEE countries.

Marketplaces continue to deliver growth, margins and cash flows. The
focus remains on improving the mobile experience, expanding the
selection of products and services, and extending consumer reach.
We will begin experimenting with first-party sales (owning inventory)
in the second half of the financial year in Poland. In September 2015
the sale of the Swiss marketplace business – Ricardo group – was
concluded for CHF240m.

The payments business is making progress in terms of growth,
innovation and operational improvements and reported revenue
growth of 17% (21%) year on year. The operations in CEE and
Brazil were restructured, contributing to healthy topline organic
growth and margin improvement in these geographies. Payments
is a competitive market, with the number of disruptions to legacy
payment systems accelerating. We continue to explore emerging
formats and in June 2015 acquired a minority stake in an early-stage
crypto-currency (eg BitCoin) business, BitX.

In India, ibibo continues to improve its competitive position in its core
air-ticketing and hotel-bookings business. The air-ticketing business
is approaching breakeven. On the back of encouraging early traction,
ibibo is accelerating its investment in its hotel-booking platform.
RedBus, its bus-ticketing business, remains the clear market leader. The
travel business grew revenue by 61% (44%) over the reporting period.

Movile is a leading mobile services platform in Latin America. It
continues to scale its online food-delivery business, iFood, in Brazil.
Movile has also made some promising investments in a number of
offline-to-online platforms in Brazil and across Latin America.

Video entertainment
The segment reported revenues of R22,6bn – an increase of 12% (9%)
over the prior year. Trading profit was constant at R5,0bn compared to
the prior year due to the group's investment in ShowMax, weakening
economies and currencies, and sizeable foreign input costs in sub-
Saharan Africa. Development spend was R644m, up marginally year
on year, as the decrease in spend following the completion of the DTT
rollout is offset by investments to scale ShowMax.

The DTT business recorded good growth, adding 172 600 customers.
However, this growth was offset by a decline in the DTH business of
164 300 customers, largely in sub-Saharan Africa. The total customer
base closed at 10,2m at 30 September 2015.

Economies in sub-Saharan Africa have been severely impacted
by currency devaluations and a weaker macroeconomic climate.

DTT subscribers across Africa were 2,4m. Analogue switchoffs
(ASOs – the process of migrating terrestrial television broadcasting
from an analogue to a digital format), have taken place in Kenya,
Namibia and certain cities in Uganda and Malawi. Despite delays in
other countries, further switchoffs are expected over the next 18 to
24 months in key markets such as Nigeria. While strong decoder sales
continue in both pre-ASO and post-ASO markets, there has been a
distinct reduction in churn in markets where ASO has taken place. We
will continue to invest and focus on retention in markets where ASOs
have occurred. Development costs are expected to decline further as
the business scales.

ShowMax is an SVOD service available to consumers on all connected
devices. It has a strong local and international content library with
over 10 000 hours of content – more than any of its local peers.

The focus remains on providing the best quality entertainment while
managing costs, improving customer service, driving retention and
growing average revenues per user through value-added services
such as BoxOffice. Our DStv Catch Up product has been enhanced
by the introduction of recommendations and 'pull' video-on-demand
(VOD) to the set-top box, which allows DStv Premium subscribers
with internet-connected personal video recorders (PVRs) to access a
much larger catalogue of content. Connecting the PVR to the internet
is a key part of our strategy and we have seen satisfying levels
of uptake. The 'TV everywhere' product, DStv Now, has recorded
pleasing levels of uptake across all platforms. This service has been
enhanced by adding more sport, movie and kids channels.

PVR penetration has increased to 19,8% of South African customers
and 9,7% of customers in the rest of Africa. As churn is more than
50% lower for PVR customers, growth of this base will have a positive
financial impact.

Management continues to engage with regulators across the
continent, with a number of regulatory reviews pending in various
markets.

Print media
Media24 continues to face sectoral headwinds in its traditional offline
print and media business, but is addressing costs. Revenues of R4,0bn
are marginally up year on year as the decline in the offline businesses
is offset by growth in online services, ecommerce and Novus, the
commercial print business listed on the JSE. Reduced costs resulted in
trading profit of R202m. Development spend to build online initiatives
was R142m.

(1) EBITDA refers to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.

(2) The group's segmental review includes the results of its equity-accounted investments on a proportionate consolidation basis in line with internal
    reporting to the chief operating decisionmaker (CODM). During the six months ended 30 September 2015, the CODM ceased reviewing the results of the
    group's associate Abril S.A. (""Abril"") for performance evaluation purposes as the group no longer participates in the management of Abril, the group's
    investment in Abril has been fully impaired and, accordingly, the group no longer recognises its share of the losses of Abril in accordance with the equity
    method. IFRS 8 ""Operating Segments"" requires segmental reporting to reflect the measures reported to the CODM for purposes of making decisions
    regarding the allocation of resources and for performance evaluation. Accordingly, the results of Abril have been excluded from the segmental review for
    the six months ended 30 September 2015. To ensure comparability and in line with the requirements of IFRS 8 paragraph 29, the print-media segment's
    results for comparative periods have been restated to exclude the results of Abril. The six-month period ended 30 September 2014 presented for the
    print-media segment previously included revenue of R2,0bn (31 March 2015: R3,8bn), positive EBITDA of R13m (31 March 2015: R253m) and a trading loss
    of R82m (31 March 2015: trading profit of R81m) relating to Abril.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM REPORT

1.   General information
     Principal activities of Naspers and its operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies (collectively ""the group"") are the operation
     of internet and media platforms. Our principal operations are in ecommerce and other internet services, video-entertainment services and print
     media.

2.   Basis of presentation and accounting policies
     The condensed consolidated interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2015 is prepared in accordance with International Financial
     Reporting Standards (IFRS) IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting"", the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices
     Committee, and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council as well as the requirements of the Companies
     Act of South Africa and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Listings Requirements.
 
     The condensed consolidated interim report does not include all the disclosures required for complete annual financial statements prepared
     in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting policies used in preparing the
     condensed consolidated interim report are consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements.
 
     The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements issued by the IASB that are effective for financial years commencing
     1 April 2015. None of the new or amended accounting pronouncements that are effective for the financial year commencing 1 April 2015 are
     expected to have a material impact on the group.
 
     Trading profit excludes amortisation of intangible assets (other than software), equity-settled share-based payment expenses relating to
     transactions to be settled through the issuance of treasury shares, retention option expenses and other gains/losses, but includes the finance
     cost on transponder leases.
 
     Core headline earnings exclude once-off and non-operating items. We believe it is a useful measure of the group's sustainable operating
     performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other
     companies.

3.   Review by the independent auditor
     This condensed consolidated interim report has been reviewed by the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., whose unqualified
     report appears at the end of the condensed consolidated interim report.

12.  Business combinations, other acquisitions and disposals
     In May 2015 the group invested R122m in Ambatana Holdings B.V. (""Ambatana""), an entity operating a hyperlocal classifieds marketplace app
     under the Letgo brand. The investment resulted in Ambatana being accounted for as an associate of the group. A further R693m was invested
     in Ambatana during September 2015, resulting in the group having a 67,5% interest on a fully diluted basis at the end of the reporting period.
     The additional investment was accounted for as a business combination with an effective date of 30 September 2015. The total purchase
     consideration amounted to R808m representing the fair value of the group's previously held equity interest in Ambatana of R473m and the
     fair value of a call option granted to the former owners of Ambatana amounting to R336m. The cash invested and cash consideration still
     payable, in aggregate amounting to R693m, remains within the group following the transaction and is accordingly not disclosed as part of the
     consideration transferred by the group or assets of Ambatana acquired, although it did affect the amount of goodwill recognised in the business
     combination. A gain of R334m has been recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the remeasurement
     of the group's previously held equity interest in Ambatana to its fair value. The purchase price allocation: property, plant and equipment R4m;
     intangible assets R231m; cash R7m; other receivables R20m; trade and other payables R39m; deferred tax liability R58m and the balance
     of R907m to goodwill. The transaction gave rise to the recognition of non-controlling interest of R264m, which has been measured at the
     non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of Ambatana as at the acquisition date. The accounting for this
     business combination, including the identification of intangible assets and the recognition of goodwill, has not been finalised and is reported
     provisionally in the condensed consolidated interim report.

     Had the revenue and net results of Ambatana been included from 1 April 2015, it would not have had a significant effect on the group's
     consolidated revenue and net results.
  
     The following relates to the group's investments in its equity-accounted investees:
  
     During April 2015 the group invested R501m in its joint venture Konga Online Shopping Limited (""Konga""). Following the additional investment,
     the group continues to exert joint control over Konga with its 50,9% interest on a fully diluted basis.
  
     The group's associate Flipkart Limited (""Flipkart"") undertook two funding rounds during April and July 2015 in which the group did not participate.
     The funding rounds resulted in a dilution of the group's interest in Flipkart and in the recognition of an aggregate net dilution gain of R1,25bn
     in ""Dilution gains/(losses) on equity-accounted investments"". Following the dilutions, the group now holds a 14,95% interest in Flipkart on a
     fully diluted basis.
  
     During May 2015 the group invested R122m in its joint venture Souq Group Limited (""Souq"") as part of a funding round. Souq undertook another
     funding round during July 2015 in which the group did not participate. These funding rounds resulted in a dilution of the group's interest in Souq
     and in the recognition of an aggregate net dilution gain of R802m in ""Dilution gains/(losses) on equity-accounted investments"". Following the
     dilutions, the group now holds a 36,88% interest in Souq on a fully diluted basis.
  
     The group invested R277m in its available-for-sale investment Avenida Inc. (""Avenida"") during July 2015. The transaction resulted in Avenida
     becoming an associate and the group now holds a 23,43% interest in Avenida on a fully diluted basis.
  
     The group invested R716m as part of a funding round of its associate Takealot Online (RF) Proprietary Limited (""Takealot"") during August 2015.
     The group now has a 42,2% interest in Takealot on a fully diluted basis.

     The following relates to significant disposals by the group during the reporting period:
 
     During September 2015 the group disposed of its interest in Ricardo.ch AG following approval of the transaction by regulatory authorities. The
     proceeds on sale amounted to R3,4bn and a gain of R1,1bn was recognised in ""Gains on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement
     following the transaction.
 
     The group disposed of its 9,9% interest in its available-for-sale investment Beijing Media Corporation during August 2015 for a cash consideration
     of R164m. The transaction resulted in the recognition of an aggregate gain on disposal of R148m, which has been recognised in ""Gains on
     acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement.
 
     Investments acquired and funding rounds participated in were funded through the utilisation of existing credit facilities and proceeds received
     from disposals during the reporting period.

13.  Issue of listed bond
     The group issued a 10-year US$1,2bn international bond in July 2015. The bond matures in July 2025 and carries a fixed interest rate of 5,5%
     per annum. The proceeds will be utilised for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain amounts on the group's offshore
     revolving credit facility and to fund the group's future growth strategy.
 
14.  Financial instruments
     The group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks such as market risk (including currency risk, fair-value interest rate risk, cash flow
     interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
 
     The condensed consolidated interim report does not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in the annual
     financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group's annual financial statements as at 31 March 2015. There have been no
     material changes in the group's credit, liquidity, market risks or key inputs used in measuring fair value since 31 March 2015.
 
     The fair values of the group's financial instruments that are measured at fair value at each reporting period are categorised as follows:

     The fair values of level 2 and 3 financial instruments are measured as follows:
     
     -  Foreign exchange contracts – market observable quotes of forward foreign exchange rates on instruments that have a similar maturity
        profile.
     
     -  Interest rate swaps – discounted cash flow techniques using only market observable information.
     
     -  Shareholders' liabilities – option pricing models and discounted cash flow techniques. Significant inputs include: fair values of underlying
        shares, strike prices, risk-free interest rates, calculated volatilities and the period to exercise.
     
     -  Earn-out obligations – discounted cash flow techniques. Key inputs include: forecasts of the extent to which performance criteria are
        expected to be met, discount rates and contractually specified earn-out payments.

15.  Events after the reporting period
     In October 2015 the group entered into an agreement with the existing shareholders of its associate Avito AB (""Avito"") for the purchase of an
     additional 50,5% interest in Avito. The cash purchase consideration amounts to US$1,2bn. The group will obtain control of Avito with its 67,9%
     interest, on a fully diluted basis, following the transaction. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.

     The group also concluded the sale of its online retail and ecommerce platform Netretail, as well as the sale of its Czech online comparison-
     shopping platform, Heureka, during October 2015. The assets and liabilities of Netretail and Heureka are presented as held for sale as at
     30 September 2015 in this condensed consolidated interim report (refer to note 11).
  
     In terms of the memorandum of incorporation (MOI) of Naspers there is an obligation to maintain the integrity of Naspers's existing control
     structure constituted by the A ordinary shares and the N ordinary shares in the share capital of the company. The voting percentage of the
     control structure companies, Naspers Beleggings (RF) Beperk and Keeromstraat 30 Beleggings (RF) Beperk, is close to falling below 50% as
     a result of the issue of Naspers N ordinary shares. The MOI provides that if the allotment and issue of N ordinary shares affects the existing
     voting relationship between the A and N shareholders, then there is an obligation on the Naspers board (""the board"") to restore the voting
     relationship by issuing further A ordinary shares to the existing holders of A ordinary shares by way of a capitalisation issue. Pursuant to its
     obligations under the MOI, the board approved that a capitalisation award of 194 607 A ordinary shares be made on 26 November 2015 on a
     pro rata basis to existing A ordinary shareholders at their par value of R20,00 per share. The effect of the capitalisation issue is to increase the
     voting percentage of the control structure companies to 54,68% and restore the voting percentage of the A ordinary shareholders to 68,38%,
     the percentage it was on 31 August 2012 being the date on which the new MOI of the company was adopted.

16.  Pro forma financial information presented in the condensed consolidated interim report
     The group has presented certain revenue and trading profit metrics on a constant currency, organic basis (""the pro forma financial information"")
     in the commentary to the condensed consolidated interim report. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the board of
     directors (""the board"") of Naspers Limited and is presented for illustrative purposes. Information presented on a pro forma basis has been
     extracted from the group's management accounts, the quality of which the board is satisfied with.

     Shareholders are advised that, due to the nature of the pro forma financial information and the fact that it has been extracted from the group's
     management accounts, it may not fairly present the group's financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.
  
     The pro forma financial information has been prepared to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and changes in the
     composition of the group on its results for the six months ended 30 September 2015. The following methodology was applied in calculating
     the pro forma financial information:

     1.  Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results to the prior period's
         average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates for that period. The organic pro forma
         financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency results, arrived at using the methodology outlined above, compared
         to the prior period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates used for the most significant currencies were: US dollar
         (2015: R12,67; 2014: R10,73), Polish zloty (2015: R3,39; 2014: R3,44), Russian rouble (2015: R0,22; 2014: R0,30), Chinese yuan renminbi
         (2015: R2,02; 2014: R1,73), Indian rupee (2015: R0,20; 2014: R0,18) and Brazilian real (2015: R3,76; 2014: R4,72).
  
     2.  Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and equity-accounted
         investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-accounted investments. The following significant changes in
         the composition of the group during the reporting period have been adjusted for in arriving at the pro forma financial information:

Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review
in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude
whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements
are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement.
We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the
entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion on these interim financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Naspers Limited for the six months ended
30 September 2015 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued
by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Other matter

We have not reviewed future financial performance and expectations expressed by the directors included in
the commentary in the accompanying interim financial statements and accordingly do not express an
opinion thereon.
