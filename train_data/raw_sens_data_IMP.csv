RESULTS OF THE ODD-LOT OFFER

Shareholders are referred to the circular issued by Implats on Monday, 14 September 2020 (“Circular”) and the SENS
announcements dated 14 September 2020, 14 October 2020 and 27 October 2020, relating to the Odd-lot Offer.
Unless otherwise defined, the definitions and interpretations contained in the Circular apply, mutatis mutandis, to the
terms used in this announcement.

The Odd-lot Offer closed on Friday, 6 November 2020, and the results thereof are as follows:

                                                                                           Total number of
                                                                                           Shares repurchased

                  retained by election    sold by election         sold by default(1)     to the Odd-lot Offer
Certificated                       381                 226                   54 528                     54 754

Total                           71 373             698 896                  326 419                  1 025 315
(1) Odd-lot Holders who did not make an election were automatically regarded as having sold their Odd-lot Holdings to
the Company.

Implats repurchased a total of 1 025 315 Shares, representing 0.131% of the total issued ordinary share capital of
Implats for a total consideration of R177 094 472.81. The Shares repurchased by the Company in terms of the Odd-lot
Offer will be cancelled and delisted on or about Wednesday, 11 November 2020, and accordingly the total issued
ordinary share capital of Implats will be reduced from 782 800 320 to 781 775 005 Shares.

Implats Shareholders’ attention is drawn to paragraph 5.2 of the Circular which showed, for illustrative purposes only,
if Implats had implemented the Odd-lot Offer on 28 August 2020, being the Last Practicable Date before the Circular
was distributed, assuming an Offer Price of R173.98 per Share, and based on Odd-lot Holdings of approximately
232 581 Shares, the financial impact on Implats, if funded from existing cash resources, would have resulted in a
reduction of cash resources of R40 464 442.38 and a reduction of total equity by R40 464 442.38.

Due to a significant increase of trading in Shares at holdings below 100 Shares between Tuesday, 27 October 2020
and Tuesday, 3 November 2020 (being the last day to trade to participate in the Odd-lot Offer), the number of Odd-lot
Holdings increased from 232 581 to 1 096 688 Shares. As a result, the Company has repurchased a total of 1 025 315
Shares at the Offer Price of R172.72 per Share (as contained in the finalisation announcement dated 27 October
2020), totalling R177 094 472.81, which was funded from existing cash resources, resulting in a reduction of cash
resources of R177 094 472.81 and a reduction of total equity by R177 094 472.81.

Notwithstanding the largely increased Odd-lot Offer amount, the Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer process
achieved the desired outcomes for the Company as set out in the Circular whilst also facilitating an increased
repurchase of the Company’s Shares, which Implats believes is in the best interests of Shareholders.

Implats Shareholders are reminded of the following remaining salient dates and times in relation to the Odd-lot Offer:

                                                                                                         2020

First quarter production report for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 September 2020

Key highlights

   •   Zero fatalities and a 7% and 26% improvement in the reported lost-time injury and all
       injury frequency rates, respectively

   •   An 11% increase in total 6E concentrate volumes to 859 000 ounces, with an 11% gain
       in managed volumes to 623 000 ounces, a 23% increase in JV production to 142 000
       ounces and a 6% decline in third-party receipts to 94 000 ounces

   •   A 58% improvement in gross 6E refined and saleable production volumes to 870 000
       ounces on improved availability at Group processing assets and the inclusion of
       contributions from Impala Canada

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Implats has delivered a strong start
to FY2021 with pleasing improvements in safety and a number of notable operational gains.
This was achieved despite the continuing challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic and
is testament to the operational resilience our team has worked so hard to develop and entrench.
Production losses attributable to the pandemic in the quarter were minimal and our health,
safety and operating protocols have proved effective in mitigating the impact of the virus on our
operations, employees, host communities and customers. PGM pricing remains robust and we
continue to experience strong demand for our primary products. We are well positioned to
continue delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders in the year ahead.”

HEALTH AND SAFETY
Implats’ goal is to eliminate harm to the health and safety of our employees and contractors.
Effectively managing workplace health and safety risks, therefore, remains a key priority in
achieving the Group’s vision of zero harm. Focused attention across all operations and targeted
precautionary measures have mitigated the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic
and Implats has delivered an improved safety performance in the quarter under review.

Management of the Covid-19 pandemic required extensive revisions to operating practices over
the course of 2020, with additional care required to ensure the safe start-up of operations
following Covid-related restrictions and interruptions. Pleasingly, the infection rate across the
Group, which peaked in June 2020, has maintained a steady downward trend throughout the
first quarter of FY2021. To date, the Group has recorded 2 137 infections and currently has 17
active cases.

The Group operated without a fatal incident during the quarter. The lost-time injury rate of 4.91
per million-man hours worked improved by 7% from 5.27 recorded in the first quarter of FY2020,
the all injury frequency rate of 9.19 per million-man hours worked improved by 27% over the
same period.

PRODUCTION
Gross tonnes milled at managed operations improved by 18% to 6.13 million tonnes during the
quarter, compared to 5.21 million tonnes achieved in the prior comparable period. The increase
was primarily due to the maiden inclusion of Impala Canada, but production gains at Marula
also aided this performance and helped offset slightly lower milled volumes from Impala
Rustenburg and Zimplats. The resolution of milling challenges experienced at our joint ventures
(JVs) resulted in higher volumes from both Two Rivers and Mimosa during the period.

As a result, 6E in concentrate production of 623 000 ounces at managed operations was 11%
higher than in the prior comparable quarter. JV production from Mimosa and Two Rivers
increased by 23% and helped offset the impact of lower third-party receipts in the period. Total
6E concentrate volumes rose by 82 000 ounces, or 11%, to 859 000 ounces.

Refined 6E production in the prior comparable period was significantly impacted by planned
maintenance at the Zimplats furnace and Impala Rustenburg’s smelting complex, which
constrained processing capacity. During the period under review, gross refined volumes
benefitted from the accelerated processing maintenance across the Group and the inclusion of
saleable production from Impala Canada. In total, gross refined 6E production increased by
58% to 870 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 551 000 ounces).

Impala
Milled production at Impala Rustenburg decreased by 2% to 2.96 million tonnes negatively
impacted by the residual effect of Covid-19 on labour availability, declining reserves at the short-
life shafts (6 and 9 shafts) and increased Eskom power failures. Higher delivered grade of 3.93
g/t (Q1 FY2020: 3.88 g/t) and improved recoveries and yield gains resulted in stable 6E in
concentrate production of 346 000 ounces. Refined 6E production increased significantly to
372 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 184 000 ounces) and benefitted from greater availability of
processing capacity due to the timing of scheduled maintenance in the previous comparable
period.

Marula
Marula continues to deliver improvements in operational momentum. Tonnes milled increased
by 8% to 525 000 tonnes (Q1 FY2020: 488 000 tonnes), benefitting from a quick ramp up
following Covid-related interruptions, a step change in safety performance, the notable absence
of community disruptions and improved mining performance. Mill grade decreased by 2% to
4.33 g/t (6E) (Q1 FY2020: 4.43 g/t) but 6E in concentrate production improved in line with higher
milled tonnage to 68 000 ounces during the period (Q1 FY2020: 63 000 ounces).

Zimplats
Zimplats continues to benefit from uninterrupted operation and remained relatively unaffected
by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mined tonnage increased by 2% due to improved fleet productivity
and increased production from the new Mupani Mine, which is still in development. Mill
throughput of 1.67 million tonnes declined marginally due to planned maintenance at the Ngezi
concentrator during the quarter, while grade and recoveries were stable, resulting in a 2%
decline in 6E concentrate produced of 148 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 151 000 ounces). Routine
smelter maintenance in Q1 FY2020 resulted in elevated matte volumes relative to concentrate
production during that quarter, which normalised in the current period. As a consequence, 6E
volume in matte was 6% lower at 142 000 ounces.

Impala Canada
Operational delivery during the first quarter was impacted by the residual impact of Covid-
related challenges at the mine site and planned underground infrastructure enhancements,
which were completed in the period under review. Milled throughput of 980 000 tonnes and a
6E head grade of 2.48 g/t yielded 6E in concentrate production of 61 000 ounces.

Mimosa
The impact of Covid-19 infections in the broader Mimosa community were well controlled,
benefitting from the protocols and practices implemented at the onset of the pandemic. In Q1
FY2020, concentrate production at Mimosa lagged mined volumes due to extended repairs to
the milling circuit. In the period under review, mined volumes improved by 12%, while milled
tonnage of 724 000 tonnes and 6E in concentrate production of 67 000 ounces both improved
by 23% from the previous comparable quarter.

Two Rivers
The delayed return of foreign employees following Covid-related national border closures
impacted staffing levels at Two Rivers in the early weeks of the reporting period, but the mine
had returned to full staffing and production levels by mid-quarter. Concentrate production
volumes in Q1 FY2020 were heavily impacted by extended maintenance and metallurgical
challenges at the concentrator plant, which were resolved during FY2020. In the period under
review, tonnes milled were flat at 802 000 tonnes (Q1 FY2020: 798 000 tonnes), while a 1%
decrease in mill grade to 3.37g/t was more than compensated for by improved plant
performance and recoveries. As a result, 6E production in concentrate rose by 23% to 75 000
ounces (Q1 FY2020: 61 000 ounces).

Impala Refining Services (“IRS”)
Gross receipts at IRS increased by 18% to 474 000 6E ounces (Q1 FY2020: 399 000 ounces).
The rebound in mine-to-market deliveries marginally offset weaker third-party deliveries, which
declined by 6% or 6 000 ounces. Refined production increased by 21% to 443 000 ounces (Q1
FY2020: 366 000 ounces) with volumes benefitting from improved availability at Group
processing facilities.

On 3 September 2020 the board of directors of Implats determined to pay a final cash dividend
of 400 cents per ordinary share payable on 28 September 2020. The ruling rand to pound
sterling conversion rate on 24 September 2020 of R21.6151 to GBP1.00 will be used in
calculating the sterling amount payable to shareholders registered in the United Kingdom
section of the share register. This converted amount equates to a pre-tax interim cash dividend
of 18,50558 pence per ordinary share to United Kingdom registered shareholders.

PROPOSED ODD-LOT OFFER AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE CIRCULAR AND NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING

1.     Introduction and rationale

     As at 28 August 2020, Implats had a total of 10 123 ordinary shareholders (“Odd-lot
     Holders”) each holding less than 100 Implats ordinary shares of no par value (“Implats
     Shares”) (“Odd-lot Holdings”), holding a total of 232 581 Implats Shares, representing only
     0.03% of the total issued share capital of Implats. Odd-lot Holders represent 48.7% of the
     total number of ordinary shareholders (“Implats Shareholders”) in the Company. The
     recurring administrative costs for the Odd-Lot Holders is disproportionately large relative to
     the small size of their Odd-lot Holdings and negatively affects all Implats Shareholders. To
     reduce the administrative time and costs associated with the Company’s shareholder base,
     the board of directors of Implats (“Board”) has proposed the implementation of an odd-lot
     offer (“Odd-lot Offer”) to facilitate the reduction in these Odd-lot Holders in a fair manner,
     which will result in the repurchase by the Company of the Odd-lot Holdings from the Odd-lot
     Holders at the offer price, being at a 10% premium to the 30-calendar day volume weighted
     average price (“VWAP”) of an Implats Share at the close of business on Monday, 26 October
     2020 (“Offer Price”).

     The Odd-lot Offer will provide Odd-lot Holders with the ability to dispose of their Odd-lot
     Holdings on an efficient basis and will provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect
     not to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election, in which case such Odd-lot
     Holders will be deemed to have agreed to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings. Odd-lot Holders
     will sell their Odd-lot Holdings to Implats and receive the Offer Price in cash (“Cash
     Consideration”). Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings.

     An odd-lot offer is a ‘standard’ corporate action undertaken by JSE-listed companies and is
     permitted by the Company’s memorandum of incorporation (“MoI”). For Implats to implement
     the Odd-lot Offer, the directors are seeking approval from Implats Shareholders to (i) effect
     certain required amendments to the MoI (“MoI Amendments”), and (ii) implement the Odd-
     lot Offer.

2.   MoI Amendments

     Paragraph 1(2)(n) and (o) read together with paragraph 14 of the MoI provides that if the
     Company makes an Odd-lot Offer, Odd-lot Holders may elect to increase their Odd-lot
     Holding to 100 Shares (“top-up provision”). The top-up provision was contained in historic
     versions of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements and was included in the MoI. The
     top-up provision was repealed by the JSE in c. 2007. Accordingly, in order to align the MoI
     with the JSE Listings Requirements and current practice, Implats Shareholder approval is
     being sought to give effect to the MoI Amendments to remove the sections in the MoI allowing
     for the top-up provision.

3.   Key terms of the Odd-lot Offer

     The Odd-lot Offer will be subject to Implats Shareholder approval (“Shareholder Approval”).

     In order to (i) provide Odd-lot Holders with an opportunity to realise the value of their
     investment without suffering dealing charges which might otherwise make it impractical to
     sell their holding, and to provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect not to retain
     their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election and; (ii) from the Company’s perspective, to
     reduce the costs and complexity of managing a large number of Odd-lot Holders, Implats has
     decided to proceed with the implementation of the Odd-lot Offer to repurchase the Implats
     Shares from the Odd-lot Holders at the Offer Price. For purposes of payment of the Offer
     Price to Odd-lot Holders on the United Kingdom share register, the Offer Price will be
     converted at the GBP/ZAR exchange rate at the close of business on Monday, 26 October
     2020.

     Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or sell their Odd-lot Holdings
     at the Offer Price. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election by 12:00 (SA
     time) and 10:00 (UK time, for Odd-lot Holders on the United Kingdom register) on
     Friday, 6 November 2020 will automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-
     lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings.

4.   Circular and notice of general meeting

     For Implats to implement the Odd-lot Offer, the Board is seeking approval from Implats
     Shareholders to give effect to the MoI Amendments and to implement the Odd-lot Offer, and
     is therefore convening a general meeting of Implats Shareholders (“General Meeting”), to
     be held through electronic communication on Wednesday, 14 October 2020 at 12:00 (SA
     time) or 11:00 (UK time), at which all Implats Shareholders will be entitled to vote on the
     resolutions required to give effect to the MoI Amendments and to implement the Odd-lot
     Offer. A circular (“Circular”), containing details of the MoI Amendments and the Odd-lot
     Offer, together with a notice of General Meeting (“Notice of General Meeting”), will be
     posted to Implats shareholders on Monday, 14 September 2020.

5.   Odd-lot Offer mechanics

     Following receipt of Shareholder Approval, the Odd-lot Offer will open and Odd-lot Holders
     must decide to either:

     •          sell their Odd-lot Holding to Implats at the Offer Price; or

     •          retain their Odd-lot Holding.

     If Odd-lot Holders wish to retain their Implats Shares, they must specifically make an election
     to do so. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will automatically be regarded
     as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Implats Shares to Implats
     and will receive the Cash Consideration.

6.   Salient dates and times
                                                                                                  2020

                their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election, are specifically referred to paragraph 8.2 of
                the Circular as regards the processing and payment of their Cash Consideration.

7.     Tax considerations

       The Board has specifically resolved that the Odd-lot Offer will be distributed as a return of
       capital and will result in a reduction of ‘contributed tax capital’ as defined in section 1 of the
       South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, as amended. The Cash Consideration will
       therefore not be regarded as a dividend for South African income tax purposes. Implats
       Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax and/or other professional advisors
       regarding the taxation implications arising out of the acceptance of the Odd-lot Offer.

Commentary
Safety remains the Group's foremost priority. In a 
period marked by unexpected public health and associated 
operational challenges, Implats recorded 14% and 11% 
improvements in the lost-time and total injury frequency 
rates, respectively. Despite these gains, Implats mourns 
the loss of five employees at managed operations and two 
employees at joint ventures during FY2020.

The strategic repositioning of Implats over the past 
several years enabled the Group to successfully navigate 
the challenges created by the external shock of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Operational resilience enabled 
sustained delivery of refined metal to customers and 
the Group benefitted from robust pricing for primary 
products and achieved record financial results.

The coronavirus pandemic significantly disrupted and 
impacted business performance during the second half 
of the financial year and resulted in an opportunity 
cost of mine-to-market concentrate production of 290 000 
6E ounces. The release of previously identified excess 
inventory mitigated the impact on reported production and 
refined 6E production declined by 8% to 2.8 million ounces.

Reported unit costs were impacted by lower volumes, 
additional investment in development and changes in ore 
mix, which impacted yield. These compounded the impact of 
inflationary pressures and a weaker rand, increasing 
stock-adjusted unit costs by 12% to R13 345 per 6E ounce. 
This excludes abnormal production costs of R1.3 billion. 
If these were included, stock adjusted unit costs would 
have increased by 18% to R14 067 per 6E ounce.

Pricing for the Group's primary products was robust and, 
together with rand depreciation, drove substantial 
improvements in the Groups' financial performance. Revenue 
improved by 44% to R69.9 billion, gross profit increased to
R23.3 billion and headline earnings increased to R16.1 billion
- or R20.75 per share.

The Group generated R14.4 billion of free cash flow after 
capital investment of R4.2 billion and ended FY2020 with 
gross cash of R13.3 billion, net cash of R5.7 billion and 
liquidity headroom of R16.1 billion, notwithstanding the 
acquisition of Impala Canada, the payment of the R973 million 
interim dividend and expenditure incurred to induce the early 
conversion of the US$250 million bond.

Gains in safety and efficiency at Impala Rustenburg resulted 
in upward revisions to the planned production profile at the 
operating complex, negating the need for large-scale 
retrenchments. In Zimbabwe, operations continued to excel 
despite increasing socioeconomic pressures. The operational 
turnaround and renewed social stability at Marula sustained, 
yielding substantial financial value and, at Two Rivers, a 
project to increase processing capacity was approved and 
advanced during the year. The competitiveness of the Groups' 
portfolio was enhanced by the acquisition of Impala Canada, 
a mechanised, high-margin primary palladium producer which 
further diversified Implats' operating footprint.

Strengthened relationships with key stakeholders were 
affirmed by a multi-year wage agreement concluded without 
third-party intervention. A strong environmental performance 
underpinned the continued commitment to responsible 
corporate stewardship.

Meaningful advances were made to strengthen the Group 
balance sheet through the reduction of debt and dividend 
payments were reinstated. The capital allocation framework 
adopted during the year will serve to guide the effective 
future allocation of financial resources.

Production rates at most operations normalised back to 
near full capacity by year end and the risk of material 
disruptions as a result of the pandemic are now steadily 
receding.

FY2021 production volumes will be supported through the 
planned release of accumulated inventory. Group refined 
production is estimated at between 2.8 and 3.4 million 6E 
ounces. Implats expects Group stock-adjusted operating costs 
of between R14 500 and R15 500 per 6E ounce and capital
expenditure of between R6.0 and R6.8 billion. This guidance 
is based on an assumed R/US$ and C$/US$ exchange rate of 
R16.63/US$ and C$1.35/US$, respectively and does not account 
for further potential Covid-related public health disruptions.

The financial information on which this outlook is based has 
not been reviewed and reported on by Implats' external 
auditors.

Declaration of dividend
Shareholders are advised that the board has resolved to 
declare a final gross cash dividend of R4.00 per ordinary 
share for the financial year ended 30 June 2020. The final 
dividend has been declared in terms of the dividend policy 
previously communicated to shareholders. The dividend policy 
states that a dividend will be declared from 30% of free cash
flow, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the 
board's discretion. The final cash dividend is in addition to 
the interim cash dividend of R1.25 declared in February 2020, 
bringing the total dividend for the financial year to R5.25
per ordinary share.

Implats has 799 034 147 ordinary shares in issue and the 
Company's tax reference number is 9700178719. The cash dividend 
will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax for 
shareholders who are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, 
a reduced rate of withholding tax. Therefore, the net dividend 
amount is R3.20 per ordinary share for shareholders liable to 
pay the dividend withholding tax and R4.00 per ordinary share 
for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding tax. 
Shareholders are advised to complete the requisite declaration 
form to make the Company aware of their tax status. The
salient dates are as follows:

Declaration date:                 Thursday, 3 September 2020
Last day for trading to be
eligible for cash dividend:       Monday, 21 September 2020
Trading ex-dividend commences:    Tuesday, 22 September 2020
Record date:                      Friday, 25 September 2020
Dividend payment date:            Monday, 28 September 2020

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised 
between Tuesday, 22 September 2020 and Friday, 25 September
2020, both days inclusive.

     PROPOSED REPURCHASE OF IMPLATS TREASURY SHARES FROM A SUBSIDIARY

1.   Introduction
     Developing an optimal capital structure remains a key strategic imperative for Implats. The Group
     seeks to create value by sustaining and leveraging a strong and flexible balance sheet within a
     prudent capital allocation framework.

     During FY2020, substantial progress was made in this regard through the induced conversion of
     the US$250 million bond, the funding of the acquisition of Impala Canada through a combination
     of cash and debt, and the implementation of a revised dividend policy based on a declaration of at
     least 30% of free cash flow, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the discretion of the
     board of directors of Implats (""Board"").

     In addition, the Board has approved the cancellation of treasury shares, which are currently held
     by a subsidiary of the Group. While this is a non-cash transaction for Implats, in order to effect this,
     the Company, Impala Platinum Limited (""Impala"") and Gazelle Platinum Limited (“Gazelle”) (both
     Impala and Gazelle being subsidiaries of Implats) have entered into a repurchase agreement dated
     26 August 2020 in terms of which Implats will repurchase 16 233 994 ordinary shares currently
     held by Gazelle in the issued share capital of Implats (the “Specific Repurchase”).

     As certain shareholder approvals are required to effect the Specific Repurchase, full details of the
     Specific Repurchase will be incorporated in the notice of annual general meeting which is expected
     to be distributed to shareholders on or about Monday, 14 September 2020 and will include a special
     resolution relating to the Specific Repurchase. The annual general meeting is scheduled to be held
     on Wednesday, 14 October 2020.

2.   Terms of the Specific Repurchase
     2.1.   The price at which the 16 233 994 ordinary shares are to be repurchased will be equal to the
            closing market price as quoted on the JSE Limited of an Implats ordinary share on the day
            immediately preceding the date of the Specific Repurchase, being Friday, 16 October 2020.

     2.2.   The effective date of the Specific Repurchase will be Monday, 19 October 2020.

     2.3.   The Specific Repurchase represents 2.03% of the current ordinary shares in issue.
     2.4.   The ordinary shares to be repurchased in terms of the Specific Repurchase are reflected as
            treasury shares in the consolidated annual financial statements of Implats. Subsequent to
            the Specific Repurchase, application will be made to the JSE for the cancellation and
            delisting of the 16 233 994 Implats ordinary shares, which delisting and cancellation will take
            place on or about Thursday, 22 October 2020.

     2.5.   After the Specific Repurchase, there will be 4 613 469 treasury shares in issue which are
            held in terms of the Implats LTIP 2018 Share Plan.

3.   Suspensive conditions
     The Specific Repurchase is subject to the following suspensive conditions:

     3.1.   shareholders of Implats passing the requisite special resolution required to approve the
            Specific Repurchase at the annual general meeting of Implats to be held on Wednesday, 14
            October 2020; and

     3.2.   JSE approval of the Specific Repurchase.

4.   Impact of the Specific Repurchase on financial information
     As the Specific Repurchase involves the repurchase by Implats of treasury shares, the Board
     confirms that the implementation of the Specific Repurchase will have no impact on the financial
     information of Implats, other than reducing the number of ordinary shares in issue, increasing the
     inter-company loan accounts and the payment of Securities Transfer Tax on the cancellation of the
     16 233 994 Implats ordinary shares.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Implats will release its results for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“the period”) on or about
3 September 2020.

Implats issued a trading statement on SENS on 23 July 2020 indicating that it expected to
report that both basic and headline earnings per share for the period had improved by
significantly more than 20% than those reported for the year ended 30 June 2019 (“the
comparative period”). Implats now has reasonable certainty on its earnings and therefore
advises shareholders of the following:

Implats’ headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the period are
expected to be between R15 600 million and R16 200 million and between 2 007 cents and
2 084 cents per share, respectively. This represents an increase of between 413% and 433%
for headline earnings and an increase of between 374% and 393% for HEPS. Headline
earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R3 038 million and 423 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period are expected to be between
R15 810 million and R16 100 million and between 2 034 cents and 2 072 cents per share,
respectively. This represents an increase of between 975% and 994% for basic earnings and
an increase of between 892% and 911% for EPS. Basic earnings and EPS in the comparative
period were R1 471 million and 205 cents respectively.

Group operations have delivered production volumes at the top-end of the guided range
provided to the market on 24 June 2020, despite the impact of Covid-19.

The benefit of a significant increase in the dollar basket price for PGMs, together with rand
depreciation, has resulted in a meaningful increase in gross profit, which is expected to
increase to R23 billion in the period from R7 billion in the comparative period, despite an
expected 5% decline in refined and saleable PGMs to 2.8 million 6E ounces relative to the
comparative period.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the period increased from 718.6 million
to 777.2 million due to the issue of 64.3 million Implats ordinary shares on 1 August 2019, after
US$ bond holders elected to exercise their option to convert their bonds into Implats ordinary
shares.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of Implats.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Implats will release its results for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“the period”) on or about
3 September 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading
statement on SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for
the period to be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

A significant increase in the dollar basket price for PGMs, together with rand depreciation, has
resulted in a higher rand PGM basket price received by the Group during the period.
Consequently, Implats is expecting headline earnings and headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) for the period, to be significantly more than 20% higher than that reported for the
year ended 30 June 2019 (“the comparative period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period were R3 038 million and 423 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are also expected to be significantly more
than 20% higher than the comparative period primarily due to the improvement in rand PGM

June 2020 market update

Implats refers to its SENS announcement of 30 April 2020 which provided revised Group
guidance for FY2020. The Group cautioned at the time as to the fluidity of the operating
environment created by the Covid-19 pandemic and its potential impact on guided production
parameters. Implats is therefore pleased to provide a further market update ahead of its closed
period starting 30 June 2020.

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Several innovative solutions have
been developed by our management teams including different cycles of work and staggered
shift systems aimed at enabling the best possible precautionary measures against the spread
of Covid-19 among our employees. Through collaboration and co-operation between
employees, union structures and management, we have created safer workplaces, and, a
better-than-expected production performance across Group operations in the final quarter of
FY2020.

Logistical constraints have eased and, despite the undeniable impact of the pandemic on
global economic activity, demand for metal from our customers has remained robust, allowing
us to capitalise on a reduction in excess inventory and a period of robust rand PGM pricing.

As the pandemic progresses in the coming months, we expect to face increasing challenges
to our medical preparedness and operational resilience. The benefit of experience gained by
our team over the past few months, together with the geographical diversification of our
operational footprint and the strong financial position of the Group, will prove vital to
successfully navigating the expected variability in the near-term operating environment.”

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE FOR FY2020

South Africa

The nationwide lockdown in South Africa, implemented on 26 March 2020, imposed legislated
limits on staffing levels at Impala Rustenburg, Marula and the joint venture at Two Rivers, but
made allowances for continued operations at the Group’s processing operations.

From 1 June 2020, restrictions on staffing levels were uplifted. However, the need for a
prudent and phased approach to intra-provincial travel by employees, particularly those
identified as returning from ‘hot spots’, has continued to limit attendance levels at operations
in Limpopo and the North West. Implats has made use of mandatory quarantine and isolation
protocols for returning workers from ‘hot spot’ areas to minimise the risk of transmission to its
workforce and host communities. In addition, South Africa’s national borders remain closed
and circa 5% of Group employees remain in their home countries.

Despite these limitations on staffing, the ramp-up of production has surpassed initial
expectations, with revised operating protocols proving effective in mitigating the impact of
potential virus-related interruptions at the Group’s South African mines, which had returned to
circa 85% of capacity by mid-June 2020.

Infection rates are expected to peak in South Africa in the coming months, and the challenges
associated with screening and identifying Covid-19 cases will be further complicated by the
prevalence of seasonal influenza. It remains Implats’ view that much of FY2021 will be
characterised by a ‘BUSINESS UNUSUAL’ operating environment.

Impala Refining Services (IRS)

Force majeure notices instituted on IRS customers from 26 March 2020 were uplifted in a
phased approach in May and June 2020. Excess concentrate and matte inventory
accumulated by customers (including Group operations) during the force majeure period are
expected to be received in full by Q1 FY2021.

Smelters and refineries were identified as ‘essential services’ during the national lockdown in
South Africa and the systematic ramp-up of operations and continued, albeit reduced,
production of refined volumes has resulted in the Group being able to fully refine the previously
identified excess in-process PGM inventory. As a result, refined and sales volumes will exceed
concentrate production in FY2020.

Given production rates relative to plan in FY2020, a decision was made to bring forward the
annual acid plant maintenance scheduled for July 2020. This is expected to result in greater-
than-usual alignment of processing and mining capacity in Q1 FY2021 but will have a small
impact on the FY2020 year-end processing inventory.

Implats declared force majeure on its contractual deliveries of final metal to its customers when
the national lockdown in South Africa was announced on 23 March 2020. This was uplifted on
22 June 2020. Prior to this upliftment, discussions for customer deliveries were conducted
monthly. To date, the overwhelming majority of Implats’ customers have elected to receive
their metal rather than exercise their right under force majeure to cancel deliveries. Logistical
constraints have eased with the resumption of international flights, such that these no longer
pose a risk to Implats’ ability to deliver metal.

Zimbabwe

Both Zimplats and the joint venture at Mimosa have operated uninterrupted and well within
pre-Covid-19 FY2020 guidance. Despite the indefinite extension of the national lockdown,
permission to continue mining operations remains in place and, to date, potential risks to output
associated with virus-related employee attendance and supply chain and logistical challenges
have not materialised. Residual concentrate and matte inventory accumulated in-country
during the IRS force majeure period is expected to be delivered to our Rustenburg processing
facilities in full by Q1 FY2021.

Canada

At Impala Canada, an outbreak of Covid-19 at the operation in mid-April 2020, necessitated
the temporary cessation of mining operations. The progress of the pandemic in Canada and
the “fly-in, fly-out” staffing model also required an appropriately cautious approach to re-staffing
and re-starting operations at Lac des Iles, with the mine expected to return to full production in
Q1 FY2021.

Capital investment

Implats’ capital allocation framework highlights the importance of appropriate levels of capital
investment to support operational resilience and environmental compliance. Interruptions to
operational activity across the Group as a result of national lockdowns has impacted the ability
to spend to plan in FY2020. Lower guidance therefore reflects the impact of business
interruption rather than a deliberate reduction of investment spend.

Implats elects not to exercise its option to increase its stake in the Waterberg Project

Implats refers to its SENS announcement of 16 October 2017, regarding its strategic
investment in the Waterberg Development Project (the project) and its right to acquire majority
ownership in the project through the exercise of a sale and subscription option following
completion of a definitive feasibility study (“DFS”). The Board of Implats has elected not to
exercise the current option arrangement to acquire up to 50.1% from the joint venture partners
(""JV partners""). Implats will, however, retain its 15% ownership in the project.

The original investment decision was informed by Implats’ stated strategy to rebalance its
portfolio of mining assets towards lower risk, shallow and mechanisable orebodies. The final
decision to increase participation in the project was always dependent on the outcomes of the
DFS. Following completion of this study, which was approved by the JV partners in December
2019, the following key considerations, among others, were considered in assessing the
Group’s appetite for increasing its participation in the project:

     •   The long-term PGM demand outlook combined with the project schedule and
         production ramp-up profile.
     •   Implats’ funding and return requirements at 50.01% shareholding in the context of the
         Group’s capital allocation framework, which prioritises balance sheet strength and
         shareholder returns.
     •   More recently, the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economic
         outlook.
     •   Investor financing appetite for large greenfield projects in general.

After taking these considerations into account, the Implats Board resolved that the Group will
not exercise its option to increase its shareholding in the project at this time.

Implats reiterates its support for both the project and its JV partners. The Group intends to
remain an active participant in the project at its current 15% shareholding, including funding its
share of costs depending on future implementation decisions taken by all the JV partners.

In addition, the Group confirms that its rights relating to the concentrate offtake from the project
remains unchanged and affirms its commitment to continue negotiations in this regard with the
JV partners in good faith.

Costs associated with further study and optimisation work to de-risk the project implementation
programme will continue to be funded by Implats, up to a maximum of R55 million as previously
announced, with planned studies expected to be complete by mid-August 2020.

Notification in terms of Section 45(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008

Following the completion of the acquisition of North American Palladium Limited (""NAP"") in
December 2019, the Company earlier this year finalised the process of refinancing the bridge
loan facility which was utilised by the Company and its subsidiaries to fund the acquisition of
NAP, as well as NAPs existing working capital facilities (the ""Acquisition Debt""), through
various means. This included the conclusion of a USD 275,000,000 term and revolving credit
facility by NAP (renamed Impala Canada Ltd.) which is guaranteed by the Company, Impala
Holdings Limited and Impala Platinum Limited.
The Company is also pleased to announce that it has amended its rand revolving credit facility
(""Rand Facility"") made available to the Company and guaranteed by Impala Platinum Limited
so that the Company will be entitled to request access to additional credit facilities of up to
ZAR2,000,000,000 under the same facility agreement should the need for additional liquidity
arise in the next 12 months. The amendments require the Company to confirm the financial
assistance in the form of indemnities provided to its subsidiary as contemplated in Section 45
of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the ""Companies Act"").

As part of its treasury management activities, the Company has refreshed approvals for the
following intercompany loans granted to certain subsidiaries:

Impala Platinum Limited       ZAR5,316,283,530
Gazelle Platinum Limited      ZAR199,679,283
Impala Holdings Limited       ZAR11,345,697,296

In addition, the Board of directors (the ""Board"") has authorised that the Company may, as
required from time to time over the next six months, provide direct or indirect financial
assistance - as contemplated in section 45 of the Companies Act - of up to a maximum
ZAR500,000,000 in aggregate, to any of its present or future related or inter-related companies
or corporations (including in the form of intercompany loans, guarantees to Eskom and the
Department of Mineral Resources, and cash management arrangements) (""Intercompany
Financial Assistance"").

Further, the Board has authorised that the Company may, as required from time to time over
the next six months, provide financial assistance - as contemplated in Section 44 and Section
45 of the Companies Act - of up to a maximum ZAR20,000,000 in terms of the Impala Platinum
Holdings Limited Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2012 (""2012 LTIP"") (“LTIP 2012
Financial Assistance”).

Accordingly, notice is hereby given that, in terms of the provisions of Section 45(5) of the
Companies Act, and pursuant to the special resolution passed at the general meeting held on
17 October 2018, the Board has adopted resolutions to provide the financial assistance in
relation to the Acquisition Debt, the Rand Facility and the Intercompany Financial Assistance
to direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company and in terms of the 2012 LTIP.
Shareholders are advised that the total value of the aforesaid financial assistance will exceed
one-tenth of 1% of the Company's net worth as at the date of the last meeting of the Board,
being 4 June 2020 and, as a consequence has triggered this notice in terms of section 45(5)
of the Companies Act.

Having considered all reasonable financial circumstances of the Company in terms of and
pursuant to the provisions of Section 45 as read with Section 4 of the Companies Act, the
Board satisfied itself that:

  •    immediately after providing the financial assistance referred to above, the Company
       would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test contemplated in Section 4 of the
       Companies Act;
  •    all relevant conditions and restrictions relating to the granting of such financial
       assistance by the Company contained in the Company's memorandum of
       incorporation are satisfied; and
  •    the terms and conditions on which such financial assistance is to be given are fair and
       reasonable to the Company.

RETIREMENT OF A DIRECTOR

Implats announces the planned retirement of Dr Mandla Gantsho as an independent non-
executive director and Chairman of the Board of directors of Implats (“the Board”) in
accordance with paragraph 3.59(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements. Dr Gantsho’s
retirement will take effect on conclusion of the scheduled annual general meeting of the
Company on 14 October 2020. Dr Gantsho was appointed to the Board in November 2010 as
a non-executive director and appointed Chairman in October 2015.

Implats CEO Nico Muller said: “Dr Gantsho has led the Board through some of the most testing
times in the history of both the broader PGM industry and the Group. His wise and steady-
handed stewardship of our leadership throughout his tenure as Chairman will be sorely missed.
Thanks in no small part to his clarity of vision and courageous leadership, Dr Gantsho leaves
the Group in a significantly stronger position with Implats now well equipped to navigate the
current challenging operating and economic environment that we find ourselves in. We are all
deeply grateful for his guidance and contribution over the years. On behalf of the Board and
the greater Implats team, I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Dr Gantsho for his
outstanding contribution over the past decade of Board service.”

The Board has started a process to appoint a new Chairman. Shareholders will be notified
once a candidate has been nominated and appointed.

Third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2020

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Implats continued to make excellent
progress in delivering a strengthened operational performance across the Group in a period
characterised by robust pricing for our primary products. The emergence of the coronavirus
pandemic has however, heralded a time of unprecedented uncertainty, which will require new
ways of thinking and innovative solutions to challenges we have not faced as a company before.

Implats is faced with nationwide lockdowns and legislated limitations on operating and
production capacity across all our operations aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. The
geographical spread of our operations has allowed mining production to continue during the
lockdown periods, albeit in varying degrees in different geographies, while the continued
production of refined metal has provided an opportunity to reduce excess in-process inventory.

The impact of the coronavirus will be a feature for some time and, in our view, operating in a
‘business as usual’ environment will not be possible until effective prevention and treatment
measures become readily available. Our internal planning to secure operational resilience
during the coronavirus pandemic has been ongoing since its emergence in early 2020. Our
primary focus remains on protecting the safety and health of our employees while sustaining
operational delivery as far as possible. The Group has taken decisive steps to secure and
sustain financial viability and continues to engage actively with the governments where we
operate, given the significant contribution we make to both local and national economies.

The Group’s focus for the remaining months of FY2020 will be multipronged and will include
securing operational stability in a period where unplanned interruptions are likely to be a regular
feature; protecting the health and wellbeing of our employees; maintaining close and
collaborative relationships with our customers; and further reducing the Group’s excess
processing stockpile to secure cashflow and protect our financial position.”

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Increased leadership focus and greater collaboration with all stakeholders, to prioritise safe
production across all operations, has yielded positive results and no fatalities were reported at
managed operations during the quarter under review. Regrettably, Mimosa, a non-managed
joint venture operation, recorded a fatal injury on 24 March 2020 when the late Stephen Chizola
was fatally injured in a fall-of-ground accident. The Board of Directors and management team
have extended their sincere sympathies to the family and friends of our colleague.

The lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and all injury frequency rates were 4.87 and
11.86 per million man hours worked, respectively, an improvement of 6% on both metrics from
those reported in FY2019. Nine of the 17 Group operations were on millionaire or multi-
millionaire status in terms of fatality free shifts at the end of the reporting period.

The Group fully supports the implementation of national lockdown measures to help curb the
spread of coronavirus, recognising the significant threat it represents to employees and
communities where we operate and we are cognisant of the role Implats must play in complying
with these measures.

Implats has implemented and enforced several measures to provide further health protection to
employees, rolling out several programmes which have been in development internally since
the threat of coronavirus emerged. The lockdown period was used to significantly strengthen
these preparations. Stock levels of medical protective equipment and PPE have been
increased, regular large-scale disinfection of workplaces is being performed and screening and
testing procedures for all employees reporting to work have been implemented. A meaningful
increase in medical care preparedness was also undertaken through further increasing the
capacity of the Group’s comprehensive internal medical facilities and through the coordinated
collaboration with industry peers, public/private partnerships and both local and regional
medical institutions.

Management teams across all Group operations have introduced risk-based operating
procedures to further protect employees. These measures are specifically aimed at reducing
the risk of viral infections in high-risk work areas and to vulnerable employee categories. These
steps include modifying at-risk employee behaviour, improved hygiene practices, restrictions on
the amount of work performed, social distancing while performing work and while travelling to
and from work, the provision of additional PPE where social distancing is not possible and the
implementation of screening and testing procedures.

Employees are screened using questionnaires, thermo-scanning of skin temperature, and if
necessary, core temperature screening, before entering their work areas. Employees with risk
indicators are isolated at dedicated areas at the operations and then transported to designated
medical facilities for diagnosis and, if necessary, testing, quarantine and/or hospitalisation.

A key part of Implats’ strategy has been to identify potentially vulnerable employees and to
institute additional precautionary measures to increase protection. This includes the provision
of vitamin and dietary supplements, flu vaccinations and critical medical screening. In addition,
employees have been provided with pre-packaged supplies of chronic medication for a period
of six months to ensure high-risk employees do not need to visit hospitals or clinics during this
time. Suitable temporary company accommodation is also being availed to employees who
may not be able to self-isolate or practise recommended social distancing measures when not
at work.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE THIRD QUARTER

On 23 March 2020, the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa issued a directive for a
national lockdown to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. Implats successfully
ramped down all South African operations and placed them on care and maintenance from
26 March 2020. The implementation of the lockdown is estimated to have resulted in a 6%
reduction in reported milled tonnage from each of Impala, Marula and Two Rivers, equivalent to
approximately 26 000 ounces of 6E mine-to-market concentrate production during the quarter.

Post the declaration of a state of emergency in Ontario, Impala Canada’s mining operations
were classified as an essential business by the Ontario government and after confirmation of
this status, operations resumed, with two days of lost production occurring in the period.

In accordance with the directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on 27 March 2020,
both Zimplats and Mimosa applied for, and were granted approval to continue operations during
the Zimbabwean national lockdown under agreed precautionary measures, with negligible
impact on reported production in the period under review.

IRS receipts from both third parties and mine-to-market operations were impacted by the
declaration of force majeure on concentrate and Zimplats matte deliveries from 24 March 2020
as processing facilities were prepared for care and maintenance ahead of the lockdown.

PRODUCTION

Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Group tonnes milled (excluding JV operations) improved by 18% to 5.36 million tonnes during
the quarter, compared to 4.53 million tonnes in the prior comparable period. An improved mining
performance at Marula and Zimplats compensated for lower volumes from Impala Rustenburg,
with absolute volume gains driven by the inclusion of Impala Canada and its contribution of
865 000 tonnes. Reported mill grade declined by 4% to 3.64g/t (6E), benefitting from a strong
performance at Marula but impacted by the inclusion of lower-grade volumes from Impala
Canada.

Mine-to-market 6E concentrate production was stable on a like-for-like basis with stronger
volumes from Marula and Zimplats offsetting weaker production from Impala Rustenburg and
Two Rivers. Together with production from the recently acquired Impala Canada operation,
concentrate volumes increased by 8% to 667 000 ounces from the prior comparable period.

IRS 6E in concentrate receipts from third-party and toll customers increased by 3% to 85 000
ounces. Gross concentrate production and receipts improved by 7% to 751 000 ounces.
Refined and saleable 6E production, which includes saleable ounces from Impala Canada,
increased by a more material 23% to 862 000 ounces.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
In the nine-month period ended 31 March 2020, the inclusion of Impala Canada compensated
for slightly lower year-to-date volumes from Impala Rustenburg. Tonnes milled, excluding
production from JV operations, increased by 6% to 15.67 million tonnes as the average mill
grade declined by 2% to 3.75g/t (6E).

Mine-to-market 6E concentrate production benefitted from higher volumes at Zimplats and
Marula and the initial contributions from Impala Canada, which helped offset weaker volumes
at Impala, Two Rivers and Mimosa. Gross 6E concentrate production of 2.02 million ounces is
1% higher than in the prior corresponding nine months.

In line with volume gains reported over the period, 6E third party and toll material received in
concentrate increased by 3% to 275 000 ounces.

Refined 6E production was impacted by the programme of scheduled maintenance at the
Groups’ processing facilities, including the scheduled furnace rebuild at Zimplats and acid plant
maintenance during the first half of financial year and the number 4 furnace ring repair
completed at Impala Rustenburg in 3Q 2020.

Gross refined production, including saleable ounces from Impala Canada declined by 5% to
2.18 million ounces – while saleable platinum production of 1.06 million ounces declined by 6%,
saleable palladium production of 689 000 ounces benefitted from the contribution of Impala
Canada and is 1% higher than in the prior comparable period.

The implementation of a revised stock allocation policy between IRS and Impala Rustenburg
resulted in a reallocation of refined volumes in 2Q 2020, and while Impala’s refined
6E production increased by 5% in the nine months ended 31 March 2020, IRS volumes were
19% lower.

At 31 March 2020, circa 200 000 ounces excess 6E in concentrate remained in stock, a
decrease of 150 000 ounces from the 350 000 ounces reported at 31 December 2019. These
stocks will continue to be used to bolster refined volumes and sales in the final quarter of
FY2020.

Impala Rustenburg
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 17 500 ounces of 6E, was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown. Tonnes
milled during the quarter declined by 8% to 2.37 million tonnes, compared to 2.58 million tonnes
in the prior comparable period. Lower volumes were delivered as expected from 1 and 10 shafts
due to reduced operations and challenging ground conditions, offset by the ramp-up in
production from 16 shaft.

The increase in the development-to-stoping ratio and continued orepass rehabilitation at 16 and
20 shafts impacted milled grade. However, concentrate production was buffered by improved
recovery and yield from the trial tailings campaign and other surface sources, resulting in a 7%
decrease in volumes to 275 000 ounces, compared to 296 000 ounces in the prior comparable
period.

Refined 6E production of 343 000 ounces improved by 12% during the quarter from 307 000
ounces in the prior corresponding period. This was due to the implementation of a revised stock
allocation policy between Impala Rustenburg and IRS during the current financial year.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Tonnes milled decreased 5% to 8.1 million tonnes and the milled grade of 3.92g/t (6E) was 1%
lower. Higher recoveries and contributions from the trial tailings campaign were offset by lower
production from other high-grade surface sources including smelter reverts. 6E production in
concentrate of 928 000 ounces declined by 4% from 969 000 ounces in the prior corresponding
period.

Refined 6E production increased by 5% to 1.10 million ounces from 1.05 million ounces during
the previous comparable period, benefitting from the change in stock allocation and despite
constrained smelter capacity due to ongoing maintenance.

Zimplats
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Zimplats operations received approval to operate during the national lockdown in Zimbabwe
resulting in minimal interruptions to production. The operation delivered a strong performance
during the quarter under review. Tonnes milled increased by 6% to 1.70 million tonnes, while
the delivered mill grade was stable at 3.46g/t (6E). 6E concentrate production improved by 6%
to 150 000 ounces compared to 141 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. Matte
production and concentrate sales were slightly higher than milled volumes in the period and
improved by 6% to 152 000 ounces.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput of 5.08 million tonnes was 3% higher and 6E concentrate production improved
by 3% to 449 000 ounces from the prior comparable period. Production in matte, together with
concentrates sold, were impacted by the accumulation of in-process inventory due to the
furnace rebuild in 1Q 2020 and declined by 3% to 419 000 ounces from 433 000 ounces.

Marula
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 3 500 ounces 6E was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown. Despite
this headwind, Marula delivered a much-improved performance in the current quarter benefiting
from the treatment of some surface material. Milled volumes increased by 23%, milled grade
rose by 17% and 6E concentrate production was up 37% to 55 000 ounces from the previous
comparable quarter when operational continuity was hampered by community disruptions,
which resulted in a seven-day work stoppage.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput improved by 8% to 1.40 million tonnes from 1.30 million tonnes in the previous
corresponding period. Grade increased by 9% and concentrate production rose by 14% to
179 000 ounces from 158 000 ounces.

Impala Canada
The acquisition of Impala Canada was concluded in December 2019 and operational results
reflect a full quarter of metrics for the first time. During the period, the integration of Impala
Canada into the Group was meaningfully advanced with a focus on financial and technical
support, together with alignment on several Implats operating principles and practises including
the progression of community and stakeholder relations.

The operational performance in the period was characterised by milling constraints due to
inclement weather conditions and ongoing rehabilitation of the ore pass system at the mine. In
total, 865 000 tonnes were milled generating 6E production of 55 000 ounces and saleable
volumes of 57 000 ounces.

Mimosa
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Mimosa received approval to operate during the national lockdown in Zimbabwe resulting in
minimal interruption to production in the quarter under review. Mining operations were placed
on care and maintenance at the end of the quarter as milling from stockpiled material continued.
Mining has since been resumed in terms of an exemption received from the government of
Zimbabwe.

Mimosa continued to recover from the first quarter when concentrate volumes were impacted
by extensive mill repairs. Milled volumes of 683 000 tonnes and delivered grade of 3.85g/t (6E)
were maintained versus the prior comparable period. Lower recoveries impacted marginally on
concentrate production, which declined by 2% to 61 000 ounces. The primary process
bottlenecks at Mimosa will be addressed through the installation of additional milling equipment
during the plant optimisation project which is currently underway at the operation.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
During the nine-month period, mill throughput declined by 5% from the prior comparable period
due to the breakdown in the primary mill in 1Q 2020, with a total of 1.99 million tonnes treated.
6E concentrate production of 181 000 ounces was 7% lower than the prior comparable period.

Two Rivers
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 4 500 ounces of 6E, was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown at the end
of the quarter, with a further two days of production lost due to an Eskom transmission line fault
earlier in March 2020.

Total tonnes milled declined by 3% to 808 000 tonnes and milled grade was 4% lower at
3.46g/t (6E). Concentrator recoveries continued to be negatively impacted by lower grade and
changes in mineralogy as greater proportions of feed are sourced from split-reef and
development tonnage. Concentrate volumes of 71 000 ounces declined by 9% from the 78 000
ounces produced in the prior comparable period.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput decreased by 2% to 2.45 million tonnes, while mill grade decreased by 3% to
3.45g/t (6E) and metallurgical recoveries reduced by 6%. Consequently, 6E concentrate
production declined by 13% to 209 000 ounces from 239 000 ounces in the prior comparable
period. A project aimed at increasing mill capacity to compensate for the structural change in
feed-grade was approved in February 2020 with work commencing during the period.

IRS

Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Gross concentrate receipts were negatively impacted by the declaration of force majeure on
23 March 2020 to allow for an orderly shutdown of the processing facilities ahead of the start of
the national lockdown and restrictions on the transportation of non-essential goods during the
lockdown period. Refined 6E production of 462 000 ounces from both mine-to-market
operations (Zimplats, Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa) and IRS third-party and toll customers,
was 17% higher than in the previous period (396 000 ounces).

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Gross concentrate receipts benefitted from higher deliveries from Marula and third parties which
mitigated the impact of lower production from Zimplats, Mimosa and Two Rivers. While gross
concentrate receipts were fractionally lower, refined 6E production decreased by 19% to
1.01 million ounces, due largely to the change in the stock allocation policy between IRS and
Impala Rustenburg.

UNAUDITED FINANCIAL POSITION

Net cash, excluding finance leases, amounted to R3.2 billion at 31 March 2020, an improvement
of R2.1 billion from closing levels at 30 June 2019 of R1.1 billion, after the payment of
R978 million (FY2019: nil) in dividends to Implats shareholders during March 2020. The balance
sheet remains strong with an unutilised revolving credit facility of R4.0 billion available until
7 June 2021. The Group had liquidity headroom of R12.9 billion at 31 March 2020 compared to
the R12.2 billion available at the end of June 2019.

In addition, the Group has embarked on various cash preservation measures to improve liquidity
during the next 12 to18 months. These include a material reduction of non-essential operational
and capital expenditure and the extension of the maturity of the Standard Bank term loan
associated with the Marula BEE ownership of R865 million from 30 June 2020 to
30 September 2020.

FORCE MAJEURE

The bulk of Implats metals sales are sold into annual contracts and delivered on a monthly basis
to customers around the world. Implats declared force majeure on its contractual metal
deliveries when the national lockdown in South Africa was announced on the 23 March 2020.
This allows both Implats and its customers to suspend the operation of the contract for the
duration of the force majeure event, as reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Depending
on how the situation develops, partial, and later possibly complete, upliftment of the force
majeure protection can then be considered.

Discussions for resumed customer deliveries have been ongoing on this basis as greater
clarification regarding operating conditions has been reached. The majority of Implats’
customers have elected to receive metal on a delayed delivery schedule and, where logistics
have allowed, delivery of metal to customers has occurred in April 2020.

The relief of force majeure restrictions on deliveries in terms of IRS offtake agreements with
both Group companies and third parties is, however, conditional on the Group’s ability to sell
and transport final metal to customers and the impact of further amendments to the terms of the
South African national lockdown. The Group is working towards the upliftment of the force
majeure on its IRS receipts as a near-term priority.

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE

The Group was well on-track to meet the guidance parameters on production, unit costs and
capex provided with the release of its half year results ended 31 December 2019. However,
Implats is now faced with a period of unprecedented uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the implementation of nationwide lockdowns and legislated limitations on production
capacity at the Group’s South African operations.

Operational activities during the lockdown period 26 March - 30 April 2020
While milled volumes from Zimbabwean operations were largely unaffected by the Zimbabwean
national lockdown, underground production from Impala Rustenburg, Marula and the
Two Rivers joint venture were heavily impacted during the initial period of the South African
national lockdown. Minimal underground production was secured during April 2020 as the focus
remained on the safety and health of employees and ensuring the orderly screening, testing
and training of returning employees ahead of the gradual resumption of drilling and blasting.

At Impala Canada, following a positive case of COVID-19, further employees have tested
positive and the mine was placed on care and maintenance and the workforce quarantined for
a two-week period from 13 April 2020. Regrettably, an employee with comorbidities passed
away on 23 April 2020. The Board and management team have extended their sincere
condolences to his family, friends and colleagues and wish all affected employees at the
operation a speedy recovery. Discussions for a planned resumption of operating activities are
ongoing with the relevant health authorities in Ontario.

While mining production was stopped in South Africa during April 2020, the Group took a phased
approach to processing activities, in line with regulations which recognised smelters and
refineries as ‘essential services’ during the lockdown period. This has allowed a systematic
ramp-up of operations and continued, albeit reduced, production of refined volumes during the
lockdown period. This development has allowed for a reduction of excess in-process inventory
at the Group and, as such, refined volumes are likely to exceed concentrate production in the
FY2020 period.

Implats’ revised production guidance considers the production losses suffered in March and
April 2020 and assumes average production rates of between 30% and 40% of previous plans
in May and June 2020 for South African operations. In Zimbabwe, the Group’s mines have
operated successfully to date but remain vulnerable to potential unforeseen interruptions during
the remainder of the forecast period. In Canada, the guidance assumes operations will resume
in May 2020 but at a lower production rate.

The Group is pleased that its cost performance in the nine months to March 2020 was within
guidance despite the impact of a weaker-than-expected rand on the translated cost base of both
Zimplats and Impala Canada. The operating environment is now highly uncertain and the
combination of variable production parameters, staffing levels and currency volatility creates
exceptional forecast risk at this point in time. As a result, Implats is withdrawing its unit cost
guidance for FY2020.

Capex spend has been impacted by the wider effects of the South African national lockdown,
together with rand weakness on spend in Zimbabwe and Canada. Revised capex guidance
reflects rand weakness, offset by savings and deferment where necessary.

The revised Group guidance is illustrated in the table below. Implats cautions as to the fluidity
of the current operating environment and the downside risks presented by the potential for
further lockdowns or variations in operating parameters. It is the Group’s intention to issue a
further market update ahead of the year-end on 30 June 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE

Implats refers all stakeholders to its SENS announcements of 24 March and 30 March 2020 noting
its acknowledgement and support for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a
21-day national lockdown to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in South Africa. The national
lockdown of all non-essential businesses and services was effective from midnight Thursday,
26 March 2020 and, following the recently announced two-week extension, will continue until
midnight on Thursday, 30 April 2020. In terms of an amendment to the regulations and these
directives, announced on 16 April 2020, mining operations may now conduct activities at a reduced
capacity of not more than 50% during the extended lockdown period, subject to the implementation
of specified precautionary measures aimed at protecting employees and limiting the spread of the
virus. Once the provisions of the lockdown have been lifted, operations may ramp up capacity further
as determined by the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy.

Implats supports the lockdown measures taken by national governments to reduce the spread of the
coronavirus and welcomes the amended regulations, which will assist in securing critical mining
infrastructure and mitigate the severe impact of these measures on the lives and livelihoods of
employees, host communities and suppliers.

The Group’s internal planning to secure operational resilience during the coronavirus pandemic has
been ongoing since January 2020. Implats’ approach is based on the view that the virus will be a
feature for some time and operating in a ‘business as usual’ environment will not be possible in the
near term. Implats’ primary focus has therefore been on protecting the lives and livelihoods of its
stakeholders by taking steps to secure and sustain the financial viability of the Group and support
the national economies of the countries in which it operates.

Implats will establish a mechanism to enable members of its Board, the Group Executive Committee
and all Implats employees to donate up to one third of their salaries over the next three months. The
donations, including those received from our international operations, will, at the donor’s election,
either be paid into the Solidarity Fund - established to improve prevention and detection of COVID-
19 and cushion the impact of the pandemic on the country’s most vulnerable citizens - or be used to
provide care and support to our mine host communities. This mechanism heeds the call by the
President and the Cabinet, and their demonstrated leadership in action, in which they will donate
one third of their salary for three months into the Solidarity Fund.

All South African operations (Impala Rustenburg mining, processing and refining and Marula mining
and concentrating) were successful ramped down and placed on care and maintenance from
Thursday, 26 March 2020. The Group continued with limited operating activities at its critical
smelting and refining infrastructure and performed care and maintenance on underground
operations during the initial 21-day lockdown period. This allowed the Group to secure its furnaces
by treating some in-process inventory during this period. The Group’s ability to deliver precious
metals to customers has been constrained by the unavailability of secure air freight during the
lockdown, while base metal sales have been impeded by road and port restrictions.

Preventative measures

Implats has implemented and enforced several measures to provide protection to employees who
are at work, rolling out a number of programmes which have been in development internally since
the threat of coronavirus emerged in January 2020. The lockdown period has been used to
significantly strengthen preparations to ready the business and safeguard employees. Stock levels
of medical protective equipment and PPE have been increased, regular large-scale disinfection of
workplaces is being performed and screening and testing procedures for all employees currently
reporting to work to perform essential services have been implemented. At this time, no COVID-19
cases have been diagnosed among employees or their dependants at the Group’s South African
and Zimbabwean operations.

A meaningful increase in medical care preparedness has also been undertaken through increasing
the capacity of internal medical facilities and through the coordinated collaboration with industry
peers, public/private partnerships and both local and regional medical institutions.

Management teams across all Group operations have introduced vital risk-based operating
procedures to further protect employees. These measures are specifically aimed at reducing the risk
of viral infections in high-risk work areas and to vulnerable employee categories. These steps
include improved hygiene, restrictions on the amount of work performed, social distancing while
performing work and while travelling to and from work, the provision of additional PPE and the
implementation of screening and testing procedures.

All essential services employees are currently screened using questionnaires, thermo-scanning of
skin temperature, and if necessary, core temperature screening, before entering their work areas.
These protocols will continue to ramp-up as employees return to work. Employees with abnormal
temperatures will be isolated at dedicated areas at the operations and then transported to designated
medical facilities for diagnosis and, if necessary, testing, quarantine and/or hospitalisation.

A key part of Implats’ return to work strategy has been to identify potentially vulnerable employees
and to institute additional specific precautionary measures to increase protection. This includes the
provision of vitamin and dietary supplements, flu vaccinations and critical medical screening. In
addition, employees have been provided with pre-packaged supplies of chronic medication for a
period of six months to ensure high-risk employees do not need to visit hospitals or clinics during
this time. Suitable temporary company accommodation is also being availed to employees who may
not be able to self-isolate or practise recommended social distancing measures when not at work.

Operational update

Implats’ operational strategy is aimed at securing the integrity of key infrastructure and facilitating a
safe start-up once operations are cleared to resume. A systematic increase in labour attendance
was planned at Impala Rustenburg and Marula from 14 April 2020, in line with the permissions
received from the regulator. Following the easing of the lockdown provisions announced on
16 April 2020, the South African operations will advance measures to responsibly manage a gradual
return to work from Friday, 17 April 2020, taking the precautionary measures necessary to protect
employees. The management team continues to engage with the relevant authorities in this regard.

As previously indicated, management met with organised labour at both the national and branch
level before the lockdown began and agreed to continue paying full salaries to all employees during
the 21-day lockdown period. However, it was communicated to all stakeholders that the Group’s
financial position could not sustain this arrangement post the initial 21-day lockdown period and
therefore alternative arrangements would be implemented should the lockdown period continue
beyond the originally envisaged 21 days. The Group's standpoint is unchanged in this regard but
remain open to exploring alternative measures with its social partners to assist employees where
possible.

Impala Canada’s mining operations were classified as an essential business by the Ontario
government and operations continued at the Lac des Iles mine (LDI) during the declared state of
emergency. The provincial government has since extended the period to 12 May 2020. The
emergence of seven confirmed cases of COVID-19 at LDI over the past week, despite extensive
preventative measures that had been implemented to ensure employee safety, has required a ramp
down of operating activity. The operation was placed into temporary care and maintenance on
Monday, 13 April 2020. The majority of employees have left the site and are in self-quarantine until
27 April 2020. Management continues to collaborate with the health authorities and operations will
resume when it is safe to do so.

In accordance with the directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on Friday, 27 March 2020,
a 21-day lockdown commenced in Zimbabwe on Monday, 30 March 2020. Zimplats and Mimosa
applied for, and were granted, approval to continue with operations under agreed precautionary
measures. This has allowed Zimplats to maintain mining and processing operations, while at
Mimosa, limited mining operations to supplement available ore resources have allowed concentrate
production to continue during the lockdown.

Nico Muller, Implats CEO, said: “We are living in times of unprecedented uncertainty, which requires
new ways of thinking and innovative solutions to challenges we have not faced before. At Implats
we have taken several proactive steps to safeguard our business, with a key focus on securing and
ensuring the well-being of our employees.

“As management, we maintain regular and open communication with our key stakeholders including
our employees, organised labour and the national governments of Zimbabwe, South Africa and
Canada. To this end, we will continue to enhance our strategies for a successful resumption of
operating activities. This is necessary to secure the vital role our company plays in the livelihoods of
our employees, our host communities and the national economies in which we operate.

“Implats remains committed to engaging with all our stakeholders as we navigate through the
challenges presented by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We have been working tirelessly since
the emergence of the virus, to safeguard our employees and ensure the sustainability of our
company. We have significantly strengthened the preventative safety and health measures put in
place and are ready for a safe and orderly start up once we are given the go ahead to resume full-
scale production at our operations.”

Implats will provide additional updates as the situation develops. In addition, guidance on operations
will be provided in the scheduled third quarter FY2020 production update on 30 April 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE

Implats refers all stakeholders to its SENS announcement of 24 March 2020 noting South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a 21-day national lockdown of all non-essential
businesses and services, effective from midnight Thursday, 26 March 2020 to help curb the spread
of COVID-19 in South Africa. The South African national lockdown is planned to continue until
midnight on Thursday, 16 April 2020.

The Group supports the decisive action taken by the South African government to help flatten the
curve of the COVID-19 infection rate. Implats is committed to contributing where it can to South
Africa’s socio-economic stability. During the national lockdown, Implats’ primary focus is on
protecting the lives and livelihoods of employees, service providers and communities through doing
all it can to sustain the financial viability of its business and the national economies of the countries
in which it operates.

Implats successfully ramped down all South African mining operations (Impala Rustenburg and
Marula) and placed them on care and maintenance from Thursday, 26 March 2020. Essential care
and maintenance services are continuing to ensure the integrity of key infrastructure and facilitate
a safe start-up once operations are cleared to resume.

In line with South African government regulations, the Group has applied for permission to conduct
limited smelting operations at Impala Rustenburg together with limited operations at its Springs
refinery. This would allow some in-process inventory to be treated during the lockdown period
under controlled conditions. The Group will also apply for permission to conduct limited
underground ore transport and milling at its South African mining operations under agreed
precautionary measures. This would greatly assist in securing underground infrastructure during
the lockdown period and significantly enhance our ability to safely resume operations after the
lockdown period.

Impala Canada’s mining operations have been classified as an essential business by the Ontario
government and are therefore permitted to continue operations during the provincial 14-day
lockdown. Our executive leadership team is taking all the necessary precautions pertaining to
COVID-19. They are actively monitoring developments in the province of Ontario and Canada and
will adapt work procedures accordingly.

Following a directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on Friday, 27 March 2020, a 21-day
lockdown commenced in Zimbabwe on Monday, 30 March 2020. In line with government regulation,
executives at Zimplats and Mimosa have applied to continue with operations under agreed
precautionary measures. This would allow mining and processing operations to continue relatively
uninterrupted at Zimplats during the lockdown. Mimosa will continue to process stockpile material
during the lockdown and conduct limited mining operations to supplement available ore resources
during the period.

The safety of employees and contractors on all sites is a key priority and additional measures are
in place to protect the health of employees working during the lockdown and thereafter. These
include, but are not limited to, heightened risk mitigation measures through early COVID-19
detection, an enhanced focus on pandemic awareness, workplace hygiene, medical surveillance,
additional PPE and medical supplies, and isolation and treatment of suspected and confirmed
cases. All clinics and the Impala Rustenburg hospital will remain open and fully operational during
the lockdown period. At this time, no COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed among employees or
their dependants.

Management met with organised labour at both the national and branch level before the lockdown
and agreed to continue paying all employees during the 21-day lockdown period. However, it was
communicated to all stakeholders that alternative arrangements will need to be implemented
should the lockdown period continue beyond the envisaged 21 days.

Force majeure letters have been issued to all consultants and contractors for the duration of the
lockdown, to legally suspend our obligations under these contracts.

Force majeure letters have also been issued in respect of offtake agreements with both Group
companies and third parties, as well as customer supply contracts, to legally suspend our
obligations under these contracts.

With respect to offtake agreements, deliveries from all parties to the smelter were suspended on
24 March 2020 to enable the smelting operations to prepare for an orderly shutdown. With respect
to customer supply contracts, deliveries can resume once the force majeure is lifted, provided
delivery logistics permit.

We remain in regular contact with all our service providers and customers to work towards meeting
their continued requirements as best as possible while our business is impacted, aligned to the
force majeure provisions as it applies to each party.

Several steps have been taken to respond at short notice to President Ramaphosa’s directive while
seeking to preserve the financial viability of our business. The Group will continue to maximise the
business flexibility provided by our diverse asset base and mine-to-market operating model, and
detailed planning is underway to ensure a swift and safe start-up once the lockdown suspended.

Implats will provide additional updates as the situation develops. In addition, guidance on its
operations will be provided in its scheduled third quarter FY2020 production update on or around
30 April 2020.

COVID-19 LOCKDOWN

Implats notes South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a 21-day national shutdown
of all non-essential businesses and services, effective midnight Thursday 26 March 2020.

The Group supports the decisive action taken to help bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control
and flatten the curve of the infection rate. The health and safety of our employees and host
communities is of paramount importance to Implats.

The Group is working systematically to ensure an orderly transition to a period of care and
maintenance at our mining, smelting and refining operations, as directed by the South African
government.

Implats plays a key role in the economy of South Africa, is a major employer, and our operations
support multiple businesses and families in our host communities. As such, the Group is engaging
with the South African government to ensure the sustainability of the Group and mitigate, where
possible, the negative socio-economic outcomes of the shutdown.

The Implats Board and executive are engaged in detailed analysis and planning related to the impact
the shutdown will have on the Group. Further details will be communicated once the Group has more
certainty.

Implats CEO Nico Muller said: “These are unprecedented and extraordinary times and we all need
to make sacrifices for the greater good. Implats will do what is necessary to protect our employees,
communities and the South African economy.”

Commentary
Implats delivered solid results for its half year ended 31 December 2019. Sustained operating performances
from mining operations, together with robust rand PGM pricing during the period, offset short-term challenges
associated with concentrator maintenance and constrained smelter availability, resulting in improved free 
cash flow and strong headline earnings. 

This enabled the funding of the acquisition of Impala Canada through a combination of cash, a forward sale
of metal and debt. The Group was also able to reinstate dividends, based on a pay-out ratio of free cash flow
generated before growth capital of 30%. The Board declared an interim dividend of R1,25 per ordinary share,
which will be paid on 23 March 2020. 

Safety remains the Group's foremost priority. Despite 6% and 9% improvements in the total and lost-time
injury frequency rates, respectively, Implats mourns the loss of three employees at its managed operations. 

The Group's strategic re-positioning as a high-value, profitable and competitive PGM producer was
meaningfully advanced through initiatives to improve organisational effectiveness at key operations. In addition, 
a three-year wage settlement was secured with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union at Impala
Rustenburg and Marula. 

At Impala Rustenburg, the sustained improvement in cost performance, productivity and safety at 12 and 
14 Shafts has resulted in these operations collectively meeting the internal targets set to avoid disposal or
closure and we now expect to operate these assets for the foreseeable future. While higher pricing has provided
some medium-term life extension at 1 Shaft, 9 Shaft is likely to be closed in the short-term due to depleted
mineable reserves.

The Group delivered stable 6E in concentrate production of 1,53 million ounces, with Group refined
6E production down by 17% on constrained smelter availability due to a planned furnace rebuild at Zimplats. 

Free cash inflow of R5,0 billion improved year-on-year as received rand PGM pricing rose by 41% per ounce,
offsetting a 16% decline in 6E sales volumes due to an increase in work-in-process metal inventories.
Revenue improved by 19% to R28,0 billion, gross profit increased by more than 90% to R6,2 billion and 
headline earnings rose by 52% to R3,4 billion or 436 cents per share. 

Net cash generated from operating activities amounted to R6,0 billion for the six months. The incentivised
early conversion of the US$ bond resulted in a R3,1 billion reduction in debt as 64,3 million Implats shares
were issued in August 2019. The benefit of this, together with the payment of residual debt at Zimplats, was
partially offset by a bridging loan used to fund the acquisition of Impala Canada, and the Group ended the half
year in a net debt position of R1,9 billion.

DECLARATION OF INTERIM DIVIDEND

The Board of Implats wishes to inform shareholders that it has approved the declaration of an interim cash
dividend of R1,25 per ordinary share for the six-month period ended 31 December 2019. The interim dividend has
been declared in terms of the newly approved dividend policy, which is aligned to the Company's capital
allocation framework. The dividend policy states that a dividend will be declared from 30% of free cash flow
generated, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the Board's discretion. 

The Company has 799 034 147 ordinary shares in issue and the Company's tax reference number is 9700178719.
The dividend has been declared from retained earnings and will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax 
for shareholders who are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, a reduced rate of withholding tax. Therefore,
the net dividend amount is R1,00 per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay the dividend withholding tax
and R1,25 per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding tax. Shareholders are advised
to complete the requisite declaration form to make the Company aware of their tax status. The salient dates 
are as follows:

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Implats will release results for the half year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"") on 27 February 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading statement on
SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that financial results for the next reporting period will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Implats' headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period are expected to increase
by between 42% and 62% and by between 32% and 50% respectively, compared to those reported for the
six months ended 31 December 2018 (""the comparative period""). Headline earnings are expected to be
between R3.160 billion and R3.600 billion and HEPS will increase to between 408 cents and 465 cents per
share. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R2.228 billion and 310 cents per share,
respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period are expected to increase by between 37%
and 57% and by between 27% and 46% respectively, compared to the comparative period. Basic earnings are
expected to be between R3.170 billion and R3.630 billion and EPS to be between 409 cents and 469 cents
per share. Basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R2.306 billion and 321 cents per share,
respectively.

Despite sales volumes for the period being lower than the comparative period due to the impact of ongoing
planned smelter maintenance on refined production, gross profit is expected to increase by more than 90%
to approximately R6 billion, primarily due to the higher rand PGM basket price.

This increase was partially offset by:

    *   the once off expense of R509 million or 66 cents per share (no tax impact), relating to the incentivised
        early conversion of the US$ convertible bonds during the period;
    *   restructuring costs of R238 million or 31 cents per share (after tax); and
    *   higher taxation charges due to improved profitability.

Further, in the comparative period, earnings included the non-taxable income from Zimplats of export
incentives of R417 million or 58 cents per share, which did not recur in the current period.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the period increased to 774.4 million due to the issue of
64.3 million Implats ordinary shares on 1 August 2019, after US$ bond holders elected to exercise their option
to convert their bonds into Implats ordinary shares.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

Forward-Looking Statements

This announcement contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the securities
laws of certain jurisdictions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words like ""may,""
""will,"" ""likely,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,""
""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""continue"" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are neither
historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current
beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and
strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent
uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which
are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this announcement are
made only as of the date of this announcement, and except as otherwise required by law, we do
not have any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
subsequent events or circumstances.

Forward-looking statements in this announcement include, but are not limited to: statements with
respect to the completion of the Transaction and the timing for its completion; the satisfaction of
conditions precedent which include, without limitation the conditions referred to in paragraph 1
above, including compliance by Implats and NAP with various covenants contained in the
Arrangement Agreement; statements with respect to the effect of the Transaction on Implats and
its strategy going forward; statements with respect to the anticipated benefits associated with the
acquisition of NAP; and NAP’s financial outlook for estimated net and gross revenues from the
sale of palladium for fiscal 2020.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions regarding Implats and NAP,

including the completion of the Transaction, anticipated benefits from the Transaction, and
expected growth, results of operations, performance, industry trends and growth opportunities.
While Implats and NAP consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information
currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements.

The factors and assumptions contained in this news release, which may prove to be incorrect,
include, but are not limited to: the completion of the Transaction on the terms detailed above; NAP
will be able to continue normal business operations at Lac des Iles Mine; palladium prices and
exchange rates between the Canadian and United States dollar will be consistent with NAP's
expectations; there will be no significant disruptions affecting operations; and that prices for key
mining and construction supplies, including labour, will remain consistent with NAP's
expectations. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

The assumptions of Implats and NAP, although considered reasonable by them at the time of
preparation, may prove to be incorrect. In addition, forward-looking statements necessarily involve
known and unknown risks, including, without limitation, risks associated with general economic
conditions; adverse industry events; future legislative, tax and regulatory developments; inability
to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, and/or inability to access sufficient
capital on favourable terms; the ability of NAP to implement its business strategies; competition;
currency and interest rate fluctuations and other risks. Among other things, there can be no
assurance that the Transaction will be completed or that the anticipated benefits from the
Transaction will be achieved.

Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive. Readers are further cautioned not
to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as there can be no assurance that the
plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are placed will occur. Such information,
although considered reasonable by management at the time of preparation, may prove to be
incorrect and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated.

Forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified by this
cautionary statement and reflect our expectations as of the date hereof, and thus are subject to
change thereafter.

Notice to U.S. Holders. Both Implats and NAP have been formed outside of the United States.
The Transaction will be subject to disclosure requirements of Canada that are different from those
of the United States. Financial statements included in the documents, if any, will be prepared in
accordance with Canadian accounting standards and may not be comparable to the financial
statements of United States companies. It may be difficult for a securityholder in the United States
to enforce his/her/its rights and any claim a securityholder may have arising under U.S. federal
securities laws, since the companies are located in Canada, and some or all of their officers or
directors may be residents of Canada or another country outside of the United States. A
securityholder may not be able to sue a Canadian company or its officers or directors in a court
in Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States for violations of U.S. securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel a Canadian company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's
judgment.
