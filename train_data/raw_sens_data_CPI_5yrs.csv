(1) Starting 2013, the non-loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to a
10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.

(2) This value is currently 11.000% (May 2020: 10.500%) of risk-weighted
assets, being the Basel global minimum requirement of 8.000%, the Capital
Conservation Buffer of 2.500% and the Domestic Systemically Important
Bank(“D-SIB”) capital add-on of 0.500%, disclosable in terms of Directive 4
issued by the Prudential Authority on 27 August 2020. Directive 4 has
replaced Directive 6 of 2016 and requires banks to publicly disclose their D-
SIB capital add-on as part of their composition of regulatory capital
disclosure. In terms of the regulations relating to banks the Individual
Capital Requirement (“ICR”) is excluded.

The Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 on 6 April 2020 and temporarily
relaxed the Pillar 2A South African country-specific buffer of 1.00% to
provide temporary capital relief to banks during this time of financial
stress following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, in a manner that
ensures South Africa’s continued compliance with the relevant internationally
agreed capital framework.

(2) Capitec has a net cash inflow after applying the run-off weightings,
therefore outflows for the purpose of the ratio are deemed to be 25% of gross
outflows. As at 31 August 2020, R534.8 million (31 May 2020: R563.6 million)
of the total net cash outflows is attributable to Mercantile Bank Limited.

(3) The Prudential Authority issued Directive 1 of 2020 on 31 March 2020 and
decreased the minimum LCR requirement on 1 April 2020 from 100% to 80%. The
reason for the decrease is attributable to the current financial market turmoil
where market liquidity has decreased, and banks expected to be under increased
pressure to comply with the currently prescribed LCR requirements.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE 6 MONTHS ENDED
31 AUGUST 2020


1.   SALIENT FEATURES

     Operating profit before tax decreased by 86% to R538 million, from R3.83 billion in the
     prior year.

     Headline earnings per share decreased by 78% to 562 cents per share, from
     2 545 cents per share in the prior year.

     Earnings per share decreased by 79% to 537 cents per share, from 2 549 cents per
     share in the prior year.

     No interim ordinary dividend was declared in the current year compared to 755 cents
     per share in the prior year.

2.   DIVIDEND

     The South African Reserve Bank published Guidance Note 4/2020 on 6 April 2020 in
     which banks were directed to act prudently in preserving capital and focusing on financial
     and economic stability. This was due to the absence of appropriate factual information to
     determine the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the South African economy.
     There was a clear expectation communicated in the Guidance Note that banks should not
     declare ordinary dividends during 2020. The board considered the guidance of the
     Reserve Bank and decided against the declaration of an interim ordinary dividend.

TRADING STATEMENT AND QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE
REGULATIONS RELATING TO BANKS

The COVID-19 national lockdown resulted in increased credit impairment
charges and lower loan sales and transaction volumes, and as a result,
Capitec incurred a loss of R404 million for the quarter ended 31 May 2020.
The impact of the lockdown on the business is detailed below.

Total lending income (including credit life insurance):
The total lending income is 7% below expectation. This is due to retail and
business loan sales being 43% and 25%, respectively, below expectation.

Net funding expense:
The average deposit balance is 7% above expectation. As a result, interest
income on investments was 6% above expectation. There was a decrease of 2.5%
in the repo rate that led to the interest expense being 13.5% lower than
expectation.

Credit impairment charge and provision:
The credit impairment charge is 145% higher than expectation. This is
predominately due to R5.75 billion and R236 million in retail and business
credit balances, respectively, being rescheduled or granted payment breaks
due to the lockdown. These clients were in good standing at the end of
February 2020 and we believe the increased risk is not as high as normally
associated with rescheduled balances.

Due to our conservative approach the group provision for credit impairments
increased by R3.3 billion since February 2020. The tables below show gross
loans and related provisions by category for retail and business banking:

Credit life reinsurance:
The retail bank’s reinsurance agreements expired on 30 April 2020. We self-
insure claims with event dates (i.e. retrenchment notification date, date of
death or date of disability) from 1 May 2020. The reinsurance cover in place
up to 30 April 2020 covers all claims with an event date up to 30 April 2020.
We are negotiating with reinsurance companies for death cover that provides a
meaningful transfer of risk that, given the cost, would be acceptable to both
parties. Our clients continue to be covered for retrenchment, death and
disability. To date we have not seen any significant increase in retrenchment
or death claims.

Net transaction fee and treasury foreign currency income:
The net transaction fee and treasury foreign currency income is 20% below
expectation. Retail transaction volumes are 11.5% below expectation. On a
monthly basis volumes were 2.7% down in March, 25.3% in April and 7.1% in
May. The merchant acquiring business was 33% below expectation.

Banking client behaviour shifted to fewer, higher value transactions during
the quarter and was most severely impacted during level 5 of the lockdown.
Subsequent to level 5 lockdown, volumes improved but have not yet recovered
to pre-lockdown levels.

Funeral insurance:
Funeral insurance income is 17% above expectation, although the number of
policies issued was below expectation. The increase in income is due to an
increase in the average premium, as well as collection rates being above
expectation for April and May. The collection rates increased to above 80%
in May 2020.

Operating expenditure:
Operating expenditure is 12% lower than planned. We will continue to apply a
conservative approach in the management of operating expenditure.

Prospects:
Stricter credit granting criteria were implemented at the start of the
lockdown. As the economic fallout of the lockdown is assessed, credit
granting criteria will be adjusted to reflect market conditions. We
anticipate reaching pre-lockdown credit sales at the start of the next
financial year. We are currently focused on credit pricing and client
experience to stabilise our credit market share.

Repayment of rescheduled loans and commencement of payments after payment
holidays will determine whether we were too conservative or lenient in our
provisioning. The first payment due at the end of June gave a positive
indication, however, July and August payments will clarify the effect.

There will be continued focus on digital innovation. As the country exits
the lockdown we expect transaction volume and revenue to increase, supported
by growth in quality banking clients in both the business and retail banks.

We will continue to launch new products to meet the needs of our clients. We
see an opportunity to grow our business banking footprint and there is still
a focus on building our future business bank.

There is a reasonable degree of certainty that Capitec’s headline earnings
per share and earnings per share will decline by more than 70%, or more than
1782 cents and 1784 cents, respectively, compared to the headline earnings
per share of 2545 cents and earnings per share of 2549 cents for the six
months ended 31 August 2019. We do, however, believe that the results for the
second half of the 2021 financial year could return to normal levels.
We will provide a more specific guidance range when there is reasonable
certainty of the range of headline earnings and earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed and reported on by Capitec’s auditors.

Regulation 43:
Capitec and its subsidiaries (“the group”) have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.


Both Capitec and Capitec Bank Limited (“Capitec Bank”) have maintained
healthy buffers above the minimum capital adequacy requirements, despite the
breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic during the quarter.


The group’s consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
first quarter of the 28 February 2021 financial year are set out below:

(1) Capitec incurred a loss during the 1st Quarter of 2021 which amounted to
R404.1 million. Also included in the movement in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
for the quarter is the additional phase-in of IFRS 9 in accordance with
Directive 5 of 2017, which amounted to R162.0 million, and amounts arising
from unused tax losses which amounted to R267.8 million. The remainder of the
movement for the quarter relates to movements in intangible assets and other
reserves, which include the cash flow hedge reserve, foreign currency
translation reserve and the net impact of the share option scheme for the
group.

(2) Starting in 2013, the non-loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to
a 10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.

(3) This value is currently 10.500% (February 2020: 11.500%)of risk-weighted
assets, being the Basel global minimum requirement of 8.000% and the Capital
Conservation Buffer of 2.500%, disclosable in terms of a SARB November 2016
directive in order to standardise reporting across banks. In terms of the
regulations relating to banks the Individual Capital Requirement (“ICR”) is
excluded. The Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 of 2020 on 6 April 2020
and temporarily relaxed the Pillar 2A South African country-specific buffer
of 1.00% to provide temporary capital relief to banks during the time of
financial stress following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a manner
that ensures South Africa’s continued compliance with the relevant
internationally agreed capital framework.

(1) As at 31 May 2020, R987.9 million (29 Feb 2020: R1.15 billion) of the total
High-Quality Liquid Assets is attributable to Mercantile Bank Limited
(“Mercantile Bank”).

(2) Capitec has a net cash inflow after applying the run-off weightings,
therefore outflows for the purpose of the ratio are deemed to be 25% of gross
outflows. As at 31 May 2020, R563.6 million (29 Feb 2020: R550.7 million) of
the total net cash outflows is attributable to Mercantile Bank.

(3) The Prudential Authority issued Directive 1 of 2020 on 31 March 2020 and
decreased the minimum LCR requirement from 100% to 80% effective from 1 April
2020. The decrease is attributable to the current financial market turmoil
which has decreased market liquidity, and the expectation that banks will
remain under increased pressure to comply with the currently prescribed LCR
requirements.

amounts to R181,000,000 and the 200,000 shares that are the subject of the
collar serve as security against the loan. It is Wimsey's intention to

(“Limietberg”) over a portion (referencing 1,250,000 shares) of
Limietberg’s shareholding in Capitec Bank Holdings Limited (the “2017
Hedging Transaction”) and the announcement released on SENS on 24 February
2020, relating to the partial unwind of a portion (“394,737 shares”) of
the 2017 Hedging Transaction.

Shareholders are now advised that, in anticipation of the upcoming expiry
of the remaining 2017 Hedging Transaction (the “Current Hedge”) and the
settlement of any financing relating thereto, Limietberg has concluded a
new hedging and financing transaction (the ""New Hedge"") over 1,250,000
shares on the basis set out below:

 DIRECTOR’S INTEREST IN THE
 TRANSACTIONS

The hedging counterparty shall provide Limietberg with loan financing for
the duration of the New Hedge. The maximum financial obligation under that
financing arrangement, including all interest thereon, will never exceed
the total number of shares hedged multiplied by the put strike price.
Limietberg will therefore always be in the position to fully cover the
liability under the financing arrangement with the shares hedged.

The default legal position on the Current Hedge is cash settlement (i.e.
not physical settlement) and Limiteberg is thereby not required to sell
any shares irrespective of whether the share price might be (a) below the
put strike price or (b) above the call strike price, at expiry. The
Current Hedge (855,263 shares) has already, as at the date of this
announcement, begun the process of unwinding naturally and Limietberg’s
intention remains to cash settle any rights or obligations that arise on
the expiry thereof. The proceeds of the financing arrangement under the
New Hedge will be used to cash settle the obligations of the financing
arrangement under the Current Hedge. As such, all the underlying shares
will continue to be retained by Limietberg.

TRADING STATEMENT

The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting businesses in South Africa across
the board and generally causing increased distress in the South African
economy. We do not as yet fully understand the ultimate economic
outcome of the pandemic. The national lockdown affected Capitec from
the end of its first month of the 2021 financial year and the impact
continues. The relaxation of the lockdown restrictions enabling
broadened business activity from 1 June 2020 is imperative to
facilitate economic recovery in South Africa.

Over the period of the national lockdown, Capitec transaction volumes
(branch transactions, cash withdrawals and point-of-sale transactions)
number of funeral policies sold and credit sales were lower. Many
clients applied for a payment holiday. It is still early days to
determine the extent, but doubtful debt is expected to increase.

All reasonable measures are being taken to contain expenses.

Capitec’s liquidity and capital positions continue to be very strong.
Capitec’s deposit base increased further and we believe this is due to
clients’ normal spending habits being curtailed due to the national
lockdown.

It is not possible at this stage to provide specific guidance to
shareholders on the results for the 6 months ending on 31 August 2020
(“the interim reporting period”). The potential remedial effect of the
relaxation of the economic restrictions from 1 June 2020, on Capitec’s
interim results, will only become apparent over the second half of the
interim reporting period. Due to the impact of the national lockdown
over the first half of the interim reporting period, however, there is
a reasonable degree of certainty that Capitec’s headline earnings per
share and earnings per share will decline by more than 20% or more than
509 cents and 510 cents respectively, compared to the headline earnings
per share of 2545 cents and earnings per share of 2549 cents for the
six months ended 31 August 2019.

We will provide a more specific guidance range when there is reasonable
certainty of the range of headline earnings and earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has
not been reviewed and reported on by Capitec’s auditors. The financial
results for the half year ending on 31 August 2020 are expected to be
published on or about 30 September 2020.

CAPITEC BANK LIMITED (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CAPITEC BANK HOLDINGS
LIMITED): FOREIGN CURRENCY LONG-TERM ISSUER CREDIT RATING LOWERED IN
LINE WITH COUNTRY RATING

On 29 April 2020, S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) lowered the credit ratings
on South Africa to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’ based on the impact that Covid-19 is
expected to have on the country’s fiscal and growth prospects.

S&P does not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the
foreign currency long term sovereign ratings. Therefore, on 7 May 2020,
Capitec Bank’s foreign currency long-term issuer credit rating was
lowered to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’ in line with that of South Africa. The rest
of Capitec Bank’s credit ratings were left unchanged. The ‘B’ short-
term rating was affirmed. The outlook is stable. Furthermore, the
‘zaAA’ long-term and ‘zaA-1+’ short-term national scale ratings were
affirmed.

S&P’s standalone credit assessment of Capitec Bank has been maintained
despite their view of higher system-wide economic risks. This is
underpinned by ‘the banking sector’s long track record of sound asset
quality, muted risk appetite, and solid regulatory capitalization.’

QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE REGULATIONS RELATING
TO BANKS

Capitec and its subsidiaries (“the group”) have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.

Capitec Bank Limited (“Capitec Bank”), the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capitec, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Mercantile Bank
Holdings Limited (“Mercantile Holdings”) on 7 November 2019, the date on
which the final purchase price was paid. On 12 November 2019, the assets and
liabilities of Mercantile Holdings were transferred to Capitec Bank.
Mercantile Bank Limited (“Mercantile”) is now the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Mercantile Holdings is in the process of being
deregistered.

Mercantile is consolidated in the disclosures in respect of the 3rd and 4th
quarters of the 2020 financial year ended on 29 February 2020. Both Capitec
and Mercantile apply the standardised approach to calculate capital
adequacy.

The acquisition of Mercantile has a significant impact on Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio, as Capitec’s qualifying capital is measured against the
combined risk weighted assets of Mercantile and Capitec.

The impact of the acquisition of Mercantile on the capital adequacy ratio of
Capitec was partly offset by an increase in appropriated profits and the
placement of excess funds in investments with lower risk weightings such as
South African National Treasury bills.

Both Capitec and Capitec Bank have maintained healthy buffers above the
minimum capital adequacy requirement.

The group’s consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
fourth quarter for the 29 February 2020 financial year end are set out
below:

AUDITED SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
29 FEBRUARY 2020


1.   SALIENT FEATURES

     Operating profit before tax increased by 14% to R8.06 billion, from R7.08 billion in the
     prior year.

     Headline earnings per share increased by 19% to 5 428 cents per share, from 4 577
     cents per share in the prior year.

     Earnings per share increased by 18% to 5 400 cents per share, from 4 571 cents per
     share in the prior year.

     Total dividends per share decreased by 57% to 755 cents per share, from 1 750 cents
     per share in the prior year.

2.   DIVIDEND

     Capitec’s ordinary dividend policy is to pay out 40% of headline earnings. As Capitec’s
     capital base and liquidity ratios remain strong, it was the intention of the board to declare
     the final dividend this year. The South African Reserve Bank published Guidance Note
     4/2020 on 6 April 2020 in which banks are directed to act prudently in preserving capital
     and focusing on financial and economic stability. This is due to the absence of appropriate
     factual information to determine the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the South
     African economy. There is a clear expectation communicated in the Guidance Note that
     banks should not declare ordinary dividends for the time being. The board therefore
     considered the guidance of the Reserve Bank as well as the expectation of ordinary
     shareholders regarding the dividend declaration. After extensive deliberation, the board
     decided to support the guidance of the Reserve Bank and decided against the declaration
     of the final ordinary dividend.

WITHDRAWAL OF MERCANTILE BANK LIMITED’S (“MERCANTILE”) MOODY’S INVESTOR
SERVICES (MOODY’S) CREDIT RATINGS

On 26 November 2019, Mercantile requested a withdrawal of their Moody’s
credit ratings. The credit ratings at the time of withdrawal were
Ba3/Not-Prime global scale and Baa1.za/P-2.za national scale issuer
ratings. At the time of the withdrawal, the long-term global scale
issuer rating had a stable outlook.

Mercantile withdrew its Moody’s credit ratings following its acquisition
by Capitec Bank on 7 November 2019. Mercantile is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Capitec Bank is rated by S&P Global Ratings.
There is thus no reason for Mercantile to continue to have separate
credit ratings. The integration of Mercantile into Capitec Bank is in
process and it will become a division of Capitec Bank. Moody’s issued a
statement today in which they indicate that the ratings were
discontinued due to ‘business reasons’. Included in Moody’s definition
of ‘business reasons’ they state ‘Moody’s generally do not reflect any
concerns about the Rated Entity’s creditworthiness or the quality of its
management’.

GENERAL STATEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the guidance provided in
Capitec’s trading statement published on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 6 March 2020 advising that
headline earnings per share and earnings per share are expected
to increase by between 18% and 21%. This guidance remains
unchanged and Capitec’s fundamental business remains strong.

Globally, markets are in economic turmoil due to the effects
of Covid-19, and many companies, including the banks, have
seen big declines in their share prices.

We believe that the sharp decline in the Capitec ordinary
share price since yesterday may be attributable to the
following technical reasons:
• International shareholders are impacted by the continued
   weakening of the Rand which, over and above the declining
   share price, further motivated the disposal of their
   Capitec shares.
• The algorithms applied by professional traders enforce
   disposal of a share when the price of that share declines
   below a certain limit.
•  Banks that are counterparties to collar transactions are
   inclined to sell the underlying share when contracted
   limits are breached.

There is speculation in the market that Capitec will be
severely impacted by Covid-19 due to the market on which it
focuses and its unsecured credit business model. Shareholders
are reminded of the following important features of Capitec’s
business model as highlighted in the FY2020 interim results
published on SENS on 26 September 2019:

1. Only 1.1 million of Capitec Bank’s 12.6 million active
   clients (9%) have credit with Capitec Bank.
2. Capitec’s business model is well diversified and income
   is strengthened by transaction fee income and funeral
   cover sales. Net transaction fee and funeral income
   contribute 46% of net income and covers 91% of operating
   expenses.
3. There has been a significant migration in Capitec Bank’s
   client base to the middle and higher income segment. 81%
   of credit granted in August 2019 was to clients with a
   gross salary of over R10 000 per month, and 47% to
   clients with a gross salary of over R20 000 per month.
4. The bank has a strong retail deposit base.

Capitec’s liquidity position as of today remains strong and
its liquidity ratios remain in line with that published on 12
December 2019 being:
- Capital Adequacy Ratio – 28.4%
- Liquidity Coverage Ratio – 1 444%
- Net Stable Funding Ratio – 186%
- Leverage Ratio – 16.6%
- Capitec Bank’s excess deposit base has grown by more than
  5% from 31 August 2019.

Management continuously assesses changes in the economy and
trading conditions and make appropriate adjustments to
business and granting models as required. This is particularly
relevant in these uncertain times.

Capitec’s full year results for the reporting period ended 29
February 2020 will be published on SENS on 14 April 2020 and
in the press on 15 April 2020.

DEALING IN SECURITIES BY AN ASSOCIATE OF A DIRECTOR

In compliance with paragraphs 3.63 to 3.74 of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, the following information, relating to the dealing in
securities by an associate of a director is disclosed:

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 11 July
2017, with regards to the hedging transaction entered into by Limietberg
Sekuriteit (Pty) Ltd (""Limietberg"") over a portion of Limietberg's
shareholding in Capitec Bank Holdings Limited (the ""2017 Hedging
Transaction"").

Shareholders are now advised that Limietberg has, on 21 February 2020,
early unwound and terminated a portion of the 2017 Hedging Transaction in
respect of 394,737 underlying shares (the ""Partial Unwind""). Limietberg
elected to cash settle its obligations pursuant to the Partial Unwind and,
as a consequence, no underlying shares were acquired or sold by
Limietberg. No other amendments have been made to the 2017 Hedging
Transaction.

Shareholders are further advised that Limietberg has concluded a new
hedging and financing transaction over the same quantum of shares
(394,737) on the basis set out below:

The hedging counterparty has provided Limietberg with loan financing for
the duration of the collar. The maximum financial obligation under that
financing arrangement, including all interest thereon, will never exceed
the total number of shares hedged multiplied by the put strike. The shares
hedged will therefore always be in the position to fully cover the
liability under the financing arrangement.

QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE REGULATIONS RELATING
TO BANKS

Capitec and its subsidiaries (""the group"") have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.

Capitec Bank Limited (""Capitec Bank""), the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capitec, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Mercantile Bank
Holdings Limited (""Mercantile Holdings"") on 7 November 2019, the date on
which the final purchase price was paid. On 12 November 2019, the assets and
liabilities of Mercantile Holdings were transferred to Capitec Bank.
Mercantile Bank Limited (""Mercantile"") is now the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Mercantile Holdings is in the process of being
deregistered.

Mercantile is consolidated in the disclosures in respect of the 3rd quarter
of the 2020 financial year ended on 30 November 2019. Both Capitec and
Mercantile apply the standardised approach to calculate capital adequacy.

The acquisition of Mercantile has a significant impact on Capitec's capital
adequacy ratio, as Capitec's qualifying capital is measured against the
combined risk weighted assets of Mercantile and Capitec.

The impact of the inclusion of Mercantile's risk weighted assets resulted in
a decrease of 5.5% in the group capital adequacy ratio. Of the total risk
weighted assets as at 30 November 2019, R13.0 billion is attributable to
Mercantile.

In terms of the Regulations relating to banks, goodwill and intangible
assets net of the related deferred tax liability, are treated as specified
adjustments and are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (""CET1"") capital and
reserve funds. The goodwill originating on the acquisition of Mercantile and
Mercantile's intangible assets at acquisition therefore also reduce the
qualifying CET1 capital of Capitec on consolidation and resulted in a
further 1.2% decrease in the group capital adequacy ratio.

The impact of the acquisition of Mercantile on the capital adequacy ratio of
Capitec was partly offset by an increase in appropriated profits and the
placement of excess funds in investments with lower risk weightings such as
South African National Treasury bills.

Both Capitec and Capitec Bank have maintained healthy buffers above the
minimum capital adequacy requirement.

The group's consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
third quarter for the 29 February 2020 financial year end are set out below:


                                      3rd Quarter 2020                  2nd Quarter 2020

PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION ON ACQUISITION OF MERCANTILE BANK HOLDINGS
LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (""MERCANTILE"")

Capitec Bank concluded the purchase of Mercantile on 7 November 2019 for
R3.56 billion. Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement of the
same date regarding the purchase and the payment of the purchase price.

This announcement provides detail on the acquisition date accounts of
Mercantile as well as the allocation of the purchase price to these
accounts and other intangibles identified.

Capitec Bank will consolidate Mercantile from the acquisition date and
Capitec Bank's results for the year ending 29 February 2020 will include
the Mercantile earnings from 7 November 2019.

Capitec Bank determined the acquisition date accounting of Mercantile
through the following processes:
1. Obtaining the statement of financial position of Mercantile as at 7
    November 2019 which reflects a net asset value of R2.69 billion.
    Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement dated 31 October
    2019 that disclosed Mercantile's net asset value at R2.66 billion at
    30 September 2019. This date was used to determine the purchase
    price. The net asset value of R2.69 billion as at 7 November 2019
    was used to allocate the purchase price. The difference relates to
    Mercantile's earnings for the month of October 2019.
2.  Obtaining an unqualified special purpose reasonable assurance
    opinion from Mercantile's auditors reflecting a net asset value of
    R2.69 billion.
3.  Supplementing the Capitec accounting policies with those of
    Mercantile to the extent that they provide more granularity on the
    business banking segment. This did not result in adjustments to the
    net asset value of the acquisition date accounts.
4.  Applying IFRS 3 - Business combinations in order to determine the
    allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets, assumed
    liabilities and residual goodwill.

The outcome of the purchase price allocation was as follows:

1.  Fair value of assets and liabilities
    A fair value exercise was performed on all assets and liabilities.
    No material differences were noted between net asset value and fair
    value.

2.  Identified intangible assets
    Core deposit and client relationship intangibles not previously
    recognised were identified. A value of R80.8 million and R17.7
    million was placed on the core deposit and client relationship
    intangibles respectively.

    The brand value was considered to be immaterial as Mercantile has
    less than 1% of the market share in South Africa and their
    geographical footprint is limited.

    The intangible assets raised through the business combination will
    be amortised over 7 years. It is expected that this will result in a
    post-tax charge of R3.38 million to Capitec's income statement for
    the year ending 29 February 2020.

3.  Goodwill
    The net asset value of Mercantile of R2.69 billion as at 7 November
    2019 was increased by R98.5 million for intangible assets and offset
    by an increase in deferred tax of R27.6 million. The resultant fair
    value of identifiable net assets of R2.76 billion compared to the
    purchase price of R3.56 billion results in goodwill of R794.5
    million. This goodwill is attributable to future revenue expected to
    be generated from new business banking clients, the leveraging of
    the Capitec brand and the Mercantile business banking process. None
    of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax
    purposes.
                                                                  R'000

The purchase price of R3.56 billion was paid in cash. Capitec Bank
incurred acquisition related costs of R9.5 million (mainly Securities
transfer tax) during the year and these will be included in operating
expenses for the year ending 29 February 2020.

acquisition supports Capitec's goal of expanding its offering as part of
a broader banking strategy.

CAPITEC BANK LIMITED (THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CAPITEC BANK
HOLDINGS LIMITED) CREDIT RATINGS AFFIRMED AND OUTLOOK CHANGED

On 22 November 2019, S&P Global Ratings (""S&P"") revised its outlook on
South Africa to negative on weakening fiscal and debt trajectory and
sizable contingent liabilities. S&P's policy is to not rate financial
institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency long term
sovereign ratings, of  BB' and short term ratings of  B' due to the
direct and indirect impacts a sovereign distress would have on South
African banks' operations. Capitec Bank's credit ratings' outlook has
therefore been revised to negative from stable on 26 November 2019.

Simultaneously, S&P affirmed the global and national scale ratings of
Capitec Bank. The global long term ratings remain  BB' and the global
short term ratings  B'. The national scale long term ratings are
affirmed as 'zaAA' and the national short term ratings  zaA-1+'.

Due to the continued volatility in the market and Mr le Roux's age, this
transaction enabled Limietberg Sekuriteit (Pty) Ltd (""Limietberg"") to
protect the downside risk of the share price at 90% of the current value
(""Put strike price"") on 1 250 000 Capitec shares. In order to reduce the
cost of the protection, Limietberg was willing to forfeit the growth above
150% of the current value (""Call strike price"") of the shares. It is
Limietberg's intention to cash settle the transaction at maturity as opposed
to selling any shares.

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

The boards of Capitec and Capitec Bank (""the boards"") are very
sad to announce that Riaan Stassen, one of the founders of
Capitec Bank, has decided to retire. Riaan played an integral
role in the establishment and success of the bank from 2001
to 2013 when he retired as chief executive officer of Capitec
and Capitec Bank. Riaan served as non-executive chairman of
the boards from 2016 and will retire on 31 May 2019.

The boards and management thank and honour Riaan for the
significant role he played in the success of the Capitec group
and wish him well in his retirement. His commitment and
steadfast leadership will be greatly missed.
The boards are delighted to advise that Ms Santie Botha has
agreed to join the boards. Santie's appointment will
strengthen the independent element of the boards and support
the continuous drive to augment board acumen.

Santie's appointment will be effective 1 June 2019. She will
take over as chairman of the boards from Riaan.

Summary curriculum vitae of Santie Botha

Banking is about people, passionately delivering on clients' needs

We remain focused on delivering on our purpose: to enable clients to improve their financial lives. This is done with an unwavering commitment to the 4 fundamentals
that have made Capitec so successful.

Simplicity, our brand essence, permeates through the way we design our banking solutions, pricing, digital services and communication. We believe that simplicity,
delivered transparently, puts our clients in control of their money.

We are determined to deliver solutions that provide value for money to clients. Our cost-conscious culture and innovative processes and technology allow us to reduce
the cost of banking. We pass the saving on to our clients, making banking more affordable.

We continue to make banking accessible through our 840 branches (14 new) and the extended trading hours of over 300 Sunday banking branches. We however also
accelerated our digital banking development and are experiencing significant growth in this regard, with over 5.2 million clients using digital channels to access
their money from anywhere at any time.

The Capitec brand is further differentiated by a personalised, omni-channel client experience that aims to build long-term relationships with our clients. We created
441 new jobs and now employ 13 774 people focused on understanding clients' needs, and developing or delivering better experiences across our physical and digital
service channels.

The industry is experiencing a challenging economic climate in addition to the prospect of new competitors. Our strategy remains to focus on our clients with a 
combination of digital banking, a branch network, and relevant and insightful communication to help them bank better. This, combined with our ability 
to adapt to the changing needs of clients, new markets and new technology will remain Capitec's competitive advantage today and in the future.

Earnings up by 19%

Continued growth is testimony to staying true to our fundamentals. Clients trust a solution that they understand, which is reliable and transparent. This focus
resulted in an enhanced credit offering and an increase in transactions due to sustained acquisition of banking clients.

Our client base has grown by 15% to 11.4 million clients (2018: 9.9 million). On average 127 000 clients joined us per month this year.

Easy to use and always in control

Our marketing and pricing strategy promotes transacting on our self-service solutions (including the banking app, internet banking, USSD (primarily feature phones),
in-branch self-service terminals and dual note recyclers (DNRs)) which frees up capacity in branches to ensure that our clients receive more personalised service.
We therefore give our clients the freedom to decide whether they want to go to a branch or whether to do their banking at the time and place that suits them.

Self-service terminal and DNR transactions have increased in volume by 111% to 18 million and 55% to 29 million respectively at the end of February 2019. Net
transaction fee income grew by 26%. Clients continue to move from cash to card with 62% of value spent on card (February 2018: 59%).

The security of our clients' money and personal information is important to us and was considered in the design of our banking app. Over 2.2 million clients actively
use the banking app to make payments, buy prepaid or manage their accounts on a daily basis. The volume of banking app transactions has increased by 75% to 343 million
for the financial year (February 2018: 196 million). The app provides a simple, personalised user experience. We cover the cost of the data when our clients
make use of the app.

Improved processes and advanced technology increased efficiency and allowed us to make digital banking more affordable by lowering our fees. On 1 March 2019, 
transaction fees for payments made via the banking app, internet banking or USSD were reduced from R1.60 to R1.00 and the monthly administration fee of our 
Global One account was reduced from R5.80 to R5.00. By taking all the digital banking fees and the monthly administration fee into consideration, we are putting 
R360 million back into our clients' pockets. To balance this, we increased the cost of cash withdrawal fees at ATMs for amounts over R1 000. The risk of cash handling 
in South Africa has increased significantly over the last few years. As an alternative, real-time clearance is a simple solution for clients to facilitate immediate 
payment on our banking app and internet banking. This is much safer than carrying cash around. We are leading the industry by having reduced the real-time payment 
fees to the other banks from R10.00 to R8.00.

Trust in our brand

Retail deposits increased by 23% to R71 billion. Clients currently earn a minimum of 5% interest per year on any positive balance on their debit or credit cards.
During the 2019 financial year we paid out R3.9 billion in interest on retail call, fixed deposits and credit card accounts.

Wholesale funding decreased by 18% from R6.2 billion to R5.1 billion during 2019. The funding requirement of the loan book is met by retail fixed deposits, retained
earnings and wholesale funding.

One funeral plan, more cover

We identified a need for a client-centric, affordable funeral plan.

The value proposition from a pricing, benefit and service experience perspective has contributed to the market acceptance of the offering. The Capitec funeral 
plan has benefits such as the waiver of the waiting period if transferring existing risk cover from a registered insurer, and a new-born premium waiver benefit 
that celebrates additions to clients' families at no cost for up to 6 months while still enjoying cover and peace of mind.

The plan is transparent, easy to understand and is available via our 840 branches and on the banking app. 80% of the policies to date were issued in the branch. This
is further evidence of how important our branch network remains to best serve clients. At financial year end more than 360 000 policies were active. We are
pleased that we could expand on our Bank Better, Live Better principle with the Capitec funeral plan, and help our clients to manage their broader financial needs.

Credit for the right reasons

When clients understand credit, they use it responsibly. This assists them in reaching their financial goals.

We encourage our clients to match the term of the loan that they take to the purpose for which they require the loan. Consequently, 56% of the value of loans were
at shorter terms or lower values, compared to what the client qualified for.

We have also initiated a debt alleviation program to assist clients that have experienced a loss of income outside of  their control.

Extension of credit

The effect of credit optimisation strategies resulted in a decrease in the shorter term credit products and increase in longer term loans. Against the background of a
lacklustre economy, and increased credit risk-taking in the unsecured credit market, we introduced further granting restrictions. We curbed granting to clients who
exhibited tendencies to frequently borrow the maximum amount on offer and we built on our prudent approach applied in affordability assessments by increasing our
minimum living expenses threshold. Notwithstanding this, we grew and optimised our book through a focus on client quality and protecting the book from clients prone to
go under debt review.

It is our strategy to drive the price of unsecured lending lower. Those clients with positive credit behaviour receive our best interest rates and we have a lower
return on equity target for these clients. The average interest rate charged for this group was 17.5% compared to the book average of 24%. Our unsecured lending rates
go as low as 12.9% and we charge credit insurance on the actual amount of outstanding debt and not on the original amount advanced. This differentiates the Capitec
credit protection plan in the market.

Our credit card offer has been well-received by the market, with a monthly fee that remained unchanged at R35 and an interest rate as low as prime. With an average of
14 000 new credit card clients per month, disbursements increased by 57% to R6.2 billion. At 28 February 2019, the gross credit card book was R3.6 billion and
comprises approximately 3% of the total South African retail credit card market.

: Loan revenue
:
: We implemented International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, the revised accounting standard for financial instruments, on 1 March 2018. 
: Under IFRS 9, once a loan rolls into stage 3 (non-performing book), the interest recognised on the loan is netted after deducting the related provision. This net 
: interest recognition decreased total interest received on loans and the related net credit impairment charge by R1.1 billion for the current year. This aspect of the 
: change has no impact on the overall profit, but results in increasing the cost-to-income ratio.
:
: Loan book, impairments and bad debts written off
: 
: The loan book performed well with a strict credit extension policy applied. The total net loans and advances include 87% of up-to-date loans (1 March 2018: 84%).
: Loans up to 3 months in arrears decreased by 8%. From 1 March 2018, under IFRS 9, up-to-date with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) and total up-to-date
: that rescheduled (not yet rehabilitated) decreased 14% and 10% respectively.
: 
: At 28 February 2018, under IAS 39, the previous accounting standard, loans and advances were written off at the earlier of when they were more than 3 months in
: arrears or had a legal status. Under IFRS 9, loans can only be written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. We consider this point to be when 
: a loan has a present value of future recovery of less than 5%.
: 
: A large portion of loans more than 3 months in arrears have therefore not yet been handed over or written off due to the change in write-off policy. This has resulted
: in a build-up of loans on the balance sheet that are more than 3 months in arrears, with an appropriate provision. Previously these loans were written off. 
:
: After transition to IFRS 9 our focus on maximising collections continues. We utilise a combination of cutting edge machine learning and
: regression score card techniques to complement our years of operational experience in this environment.
: 
: No receivable is recognised post write-off for any possible recoveries and any amount received post write-off will be recognised as a bad debt recovered. The expected
: recoveries receivable on 1 March 2018 (R906 million) represented the  net present value of expected future recoveries on loans that were written off previously under
: IAS 39 (the receivable). Under IFRS 9, no future expected receivable is recognised post write-off. As a result, the receivable was run-down in the current period and
: bad debts recovered were reduced by R906 million.

: * In the current period, under IFRS 9, the credit impairment charge is recognised on a net basis for all loans classified as stage 3, reducing interest and bad
:   debt written off by R1 073 million for the year ended February 2019.


The coverage of 109% for the total provision for credit impairment to stage 3 (excluding expected recoveries receivables) and stage 2 (up to 1 month in arrears)
reflects that our provisioning methodology remains conservative.

Tax

Insurance income and funeral income is received from the related cell captives as a dividend after tax. In the current year, the tax attributable to the profits on 
cell captives was deducted from the net insurance income and funeral income and excluded from the tax expense line. This has resulted in the effective tax rate, as disclosed, 
decreasing to 25.2% for the current year. Together with the tax paid in the cell captives, the effective tax rate for the bank remains approximately 28%.

Credit ratings

S&P Global Ratings affirmed Capitec Bank's ratings on 22 November 2018 with a stable outlook. We have a global long-term rating of BB and a short-term global rating of B. 
The South African long-term national scale rating is zaAA and the short-term rating is zaA-1+. Our global long-term rating is the same as the sovereign rating, as
well as those of other large South African banks.

Strong capital levels and healthy liquidity

We have sufficient capital to meet our growth requirements. At 28 February 2019 the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 33.9%.

The IFRS 9 transition after applying the phase-in resulted in a 0.5% decrease in the CAR based on the current year's capital and risk-weighted assets.

IFRS 16, that relates to leases, with an implementation date of 1 March 2019, will result in an estimated reduction of 1.3% to 1.5% in the CAR, 
for which no phase-in period is applicable. IFRS 16 brings operating leases onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with a corresponding liability.

We are awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition of Mercantile Bank Holdings Limited. The transaction will be funded out of cash reserves and no additional
equity will be required. The impact of this acquisition on our CAR can be met by the reallocation of assets in the investment portfolio.

Investing in growth and efficiency

Operating expenses increased by 18%, in line with earnings growth. The increase was driven by information technology, security costs, an increase in employees in the
digital and credit value streams, new product offerings and salary incentives due to the 57% share price increase. We are building a new head office which we expect
to be completed in 2020. The new building will increase operational efficiencies and collaboration between the business units that are currently distributed across a
number of buildings.

We are implementing a new SAP general ledger, human resources and procurement system to establish high-performance support services capability, efficiencies and to
assist in increasing throughput.

Prospects

Our continued investment in new payment solutions, digital development and advanced data and analytics will allow us to offer retail clients easier ways to bank and
more personalised credit offers.

We regard the acquisition of Mercantile Bank Holdings Limited as a strategic move to accelerate the development of a unique business banking offer for our clients.

Changes in board composition

On 28 November 2018, Daniel Petrus Meintjes was appointed as an independent non-executive director. He has comprehensive business experience and insight. 
We welcome him to the board.

Nonhlanhla Mjoli?Mncube will retire from the board effective 31 May 2019. We thank her for her 15 years? dedicated service to the group.

Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, 
as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summary consolidated financial statements were derived are
in terms of IFRS, including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was effective from 1 March 2018. Capitec elected, as permitted by IFRS 9, not to restate comparative
financial statements. The impact of adopting IFRS 9 was applied as a downward adjustment to the opening retained earnings at 1 March 2018 of R648 million. This 
included a credit impairment (ECL) of R900 million on loans and advances and financial investments. The remainder of the amount related to increased tax.

In calculating the ECL for the year, key areas of significant management estimation and judgement included determining SICR thresholds, write-off being when there 
is no reasonable expectation of further recovery (5% of balance before write-off), assumptions used in the forward-looking economic model, event overlays and how 
historical data is used to project ECL.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was adopted on 1 March 2018. The accounting policy was updated to reflect the terminology in the new standard but it had
no impact on the financial information reported in the current or comparative period.

Capitec assessed revenue recognised from contracts with customers by nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows that are affected by economic
factors. Based on this assessment, revenue is appropriately disaggregated for loan fee income, transaction fee income and funeral income.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the 2019 consolidated financial statements are consistent with the previous consolidated annual financial 
statements, with the above IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 exception. In the current year, the cash inflow from participants to acquire shares to settle employee share options 
was disclosed separately from the cash outflow for shares acquired to settle employee share options.

All other standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards applied for the first time during the current financial period did not have any significant
impact on the financial statements.

The sections enclosed by dotted lines as well as the summary consolidated statement of financial position, summary consolidated income statement, summary consolidated 
statement of other comprehensive income, reconciliation of attributable earnings to headline earnings, summary consolidated statement of cash flows, summary 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, commitments, segment analysis, fair values, related party transactions, events past the date of the statement of 
financial position and notes are audited.

The preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements was supervised by the chief financial officer, Andre du Plessis CA(SA).

Independent auditor?s opinion

These summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2019 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an 
unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified opinion on the annual financial statements from which these summary consolidated financial 
statements were derived.

A copy of the auditor?s report on the summary consolidated financial statements and of the auditor?s report on the annual consolidated financial statements are 
available for inspection at the company?s registered office, together with the financial statements identified in the respective auditor?s reports.

The auditor?s report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this announcement/financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised 
that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor?s engagement they should obtain a copy of the auditor?s report together with the 
accompanying financial information from the company?s registered office. The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the report and that the 
financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying annual financial statements.

protect the downside risk of the share price at 90% of the current value

cost of the protection, Limietberg was willing to forfeit the growth above
170% of the current value (""Call strike price"") of the shares. It is

ACQUISITION OF MERCANTILE BANK HOLDINGS LIMITED AND ITS
SUBSIDIARIES (""MERCANTILE"")

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement dated 18
June 2018 that Capitec Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capitec, made a non-binding offer to purchase Mercantile. A
further notification, included in Capitec’s interim results
published on SENS on 26 September 2018, stated that Capitec
Bank submitted a formal bid on 31 August 2018 to acquire
Mercantile. The offer was made subsequent to the conclusion of
a detailed due diligence on the operations of Mercantile.

The Board is pleased to advise shareholders that Capitec
Bank’s offer of R3.2 billion, to be adjusted by any change in
the net asset value of Mercantile from 30 April 2018 to the
completion date of the transaction, when all conditions
precedent have been met, has been accepted. The purchase
consideration will be paid from capital and cash reserves.

The Board of Capitec Bank believes there are many
opportunities in the market to serve small-to-medium
enterprises and owner-managed businesses better, and the bank
has commenced with a strategy to develop infrastructure to
facilitate same. The acquisition of Mercantile will obviate
the need to reinvent and create new systems and processes from
scratch and thus fast track the bank’s objective to expand its
focus to a broader bank strategy.

Mercantile’s core business offer is business banking for
small- to medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs and it is
therefore well positioned to align with Capitec Bank’s
business banking strategy. It was offered for sale by its
shareholder, Caixa Geral de Depósitos S.A., a Portuguese bank,
because it is divesting from non-core operations outside of
Portugal as part of its recapitalisation plan.

The transaction is subject to regulatory authority.
Shareholders will be informed once all regulatory approvals
have been received and the transaction is final.

(1) Transition to IFRS 9 ï¿½ Financial Instruments on 1 March 2018. The figures as at 28 February 2018 were adjusted accordingly. Please refer to the 
    audited transitional report on our website that illustrates the impact of implementing IFRS 9 on 1 March 2018. 
    (https://resources.capitecbank.co.za/Capitec_-_IFRS9_transitional_report.pdf)
(2) In the current period, under IFRS 9, interest income and net provision for doubtful debts charge are recognised on a net basis for all loans classified as
    Stage 3 (R442 million for period end August 2018). Refer to table 2: IFRS 9 income recognition impact
(3) Insurance profit is received from the cell captives as a dividend after tax. The tax expense on insurance profit is included in net insurance income
    and deducted from the tax expense line for the period ended August 2018: R142 million (August 2017: R109 million, February 2018: R245 million)
(4) Cash, cash equivalents, money market funds, term deposits and other financial investments
(5) Includes credit card. For the number of loans advanced, a month in which the credit card is utilised is counted
(6) Not rehabilitated - Clients are deemed to be rehabilitated once they have made contractual payments for 6 consecutive months. Once rehabilitated, the loan is
    classified as up-to-date
(7) Interest received on loans, initiation fees, monthly service fee and net insurance income

Strong client growth drives performance 

Our focus on delivering simple, affordable, accessible solutions through personal service to our clients, and unlocking the full potential of our team, generates 
shareholder value and improves clients' financial lives.

We continuously improve efficiencies to ensure clients receive the best service and are able to be in control of their money. We attracted 109 000 additional active
clients every month for the last 6 months.

Our digital innovation remains focused on offering clients convenience and security. Self-service banking transactions (including the banking app; internet banking; 
unstructured supplementary service data or USSD, which is mostly used by clients who do not have smart phones; in-branch self-service terminals and dual note recyclers) 
have increased in volume by 27% to 295 million at the end of August 2018 (August 2017: 231 million). For the 6 month period ended August 2018, 146 million transactions 
had been performed via our banking app. The app was used by 1.8 million clients ï¿½ an increase of 62% from August 2017.

Continuous refinements to our credit strategy resulted in an improvement in the quality of the loan book. Arrears up to 3 months decreased by 10% and bad debts 
recovered increased by 14% for the 6 months since 1 March 2018.

We have expanded our product offering and introduced funeral insurance from 21 May 2018. The performance to date is in line with expectations and we are 
pleased with the market acceptance.

Earnings up 20%

Client centricity and a team dedicated to operating efficiently has resulted in a return on equity of 27%. Headline earnings increased by 20% to R2.46 billion for 
the period ended August 2018 from R2.05 billion for the comparative 6 month period ended August 2017.

Net transaction fee income growth of 32%

Net transaction fee income (non-lending) increased from R2.4 billion to R3.1 billion. Net transaction fee income now comprises 47% of total net income and 
covers 90% of operating expenses.

Total transactional volume, including self-service banking transactions, increased by 25% due to increased usage and a 15% increase in active clients. Of all 
possible transactions that can be performed in a branch or through self-service banking channels, clients elected to perform 84% through self-service banking 
channels for the 6 month period ended August 2018 (August 2017: 74%). Self-service banking increases efficiency, saving our clients time and money.

Conservative lending growth

The value of loan sales grew by 4% compared to the period ended 31 August 2017. The net loan book growth of 3% is in line with sales growth. Our credit 
granting strategy resulted in loan sales with a product term between 73 and 84 months increasing by 121%, and loan sales with a product term between 
1 and 12 months decreasing by 10%. Credit card sales increased by 54% with the lowest credit card interest rate now being 10% per annum. As shown in table 2 below, 
the 1% increase in total lending and insurance income, excluding investment income, on a gross basis, is driven by sales of longer-term loans with lower interest rates.

In the prior period, we communicated improvements to our credit solution. Last year we strengthened our credit solution to allow clients to choose either the 
amount that suits their purpose, monthly instalments that suit their cash flow or an option that gives them the best interest rate. The stricter granting criteria applied 
since the prior period also resulted in extending loans to better quality clients.

We continue to improve our understanding of clientsï¿½ behaviour and risk profiles. This allows us to price loans accordingly and achieve a healthier, more 
sustainable loan book.

Improved quality credit book, prudent provisioning retained

August 2018 compared to August 2017

The total up-to-date book growth was 6% from 31 August 2017. The arrears loan book at 31 August 2017 can be compared to loans up to 3 months in arrears on 
31 August 2018. Total arrears up to 3 months decreased by 3%. 

The coverage of total provision for doubtful debts to Stage 3 (excluding expected recoveries receivables) and Stage 2 (up to 1 month in arrears) is comparable to the 
prior year coverage ratio of provision for doubtful debts to arrears and all reschedules within 6 months. In the current period, this coverage was 121% compared 
to 120% in the prior period. We continue to be prudent in our approach to provisioning.

August 2018 compared to 1 March 2018

The up-to-date book growth was 7% from 1 March 2018. Up-to-date loans with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) decreased by 21% from 
1 March 2018 to 31 August 2018. This was due to improved behaviour scores and maintaining a strict credit granting strategy during this reporting period.

Loans up to 1 month in arrears decreased by 9% and loans 2 and 3 months in arrears decreased by 11% from 1 March 2018 to 31 August 2018.

Up-to-date loans that rescheduled from up-to-date (not yet rehabilitated) decreased by 11% and loans that rescheduled from arrears (not yet rehabilitated) increased 
by 8% when compared to 1 March 2018. 

The improved up-to-date, SICR and loans up to 3 months in arrears is a direct result of the credit granting strategy applied.
The improved quality of the book and better behaviour scores of clients in arrears have resulted in more clients being approved for rescheduling, according to 
our policy, during the last 6 months. This is due to improved performance of loans that rescheduled, rehabilitated and rolled back into up-to-date.

The coverage of total provision for doubtful debts to Stage 3 (excluding expected recoveries receivables) and Stage 2 (up to 1 month in arrears) decreased 
from 130% at 1 March 2018 to 121% at 31 August 2018. This is largely due to the change in our write-off policy, as discussed in the IFRS 9 section below.

IFRS 9

We prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
IFRS 9 is the revised accounting standard for financial instruments and was implemented to address perceived deficiencies that were believed to have contributed 
to the magnitude of the financial crisis of 2008. The new provision model under IFRS 9 addresses criticism of the provision models previously used, which only 
recognised credit losses once incurred. Under IFRS 9, however, credit losses are recognised on default events projected over the next 12 months or over the lifetime of 
the asset. Application of this new standard enhances consistency across credit providersï¿½ financial statements and disclosures.

We transitioned to IFRS 9 on 1 March 2018. We announced the publication of the audited IFRS 9 ï¿½ Financial Instruments Transitional Report as at 
1 March 2018 on SENS on 16 August 2018. The report can be viewed at https://resources.capitecbank.co.za/Capitec_-_IFRS9_transitional_report.pdf. The report 
illustrates the impact, provisioning methodology and revised accounting policies following the implementation of IFRS 9. As previously disclosed, the final impact 
on the retained earnings opening balance on 1 March 2018 was R900 million pre-tax, and R648 million post-tax.

The 6 month period ended 31 August 2018 is the first period during which the IFRS 9 provision methodology was applied. Comparative information was not restated, 
as permitted by IFRS 9.

Loans previously written off were not written back. By 31 August 2018, a large portion of loans more than 3 months in arrears had not yet been handed over or 
written off due to the change in accounting write-off policy. This has resulted in a build-up of loans on balance sheet that are more than 3 months in arrears, 
with an appropriate provision at 31 August 2018. Previously, these loans were written off. Table 1 below shows the proportionate change in write-off and 
appropriate provision raised under IFRS 9 compared with the prior period.

Under IFRS 9, once a loan rolls into Stage 3, the interest is recognised after deducting the related provision charge. On a gross basis (illustrative), 
the total provision for doubtful debts charge (bad debts written off and movement in provision) increased by 11% on a 10% growth in gross loans and
advances in the current period.

R66 billion in retail deposits

The total retail deposits increased to R66 billion by the end of August 2018 (August 2017: R55 billion). Retail call savings increased by 22% and retail fixed savings
by 15%. The consistent, growth within the current period is confirmation of continnued brand confidence from retail depositors.

Wholesale funding decreased by 18%, to R5.8 billion (August 2017: R7.0 billion). The requirement for wholesale funding is low as loan growth was moderate in relation
to fixed-term retail deposits and internal capital generation growth. Strong support from the market was again confirmed during our bond issuance in May
2018 where we received bids totalling R1.9 billion versus R500 million that was required and issued.

Robust capital and low liquidity risk retained

Our capital adequacy ratio was 36% at 31 August 2018. Should we re-allocate funds in the investment portfolio to lower-risk-weighted government instruments, the ratio
could be increased by 4%. The bank is well positioned for growth from a capital perspective.

At 31 August 2018, our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 1 923% and our net stable funding ratio (NSFR) was 205%. These market-leading ratios are the result of our
conservatism when managing liquidity.

Credit ratings

S&P affirmed all of the credit ratings of Capitec Bank on 13 September 2018. The long-term global rating is 'BB' and the short-term global rating is 'B'. The outlook
is stable. The South African national scale ratings are affirmed as 'zaAA' long term and 'zaA-1+' short term. Our global long-term rating is the same as the sovereign 
rating as well as those of other large South African banks.

Cost of operations up 11%

Our operating costs increased from R3.2 billion to R3.5 billion in the current period. Our cost-to-income ratio remained at 36% on an illustrative gross basis (38%
under IFRS 9) comparative to the 6 month period last year.

Growth in staff, branches and investment in our IT infrastructure are the main drivers for the increase in costs.

The client growth created job oppurtunities and 377 employees have joined our team since February 2018. We hire for potential and train for competence, which resulted in more
learning and training interventions over the past 6 months. The investment in IT infrastructure, increased up-take of self-service banking and more branch staff, unlocks
the capacity to cross-sell and ensures our clients receive the best personal service.

We make use of cell captives for insurance and receive the profits in the cell captives after tax in the form of dividends. In the current period, the tax
attributable to the profits on cell captives of R142 million was deducted from the net insurance income line as opposed to including it in the total tax expense line.
This has resulted in the effective tax rate decreasing to 24.3% for the current period.

Prospects

We plan to expand our product offering to include business banking. This may include the acquisition of Mercantile Bank Holdings Limited, for which we submitted a
formal bid on 31 August 2018. We await the outcome.

We completed the 2nd tranche investment in Cream Finance Holdings Limited (Creamfinance) which included existing shareholders exercising their option on 
10 September 2018. This takes our shareholding to 40.25%. The 3rd tranche is expected to be invested early in the next financial year.

Our 2020 financial year strategy and budget review started earlier this month and will factor in the implementation of IFRS 16, which is effective from 1 March 2019. 
IFRS 16 impacts operating leases whereby a lessee is required to recognise a leased asset for the right of use and a related liability as the present value of 
future lease payments. Our branches and ATM operating lease arrangements will be affected from 1 March 2019 under the new accounting standard.

Interim dividend

The directors declared a gross interim dividend for the 6 months ended 31 August 2018 of 630 cents per ordinary share (31 August 2017: 525 cents) on Tuesday, 
25 September 2018. The dividend will be paid on Monday, 22 October 2018. There are 115 626 991 ordinary shares in issue.

The dividend meets the definition of a dividend in terms of the Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962). The dividend amount, net of South African dividend tax of 20%, is 
504 cents per share. The distribution is made from income reserves. Capitec's tax reference number is 9405376840.

Segment analysis

The group reports a single segment - retail banking - within the South African economic environment. The business is widely distributed and has no reliance on any
major clients. In addition, no client accounts for more than 10% of revenue.

Fair values

In terms of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', the fair value determined for disclosure purposes of loans and advances (level 3) was R43.2 billion (August 2017: 
R43.8 billion), retail deposits (level 2) was R66.4 billion (August 2017: R55.7 billion) and wholesale funding (level 2) was R5.9 billion (August 2017: R7.2 billion). 
The measured fair value of derivative assets (level 2) was valued at R25.9 million (August 2017: R63.5 million), available-for-sale investments (level 3) was R100 million
(August 2017: R102 million) and derivative liabilities (level 2) was R11.4 million (August 2017: R73.5 million). The fair value of all other financial instruments
equates to their carrying amount.

Unaudited interim financial statements

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 ï¿½Interim Financial Reportingï¿½, 
the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards 
Council and the requirements of the Companies Act, Act 71 of 2008, as amended.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these interim financial statements are in terms of IFRS, including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was 
effective from 1 March 2018. Capitec elected as permitted by IFRS 9, not to restate comparative financial statements, with the impact of IFRS 9 being applied 
retrospectively as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings of 1 March 2018. The accounting policies applied are consistent with the previous consolidated 
annual financial statements, with the above IFRS 9 exception.

All other standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards applied for the first time during the current financial period did not have any significant
impact on the financial statements. The Group complies in all material respects, with the requirements of the King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa
2016. Basel disclosures, in terms of Regulation 43 of the Banks Act, Act 94 of 1990, are available on the Capitec Bank website.

No event that is material to the financial affairs of the Group, has occurred between the reporting date and the date of approval of the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were not reviewed or audited by the Companyï¿½s auditors.

The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements was supervised by the chief financial officer, Andre du Plessis CA(SA).

S&P GLOBAL RATINGS (“S&P”) RAISES CAPITEC BANK’S NATIONAL
SCALE RATINGS

S&P has raised the national scale long-term credit ratings of
Capitec Bank, the wholly owned subsidiary of Capitec, to
‘zaAA’ from ‘zaAA-’. This change was effected by S&P after
“the revision of its criteria on national scale ratings and
subsequent recalibration of the mapping table for South
Africa”.

All other ratings remained unchanged. The global scale long-
term rating remains ‘BB’ with a stable outlook. The global
scale short-term rating remains ‘B’ whilst the national scale
ratings remains ‘zaA-1+’.

All Summit assisted and initiated court and NCR cases

contention in these cases was against the multi loan product
which Capitec discontinued in February 2016. Both parties
have agreed to work together in improving the unsecured
lending industry for the benefit of all South Africans. This
initiative will include programs to improve consumer
financial literacy, providing effective consumer debt relief
solutions and building consumer financial capability. We
believe that this is an important joint step in bringing
positive change in the South African credit industry.

NON-BINDING OFFER TO ACQUIRE MERCANTILE BANK HOLDINGS LIMITED
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (“MERCANTILE”)

Shareholders are advised that Capitec Bank, the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec has made a non-binding offer to purchase
Mercantile. Mercantile’s core business offer is business
banking to small- to medium-sized enterprises and
entrepreneurs. The shareholder of Mercantile, Caixa Geral de
Depositos, S.A., a Portuguese bank, wishes to divestment from
non-core operations outside of Portugal, of which Mercantile
is one such investment.

Capitec Bank is one of a number of interested parties whose
non-binding offer to purchase Mercantile has been accepted.
Capitec Bank will now commence with a formal, in-depth due
diligence exercise to determine whether the opportunity
presented by Mercantile fulfils Capitec Bank’s expectation to
build the Capitec Bank business bank strategy.

Capitec will keep the market informed of developments as and
when appropriate. Any proposed transaction will be subject to
regulatory authority approvals.

Capitec continues to investigate strategic opportunities to
enhance shareholder value and deliver to its commitment to the
market in offering affordable, simple and transparent banking
services.

Steadfast fundamentals
We help clients manage their financial lives better, so they can live better. Our single financial solution, Global One,
can be used in any way, from anywhere and at any time. We expect to achieve an active client base totalling 10 million by
the end of this month. Our clients trust in our financial solution, delivers real value through personal service and supports
continued growth. The simplicity of our solution ensures that clients know exactly what they pay for, and gives them full
control of their money.

The results for the year are a reflection of the continuous focus on our fundamentals.

Earnings up 18%
Headline earnings increased by 18% from R3.8 billion to R4.5 billion, and generated a return of 27% on our shareholders'
equity for the 2018 financial year.

Our diversification strategy is evident by the increased earnings generated from each income stream.

Net transactional income growth of 31%
Net transaction fee income (non-lending) increased from R3.9 billion to R5.1 billion in 2018. The net transaction fee
income to operating expenses increased from 72% to 81%, which is in line with our objectives to cover all operating costs
with net transaction fees by 2022.

Net transaction fee income now makes up 41% of total net income. This is a result of our focus on self-service banking,
which has experienced a significant increase in transaction volumes. This investment and innovation delivers cost benefits
and further efficiencies to our clients and frees up capacity for our consultants to better serve and address the needs of
our clients in the branches. For the 5th consecutive year, the latest South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi)
for Banking, conducted by Consulta, revealed that Capitec continues to lead with the most satisfied customers. 

The increase in quality banking clients (a client becomes a quality banking client if they have stable inflows into their
account and stable product usage over a consecutive 3 month period) of 18% and the continuous focus and improvement on our
self-service banking transactions, increased total transaction volumes by 27%. Self-service banking transactions include
the banking app, internet banking, unstructured supplementary service data (USSD - mostly used by clients who do not have
smart phones), in-branch self-service terminals and dual note recyclers (DNRs).

74% of all possible transactions were performed by clients on self-service banking channels in 2018, compared to 62% in 2017.
Transaction volumes for in-branch self-service terminals increased by 491%, and by 124% for DNRs in the current year.

Over 3 million clients have activated our banking app. For the month of February 2018, the app facilitated more than 20
million transactions. When our clients make use of our app, we cover the cost of the data. The banking app's wide appeal
is evidenced by the fact that it is not only the most downloaded banking app in South Africa, but that it is also the 9th
most downloaded app overall on the Google Play store in South Africa. This is according to the SA Social Media Landscape
Report 2018 by brand intelligence organisation, Ornico, and high-tech market research consultancy, World Wide Worx.

Monthly average retail deposit growth of R800 million
Total retail fixed savings increased by 28% to R23 billion and total retail call savings increased by 16% to R35 billion
for the current year. Any positive balance on our debit or credit cards earns interest of at least 5.1% per year. Our
clients earned more than R3.4 billion in interest for the 2018 financial year.


Wholesale funding decreased from R7.5 billion to R6.2 billion. Wholesale funding was lowered deliberately due to the strong
retail fixed deposit and earnings growth, accompanied by a moderate loan book growth. Nonetheless, we will maintain a presence
in the debt capital markets.

Personalised credit
Unsecured lending plays an important role in the South African credit market. The majority of South Africans, for example,
live in dwellings on communal land or in townships with no title deeds. Consequently, the majority of the population is
only able to build or improve their homes through accessing unsecured finance. More than 75% of South Africans do not have
access to traditional secured lending to finance assets such as vehicles older than 5 years and appliances.

Our credit granting approach consistently evolves with our clients' needs and behaviour as well as our risk appetite. In
line with the loan book growth, loan revenue increased by 6% for the current year and a better performing loan book was
achieved due to our conservative credit granting policy.

The 2018 financial year presents the first full 12 month performance of our credit card. As at 28 February 2018,
289 000 active credit cards were in issue, with a total book value of R2 billion. This represents 4.2% of the total loan
book. The monthly fee on our credit card is R35. The performance is in line with our expectations.

Arrears as a percentage of gross loans and advances decreased from 6.3% to 5.7%. This includes all loans that are not up-
to-date with contractual obligations. Arrears and up-to-date loans that were rescheduled from arrears (not rehabilitated -
have not made 6 consecutive contractual payments) as a percentage of gross loans and advances, decreased from 9.8% to
8.3%. This is a direct result of the stricter credit granting strategy and rescheduling policy, as well as the increase
of clients in debt review. In terms of our bad and doubtful debt methodology, regardless of loan status, when a client
goes into debt review, the outstanding loan balance is substantially written off.

Our provision for doubtful debts as a percentage of gross loans and advances decreased from 13.1% to 12.2% and the provision
coverage of arrears increased from 208% to 216%. The lower provision percentage and higher coverage ratio is a direct result
of the better performing loan book.

The increase in bad debt written off in the current year is mostly due to the increase in the number of clients in debt
review. Bad debts recovered increased due to improved collection efficiencies and initiatives.

Investing in our operations
Our operating costs increased by 17% from R5.4 billion to R6.4 billion in the current year. Our cost-to-income ratio is 36%.

The focus on self-service banking to improve efficiency and capacity in existing branches resulted in the opening of
30 new branches in strategic areas during the year. We now have 727 DNRs and 467 in-branch self-service terminals
to aid in the improvement of our service and client experience - the increases of which amount to 38% and 213%, respectively.
Key personnel appointments were made in business development and digital solutions to support further growth initiatives.

Insure
We believe that offering insurance solutions that are personalised and competitively priced will deliver value to our
clients and disrupt the insurance market in a similar way to what we do in banking.

Save. Transact. Insure. Credit.

The unique funeral traditions in South Africa often result in clients who earn an income being responsible for the
considerable costs of a funeral for either a direct family member or a dependant in their broader community.

We aim to launch the Capitec Funeral Plan, underwritten by Sanlam, in May 2018, as part of Insure, the new addition to our
Global One Solution. This is an opportunity to further diversify our business and expand our product offering to clients
to improve their financial lives.

Our funeral cover solution ensures that clients will only contribute what they can afford. A single contract can benefit
up to 21 dependents. The voluntary pause option will allow policyholders to put their policy on hold for a maximum of
6 months if they are under financial strain. The new-born premium waiver benefit celebrates additions to clients' families
at no cost for up to 6 months while still enjoying cover and peace of mind. Should an unnatural death or accident occur,
the life assured will be covered immediately at twice the amount.

We believe that this solution will provide our clients with financial means to cover expenses during a period when they
need someone they can trust and rely on.

Strong capital, low liquidity risk, excess funds
Capitec remains well capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 36%. The bank continues to meet all prudential 
requirements.

We comply with the Basel 3 liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) as well as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Our LCR is 
1 878% and NSFR is 206% as a result of the conservative liquidity strategy we implemented since the inception of the
bank.

We manage our clients' funds in a diligent and conservative manner. Client deposits are invested in simple and easy to
understand interest-bearing investments such as South African National Treasury Bills. These investments are, on average,
for periods shorter than 3 months, with no single investment longer than 1 year. We use our equity, the wholesale funds
received from institutions and, the bulk of fixed-term client deposits, to lend out to individual clients. We have
a conservative approach to credit, price appropriately in compliance with the National Credit Act, Act 34 of 2005,
for the risk and make adequate provisions for bad debt. Our approach to capital is consistent with our approach to liquidity
and credit, and our capital levels are well above that which is required. This policy will continue to be applied as consistently
as it has been since inception. Through deliberately maintaining substantial levels of capital, we protect client deposits should
a major unforeseen event, such as a global financial crisis, occur.

Credit ratings
The South African sovereign rating was downgraded on 24 November 2017. In its ratings report, S&P Global indicated that it
does not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency sovereign ratings. Consequently, S&P
Global lowered its ratings on 6 financial institutions operating in South Africa, including Capitec Bank.

Capitec Bank's global long-term rating was lowered to ""BB"" from ""BB+"". The global short-term rating remains at ""B"". These
ratings carry a stable outlook. While, the national long-term rating was lowered to ""zaAA-"", the national short-term
rating was affirmed at ""zaA-1+"". Capitec Bank carries the same long-term foreign currency rating as the South African
sovereign.

Thank you
We will continue to help people better manage their financial lives. We want to thank our clients for their continued
support and for the confidence they place in us.

Our solutions for our clients would not be possible without the great drive from the entire Capitec family. As colleagues
with individual strengths and skills, we make a strong team because of shared goals and commitment. We thank every member
of the team for their part in what we have achieved, and are excited to pursue the goals we have set for ourselves.

Prospects
Sustained focus on our fundamentals will keep us on course to become the best retail bank in the world.

was R44.1 billion (February 2017: R43.2 billion), retail deposits (level 2) was R58.1 billion (February 2017: R48.1 billion)
and wholesale funding (level 2) was R6.4 billion (February 2017: R7.8 billion). The measured fair value of derivative assets
(level 2) was valued at R0.1 million (February 2017: R58.1 million), available-for-sale investments (level 3) was R100 million
(February 2017: R100 million) and derivative liabilities (level 2) was R54.6 million (February 2017: R45.6 million). The fair
value of all other financial instruments equates to their carrying amount.

Notes
The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for preliminary reports, and the requirements of the Companies Act, Act 71 of 2008, applicable to summary financial
statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts
and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 'Interim
Financial Reporting'. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from
which the summarised consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those
accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements. All other
standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards applied for the first time during the current financial
period did not have any significant impact on the financial statements. The Group complies in all material respects with
the requirements of the King IV Report on Corporate GovernanceTM for South Africa 2016. Basel disclosures in terms of
Regulation 43 of the Banks' Act, Act 94 of 1990, are available on the Capitec Bank website.

The preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements was supervised by the chief financial officer, 
Andre du Plessis CA(SA).

These summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2018 have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified
opinion on the annual financial statements from which these summarised consolidated financial statements were derived.

SENS ANNOUNCEMENT ON VICEROY REPORT OF 30 JANUARY 2018

The structure of this SENS announcement is to summarise our
responses to each allegation in the 30 January 2018 Viceroy
Research Report (“Viceroy” or “the Report”). The 5 February
2018 allegations have been addressed on the same day. We
incorporated our previous SENS announcements on specific
issues by reference, where appropriate.

CAPITEC STATEMENT

•   A Viceroy Research Report was published publicly on 30
    January 2018 at 10:00 and leaked to at least one
    journalist the previous day
•   We believe we had to deal with this report as well as the
    Benguela Global Fund Managers’ letter, also leaked to the
    press, by providing factual information as necessary
•   We decided to publicly respond to these allegations and
    viewpoints on SENS announcements so that everyone in the
    market has access to all our responses
•   We believe with this final SENS announcement, we have
    responded in detail to all concerns and allegations
    levelled at Capitec
•   As stated in a previous SENS announcement, we believe
    that there will be further attacks by Viceroy in an
    attempt to substantiate their false claims
•   Shareholders are advised to use caution when reacting to
    such reports

CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN THIS REPORT

•   Capitec’s loans and advances are NOT misrepresented, as
    rescheduled loans are not treated as new loan sales
•   NO origination/initiation fees are charged on rescheduled
    loans as NO new credit is advanced
•   Rescheduling is a formal amendment to an existing loan
    contract and rescheduled loans are therefore NOT included
    in loan sales as NO new credit is granted
•   Origination fees are only charged on new loans advanced
•   When an existing loan is consolidated, loan sales only
    contain the amount of the new credit
•    Initiation fees comply with the National Credit Act
•    We DO NOT advance loans to clients who are in arrears
     with any of their Capitec instalments
•    The Report does not consider Capitec’s conservative
     write-off policy and approach to provisions when
     analysing our arrear balances. Comparing Capitec to other
     credit providers with different loan book granting, risk
     appetite and write-off strategies results in misleading
     conclusions. Based on detailed explanations provided in
     our previous SENS announcement on 5 February 2018, NO
     adjustment to the net loan book is therefore required


1.   BACKGROUND

     •   Capitec Bank

         Viceroy states that Capitec’s banking services are
         aimed at the low income market in South Africa. As
         noted on page 35 of the 2017 Integrated Annual Report
         (“IAR”) “Demographic segmentation, especially income
         segmentation, is not used to target a specific type of
         client. The focus is on providing essential banking to
         all clients, regardless of income level.”

         Capitec is a fully-fledged retail bank allowing
         clients to save, transact and borrow. [We will use the
         February 2017 figures in this report, unless otherwise
         stated, to align with the Viceroy Report.] The bank
         had 8.6 million active clients at 28 February 2017. We
         have diversified income streams with net transaction
         fee income contributing 37% of our total net income.
         Net transaction fees (non-lending income) covers 72%
         of our operating expenses. 1.4 million clients borrow
         from the bank with 53% of the balance sheet assets
         exposed to retail unsecured loans.

     •   History of micro lending in South Africa

         Viceroy completely disregards the beneficial role that
         the unsecured credit market plays in South Africa. The
         terminology such as ‘predatory finance’, ‘loan
         sharks’, clients referred to as ‘victims’ is
         deliberately inflammatory and derogatory.

         One example of the role of unsecured lending is that a
         large section of the South African population live in
         dwellings on communal land and townships with no title
         deeds. These people can only build or improve their
         houses by accessing unsecured finance. Supporting this
         assertion is the fact that there are only 1.7 million
         mortgages in South Africa. More than three-quarters of
         South Africans thus live in housing that is not backed
         by secured housing finance. The vast majority of South
         Africans do not have access to traditional secured
         lending to finance assets such as vehicles older than
         five years and white goods.
 
        The Report contains the reference “carefully concealed
        high interest rates, hidden administrative fees,
        unannounced penalties for non-repayment, garnishee
        orders that could tap into a client’s income in order
        to repay a debt, and grossly exorbitant lawyer fees
        that were incurred for any trivial contract
        infraction”. Our approach to collections focuses on
        contacting clients and, as a last resort, follow legal
        process.

    •   The Board of Directors

        Viceroy alleges that ‘Capitec’s board is largely and
        unsurprisingly made up of several executives from both
        PSG and Steinhoff’.

        The statement above is false as there is no Steinhoff
        executive (or director) that serves on Capitec’s
        board. Piet Mouton is the only PSG executive that
        serves on Capitec’s board. Chris Otto, a non-executive
        director of PSG, has served on Capitec’s board as a
        non-executive director since the company’s inception.
        Markus Jooste served on Capitec’s board from 2011 to
        2012 when he retired from the board by mutual
        agreement due to a possible conflict of interest
        created by Steinhoff’s entry into the financial
        services industry when they bought the JD Group. The
        Capitec board members are listed in the 2017 IAR on
        pages 42-45.

        There is NO business relationship between the members
        of management of Capitec and Steinhoff.

        Related party transactions between Capitec and PSG are
        detailed in the 2017 IAR as note 31 on page 167. These
        transactions are at arm’s length and limited to PSG
        Capital acting as Capitec’s sponsor for the JSE and
        broker for employee share trust transactions. The
        amounts concerned are immaterial.

    •   Breakneck insider sales
        Capitec has grown significantly since inception. This
        has resulted in total assets at 28 February 2017 of
        R73.4 billion (2004: R510 million) and equity of R16.1
        billion (2004: R428 million). The Rand value of
        shareholding of individuals who started the business
        has naturally increased along with the growth in the
        bank.

        As noted in the Report, directors and management sell
        shares from time to time to diversify their investment
        portfolios. Founding directors of Capitec, which
        include Riaan Stassen (non-executive chairman),
        Michiel le Roux (non-executive director and previous
        non-executive chairman), Gerrie Fourie (CEO) and Andre
        du Plessis (CFO), however, all continue to hold
        significant interests in Capitec. Their combined
        shareholding in Capitec today amounts to 13% of
        Capitec’s issued capital.

    •   Jean Pierre Verster

        Jean Pierre Verster is an independent non-executive
        director and chairman of the audit committee. His
        appointment to the board of Capitec in 2015 was
        subject thereto, and as an absolute condition, that he
        would not trade in Capitec securities in his role as
        asset manager or have influence over trading decisions
        on Capitec shares. This was confirmed publicly and
        verified by his previous and current employer.

2.   KICKING THE CAN – RECEIVABLE OR NOT RECEIVABLE

     •   The Report concludes that our bad debt equates to over
         42% of our gross collectible principal per the loan
         book’s maturity schedule.

         The header above states that we write off 42% of the
         principal of loans receivable within the next year.
         The following flaws exist with this conclusion:

         • The Report uses the written-off balance (numerator)
           including fees and interest up to the point of
           write-off, but the capital due in the next year
           (denominator), excludes fees and interest for the
           following year.

         • The write-off balance (numerator) includes all the
           capital due in the following and all future years,
           whereas the denominator excludes all capital due
           beyond twelve months.

         This is demonstrated by way of an example:

         Assuming one loan had 30% of capital due in the
         following year, and the loan was written-off in the
         subsequent year, then the write-off percentage as
         calculated by Viceroy would be 100/30, or 333%.

         This incorrect calculation misleads the reader as to
         the asset quality of the bank.

         A representative calculation using disclosed
         financial information is to take write-offs - which
         includes all capital and income up to the point of
         write-off (numerator R5.447 billion) and divide that
         over total outstanding capital plus loan income for
         the following year (denominator R40.891 billion plus
         R14.362 billion). The answer equates to 9.8%, which
         is conservative, as some write-offs originate from
         sales in the following year. This also proves that
         the previous year’s provision as at 28 February 2016
         of 12.5% was more than adequate.

         The reference to ‘massive write-off’s’ on page 9 of
         the Report is refuted by the 9.8% default rate
         above.

•   Irreconcilable loan book

    The first SENS announcement released on 5 February
    2018 deals with this in detail.

•   Rolling of existing unpaid loans by issuing   new loans
    while collecting zero principal

    This has been dealt with in the first SENS
    announcement released on Monday 5 February 2018. We
    reiterate that we do not grant credit or facilities to
    any client if any Capitec loans or facilities are in
    arrears. We are comfortable that our average book
    growth of 10% per annum in the last three years
    supports our assertion of a healthy book with
    conservative granting appetite. For reference, average
    inflation over the past 3 years was 5.4%.

•   Rescheduled loans

    This has been dealt with in the written response to
    Benguela Global Fund Managers as noted in the SENS
    announcement of 1 February 2018. We reiterate that we
    do not charge initiation fees on rescheduled loans and
    do not include rescheduled loans in our loan sales
    calculations. The full report is available on our
    website at www.capitecbank.co.za/investor-relations.

•   The Report states that Viceroy finds it is literally
    unbelievable that a bank would be able to increase its
    balance sheet by more than half and only incur a 1
    percentage point increase in its non-performing loans
    in that environment, much less an unsecured lender.

    Capitec’s loan book grew from R18.4 billion (February
    2012) to R30.7 billion (February 2013) which is an
    increase of 67%. In Rand terms, impaired advances went
    from R932 million (February 2012) to R1.777 billion
    (February 2013) which is a 91% increase year-on-year.
    Viceroy creates an expectation with readers that the
    arrears rates should increase with the growth in the
    loan book. If arrears balances increase in line with
    book growth percentages, the arrears rates would
    remain static.

    It appears that the reference to the 1 percentage
    point increase was stated in a manner to mislead the
    reader. Viceroy directly states that “Capitec’s low
    arrears cannot be explained any other way: the company
    must be refinancing its own delinquencies” Viceroy
    does not seem to understand the simple explanation
    that Capitec’s arrears are low due to the strict
    write-off policy.

•   61 to 84   month loan products

    On page 13, 4th paragraph the Report says “Incredibly
    and suspiciously, 2013 was the first year Capitec
    introduced its 84 month loans, which instantly became
    its most popular loan product, accounting for a third
    of its loan book. Given the sudden popularity of the
    61-84 month loan product, it would be expected that
    these loans would become a larger part of the Capitec
    loan book over time. This was not the case.” Viceroy
    uses language such as “incredibly” and “suspiciously”
    to describe the logical and prudent actions of a
    responsible credit provider to limit long-term credit
    to only the lowest risk clients. Only 7.3% of
    Capitec’s credit clients currently qualify for loans
    in excess of 60 months (3.6% qualify for 84 month
    loans).

    A further important point to understand is that the
    book growth accelerates significantly, even at stable
    loan sales levels, when extending the product term.
    This trend reverses as the book matures. On launching
    an 84-month product for example, clients repay 1/84th
    of the amount advanced in the first month and the net
    book grows by the differential of 83/84th of loan
    sales. In month 2, repayments increase to 2/84th and
    book growth continues, but at a slightly reduced rate.
    If loan sales remain stable over the next 84 months,
    the value of capital repaid will steadily increase up
    to the point in month 84, when capital repayments
    match sales and book growth will cease. The book
    growth during the 2014 and 2015 financial years,
    despite the decreasing and flat loan sales,
    demonstrates this effect.

    There is nothing sinister or suspicious in the
    performance of the book. The flattening of the book
    growth was in line with our expectations and
    demonstrates that the repayments on the products are
    healthy. As disclosed on pages 29 and 30 of the 2017
    IAR, the product is performing in line with our
    estimates.

3.   CAPITEC’S CREDIT FACILITY ORIGINATION FEE

     •   Capitec credit facility’s origination fee resembles
         loan shark tactics

         Rationale for multi-loan product

         The market norm when we started the bank was a charge
         of 30% per month for 1-month loans. We initially
         reduced the pricing to 21.5% and later to 15%. The
         process to grant credit to clients on a monthly basis
         was time consuming and highly inefficient, costing
         them time and transportation costs to apply in branch
         for each loan. The multi-loan product was developed to
         provide the client with an accessible solution
         (branch, ATM, cellphone) and we passed through the
         benefits of the more efficient process by reducing
         prices.

         Discontinuation of multi-loan and starting of facility

         The multi-loan was not prohibited. Capitec ceased
         offering the multi-loan product because the
         requirements of Affordability Assessment Regulations,
         made under the NCA, which rendered the product
         uneconomical.
         The initiation fee on the credit facility is
         calculated differently to that of the multi-loan.

    In the example on page 17 of the Report, Viceroy
    assumes that the total initiation fee of 155% of the
    facility amount, which would amount to R7,729.20. This
    is incorrect as the actual maximum initiation fee
    could only be R644.10 or 12.9% of the facility amount.
    The initiation fee is not repeated once the cumulative
    drawdowns reach the maximum facility amount. All
    Capitec loan and facility pricing conforms to the NCA.

    It is common for banks to charge clients monthly fees
    for overdrafts, facilities and credit cards
    irrespective of use. The charge of R35 per month is in
    line with other credit providers and well below the
    NCA caps.

    Calculation errors on origination fees made by
    Viceroy:

    • Percentage of origination fees to total revenue

     On page 15 of the Report, Viceroy makes the
     following incorrect statement “While competitors’
     origination fees are immaterial (<1% of earnings),
     Capitec’s origination fees contributed + 21% of
     earnings in 2017”. This statement is misleading for
     the following reasons:

     • The <1% of earnings probably applies to larger
       banks where mortgages make up a large proportion
       of their loan book and income. On these products,
       the origination fees are charged once in 20 years.
       Viceroy has selectively changed the comparison for
       this purpose to that of secured credit providers
       only. Elsewhere they compare us against unsecured
       credit providers

     • They compare pre-tax origination fees with post-
       tax profit, net of operating costs and tax

     • Origination fees comprise 3.8% of Capitec’s total
       revenue

•   Number of credit facilities and facility loan book
    size

    Viceroy’s estimate is incorrect that 87% of the total
    number of loans issued by Capitec are credit
         facilities. Furthermore, this statistic is pointless
         as it is similar to comparing credit card
         swipes/transactions to mortgage advances.

         Furthermore on page 24 of the Report, Viceroy makes
         the misleading statement that “roughly 87% of
         Capitec’s loan book is comprised of the 12-month
         credit facilities”. In our 2017 IAR (page 26), we
         disclose that the credit facility makes up 0.3% of the
         total gross loan book.

     •   Revenue earned from origination fees on multi-loan and
         credit facility

         On page 21 of the Report there is an incorrect
         estimate that our origination fees on the multi-loan
         product for the 2010 financial year amounted to R720
         million. On page 16 of the 2010 IAR, we show that the
         total revenue on all 1-month loan products including
         the multi-loan, was R361 million for that year. In
         2017, the initiation fees on credit facilities were
         R97 million and are included in interest received. The
         estimates regarding the origination fee income of the
         multi-loan product on page 21 of the Report
         demonstrates that Viceroy purposely draws incorrect
         conclusions regarding the nature and revenue of the
         product.

     •   Conclusion on origination fees

         We do not agree with the statement that there is a
         legal risk on these products. Viceroy incorrectly
         quantifies the size of the book and the revenue from
         these products. The statement that our loan
         origination fees are a major boost to our returns has
         been incorrectly calculated and creates a false
         narrative. The Report states that we charge excessive
         and illegal interest rates on our credit facility,
         disguised as initiation fees. This is incorrect.
         Viceroy incorrectly concluded that Capitec’s pricing
         was excessive and illegal based on their incorrect
         understanding of the product in the example above. The
         NCR reviewed the product in detail and concluded their
         satisfaction with the product, including the fees and
         interest charged.

4.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Viceroy accuses Capitec of advancing excessive credit,
     reckless lending and rescheduling existing loans in order
     to disguise delinquencies and, in the process, earning
     fees to which it is not entitled.
     In so doing, Viceroy relies on a press report (figure 11,
     p 10 of the Viceroy report), selective extracts from
     legal proceedings against Capitec (figures 12 and 13, p
     11; figures 14 to 17, pp 11 - 12; figure 25, p 16;
     figures 28 to 30, p 19; figure 32, p 20; figure 33, p 21
     and figure 35, p 22) and social media (figure 23, p 15).
     At least one extract (figure 33, p 21) has no relevance
     whatsoever to the conclusions and inferences drawn by
     Viceroy in its report. In respect of the other three
     court cases referred to (a) the allegations by
     complainants, in the selective extracts relied upon by
     Viceroy, do not support the conclusions and inferences
     drawn therefrom; (b) Viceroy failed to disclose that
     Capitec has filed extensive answering papers in those
     court cases; and (c) Viceroy failed to disclose Capitec’s
     answers in those papers to the allegations (in the
     extracts relied upon by Viceroy). Viceroy also did not
     take into account nor divulge (except in respect of an
     unnamed case, which allegedly will be heard in March
     2018) in its report that none of the three cases from
     which it had quoted have been heard and pronounced upon
     by the court. Moreover, Viceroy did not see it fit to
     ask Capitec for its comments on any of the allegations as
     quoted, and its conclusions and inferences drawn
     therefrom.
     As a result, Viceroy ignored the most basic tenet of any
     objective and impartial research, namely to present
     balanced and even-handed findings. Nonetheless, Viceroy
     saw it fit to opine that one of the court cases against
     Capitec will trigger a class action against Capitec
     resulting in a massive liability.
     Capitec refrains from answering the allegations in the
     extracts relied upon by Viceroy, and the conclusions and
     inferences drawn therefrom by Viceroy. The reason is
     that it will be neither practical nor appropriate for
     Capitec to attempt to summarise and contextualise the
     content of voluminous court papers. Such papers are
     however available on request from Capitec’s legal
     department.

5.   CAPITEC’S IMPOSSIBLY LOW ARREARS

     •   Accusation that the loan book is overstated by R11
         billion
    The first SENS announcement released on 5 February
    2018 deals with this in detail. Furthermore, a
    comprehensive review was done and released on Friday 2
    February 2018 on rescheduling of loans and the
    treatment of provisions. This review was done for
    Benguela Global Fund Managers and is available on our
    website www.capitecbank.co.za/investor-relations

•   Difference in arrears performance between Capitec and
    other credit providers

    • Credit granting

     The allegation that Capitec granted multi loans
     without a credit risk or affordability assessment is
     untrue.

    • Viceroy falsely alleges that Capitec grants credit
      to clients that are in arrears with their Capitec
      loans.

     The statement is false. Capitec does not issue loans
     to clients that are in arrears at Capitec. Staff do
     not have the discretion to override this rule.

    • Viceroy falsely alleges that Capitec disregards the
      instalments of new and existing debt in its
      affordability calculations.

     The statement is false. The Capitec system always
     takes into account instalments of any internal or
     external credit agreements. Instalments for all
     Capitec loans and all credit listed on the credit
     bureau are taken into account in the affordability
     assessment. The consultants also review the bank
     statements to identify new debt (inflows from credit
     providers or instalments) that is not yet on the
     credit bureau. Where clients settle internal or
     external debt with new debt, the system always
     settles the old debt directly to the relevant loan
     account at the relevant credit provider. Capitec is,
     therefore, certain about the settlement of the old
     debt. The system consequently disregards the
     instalments on debt directly settled by the system
     during the loan granting process in the
     affordability calculation, as no additional
     instalments will be due on these loans. The new
     debt is taken into account to ensure the client can
     afford the monthly repayment.
• Granting credit to clients that have existing debt

 During the loan application process, Capitec
 presents the maximum loan amount, maximum term and
 maximum instalment to the client. Within those
 constraints, the client may select any combination
 that suits the client best.

 Capitec encourages clients to take up credit for
 shorter periods of time and smaller amounts, through
 a pricing model that discounts the interest rate in
 instances where clients select a term that is
 shorter than the maximum that they qualify for. This
 is due to the manner in which the pricing for risk
 model reacts to the lower default rates observed for
 such clients.

 There are various circumstances where clients may
 return later to take up additional credit,
 including:

 • Instances where clients use credit to fund
   projects such as home improvements or studies
   (self and/or for their children) and the funds are
   needed over a period of time as the project or
   studies progresses.
 • Clients may become aware of the amount of credit
   that they qualify for and return when they
   identify opportunities to use the funds, such as
   identifying a special offer on white goods or a
   vehicle at a low price.

   Take an example where a client qualifies for a
   maximum term of 63 months, a maximum instalment of
   R3 000 per month, leading to a maximum loan amount
   of R101 000. Should the client decide to buy an
   item for R20 000 and selects to repay the debt
   over 24 months, the instalment would be about
   R1 000 per month.

   Should the above client later come across an
   opportunity to buy a second hand vehicle for
   R75 000, he will only be able to afford a loan of
   R65 000, as the R1 000 instalment reduced the
   amount available for a second loan to R2 000.
   Clients find this difficult to accept, as he
   qualified for more than R100 000, but the
   conservative and sensible choice to repay the
   first item over a short period, now limits the
   client to total credit of only R85 000. The client
       could miss the opportunity to buy the vehicle. The
       client could go to another credit provider, borrow
       R95 000, settle our loan of R20 000 and buy the
       vehicle with the remaining R75 000.

       Capitec offers the client exactly the same
       solution, on condition that he meets our credit
       risk and affordability requirements. We allow the
       client, in this case, to consolidate the R20 000
       existing loan to a new loan over 60 months. The
       total credit over 60 months will therefore be R95
       000 (initial R20 000 plus R75 000 new credit).
       There will be one monthly fee and the initiation
       fee would only be charged on the additional R75
       000. The client’s total instalments amount to
       R2 800 and we are comfortable that the client can
       afford the debt. Refer to the 5 February 2018 SENS
       announcement for more examples.

       Our scoring models do react to instances where
       clients repeatedly take up credit and where a
       client’s debt to income ratio becomes too high. In
       such instances we limit the term and amount of
       credit offered to clients or we decline the
       application for credit.

       There is nothing sinister or reckless in this
       approach and the bold statements in the Viceroy
       report that Capitec operates recklessly, rolls
       debt and hides defaults are completely unfounded.
       When Capitec reports loan sales, we report the net
       amount of debt issued and we exclude the
       consolidation loan from loan sales. Refer to the 5
       February 2018 SENS announcement for examples.

     • Our full credit risk management process, including
       credit granting is discussed in detail on pages 58
       to 63 of our 2017 IAR. We believe that our
       analytics gathered over the last 17 years is of
       high quality. This is further enhanced with the
       information that we obtain from our banking
       clients.

•   Viceroy ignores logic in drawing conclusions regarding
    the impact of pricing on credit performance

    Viceroy shows that another bank (bank one) sometimes
    has lower pricing than Capitec, but that another
    credit provider is substantially more expensive. They
    provide no pricing for a second bank and no credit
    performance for bank one. From the above they conclude
         that Capitec should perform similar to competitors
         (bank one) while our analytics based on credit bureau
         information show that Capitec is less expensive and
         performs better due to it being more conservative. We
         have analysed the pricing presented by Viceroy and it
         appears that this is outdated and there are
         calculation errors in some of the information.

         In our experience, the affordability computation is
         more critical in order to ensure that clients are not
         over indebted. Capitec has always maintained
         conservative buffers in its living expense
         calculations and this is an important reason why
         Capitec has outperformed many competitors from a
         credit risk perspective. Viceroy appears not to have
         attempted to understand how the different credit
         providers perform their affordability computations.
         Consequently we do not believe they are sufficiently
         informed to express an opinion regarding the
         operational processes of the various credit providers.

6.   STATE OF THE MARKET

     •   Current financial stability assessment by the central
         bank

         On page 28 of the Report, Viceroy stated that they
         believe the projected appetite for the market for
         ‘microfinance’ is drastically being overestimated.

         Capitec has continuously reduced its appetite for
         credit in the current economic and political climate.
         This has been communicated formally in integrated
         annual reports, interim results releases and investor
         presentations. Gross loans and advances for the 2017
         financial year grew by 10%, compared to the 13% growth
         in 2016 and 8% in 2015. This is nothing new and is
         publicly available.

         Capitec monitors credit risk performance on a daily,
         weekly and monthly basis. Whenever we identify changes
         and trends, we analyse the cause thereof and take this
         into account by adjusting our credit scoring and
         provisioning models as often as needed. As an example,
         we identified in the beginning of 2016 that small
         employers were starting to pay staff (our clients)
         late, which affected our clients’ repayment
         performance. We adjusted our credit offer to those
         clients accordingly which affected our clients’
         repayment performance. This can be seen in the
         reduction in loan sales in the shorter duration
         products during 2017.

         The fact that Capitec has 8.6 million active clients,
         allows us to analyse the financial health of the
         client and identify and monitor trends. We use this to
         inform and support our credit granting appetite and
         identify risk areas and opportunities.

     •   Deposit Insurance Scheme (DIS)

         The Report states that Capitec has a DIS funding
         obligation of R2.402 billion that will place ‘further
         strain on its cash reserves’. The conclusions arrived
         at by Viceroy are incorrect based on the following
         considerations:

         • Based on the proposed ‘covered deposits’ of up to
           R100 000 per client per bank, a significant
           proportion of Capitec’s deposits will not be covered
           and will not attract a funding obligation.
         • The funding obligation of 5% per the Report is
           incorrect and is still in the process of being
           finalised.
         • The insurance fee is unknown and will differ from
           the funding requirement. The estimate regarding the
           impact on Capitec’s book value is speculative.
         • The R2.402 billion is inaccurate. However, this
           still remains insignificant compared to Capitec’s
           surplus cash reserves of R26.5 billion as disclosed
           in our 2017 IAR on page 22 and will have no impact
           on our loan book growth.
         • Capitec retains a very conservative liquidity
           policy, which resulted in a Basel Liquidity Coverage
           Ratio of 1187% at 30 November 2017, way in excess of
           the 100% prescribed.

         SARB and National Treasury are in a process to submit
         a formal public proposal for a DIS. This process has
         yet to be completed. The SARB paper published in May
         2017 has undergone numerous iterations.

         We have calculated the impact based on preliminary
         discussions with SARB and National Treasury. We
         confirm the results are significantly less than
         alleged by Viceroy.

7.   NUMBER SKIPPED
     The Report jumps from section 6 to 8, neglecting a
     mysterious paragraph 7.

8.   IMPOSSIBLE COST STRUCTURE

     •   Capitec uses a modern Microsoft Windows based system
         with carefully designed workflow that guides and
         supports branch staff through all client interactions.
         Staff are able to focus on client service instead of
         processes that involve filling out, capturing and
         reconciling forms. Branch support is fully
         centralised, which means that branches have no back
         office and all branch staff, including branch
         managers, are client facing. Branch staff have no
         credit granting discretion and all exceptions are
         centrally managed and monitored by a central
         specialist team.

     •   One example in which the centralised system helps to
         manage risk is the manner in which we compare loan
         applicants’ biometrics (finger prints) to the
         Department of Home Affairs database. We do this to
         decrease application fraud.

     •   Capitec does not offer business banking and
         consequently there is no need for specialists to
         analyse balance sheets and income statements and
         assess credit risks for businesses. All of the above
         facts are readily available in our IAR and are well
         known to investors and clients (e.g. 2017 IAR page
         36).

     •   The report states that a Capitec branch manager earns
         R13,219 per month. The actual figure is R22,000 per
         month.

     •   The conclusion that Viceroy reaches on page 33 in the
         8th paragraph regarding staff quality is untrue. The
         numerous service quality awards that Capitec’s staff
         have received such as Ask Africa and Orange, as well
         as the market share that Capitec was able to obtain in
         a fairly short period supports the assertion that
         Capitec’s staff are well-trained, highly motivated and
         very client service oriented. The staff profile is
         young and dynamic and the assessment criteria for
         selection of new staff is strict.

9.   CHANNEL CHECKS
    In the February 2017 financial year, our employee
    turnover was 14.8% versus a financial industry average of
    20.5%.

    We have a specialist team that responds and follows up on
    social media interactions.

(""Capitec"" or ""the company"")

IN RESPONSE TO THE LATEST SET OF ALLEGATIONS THAT VICEROY
RESEARCH GROUP HAS RELEASED ON MONDAY 5 FEBRUARY 2018 IN
ITS ONGOING CAMPAIGN AGAINST CAPITEC

1. We believe that the campaign will continue for the
   foreseeable future. Shareholders can expect the
   release of fresh attacks and false allegations over an
   extended period.
2. Capitec consequently advises shareholders to use
   caution when reacting to such allegations.

We respond as follows with respect to the specific
allegations made in the 5 February 2018 release (“the 5
February report”):

Only 7.3% of Capitec’s credit clients currently qualify
for loans in excess of 60 months (3.6% qualify for 84-
month loans). The scoring models for the 61 to 84 month
loans currently target 12-month default rates of 4.2% in
aggregate (2% for 84-month loans). The portfolios are
naturally weighted to the larger amounts and consequently
the longer-term and lower risk clients.

With reference to the vintage graphs on pages 29 and 30
of Capitec’s 2017 Integrated Annual Report (IAR), a
technical matter described in the second paragraph on
page 29 of the IAR is that the numerator is the sum of
the principal amount advanced plus expected fees and
interest over the full loan term (up to 7 years of
interest and fees). The default rates as percentage of
the principal amount advanced is therefore approximately
100% higher and in line with our scoring models.

The vintage graphs demonstrates that these loans perform
at their targeted default rates.

Viceroy Research Group refers to the loss rates on “US
prime credit cards” in the last paragraph of the 5
February report, before Figure 3, but shows aggregate
credit card losses in Figure 3 and the following
paragraph. Viceroy infers that it is impossible for the
average American credit card holder to have similar
credit risk as the top 7% of Capitec’s clients. We have
extensive history and sophisticated models to support our
results.

The South African Reserve Bank, as part of their normal
oversight function, performs reviews of all areas
including detailed credit risk reviews on Capitec. They
are fully aware of the credit scoring models and the risk
targets that we set when we extend credit. We track
performance against these targets and update our models
as soon as any deviation occurs.

Independent industry experts have reviewed our credit
granting models. The conclusion of these reviews have
confirmed that the models are accurate and highly
predictive. The reviews and the related target default
rates for different risk groups are in line with our
disclosed results.

An important point to understand of an assessment of the
performance of credit providers is that where multiple
credit providers target the same group of clients, the
credit provider that has the best models to identify low
risk clients has a significant competitive advantage.

Suppose that there is a population of 10 000 clients and
that 5 000 of these clients are high risk, 4 000 are
medium risk and 1 000 are low risk. Suppose the default
rates are 20% for the high-risk group, 8% for the medium
risk group and 4% for the low risk group. Should all the
credit providers use the same risk groupings and make the
same product offer to these clients, clients would be
agnostic as to credit provider and the performance of all
providers would be similar. Should one competitor
identify the best 300 clients with a default rate of 2%
out of the low risk pool and offer them better terms, the
default rates of the remaining credit providers will
naturally increase to 4.9% [(1 000 x 4%-300 x 2%) /
(1 000-300)].

Furthermore, we have a sophisticated pricing for risk
model that quantifies the reduction in risk when low risk
clients, that qualify for long-term products, take up
loans with a shorter duration and we offer lower rates in
order to ensure that we provide competitive products to
these clients.

Consequently, our unique product structure, combined with
a highly evolved credit granting model and a
sophisticated pricing model has created a competitive
advantage that enables us to identify low risk clients
and offer them credit at rates for as low as 12.9% on an
unsecured basis over 24 months. This has enabled Capitec
to increase market share among lower risk and higher
income clients over time.

Capitec’s technology allows all Capitec clients with the
Capitec Banking App on their smartphones to view their
credit risk profile on the App and receive an indication
of the possible term and amount of credit that they could
possibly qualify for.

Regarding the arrears rates on 61-84 month loans, it
should be kept in mind that, as explained in detail in
our response to Benguela Global Fund Managers’ report
dated 1 February 2018, the provision model segments
clients based on risk characteristics. The provision of
7.6% against up to date clients is the portfolio
aggregate and the provision against up to date 61 to 84-
month loan clients is 5% due to the better risk profile
of these clients. The estimate of Viceroy Research Group
that 1.3% of 84 month clients are in arrears is therefore
too low, as the actual arrears percentage at 28 February
2017 on these products was 3.1%. Capitec’s strict write-
off policy should be taken into account. The percentage
of the 61 to 84 month clients that have rescheduled from
arrears is 6.3%, of which 40% rehabilitated by 28
February 2017.

Conclusion:
The arrears figures reported by Capitec on these loans
are accurate and in line with our risk appetite and
portfolio tracking results. The provisions raised against
these loans are conservative.

VICEROY RESEARCH GROUP REPORT ON CAPITEC – DETAILED
RESPONSE TO THE MAIN ISSUES RAISED IN THE REPORT

We refer to previous announcements on SENS advising
shareholders of concerns about the integrity of the
report by Viceroy Research Group on Capitec (“the Viceroy
report”). We will continue to respond in more detail and
as a whole to all the allegations made as we work through
the report.

In this announcement we address the following incorrect
conclusions of the Viceroy report that are both
fundamentally flawed and misleading:
1. Irreconcilability of our loan book value – we confirm
   that our loan book reconciles and DENY any
   misrepresentation of the loan book;
2. Loan book overstatement of R11 billion due to
   suggested impairment/write-off amounts - we confirm
   that there is NO overstatement and that NO adjustment
   is required;
3. Rolling existing unpaid loans by issuing new loans and
   initiation fees charged on rescheduled loans – we DENY
   the accusation that we roll unpaid loans and confirm
   that we do NOT charge initiation fees when
   rescheduling loans.

1. Accusation that our loan book is irreconcilable

The reconciliation of our loan book is incorrectly stated
in the Viceroy report. We breakdown the actual movement
of our loan book as follows:

R’m                             2017       2016      2015
Opening gross loans             40,891     36,341    33,690

Write-offs(v)                   (5,447)    (3,981)   (4,395)
Recoveries(vi)                  1,125      854       602

  (i) New credit granted; only the amount of the separate
  new credit and excludes all rescheduled loans

  (ii) For early internal settlements, where a subsequent
  loan is taken, the last repayment does not lead to an
  outflow

  (iii) Third party loan insurance through Guardrisk is
  an option to our clients since 6 May 2016. We reflect
  the income net of cost. The cost represents the third
  party reinsurance costs

  (iv) Debit orders, and cash repayments and early
  settlements (normally occurs when another credit
  provider takes over the loan)

  (v) Earliest of when the client’s account is handed
  over to external debt collectors or a loan is past 90
  days in arrears (CD3+)

  (vi) The cash received on doubtful debts previously
  written off

Conclusion: Our loans and advances reconcile and are NOT
misrepresented by including rescheduled loans through the
issuance of new loans as alleged in the Viceroy report.
Rescheduling is further discussed under section 3 below,
but we confirm rescheduling is NOT included in the loan
sales figures above. We furthermore confirm, that we DO
NOT advance loans to clients who are in arrears with
their Capitec instalments.

2. Accusation that we overstate our loan book with R11
   billion due to suggested impairment/ write-off amounts

2.1 The Viceroy report presents information that is not
clearly comparable and fails to present information that
is easily available in the public domain. We believe this
intentionally creates the false impression that Capitec’s
arrears rate is understated compared to two other credit
providers mentioned in the Viceroy report.

Capitec’s arrears analyses, compared to the other credit
providers, are different in terms of our granting,
pricing, write-off and provisioning policies. The other
credit providers’ arrear loan balances include
contractual delinquency (“CD”)3+/4 and higher. We,
however, write-off a loan at the earliest of when the
loan is past 90 days in arrears (CD3+) or the client’s
account(s) are handed over to external debt collectors.
The omission of these facts, along with statements in the
Vicery report alluding to Capitec having ‘impossibly low
arrears’ and ‘massive write-offs’ furthers its cause of
creating doubt and uncertainty about Capitec, instead of
creating an understanding of our conservative provision
model.

2.2 It is our understanding that the Viceroy report
concludes that Capitec’s provision and write-off balance,
as a percentage of our gross loans and advances, is
significantly less than the percentages disclosed by the
other credit providers. The Vicery report suggests that
our provision and write-off balances should therefore
essentially be doubled i.e. a further R5.9 billion
doubtful debt provision and R5.4 billion write-off amount
is required.

If we apply our write-off policy to the arrears loan
balances of one of the other credit providers by
excluding CD4 and higher arrear balances as disclosed in
the Viceroy report, their arrears would decrease by 67%.

Alternatively, to compare our gross loan book to that of
the other credit providers on a like for like basis, CD4
and higher needs to be excluded from the loan and
impairment balances.

Below we illustrate the effect of the above using the
write off and doubtful debt provision methodology as
disclosed by Capitec for the year ended 28 February 2017,
as well as applying the methodology of the other credit
providers to our disclosed financial information.

Total impairment as
% of total gross loans           13.1%         22.5%

(vii) In the case of Capitec, we write-off CD3+ but the
other credit providers include CD4 to CD9 (a further 6
months) in their figures. We therefore added the Capitec
6 monthly write off amount to reflect as CD4 and higher,
added it to gross loans and added it to impairments.

The analysis above illustrates why our percentage of
13.1% is so much lower than the adjusted 22.5% to compare
Capitec to other credit providers. The adjustment results
in an increase of 72% of the total impairment percentage
of total gross loans.

Conclusion: The Viceroy report analysis does not take the
different approaches and the conservatism of Capitec’s
write off policy of CD3+ into consideration. NO
adjustment to the net loan book is therefore required.

3. Accusation that we roll existing unpaid loans by
   issuing new loans and that we charge initiation fees on
   rescheduled loans

Capitec does not roll unpaid/arrears loans into longer
term new loans to disguise poor asset quality. The
process of originating new debt and consolidations is
different to rescheduling existing loans.

Below, by way of examples, we unpack the instalments,
interest, fees and loan sales as recognised and disclosed
in our audited annual financial statements on a new
(3.1), consolidated(3.2) and rescheduled loan (3.3). For
ease of reference, all the examples refer to a R100 000
loan over a term of 60 months at an interest rate of 14%
(net annual compounded monthly(nacm)).

3.1. New loan

The origination of new debt follows the credit granting
process which incorporates the comprehensive assessment
of the clients’ behaviour, affordability and source of
income, using amongst other sources, credit bureau, bank
statements, and payslip information. This is explained in
further detail in our 2017 integrated annual report on
page 59 to 63.

New loan example:
Loan amount                                    100,000
Once-off initiation fee (including VAT)       1,197
Principal                                     101,197
Payment                                       2,355
Monthly service fee                           68
Monthly instalment                            2,423

3.2. More than one loan or consolidation

When existing clients apply for further credit, a full
credit assessment is conducted. If a client qualifies for
further debt, credit can be extended as a further credit
agreement in addition to the current debt or the client
can have her/his existing debt consolidated into a new
credit agreement. This option is only available for
clients if instalments are UP TO DATE (not in arrears on
any of their Capitec debt) and clients that have a
satisfactory credit risk rating (including external
spending, other loans and repayment behaviour).

Important to note:

•   Initiation fees are only charged on new loans or the
    amount of the separate new credit. All initiation fees
    comply with the National Credit Act (NCA)
•   No loan or facility will be granted to any client if
    any Capitec loans/facilities are in arrears
•   Only the amount of the separate new credit is included
    in loan sales

Consolidated loan example (Existing Capitec loan client
as above):
After 30 months, the client wants to consolidate her/his
loan. The client has a new need, purpose or goal (e.g.
home renovation). Since the original loan has been taken,
the client has had a promotion or increased inflationary
salary as an example. The client’s outstanding balance at
the end of 30 months is R59,314 on the current Capitec
loan and wants an additional R50,000 (at 14% interest
over 30 months). The client has the option whereby
(3.2.1) the additional loan remains a separate loan or
(3.2.2) the loan is consolidated with the current
outstanding loan balance.

3.2.1. Additional loan remains separate
Monthly instalment on existing loan           2,423
Additional loan amount                        50,000
Initiation fee (including VAT)
on additional R50 000 (as per NCA table)      1,197
New loan principal                            51,197
Payment                                       2,033
Monthly service fee on additional loan        68
Monthly instalment on additional loan         2,101

Total monthly instalment                      4,524

3.2.2. Consolidation loan
Consolidated loan amount (59,314 + 50,000)    109,314
Initiation fee (including VAT)
on additional R50,000                         1,197
Total loan principal                          110,511
Monthly service fee on consolidated loan      68
Monthly instalment on consolidated loan       4,456(viii)

(viii) The benefits of a consolidated loan are:
• the client saves on the extra R68.40 monthly service
   fee charged on the additional loan (R4,524 – R4,456)
• restricting bank charges to one debit order only
• convenience to the client of only having to manage one
   loan

Conclusion: On consolidation of an existing loan, loan
advances/ sales only includes the amount of the separate
new credit i.e. the additional loan amount as referred to
in the example of R50,000, with the related initiation
fee.

3.3. Rescheduling

Rescheduling is aimed at assisting clients whose
circumstances have changed since taking up credit and to
manage part of the collection process. Rescheduling is a
process applied by most mature credit providers.

Where clients have existing debt and are experiencing
difficulties in repaying instalments or anticipate that
they will experience difficulties, the bank will consider
the merits to reschedule the debt based on prescribed
criteria. The client is evaluated on specific rules to
evaluate whether the client qualifies for the loan to be
rescheduled.

Rescheduling supports the rehabilitation of clients by
improving the collection potential on such financially
stressed, or potentially financially stressed clients.

Important to note:

•   NO origination fees are charged on rescheduled loans
    as NO new credit is advanced
•   Rescheduling is a formal amendment to an existing loan
    contract and rescheduled loans are therefore NOT
    included in loan sales as NO new credit is granted
•   Provisions in place at the time of rescheduling, are
    NOT released. As the client repays the rescheduled
    loan instalment (actual cash repayment or successful
    debit order payment), 1/12th of the provision in place
    compared to an up to date, rehabilitated rescheduled
    client, is released per month until the client is
    fully rehabilitated. This is based on statistical
    evidence and conservatism. If the remaining term of a
    rescheduled loan is less than 12 months the period of
    release is decreased over the remaining term.
•   Should the client fall one day in arrears on the
    rescheduled loan, the client will be immediately
    included in CD1 (contractual delinquency 1 month), but
    on an increased provision percentage that reflects the
    escalated risks.
•   A comprehensive review was done and released on Friday
    2 February 2018 on rescheduling of loans and the
    treatment of provisions. This review was done for
    Benguela Global Fund Managers and is available on our
    website www.capitecbank.co.za/investor-relations

Rescheduled loan client example
After month 30, a client misses the 31st instalment and
is in arrears. The client reschedules the loan by
extending the remaining term with 6 months to 36 months.
NO initiation fee is charged when the loan is
rescheduled.

Outstanding balance on existing loan          59,314
Initiation fee on reschedule                  0
Payment (over 36 months)(ix)                  2,027
Monthly service fee on existing loan (x)      68
Monthly instalment on rescheduled loan        2,095

(ix) The payment decreased from R2,355 (see 3.1 above) to
R2,027 by stretching the remaining period from 30 to 36
months
(x) This fee is payable for up-to-date or rescheduled
loans – therefore NO additional fee is payable

Conclusion: The statement that Capitec charges initiation
fees on rescheduled loans is false. Rescheduling is an
amendment to an existing contract and rescheduled loans
are therefore NOT included as new credit granted or loan
sales.

S&P GLOBAL RATINGS (“S&P”) BULLETIN: CAPITEC BANK RATINGS NOT
AFFECTED BY MARKET REPORT

S&P Global Ratings released the following bulletin late
yesterday afternoon:

“S&P Global Ratings said today that its ratings on South
Africa-based Capitec Bank Ltd (BB/Stable/B) are not affected
by an investment report published by Viceroy Research on Jan.
30, 2018, or by the market’s reaction to the report.

In the report, Viceroy Research requests that the South
African Reserve Bank place Capitec under immediate curatorship
and alleges that the value of Capitec's loan book is
""massively overstated."" The market's reaction was significant,
with the bank's share price losing over 20% before recovering
after the South African Reserve Bank released a statement
defending the soundness of the bank's capitalization and
liquidity. To date, the bank has experienced only mild funding
outflows and its liquidity remains sound.

Our ratings on the bank continue to reflect those on South
Africa (foreign currency BB/Stable/B), as well as the bank’s
strong capitalization and conservative reserving, which is
appropriate for high normalized credit losses. We also factor
in the bank’s good earnings stability for a monoline unsecured
consumer lender”.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 7.35% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2018, only 40% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 26 May 2017(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement on 8 December 2017,
shareholders are herewith advised that the Company has
repurchased a further 114 849 preference shares,
representing 7.35% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. This brings the total
percentage of preference shares repurchased under the
current general authority, to 18.37%. The issued
preference share capital following these repurchases
amount to 1 275 186.

The repurchases were made out of the Company’s available
cash resources. The total percentage of preference shares
repurchased to date in the 2018 financial year amounts to
23.77% of the issued preference share capital as at 28
February 2017. The preference shares were repurchased for
an aggregate value of R10 226 804.79.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 25 479
preference shares (1.63% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
    (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
    business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
    months after the date of this announcement;
-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

VICEROY RESEARCH REPORT ON CAPITEC – ADDRESSING THE MAIN
ISSUES RAISED IN THE REPORT

We refer to the earlier announcement on SENS today
advising shareholders of concerns about the integrity of
a report by Viceroy Research on Capitec and advising
shareholders that management will review the report in
detail and will respond to same before the end of today.

We are studying the report systematically and are still
seeking clarity on some of the allegations. It is
important to note that the report is flawed with
inaccurate statements.

We respond as follows to the main allegations raised in
the report:

1. Allegation that Capitec fabricates new loans and
   collections, or refinances up to R3b in principal per
   year by issuing new loans to defaulting clients

  With reference to the reconciliation of the loan book,
  we can confirm that the estimate in the Viceroy report
  does not accurately calculate client repayments. They
  use a figure net of fees on loan accounts based on
  assumptions regarding the amortisation and capital
  repayment profile of the loan book. Their estimate of
  capital repayments of R16.7 billion underestimates
  actual loan receipts net of fees of R18.6 billion
  (receipts less fees) by approximately R1.9 billion.
  They also reduce write-offs by an estimate of the
  component of write-offs that originate from new sales
  in subsequent years. There is a logic flaw that loan
  sales should be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, the
  default rates that they calculate does not consider
  the fact that written off balances include fees and
  should be compared against the sum of actual receipts
  plus write-offs.

2. Allegation of loans granted to delinquent customers to
  repay existing loans
  What the Viceroy report is referring to is the court
  cases of 3 particular clients. They make no mention of
  Capitec’s comprehensive responses in each of these
  cases which addresses each of the allegations
  contained in Viceroy’s report. Our comprehensive
  responses are public documents and are available at
  court or from our legal department. Whenever we grant
  a loan, we do a comprehensive credit assessment based
  on the BAS principles (behaviour, affordability and
  source).

3. Allegation of over-statement of Capitec’s loan book
  Our impairment on loans are based on the probability
  of default. Loans are written off at the earliest of
  when they are in arrears for 90 days or more, or legal
  hand-over occurs. As at 31 August 2017, our doubtful
  debt provision covers loan balances in arrears by 237%
  and 152% when including arrears loan balances
  rescheduled within the last 6 months. Any competitor
  analyses requires a further breakdown of their loan
  granting, pricing, write-off and provisioning policies
  to compare our approach and position on a like for
  like basis.

4. Assumption that court cases may result in a class
   action

  The proposition of a class action is speculation of
  the highest nature and premature. The matter must
  still be heard and Capitec believes it has solid
  defences to the allegations.

  Capitec’s explanations in its answering papers in the
  court cases are not taken into account. The monthly
  loans were granted under an over-arching multi-loan
  agreement, concluded at the outset.

  Before concluding this agreement, Capitec concluded
  its standard comprehensive credit assessment. This
  consisted of documentary and other information
  provided by the customer (including bank statements,
  payslips and answers to questions posed by Capitec),
  as well as information sourced externally from credit
  bureaux.

  Before each withdrawal under the over-arching multi-
  loan agreement, Capitec performed supplementary credit
  assessments. Capitec supplemented and updated the
  results of the underlying initial assessments, and its
  purpose was to check whether the customer still
  qualified for the proposed credit.

  The process consisted of the following:

  •   Customers asked to confirm that, ‘since you signed
      your last multi-loan agreement, your income is the
      same or more’ and ‘since you signed your last
      multi-loan agreement, your expenses are the same or
      less.’
  •   Capitec making a credit bureau enquiry to enquire
      whether the customer had any disqualifying legal
      statutes (insolvency, administration, etc)
  •   Capitec making a credit bureau enquiry to determine
      the sum total of the customer’s current external
      obligations, i.e. whether in the period since the
      conclusion of the over-arching multi-loan
      agreement, he has taken up fresh debt from entities
      other than Capitec or settled existing debts with
      such entities (as far as credit from Capitec itself
      was concerned, this was checked and taken into
      account directly)

5. Incorrect correlation between our credit facility and
   discontinued multi-loan facility

  The credit facility operates the same way as a credit
  card except that the Capitec credit facility
  terminates after 9 months. If the client applies for a
  new Capitec credit facility we do a new comprehensive
  credit assessment to see if the client qualifies for a
  new Capitec credit facility.

  The initiation fee is only triggered once the client
  uses the facility up to a maximum fee agreed with the
  client, that is within the NCA.

  Monthly fee – this fee is raised as allowed in the
  applicable regulations of the NCA. There is a
  difference between availability and use of the
  facility and interest is charged as contracted with
  the client and the full amount used, including
  interest and fees, is repayable on a monthly basis.

6. Capitec Bank’s operations are significantly different
   to that of African Bank

  Capitec Bank is fully fledged retail bank and has
  different sources of income, not only credit. It’s
  transactional business continues to contribute
  materially to its earnings as reported in our 1H 2018
  results.

  Capitec Bank has a significant retail deposit book,
  unlike African Bank. The result of this is that
  Capitec has a low reliance on wholesale funding.

  Capitec Bank has a far more conservative approach to
  providing credit than African Bank. The provisioning
  of Capitec Bank is market-leading and significantly
  more conservative to that specifically of African
  Bank, as well as other unsecured loan books.

7. Opinions of former employees

  Employees who are no longer employed by an
  organisation can make claims that are false. It is
  patently untrue that Capitec has fired any employees
  ‘for not deceiving borrowers’. Amongst the many
  inaccuracies in the report another exists where it is
  claimed that our branch managers earn an average of
  R13 219 where the actual average is R22 000 per month.
  We are proud of the journey that we have placed our
  employees on with the result that many employees are
  promoted within the organisation.

We are concerned about the way in which Viceroy Research
conduct their business and our attorneys have registered
a formal complaint with the Financial Services Board.

MARKET SPECULATION FOLLOWING VICEROY RESEARCH REPORT ON
CAPITEC

Capitec received a copy of the Viceroy research report on
Capitec at 10 am this morning. Shareholders are advised
that Capitec has not been approached by Viceroy for
insight into our business and none of their allegations
have been discussed, tested or verified with management.
We believe our corporate governance is strong and our
communications and disclosures are, and always have been
transparent, clear and to the point. On the face of it,
the report is filled with factual errors, material
omissions in respect of legal proceedings against Capitec
and   opinions  that   are  not   supported  by  accurate
information. We are reviewing the report in detail and
will respond to it in detail later today.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 3.08% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. The Company has obtained the approval of the
Registrar of Banks in terms of Regulation 38(18) of the
Regulations promulgated under the Banks Act (Act 94 of
1990) to continue with the repurchase of preference
shares under the current general authority referred to in
the paragraph below.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 26 May 2017(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement on 2 October 2017,
Shareholders are herewith advised that the Company has
repurchased a further 48 092 preference shares,
representing 3.08% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. This brings the total
percentage of preference shares repurchased under the
current general authority, to 11.08%.   The  issued
preference share capital following these repurchases
amount to 1 389 035.

The repurchases were made out of the Company’s available
cash resources. The total percentage of preference shares
repurchased to date in the 2018 financial year amounts to
17.76% of the issued preference share capital as at 28
February 2017. The preference shares were repurchased for
an aggregate value of R4 373 240.00.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 139 328
preference shares (8.92% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
    (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
    business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
    months after the date of this announcement;
-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 4.89% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2017, only 50% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 26 May 2017(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement on 28 September 2017,
Shareholders are herewith advised that the Company has
repurchased   a  further   76   358   preference  shares,
representing 4.89% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. The issued preference
share capital following these repurchases amount to 1 437
127.
    The repurchases were made out of the Company’s available
    cash resources. The total percentage of preference shares
    repurchased to date in the 2018 financial year amounts to
    14.09% of the issued preference share capital as at 28
    February 2017. The preference shares were repurchased for
    an aggregate value of R7 150 561.00.

    The repurchases were made in terms of the general
    authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
    effected through the order book operated by the JSE
    trading system without any prior understanding or
    arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

    Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
    preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

    Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 187 420
    preference shares (12.00% of the preference shares in
    issue as at the date of the current general authority),
    in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
    until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
    the requirements of the Banks Act.

    The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
    the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
    The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
    resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
    share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
    preference shares and interest earned on the cash
    utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

    OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

    The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
    repurchases and is of the opinion that:

    -   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
        (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
        business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
        months after the date of this announcement;
    -   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
        will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
        the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
        after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 3.11% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2017, only 50% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 26 May 2017(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Shareholders are herewith advised that the Company has
repurchased 48 649 preference shares, representing 3.11%
of the issued preference share capital as at the date of
the   current   general  authority   to   repurchase the
preference shares. The issued preference share capital
following this repurchases amount to 1 513 485.

The repurchases were made out of the Company’s available
cash resources. The total percentage of preference shares
    repurchased to date in the 2018 financial year amounts to
    9.53% of the issued preference share capital as at 28
    February 2017. The preference shares were repurchased for
    an aggregate value of R4 529 742.45.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 263 778
preference shares (16.89% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

    OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
    (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
    business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
    months after the date of this announcement;
-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

Unsecured lending competitive with the secured credit market

We now offer unsecured credit at an interest rate from as low as 12.9%. There are no legal or administration costs to
register an asset and the loan is instantly available with no waiting period. 

We make banking simple to suit the needs of our clients. Our understanding of the circumstances of our clients in an
economy under severe pressure, enables us to challenge what we do and make adjustments to address demands in the market.
The personalised solutions produce real value for our clients. The Global One solution remains the most affordable bank
account in the market when considering transaction fees, and interest of at least 5.1% is earned on any positive balance
in any account. The monthly fee on our credit card was reduced to R35 per month.

South Africans appreciate that we help them manage their financial lives better, so they can live better. By the end of
August 2017, we had 9.2 million active clients and increased our number of branches to 811. This represents client
growth of 106 000 per month over the last 12 months. 

We made further progress on our out-of-branch transacting strategy with self-service banking transactions (cellphone
banking app, internet banking, self-service terminals and dual note recyclers) increasing by 43%. This improves
accessibility for clients. Allowing clients to bank from anywhere, anytime and in any way, ensures clients are always in
full control. 

We were placed first in the overall mobile banking category by the SITEisfaction® 2017 survey. The simplicity and great
user experience of our internet and mobile banking resulted in Capitec being voted South Africa's best digital bank of
2017.

Being recognised as the fastest growing overall brand in South Africa and voted the best bank in the world for the
second time in a row according to Lafferty Group's annual Bank Quality Ratings survey, serves as a reminder to
constantly improve and set standards higher than any accolades received. We retain our focus of exceptional personal
service and delivery of simple, transparent solutions. 

17% growth in earnings

Our headline earnings increased by 17% to R2.05 billion for the current 6 month period from R1.75 billion in the prior
year corresponding 6 month period. Return on shareholders' equity for the current period is 26%.

Net lending and investment income increased with 10% despite introducing our improved credit solution and applying a
stricter granting strategy. Arrears and rescheduled loans decreased with 14% while the net loan impairment expense
increased with 8%. 

Net transaction fee income increased by 29% and operating expenses increased 20% from the prior year period in support
of our growth initiatives.

Our improved credit solution 

Continuous improvement of our credit offer is key to our vision. In the process of offering personalised credit and
improving our processes and systems, better interest rate options are available to our clients. The best possible
amount, term and interest rate offered to clients are based on the clients' past bank and credit behaviour,
affordability and stability of their source of income. We have strengthened our credit solution to allow clients to
choose either the amount that suits their needs, monthly instalment that suits their cash flow or an option that gives
them the best interest rate.

We continue to improve our understanding of our clients' behaviour and risk profiles that allow us to price loans
accordingly and achieve a healthier, more sustainable loan book. 

We have reduced our monthly fee on our credit card which will apply to all existing and new clients. There is no charge
on any foreign exchange conversion cost when travelling overseas. The credit card is fully integrated into the Global
One solution, earning interest of at least 5.1% on a positive balance.

We welcome the final Credit Life Insurance Regulations that came into effect on 9 August 2017. Although there are still
some matters that need to be addressed, the regulations eliminate some ambiguity and prevent credit providers from
taking unacceptable high risks that can hurt clients financially. Our credit agreements concluded on or after 9 August
2017 meet all the necessary requirements and fee limits of insuring our clients' loans for death, permanent and
temporary disability, unemployment or when our clients are unable to earn an income.

All fees are priced with our clients' best interest in mind. For all credit life cover, we price according to the
client's risk and loan balance that remains outstanding. The fee therefore adjusts downward over the term of the loan as
the capital on the loan is repaid. This ensures our clients only pay to cover the value of the loan balance that remains
at risk. As the fees previously charged were below the regulatory limits implemented on 9 August 2017, our clients and
our profitability were not adversely impacted by these regulatory changes.

Unfortunately, the regulations also allow credit providers the option to retain the premium cost at the loan inception
value even though the balance outstanding decreases over the period of the loan. We are working with the Regulator to
resolve these differences.

The health of our loan book 

With our stricter granting strategy, we have extended loans to better quality clients, aligned to support their needs.
Gross loans and advances with a product term between 61 and 84 months increased by R1.2 billion and the credit card book
increased by R1.3 billion in the current period.

Loans and advances in the up-to-date not rescheduled status, as a percentage of gross loans and advances increased from
78.7% to 82.1%. Arrears as a percentage of gross loans and advances decreased from 6.0% to 5.4%. The increase in
up-to-date status and decrease in arrears is a direct result of our improved granting strategy, and the increased number
of clients in debt review. 

The current 6 month period experienced a 58% increase of loan balances in debt review. As per our bad and doubtful debt
methodology, a client in debt review is fully written-off, regardless of loan status and does not proceed into arrears
as a client that misses an instalment would. More clients are applying for debt review due to cash flow pressures and
major marketing drives by debt management firms that currently promote debt review as a solution to the difficulty being
experienced.  In many cases the consequences of going into debt review are not in the best interest of clients.

Loans rescheduled from an up-to-date status within the last 6 months as a percentage of gross loans and advances
decreased from 3.6% to 2.3% and arrears rescheduled within the last 6 months as a percentage of gross loans and advances
decreased from 3.8% to 3.0% in the current period. This is a result of our rescheduling policy changes and implementing
stricter rules of preventing lower risk clients from rescheduling from an up-to-date loan status, and clients in arrears
from rescheduling for a second or a third time if their risk is deemed to be too high.

Loan revenue, in-line with loan book growth, increased with 10% for the current period. The implementation of
improvements to our credit solution allowed us to provide more competitive interest rates, making our offer more
attractive to quality consumers and which we expect should in turn, achieve a lower bad debt rate.

The table below presents the increase in the gross loan impairment expense for the current 6 month period:

                                                 Six months ended                       Change %

A significant portion of the 42% increase in bad debt write-offs was as a result of the increased number of clients
under debt review and the change in rescheduling policy provided for in the previous financial year which materialised
in the current period.

The total movement of the provision for doubtful debts in the current year remained flat as a result of the tightening
our of credit granting criteria, advancing better quality loans with lower risk and resultant lower arrears and
rescheduled loan balances.

Strong transactional growth of 29% remains

Our quality banking client (a client becomes a quality banking client if they have stable inflows into their account and
stable product usage over a consecutive 3 month period) growth was 21%. The increase in self-service banking transaction
volume of 231 million this period compared to 162 million of the prior year period has contributed to 95% of our clients
now waiting less than 15 minutes in a branch to be served. 

Our net transaction fee income covered 76% of our operating expenses (August 2016: 70%) and contributed 40% of our net
income (August 2016: 37%) achieving further income diversification.

Cost-to-income ratio of 36%

Operating costs increased by 20% from R2.6 billion to R3.2 billion in the current period. The main reason for the
increase in costs relate to the increase in employees, increased salary incentives (due to a 55% increase in our share
price), information technology and marketing expenditure to ensure our growth aspirations are appropriately supported. 

15 new branches were opened during the current period compared to 31 during the prior year period, driven by the focus
on self-service banking. This resulted in a decrease in capital expenditure of 34%.

Average deposit growth of R1 billion per month

Our continued brand acceptance growth resulted in a 28.7% increase in retail deposits to R55.4 billion by the end of
August 2017 (August 2016: R43.0 billion).

We continued to manage our wholesale funding downwards to R7.0 billion during this period (August 2016: R8.4 billion).
This was due to the increase in fixed retail deposits and profit contribution to fund the growth in loans and advances.
We however will always retain wholesale funding exposure and strong support from the market was confirmed during our May
2017 bond issuance of R500 million that was 4.2 times oversubscribed.

Strong capital and low liquidity risk

We retained a capital adequacy ratio of 34.6% at the end of August 2017. We have sufficient capital to meet our growth
requirements. During the current period, we continued to repurchase preference shares that are subject to the applicable
phase-out rules in terms of Basel 3.

Our approach to liquidity risk remains conservative and to reduce the risk, call deposits are only utilised for the loan
book to a limited extent. We comply with the Basel 3 liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR).
Our LCR is 1 187% (August 2016: 991%) and our NSFR is 199% (August 2016: 152%). Our internal liquidity requirements have
always been stricter than the Basel ratios.

Resilient credit rating

S&P Global affirmed Capitec Bank Limited's global long-term credit ratings of BB+ on 5 September 2017. The global
ratings carry a negative outlook linked to the sovereign's negative outlook. We were not downgraded along with the
sovereign and other South African banks earlier this year. This means that we are now rated the same as the sovereign
and the other South African banks. S&P Global recalibrated their national scale ratings after the sovereign was
downgraded, resulting in our national scale long-term ratings increasing with three notches from the beginning of the
year to zaAA.

Prospects

We believe that our DNA of client centric values, energy and ownership in everything we do, achieves personal service
that ensures long-lasting relationships with our clients. We believe that this approach gives us a competitive edge. 

The real value we generate for our clients through personal service and delivery of affordable, accessible financial
solutions drives the growth of our company.

Investing in our people and infrastructure supports this growth and allows us the opportunity to create jobs, stimulate
the economy and ultimately transform the country in which we live.

Changes in board composition 

On 6 April 2017, the Board appointed Ms Lindi Dlamini and Mr Kabelo Makwane as independent non-executive directors.
Lindi's experience includes legal and risk management, client services in the retail market and human resources
management. Kabelo is an experienced businessman involved in information technology and sales. We welcome them both to
the board.

Interim dividend

The directors declared a gross interim dividend for the 6 months ended 31 August 2017 of 525 cents per ordinary share on

Reclassification:

As part of the review of the group's basis of preparation policy to consistently comply with IFRS and interpretation
issued by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), in February 2017 we have reclassified loan origination fees to be
included in interest income and not form part of loan fee income as previously presented.

The portion of loan origination fees that relate to the creation of a financial asset is amortised over the term of the
loan on an effective interest rate basis, with the unamortised portion of the fees recorded as  deferred loan fee income
contained within net loans and advances to clients.

The impact of this reclassification for August 2016 is presented as follows:

As part of the JSE proactive monitoring of financial statements, issuers were advised that classification of an item
within the statement of cash flows, i.e. whether it relates to operating, financing, or investing activities, is equally
important to users as the final net cash position. For this purpose, during 2017 we have split the funding of our
deposits and wholesale funding to reclassify the movement of bonds (subordinated debt and listed bonds) under financing

Segment analysis 

Capitec reports a single segment - retail banking. The business is widely distributed with no reliance on any major
customers. The business sells a single retail banking product 'Global One' that enables clients to transact, save and
borrow. 

Fair values

In terms of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', the fair value of loans and advances was R43.8 billion (August 2016: R43.3
billion), deposits and bonds were R62.9 billion (August 2016: R51.6 billion), derivative assets was valued at R63.5
million (August 2016: R142.6 million), available-for-sale investment was R102 million (August 2016: nil) and derivative
liabilities was R73.5 million (August 2016: R17 million). The fair value of loans and advances and available-for-sale
investment was calculated on a level 3 basis and deposits and bonds and derivative assets and liabilities were
calculated on a level 2 basis. The fair value of all other financial instruments equates to their carrying amount.

Unaudited interim financial statements

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard (IAS) 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the
requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, as amended. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of
these interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with
those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements except for standards, interpretations and
amendments to published standards, applied for the first time during the current financial period, which did not have
any impact on the financial statements. The Group complies in all material respects with the requirements of King III.
Basel disclosures in terms of Regulation 43 of the Banks' Act are available on the Capitec Bank website.

No event, that is material to the financial affairs of the Group, has occurred between the reporting date and the date
of approval of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements was supervised by the chief financial
officer, André du Plessis CA(SA).

This transaction enabled Wimsey to protect the downside risk of the share

make the protection ""zero cost"", Wimsey was willing to forfeit the growth
above 145.6% of the current value of the shares. It is Wimsey's intention
to cash settle the transaction at maturity as opposed to selling any
shares.

Due to the volatility in the market and Mr le Roux's age, this transaction
enabled Limietberg Sekuriteit (Pty) Ltd (“Limietberg”) to protect the
downside risk of the share price at 80% of the current value on 1 250 000
Capitec shares. In order to make the protection ""zero cost"", Limietberg
was willing to forfeit the growth above 156.5% of the current value of the
shares. It is Limietberg's intention to cash settle the transaction at
maturity as opposed to selling any shares.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 3.46% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2017, only 50% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 27 May 2016(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement published on the Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 17 February 2017,
shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has
repurchased   a  further   66   637  preference   shares,
representing 3.46% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. This brings the total
percentage of preference shares repurchased under the

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 65 004
preference shares (3.37% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

    -   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
        (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
        business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
        months after the date of this announcement;
    -   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
        will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
        the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
        after the date of this announcement;
    -   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
        reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
        business of the Company and the Group for a period of

   Starting 2013, the non-loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to a
10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.

(2)
   Starting 2013, a deemed surplus attributable to T2 capital of subsidiaries
issued to outside third parties, is excluded from group qualifying capital in
terms of the accelerated adoption of Basel 3. This deduction phases in at 20%
per annum.

(3)
   This value is 10.75% (2016: 9.75%) of risk-weighted assets, being the
Basel global minimum requirement of 8%, the South African country-specific
buffer of 1.5% (2016: 1.75%) and the Capital Conservation Buffer of
1.25%(disclosable in terms of SARB November 2016 directive in order to
standardise reporting across banks). In terms of the regulations the
Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) is excluded.
Operational risk disclosure changed from 01 March 2016, per the SA Reserve
Bank’s instruction. The operational risk capital add-on, in accordance with
the ASA method, has been converted to an equivalent Risk Weighted Asset
(RWA). This reduced the Capital Adequacy Ratio by approximately 1.9% in March
2016, as qualifying capital remains the same but is divided by a higher RWA
amount.

Client growth motivated by strong service and brand fundamentals

The Capitec brand has consistently stayed true to its core fundamentals of delivering simplified banking that
is both affordable and easy to access through personal service. This resonates with most South Africans,
especially in the current tough economic climate, giving them a sense of value and allowing them to feel in
control of their money. We received recognition of this when the brand was awarded the top position in the
retail banking category at the Sunday Times Top Brands Awards in August 2016.

Substantial Capitec brand acceptance, combined with the expansion of our branch, ATM and digital footprint,
has resulted in a record growth of 1 300 000 new clients during the financial year and active clients totalled
8.6 million by year-end (February 2016: 7.3 million).

Primary banking clients (those clients who make regular deposits - mainly salaries) grew in line with total
client growth and represent 46% of all active clients. These primary banking clients are less likely to move
their banking elsewhere and, on average, do 5 times more transactions than a regular banking client.

Helping clients to help themselves

Our strategy of increasing out-of-branch transacting continued to deliver strong results. Our clients are able
to perform more cost efficient transactions through our self-service terminals ('SST'), remote banking app
('app'), USSD and dual note recyclers ('DNR'). A DNR is where you can deposit and withdraw money, as well
as get a bank statement.

Self-service banking transactions (including app, USSD, card, SSTs, DNRs and internet banking) increased
46% year-on-year to 728 million (February 2016: 499 million), while ATM and branch transactions increased
15% year-on-year to 330 million (February 2016: 287 million). As a direct result, our capacity in the branches
improved and we were able to service our clients' needs faster and more efficiently.

Client centricity delivered through service

A core principle in the organisation is to act with the best interest of the client in mind. This emphasises
the importance of the client experience, which is driven primarily by consistent client service that meets or
exceeds expectations. We opened 76 new branches during the financial year in order to alleviate pressure
in high volume areas and to grow the brand footprint in higher-end shopping malls. 301 of the 796 branches
trade seven days a week and all branches are open for longer trading hours than the industry norm to ensure
a highest level of client accessibility.

We are pleased once more by the recognition the organisation received for client service as the winner of the
Ask Afrika Orange Index service awards in 2016, as well as the South African Consumer Satisfaction Index
(SACsi) award for the top retail bank. This is however a constant reminder to continue to focus on developing
and delivering a world class service experience that helps clients to feel in control of their money.

Earnings up 18%

Earnings increased by 18% to R3.8 billion from R3.2 billion a year ago. Despite weak economic conditions,
there was strong year-on-year growth in net transaction fee income. Net lending and investment income
increased by 14%, with a 16% increase in net loan impairment expense.

Net transaction fee income increased by 30%

The combination of the growth in our active client base, expansion of our ATM and branch network and the
increasing financial awareness of our clients on the best way to bank, has resulted in a 30% year-on-year
increase in net transaction (non-lending) fee income.

Our net transaction fee income covered 72% (February 2016: 66%) of our operating expenses and contributed
37% (February 2016: 33%) of our net income.

Operating costs increased by 18%

Operating costs increased by 18% from R4.6 billion in 2016 to R5.4 billion in 2017. The cost-to-income ratio
remained at 34% for 2017 (February 2016: 34%). The main reasons for the growth in expenses were, firstly,
the continued increase in the number of employees and branches. Employment costs grew year-on-year by
21% or R421 million and the cost of premises grew by 18% or R76 million, as we opened new branches during
the year. Secondly, IT and security costs increased significantly.

Capital expenditure for the year was R1 billion (February 2016: R704 million). The 42% year-on-year increase
was mainly due to the expansion of our ATM and branch network, as well as spend on IT.

Expenditure on our staff, branch and ATM network and IT systems are critical to ensuring we continue to
deliver simple and affordable financial services to our clients in an easily accessible way that is accompanied
by excellent service.

Graduate placement program, learnerships and bursaries

This year saw the launching of two new further development programs for both current and future employees.
Firstly, we introduced a one year learnership program (NQF4 equivalent) for staff in branches and service
centres, whereby on completion they receive a certificate in banking. Secondly, we began a graduate placement
program with seven new joiners starting this year. In addition, we provided 29 bursaries to second year university
students studying finance and information technology ('IT'). These investments ensure our employees and
future employees have the opportunity to further educate themselves and that our talent pipeline is well placed
for the future growth of the company.

Leadership and staff development is important to us. 1 313 employees attended leadership courses during
the financial year, while 3 915 employees participated in specific training courses. This investment in our
employees will enable us to perform more effectively as a company and retain our talented leaders.

We also contributed to the Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme ('ISFAP') during the year. ISFAP is a
pilot program, backed by government and the private sector, aimed at addressing the funding challenge of
tertiary education of poor and 'missing middle' students.

Gross loans and advances increased by 10%

Gross loans and advances increased by R4.2 billion to R45.1 billion (February 2016: R40.9 billion). The impact of
continued tightening of our credit granting criteria and lending to better quality clients was evident, as we granted
176 655 less loans in 2017 than in the previous year (February 2017: 3 507 819; February 2016: 3 684 474). 

We granted lower-risk, higher value loans to better quality clients this year. This resulted in the value of
new loans growing by 12% from R24.2 billion in 2016 to R27.2 billion in 2017. The average amount for
loans less than 6 months and greater than 6 months was R1 905 (February 2016: R1 749) and R26 605
(February 2016: R25 229) respectively.

The average term of the outstanding book decreased from 40 months at February 2016 to 38 months at
February 2017.

The launch of the Capitec credit card

The Capitec credit card was launched on 18 September 2016 in the Western Cape branches and nationally
on 16 October 2016. So far, it has performed within our risk appetite. Clients earn interest of at least 5.35% per
year on a positive balance.

Arrears as a percentage of gross loans and advances increased to 6.3%

The financial stress and economic difficulties experienced by clients during the year were evident. Debt review
applications and retrenchment letters received increased by 19% and 15% respectively year-on-year. There
was also an increase in clients who received their salaries late or experienced reduced or no inflows.

Management acted decisively to address the deteriorating arrears performance during the year by tightening
credit granting to those segments and employers indicating financial stress. Significant changes were also
implemented to the rescheduling policies. This ensures the performance and quality of the loan book remains
within our risk appetite, while resulting in all rescheduled loans within the last 6 months to decrease year-on-year
by 21% to R2.7 billion (February 2016: R3.4 billion).

The economic conditions and changes in rescheduling policies contributed to the 24% year-on-year increase in
arrears to R2.9 billion (February 2016: R2.3 billion). Arrears and all rescheduled loans within the last 6 months
to gross loans and advances decreased to 12.2% (February 2016: 13.8%), while the arrears and all rescheduled
loans within the last 6 months coverage ratio increased to 107% (February 2016: 91%).

Rescheduled accounts

The performance of rescheduled accounts are monitored on a daily basis. Loans that were rescheduled from
arrears within the last 6 months increased by 3% year-on-year to R1.6 billion (February 2016: R1.5 billion).
We implemented rules to prevent arrears clients from rescheduling for a second or third time if their risk was
too high. Loans rescheduled within the last 6 months of the year from a current status decreased by 40%
to R1.1 billion (February 2016: R1.8 billion). This was due to policy changes that included preventing low risk
clients from rescheduling out of a current status.

Higher provisions were maintained for the rescheduled book in comparison to the remainder of the book.

Provisioning remains conservative and adequate

The total provisions compared to gross loans and advances increased to 13.1% at the end of the 2017 financial
year (February 2016: 12.5%).

We provide 8% on current loans, 43% on loans one instalment behind, 81% for two instalments and 92%
for three instalments, all statistically calculated. We provide on average 52% on clients that rescheduled any
of their loans whilst in arrears within the last 6 months even though they are current in terms of their new
agreement. For clients who rescheduled any of their loans whilst current we provide 15%. All provisions are
based on the probability of default. All outstanding balances of clients who are 90 days in arrears on any loan
are substantially provided for or written off.

The gross loan impairment expense increased by 19% to R6.2 billion (February 2016: R5.3 billion). The table
below analyses this increase:
                                                                                              Change %     
                                                                                                 2017/

Movement in bad debt provision                                              799       1 274       (37)          221
Gross loan impairment expense                                             6 246       5 255         19        4 616

A significant portion of the 37% increase in write-offs was as a result of the change in rescheduling policies in
the current year and the market deterioration of the prior year, which was provided for in 2016, that materialised
in the current year. The market deterioration of the prior year, which increased the 2016 movement in bad
debt provision, did not occur again in the current year. The tightening of the granting criteria and a more stable
market resulted in a lower bad debt provision movement during the 2017 financial year. 

Our net loan impairment expense to total lending income (excluding investment income) for the year amounted
to 35.7% (February 2016: 34.3%). The net loan impairment expense to average gross loans and advances
increased from 11.4% in 2016 to 11.9% this year. 

A weak employment environment was prevalent during the year. We managed our book meticulously and
restricted our lending to specific sectors and employers where we anticipated increased stress. The book
continues to perform within our risk appetite.

Recoveries

Recoveries increased by 32% year-on-year from R854 million in 2016 to R1 125 million in 2017. The increase
resulted from operational debt recovery improvements, a larger handover book and debt sales.

Continued healthy capital levels

The return on equity for the year was 27% (February 2016: 27%). The total annual dividend increased by 18%
from 1 055 cents per share to 1 250 cents per share, in line with the increase in earnings.

Capitec remains well capitalised and is generating sufficient profit to fund growth in the loan book. At February
2017, the capital adequacy ratio was 34%.

Growth of deposits

Retail deposits amounted to R48.0 billion at February 2017, an increase of R10.2 billion on the prior year-end
(February 2016: R37.8 billion). Retail deposits continued to grow by more than total loans and advances.

The value of wholesale deposits declined to R7.5 billion (February 2016: R10.2 billion). This is as result of
managing our wholesale funding to meet the requirements of the loan book, matched against growth in retail
fixed deposits and profit.

Capitec is fully compliant with the Basel 3 liquidity ratios. Our conservative liquidity policies are unchanged.

Credit regulation

The Department of Trade and Industry ('DTI') published final Credit Life Insurance Regulations under the
National Credit Act on 9 February 2017. The regulations prescribe the cost, cover and benefits of credit life
insurance. The regulations will come into effect on 10 August 2017 and will only affect credit agreements
concluded on or after the date of implementation. We are working towards implementing the regulations by
the effective date.

We continue to support appropriate regulation enhancing the sustainability of the credit industry and to reduce
the cost of credit for consumers if this is done in a manner that is sustainable and achieves a balance between
affordability and access to credit. We are supporting the regulator on these matters.

Prospects

We continue to grow our client numbers, branches and ATM network. This will provide us with the opportunity to
offer new financial services in the future. New products will continue to have the same foundation of simplicity
and affordability as our other products.

Our strategy to increase self-service and digital banking will result in improved capacity and efficiencies in
the branches.

On 24 March 2017, we announced our investment in Cream Finance Holding Limited ('Creamfinance').
Creamfinance is a leading online technology-driven consumer loans company, offering multiple credit products
across international markets. We will acquire an interest of 40% for ï¿½21 million in three tranches at nine-month
intervals, subject to specific agreed performance measures being met. We are excited about this investment
and the opportunities it presents for us as we expand our interests beyond the borders of South Africa.

We continue to pursue our strategy to be the best retail bank.

Dividend

The directors declared a final gross dividend of 800 cents per ordinary share on 27 March 2017, bringing
the total dividends for the year to 1 250 cents per share. There are 115 626 991 ordinary shares in issue.

The final dividend meets the definition of a dividend in terms of the Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962). The dividend
amount net of South African dividend tax of 20% is 640.00000 cents per share. The distribution is made
from income reserves. Capitec's tax reference number is 9405376840.

Segment analysis

Capitec reports a single segment - retail banking, operating only within the South African economic environment.
The business is widely distributed with no reliance on any major customers. The business sells a single retail
banking product 'Global One' that enables clients to transact, save and borrow.

Fair values

In terms of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', the fair value of loans and advances was R43.2 billion
(February 2016: R38.2 billion), deposits and bonds was R55.9 billion (February 2016: R48.1 billion), derivative
assets was R58.1 million (February 2016: R225.4 million asset), available-for-sale investment was R100 million
(February 2016: nil) and derivative liabilities was R45.6 million (February 2016: nil). The fair value of loans
and advances and available-for-sale investment was calculated on a level 3 basis and deposits and bonds
and derivative assets and liabilities were calculated on a level 2 basis. The fair value of all other financial
instruments equates their carrying amount.

Notes

The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summarised
financial statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance
with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices
Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as
a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. The accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements from which the summarised consolidated
financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied
in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements. All other standards, interpretations
and amendments to published standards applied for the first time during the current financial period did not
have any significant impact on the financial statements.

As part of the review of the group's basis of preparation policy to consistently comply with IFRS and interpretations
issued by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), we have reclassified loan origation fees to be included
in interest income and not form part of loan fee income as previously presented.

The portion of loan origination fees that relate to the creation of a financial asset are amortised over the term
of the loan on an effective interest rate basis, with the unamortised portion of the fees recorded as deferred
loan fee income contained within net loans and advances to clients.

The impact of this reclassification for 2016 is presented as follows:
                                                                                   Restated      Reported

As part of the JSE proactive monitoring of financial statements, issuers were advised that classification of an
item within the statement of cash flows, i.e. whether it relates to operating, financing, or investing activities, is
equally important to users as the final net cash position. For this purpose, during the past year we have split
the funding of our deposits and wholesale funding to reclassify the movement of bonds (subordinated debt
and listed bonds) under financing activities and not under operating activities as previously disclosed.

INVESTMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL ONLINE LENDING GROUP

Capitec has long expressed the desire to internationalise at
the right opportunity. Shareholders are herewith advised that
it has found a suitable international investment opportunity
in Cream Finance Holding Limited (“Creamfinance”), a globally
expanding online lending group.

Creamfinance is registered in Cyprus and the group provides
online consumer loan products in a number of countries,
including Poland, Latvia, Georgia, the Czech Republic, Mexico
and Denmark. Its business model, sophisticated technology and
advanced credit scoring methods align the Creamfinance group
(Creamfinance and its subsidiaries) with Capitec’s business
model   and  supports   its  long   term   digital  strategy.
Creamfinance’s management team is innovative with a pragmatic
approach, cost conscious and focused on simplicity and
prioritisation of resources and capital, creating a cultural
fit with the approach followed by Capitec.

We believe that Creamfinance will provide Capitec’s management
with the opportunity to gain experience in entering and
operating in foreign countries, more specifically advancing
credit in the international and online environment and to work
with a foreign partner to manage an international business.

Capitec will not be involved in the day to day operation of
Creamfinance, but will focus on providing strategic input and
give access to skills in key areas such as information
technology, credit management in general and the development
of term loan products.

Creamfinance continuously investigates entry opportunities
into new markets and their online business model has been
developed in such a way that new countries can be entered
swiftly and efficiently, requiring limited investment in local
infrastructure.

Key features of the transaction

-   Capitec will acquire an interest of 40% in Creamfinance for
    €21 million;
-   The investment will be done in three tranches at nine month
    intervals, subject to specific agreed performance measures
    being met. The first tranche of €6.7 million will give
    Capitec an interest of 19.43% in Creamfinance. The second
    tranche will increase Capitec’s shareholding to 31.25% and
    will amount to €7.1 million. The third tranche of €7.2
    million will increase Capitec’s shareholding to 40%;
-   Existing shareholders of Creamfinance have the option to
    sell a further 9% shareholding in Creamfinance to Capitec
    at an maximum cost of €5.4 million(“the put option”), which
    would increase Capitec’s interest to 49%. The put option
    can be exercised at the time of the 2nd or 3rd investment
    tranches, but remains subject to Creamfinance meeting the
    investment criteria for the relevant tranches;
-   It is not the intention for Capitec to become a controlling
    shareholder;
-   The two founders will each maintain an interest of at least
    10.0% in Creamfinance. The balance of the shares in
    Creamfinance is held by Whirlon Investments Limited, Basic
    Group Limited and other small shareholders; and
-   Capitec will initially have the right to nominate one
    director on the board of Creamfinance. This position will
    be filled by André du Plessis, CFO of Capitec. The second
    tranche will entitle Capitec to nominate a second director
    to serve on the board which will be filled by Gerrie Fourie,
    CEO of Capitec.

Founders of Creamfinance

-   Matiss Ansviesulis, CEO of Creamfinance. He holds a BSc
    (Hons) in Business Studies from Lancaster University
    Management School (UK). He is the co-founder of Creditclub,
    the first P2P lending service in Latvia. He worked at JP
    Morgan, London in risk management and money market trading
    from 2009 to 2012; and
-   Davis Barons, Chairman of Creamfinance. He is a successful
    entrepreneur and founder of the Latvian and Czech non-bank
    lender associations.

Advantages of the transaction for Capitec

-   Develop experience in the management of a foreign business
    through a partnership approach;
-   Create a revenue source designated in a diverse pool of
    foreign currencies;
-   Access an income stream from a high growth industry that
    has potential for sustainable growth and internal capital
    generation; and
-   Gain   insight   into  a   technologically   advanced   and
    sophisticated   credit   scoring  model   and   information
    technology platform, supporting Capitec’s long term digital
    strategy.

The South African Reserve Bank has approved the Capitec
investment of up to 49% in Creamfinance as required in terms
of the Banks Act (Act 94 of 1990).

Capitec looks    forward   to   a   successful   partnership   with
Creamfinance.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 3.41% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa, which came into effect on 1 January
2013. Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the
preference share capital of Capitec contributed fully to
the capital adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of
the “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel
III, the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2017, only 50% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 27 May 2016(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement published on the Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 18 November 2016,
shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has
repurchased   a  further   65   781  preference   shares,
representing 3.41% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. The repurchase was made
out of the Company’s available cash resources. The total
percentage of preference shares repurchased to date in
the 2017 financial year amounts to 13.17%. The preference
shares were repurchased for an aggregate value of R6 115 929.70.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 131 641
preference shares (6.83% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
    (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
    business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
    months after the date of this announcement;
-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

Registration number 1999/025903/06
Registered bank controlling company
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa
JSE ordinary share code: CPI ISIN code: ZAE000035861
JSE preference share code: CPIP ISIN code: ZAE000083838
(""Capitec"" or ""the Company"")

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 4.5% OF THE NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE, NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa which came into effect on 1 January 2013.
Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the preference
share capital of Capitec contributed fully to the capital
adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of the
“grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel III,
the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2016, only 60% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 27 May 2016(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Further to the announcement published on the Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 3 October 2016,
shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has
repurchased   a  further   86   770  preference   shares,
representing 4.50% of the issued preference share capital
as at the date of the current general authority to
repurchase the preference shares. The repurchase was made
out of the Company’s available cash resources. The total
percentage of preference shares repurchased to date in
the 2016 financial year amounts to 9.75%. The preference
shares were repurchased for an aggregate value of R8 056
712.30.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 197 422
preference shares (10.25% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
    (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
     business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
     months after the date of this announcement;

-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;

-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and

-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF 3% OF THE      NON-REDEEMABLE, NON-
CUMULATIVE,     NON-PARTICIPATING    PREFERENCE     SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa which came into effect on 1 January 2013.
Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the preference
share capital of Capitec contributed fully to the capital
adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of the
“grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel III,
the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2016, only 60% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 27 May 2016(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has
repurchased 101 109 preference shares, representing 5.20%
of the issued preference share capital as at the date of
the   current   general  authority   to   repurchase   the
preference shares. The repurchase was made out of the
Company’s available cash resources. The total percentage
of preference shares repurchased to date in the 2016
financial year amounts to 5.20%. The preference shares
were repurchased for an aggregate value of R9 404 185.90.

The repurchases were made in terms of the general
authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
effected through the order book operated by the JSE
trading system without any prior understanding or
arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

Of the 101 109 preference shares repurchased, 4 118 have
been delisted and cancelled. Application will be made to
the JSE to de-list the balance of the preference shares
at which point they will be cancelled.

Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 284 192
preference shares (14.75% of the preference shares in
issue as at the date of the current general authority),
in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
the requirements of the Banks Act.

The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
preference shares and interest earned on the cash
utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

   -   the Company and the Company and its subsidiaries
       (“the Group”) will be able, in the ordinary course of
       business, to repay their debts for a period of 12
       months after the date of this announcement;
   -   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
       will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
       the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
       after the date of this announcement;
   -   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
       reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
       business of the Company and the Group for a period of
       12 months after the date of this announcement; and
   -   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
       working capital for ordinary business purposes.

Strong client growth in a challenging economy 
Active clients continued to grow with 648 000 new clients joining Capitec Bank in the past six months compared
to 561 000 in the previous six months. This positive movement is largely attributed to a combination of increased
branch distribution in key malls and a strong brand proposition of simplified banking and value for money.

Capitec Bank opened 31 new branches during the reporting period, bringing the total branches to 751. Branches
are open for retail trading hours during the week while 280 branches, primarily in shopping malls, are open for
seven days a week, ensuring that our banking offer is accessible when people really need it.

Consistently conservative
The current economic climate puts the consumer's ability to qualify for credit under pressure. Credit client
growth and the total book remain flat due to strict affordability guidelines and prudent credit assessments.
Based on continuous market assessment, we have limited credit extension to lower income earners, employees
in particular industries and more specifically to particular business units which we believe are at high risk of
having unstable income. This conservative approach to credit is characteristic of the business and will ensure
long-term sustainability.

Strong brand loyalty evident in banking client growth
The number of primary banking clients (those clients who make regular deposits – mainly salaries) has
grown in line with total client growth and represents 46% of all active clients. This trend is also evident in the
comprehensive AMPS survey which, according to the latest results for December 2015, indicated that 22.4%
of the banked population regard Capitec Bank as their primary bank, up from 20.6% for the period to June
2015. The number of primary banking clients is a strong indicator of commitment to the brand. These clients
are more profitable since they do on average 5 times more transactions than non-primary banking clients.

Higher efficiency through self-help banking
Net transaction fee income to operating expenses continued healthy growth to 70% for the six-month period
ended August 2016 (six months to August 2015: 61%; year ended February 2016: 66%). This is driven primarily
by higher transaction activity by our growing primary banking client base. Marginal price increases at the
beginning of the financial year were only applied to in-branch and cash-based transactions, while the pricing
of banking on our remote channels remained unchanged. Remote channel transactions are priced at less than
half of branch transactions. This is part of the bank's strategy to increase out-of-branch transacting, which will
improve capacity and efficiencies in the branches.

Over the past six months new functionality was added to our remote banking app in order to help clients manage
their money anytime from anywhere in the world. The number of clients banking on their phones using USSD
and the app has grown significantly to over 3.2 million.

Earnings up 19%
Earnings increased by 19.4% to R1.8 billion from R1.5 billion a year ago. Solid growth from loan fee income
and transaction fee income contributed to the strong year-on-year increase.

Net transaction fee income increased by 31%
Our transactional banking continues to grow rapidly in line with the increased client numbers and increased
transactions by clients, both in branch and using remote access. 

Net transaction fee income contributed 37% (six months to August 2015: 32%; year ended February 2016:
33%) of our net income.

We continually strive to offer our clients the best value proposition for their banking needs. We are therefore
proud that this was recognised in the recent Solidarity banking charges report that again found that Capitec
offers the most affordable bank account in South Africa. 

Operating costs increased by 13%
Operating costs for the six-month period were R2.6 billion, which represents a year-on-year increase of 13%
(six months to August 2015: R2.3 billion). The growth was as a result of employee numbers increasing by 13%
due to the expanding branch network and the employment of more people in key support departments, mainly
information technology. Premises, security and information technology were the other major contributors towards
the increase. The cost-to-income ratio decreased from 36% for the six-month period ended August 2015 to
34% for the six-month period ended August 2016. 

Capital expenditure increased 132% to R712 million for the six-month period ended August 2016 (August
2015: R307 million) due to an increase in the rollout of ATMs (R160 million), the opening of new branches and
spend on information technology. All of these are critical to support our growing client base whilst increasing
our footprint across the country.

Emphasis on our employees
Our client service, and therefore our success, depends on our staff. 352 of our staff attended leadership courses
during the six-month period ended August 2016, while 2 757 staff were involved in specific training courses.
All operational employees were involved in continuous training. We have accelerated leadership development
through three levels of management, from team leader to senior managers, across functions. 

Our focus during the period has been to review all our employee benefits. We introduced benefits that are
relevant and appropriate to our employees. This ranged from medical cover to financial health programs, and
also temporary disability cover. The reward is employee turnover that continued to be below the industry average
in the past half-year.

Gross loans and advances increased by 13%
Gross loans and advances grew by 13% year-on-year and by 5% from February 2016 to R42.8 billion (August
2015: R37.9 billion; February 2016: R40.9 billion). Net loan impairment expense to average gross loans and
advances increased to 6.2% for the six-month period ended August 2016 from 5.7% a year ago and 5.8% for
the six-month period ended February 2016. 

Given the challenging economic conditions, we continued to tighten our credit granting criteria. This resulted
in reducing credit risk by lending to better quality clients and granting fewer loans. Fewer high-risk, low value,
shorter-term loans were granted, resulting in a 5% year-on-year decrease in the number of loans granted and
an increase in the average size of new loans to R7 487 (August 2015: R6 157; February 2016: R6 577).

The overall term of the outstanding book shortened slightly to 39 months at August 2016 (August 2015:
41 months; February 2016: 40 months).

Arrears as a percentage of gross loans and advances increased to 6.0%
Arrears increased by 44% year-on-year and by 11% from February 2016 to R2.6 billion (August 2015: R1.8
billion; February 2016: R2.3 billion), while arrears to gross loans and advances increased to 6.0% (August 2015:
4.7%; February 2016: 5.6%). The tough economic conditions can impact clients in a number of ways. Client
financial stress increases and is exacerbated by additional financial stress on employers that can often result
in late or no salary payments. To address these risks, management responded decisively by changing granting
rules and increasing the provision for doubtful debts. 

Rescheduled loans
We reschedule loans to mitigate credit risk. Clients reschedule mainly to overcome temporary cash flow
shortages. Clients who are rescheduled from an arrears status show renewed willingness to pay and maintain
a relationship with Capitec that would be lost if they were handed over. For Capitec, rescheduling is an effective
collection strategy that is closely monitored by management on a daily basis. It is more profitable than handing
a client over to the legal process. 

Rescheduling a loan does not necessarily reduce the risk of default - hence a higher provision is maintained
on rescheduled loans in comparison to the remainder of the book. 

Loans that were rescheduled from arrears during the first six months of the year increased by 41% year-on-
year and by 7% from February 2016 to R1.6 billion (August 2015: R1.2 billion; February 2016: R1.5 billion). This
is due to a combination of the growth in our loan book, credit granting strategy changes implemented during
the 2016 financial year, validated rescheduling policy changes implemented during December 2015 as well as
the impact of the current economic conditions on our clients.

When a client reschedules a loan, all his loans are moved to a rescheduled segment resulting in a higher provision
percentage across all the loans. Furthermore, when a client reschedules out of arrears he is not considered
to be rehabilitated immediately and the arrears provision is maintained and released over time to ensure our
philosophy of conservative provisioning over the rehabilitation period.

Our provision model remains conservative
The provision for doubtful debts increased by 38% year-on-year and by 14% from February 2016 to R5.9 billion
(August 2015: R4.2 billion; February 2016: R5.1 billion).

The total provision compared to the gross loan book amounts to 13.7% at August 2016 (August 2015: 11.2%;
February 2016: 12.5%). The level of the provision to arrears remains high at 229% (August 2015: 239%; February
2016: 223%).

We provide 8% on up-to-date loans, 49% on loans one instalment behind, 79% for two instalments and 90%
for three instalments. We provide on average 52% on clients that rescheduled any of their loans whilst in
arrears within the last six months, although they are up-to-date in terms of the new agreement. For clients who
rescheduled any of their loans whilst up-to-date within the last six months and are still up to date, we provide on
average 17%. All provisions are based on the probability of further default. All outstanding balances of clients
who are 90 days in arrears on any loan are fully provided for or written off.

The gross loan impairment expense of R3.1 billion for the six-month period ended August 2016 increased by
25% year-on-year and by 14% from the six-month period ended February 2016. The table below analyses the
increases:

The net loan impairment expense to loan revenue was 38.6% for the six-month period ended August
2016, compared to 35.8% for the six-month period ended August 2015 and 36.2% for the year ended
February 2016. 

Arrears and book quality continue to perform within our risk appetite. 

Recoveries
Recoveries increased by 35% to R537 million for the six-month period ended August 2016, from R397 million
for the six-month period ended August 2015 and R457 million for the six-month period ended February 2016.
The increase was the result of more effective and efficient internal procedures as well as a larger handed over
book. The retrenchment book, which is fully insured, also increased in the current difficult economic conditions.

Capital remains strong
The annualised return on equity for the six-months was 26% (August 2015: 26%). Capitec remains well
capitalised and is generating sufficient profit to fund growth in the loan book. At August 2016, the capital
adequacy ratio was 34.0%.

Retail deposits grew by R8.4 billion
Retail deposits amounted to R43.0 billion at 31 August 2016, an increase of R8.4 billion to the prior
year. The continued growth in retail deposits indicates the strong brand acceptance of the bank. The value of
wholesale deposits declined to R8.4 billion at August 2016, from R10.4 billion at August 2015. This was as
a result of instruments that matured and were deliberately only partially refinanced due to strong retail fixed
deposit growth and good capital generation. At a bond auction on 6 May 2016, we received bids totalling
R2.2 billion and subsequently issued bonds totalling R750 million. We appreciate the continued support of the
domestic capital markets.

Capitec maintained its conservative liquidity policy, retaining long-term funding to match longer term assets.
Retail call deposits are not used to finance long-term loans.

The liquidity position remained healthy and in line with our conservative liquidity policy. We comfortably exceed
the Basel 3 liquidity standards, which measures our ability to survive severe stress due to a loss of support
from institutional funders. This also measures how well the bank matches cash inflows from assets with its
cash outflows to funders and depositors. 

Regulation
The Department of Trade and Industry ('DTI') published final regulations for interest rate limits and fees for credit
agreements that became effective from 6 May 2016. Capitec complies with the limits. The bank launched credit
life and retrenchment insurance products linked to lending products from 6 May 2016 under the proposed fee
limits. In principle we never charge clients a higher total credit fee than in the past.

We continue to support appropriate regulation enhancing the sustainability of the credit industry and to reduce
the cost of credit for consumers if this is done in a manner that is sustainable and achieves a balance between
affordability and access to credit.

Contingent liability
During February 2016 the National Credit Regulator ('NCR') alleged that Capitec Bank Limited had contravened
the National Credit Act and referred the matter to the National Consumer Tribunal. The referral was withdrawn
by the NCR on 21 September 2016. There are no more referrals pending between Capitec Bank and the NCR. 

Changes in board composition and executive management
Michiel le Roux stepped down as chairman on 27 May 2016 and was succeeded by Riaan Stassen, previous
chief executive of Capitec until 31 December 2013. Michiel continues to serve on the board as a non-executive
director. The chairman and the other members of the board thank Michiel on behalf of all stakeholders for his
exceptional leadership over the past nine years.

Gerrit Pretorius and Jackie Huntley, independent non-executive directors, stepped down from the board on 27
May 2016 and 21 September 2016 respectively. Nkosana Mashiya, executive: risk management, was appointed
as an executive director on 1 June 2016.

After 15 years of outstanding and dedicated service, Carl Fischer, co-founder of the bank responsible
for marketing and corporate affairs, retired in May 2016. We are indebted to Carl for his contribution in
developing the bank and his continued focus on client service. He is succeeded by Francois Viviers who has
been with Capitec since 2011.

Prospects
The slowdown in South Africa's economic growth will continue to place pressure on consumers. As the increase
in our client numbers over the past six months has shown, clients will continue to seek value and better service
from their bank. We will maintain our conservative approach to credit in the current conditions.

We remain relentless in the pursuit of continued service excellence and our strategy to be the best retail bank
for all South Africans.

Interim dividend
The directors declared a gross interim dividend of 450 cents per ordinary share on Monday, 26 September
2016. The dividend will be paid on Monday, 17 October 2016. There are 115 626 991 ordinary shares in issue.

The dividend meets the definition of a dividend in terms of the Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962). The dividend
amount net of South African dividend tax of 15% is 382.50000 cents per share. The distribution is made from
income reserves. Capitec's tax reference number is 9405376840.

Segment analysis
Capitec reports a single segment – retail banking, operating only within the South African economic
environment. The business is widely distributed with no reliance on any major customers. The business sells a
single retail banking product 'Global One' that enables clients to transact, save and borrow.

Fair values
In terms of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', the fair value of loans and advances was R43.3 billion (August
2015: R39.4 billion), deposits and bonds was R51.6 billion (August 2015: R45.2 billion) and derivatives were
valued at R142.6 million asset and R17 million liability (August 2015: R103.6 million asset). The fair value of loans
and advances was calculated on a level 3 basis and deposits and bonds and derivative assets were calculated
on a level 2 basis. Investments designated at fair value are valued using the market approach on a level 2 basis.
The fair value of all other financial instruments equates to their carrying amount.

Unaudited interim financial statements
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued
by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, as amended. The accounting
policies applied in the preparation of these interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial
statements except for standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards, applied for the first
time during the current financial period, which did not have any impact on the financial statements. The Group
complies in all material respects with the requirements of King III. Basel disclosures in terms of Regulation
43 of the Banks' Act are available on the Capitec Bank website.

No event, that is material to the financial affairs of the Group, has occurred between the reporting date and the
date of approval of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements was supervised by the chief financial
officer, André du Plessis CA(SA).

S&P GLOBAL RATINGS AFFIRMED CAPITEC BANK’S RATINGS

S&P Global Ratings affirmed all of the counterparty credit
ratings of Capitec Bank, the wholly owned subsidiary of
Capitec.

The international scale long- and short-term ratings remain at
‘BB+/B’. The South African national scale long- and short-term
ratings remain constant at ‘zaA/zaA-2’. The outlook for these
ratings remains negative. S&P state that ‘the negative outlook
reflects South Africa’s slowdown in economic growth, high
inflation, and the positive interest rate cycle, which is
placing additional pressure on financial institutions’ asset
quality and earnings.’

(1) Starting 2013, the non loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to a
10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.
(2) Starting 2013, a deemed surplus attributable to T2 capital of subsidiaries
issued to outside third parties, is excluded from group qualifying capital in
terms of the accelerated adoption of Basel 3. This deduction phases in at 20%
per annum.
(3) This value is 9.75% of risk-weighted assets, being the Basel global
minimum requirement of 8% and a South African country-specific buffer of
1.75%. In terms of the regulations the Individual Capital Requirement (ICR)
is excluded. Operational risk disclosure changed from 01 March 2016, per the
SA Reserve Bank’s instruction. The operational risk capital add-on, in
accordance with the ASA method, has been converted to an equivalent Risk
Weighted Asset (RWA). This reduced the Capital Adequacy Ratio by
approximately 1.9% in March 2016, as qualifying capital remains the same but
is divided by a higher RWA amount.

Relentless focus on clients and service

This year has seen the largest growth in our client numbers since we started the bank.
By year-end, active clients were up 1 025 000 to 7.3 million and primary bank clients 
(those clients who make regular deposits ï¿½ mainly salaries) increased by 582 000 to 
3.3 million.

Our brand is accepted by all income profiles and most people like our transparent, non-
discriminatory approach to services and fees: all our clients hold gold cards.

According to the comprehensive AMPS survey for the period to June 2015, 20.6% of South
Africans regard Capitec Bank as their primary bank, up from 18.9% for the period to
December 2014.

A recent study by the Centre for Competition, Regulation and Economic Development,
supported by the National Treasury, demonstrates that Capitec's entry into the banking
industry contributed to a more competitive banking environment, resulting in
significantly lower bank charges in South Africa. This is estimated to amount to annual
clients savings across the banking system of R19.9 billion in 2014. The savings were 
calculated from the impact both on those clients who switched to Capitec Bank and the 
effect on clients who stayed with their existing bank but benefitted from reduced 
charges as the banks responded to Capitec's lower charges.

Cellphones lead to easier banking

Cellphone banking has taken off and the Capitec app is a tool clients can use easily
and securely to simplify banking. Over 1 million clients have activated the app and can
do almost everything they need to with three or four taps on their phones.

Earnings up 26%

Earnings increased by 26% to R3.2 billion from R2.5 billion a year ago. Continued
growth from loan and transaction fee income combined with conservative credit granting
contributed to the strong year-on-year increase.

Net transaction fee income increased by 16%

Growing client numbers, particularly salaried clients, combined with increased activity
per client resulted in a 16% year-on-year increase in net transaction fee income to
R3.0 billion. The decrease in card processing fees earned since March 2015 has been absorbed
in this figure.

Our net transaction fee income covered 66% (February 2015:65%) of our operating expenses and 
contributed 33% (February 2015:34%) of our net income.

We strive for simplicity and transparency, giving clients greater control over their
banking. Our fees are transparent and easy to understand. There was no price increase
for cellphone and internet banking in the year and our other price increases were below
inflation.

The importance of our employees

Capitec Bank's success depends upon its ability to recruit and retain employees as our
unique service experience depends on them. We had 11 440 permanent employees at year-
end, an increase of 1 179 employees compared to a year ago. Each one of our new
employees is trained at our training centre in Stellenbosch and we invested significantly
in leadership training. We promoted 1 369 employees within the organisation during the year.

Operating costs increased by 14%

Operating costs increased by 14% from R4.0 billion in 2015 to R4.6 billion in 2016. The
cost-to-income ratio decreased from 35% in 2015 to 34% in 2016. The two biggest reasons
for the growth in expenses were the increases in the number of employees and branches. 
Employment costs grew by R302 million, in line with the 11% year-on-year
growth in employees. The cost of premises grew by R68 million as we opened 52 new
branches during the year. Security and IT costs also showed significant increases.

Capital expenditure for the year was R704 million (February 2015: R414 million). The
70% year-on-year increase was due to the growing ATM and branch network, as well as the
purchase of land and property.

Gross loans and advances increased by 13%

We granted 864 935 more loans in 2016 than in the previous year. Gross loans and advances
increased by R4.6 billion to R40.9 billion.

The average term of the outstanding book decreased from 43 months at February 2015 to 
40 months at February 2016. Although the average term of loans advanced were shorter and the
average loan amount decreased, the value of new loans grew by 25% from R19.4 billion to
R24.2 billion in 2016.

We react swiftly to events and changing circumstances that impact on our clients.
Continuous detailed measurement of the performance and trends in the various segments of
the loan book and economy is performed. For example, management undertook visits to mines
during the year to understand the impact of the commodities downturn on our clients.

During the last few months of the 2016 year, macro-economic conditions deteriorated and
as a result we made changes to the credit granting model in December 2015.

Arrears as a percentage of gross loans and advances increased to 5.6%

Arrears increased from R2.0 billion in 2015 to R2.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 17%,
while arrears to gross loans and advances increased from 5.4% to 5.6%. Arrears
performance was on track for most of the year, but increased in the last quarter of
2016.

Rescheduled accounts

We give clients who experience cash flow stress the opportunity to reschedule their
payments. This applies to clients who are in arrears and those who are up-to-date with
their payments, based on predetermined criteria.

Loans rescheduled during the last six months of the year (which were in arrears at the
time of rescheduling), grew by 75% to R1.5 billion (February 2015: R884 million). This
is due to the expansion of our higher margin short term book, and is also an indication
of the economic challenges faced by clients.

The increased cash flow stress to which clients are being subjected to, is also reflected in the
increase in up-to-date rescheduling, which amounted to to R1.8 billion (February 2015: R1.1 billion).

Conservative provisioning

We introduced two additional provisions during the latter half of the year. Firstly,
for the probability of an up-to-date client rescheduling and secondly, for the effect of
the macro-economic conditions on our clients. These provisions, as well as the provision
model changes, contributed to a 33% increase in provision for doubtful debts to R5.1
billion at February 2016.

The total provisions compared to the gross loan book increased to 12.5% at the end of
the 2016 financial year (February 2015: 10.6%). The level of provisions to arrears
increased from 196% in 2015 to 223% in 2016.

We provide 8% on up-to-date loans, 47% on loans one instalment behind, 76% for two
instalments and 89% for three instalments. We provide on average 49% on clients that
rescheduled any of their loans whilst in arrears within the last six months although
they are up-to-date in terms of the new agreement. For clients who rescheduled any of
their loans whilst up-to-date we provide 16%. All these provisions are based on the
probability of further default. All outstanding balances of clients who are 90 days in
arrears on any loan are fully provided for or written off.

The gross loan impairment expense increased by 14% to R5.3 billion for the year ended
February 2016 (February 2015: R4.6 billion). The table below analyses this increase:

Our net loan impairment expense to loan revenue improved from 37.7% in 2015 to 36.2%
this year. The net loan impairment expense to average gross loans and advances
decreased slightly from 11.5% in 2015 to 11.4% this year.

The book is performing within our risk appetite. We expect continued pressure on employment and
the economy. We are prudent when providing credit, we manage our book meticulously and
we make conservative provisions.

Recoveries

Recoveries increased by 42% year-on-year from R602 million in 2015 to R854 million in 2016.
The increase resulted from growth in the handed-over book, the implementation of a new
strategy with our debt collectors and debt sales.

Robust capital

The return on equity for the year increased to 27% (February 2015: 25%). The total
annual dividend increased by 26% from 836 cents per share to 1 055 cents per share, in
line with the increase in earnings.

Capitec remains well capitalised and is generating sufficient profit to fund growth in
the loan book. At February 2016, the capital adequacy ratio was 34.9%. We remain
conservatively leveraged with total assets at 5 times equity.

Retail deposits grew by R7.8 billion

Capitec clients receive a minimum of 5.35% annual interest on balances in their transaction
accounts. Retail fixed savings amounted to R13.6 billion at 29 February 2016 (an
increase of R2.9 billion from a year ago) and retail call savings grew by R4.9 billion
to R24.2 billion. Our retail deposits grew by more than our total advances.

We maintain a healthy reserve of longer dated wholesale deposits to match our assets. 
Wholesale funding remains an important part of our liquidity structure. On 2 November 2015, 
we received bids totalling R903 million and subsequently issued a bond of R500 million. 
Capitec is fully compliant with the Basel 3 liquidity ratios. Our conservative liquidity 
policies are unchanged.

Regulation

The Department of Trade and Industry (""DTI"") published new regulations dealing with the
assessment of affordability under the National Credit Act on 13 March 2015. The
regulations, which guide credit providers away from providing high-risk credit and
protect consumers applying for credit at registered providers, came into effect on 
13 September 2015.

The DTI published final regulations for interest rate limits and fees for credit
agreements which will become effective from 6 May 2016. They have also invited comment
on the draft regulations regarding the capping of costs on credit life and retrenchment
insurance. Capitec does not currently charge credit life or retrenchment insurance, but
will start to do so from 6 May 2016. We performed a robust assessment of the impact of
these regulations, including the charging for credit life and retrenchment insurance
based on a client-by-client risk assessment, and determined that there will be a
limited impact on Capitec.

We continue to support appropriate regulation enhancing the sustainability of the
credit industry and to reduce the cost of credit for consumers if this is done in a
manner that is sustainable and achieves a balance between affordability and access to
credit. We will support the regulator on these matters.

Contingent liability

Since 2013, we have reported that the National Credit Regulator (""NCR"") alleged that
Capitec Bank Limited had contravened the National Credit Act. The National Credit
Tribunal dismissed the NCR's application and the NCR lodged an appeal. The appeal was
heard in the Gauteng High Court before a bench of three judges on 24 February 2016. 
On 23 March 2016 the court delivered its judgment and dismissed the NCR's appeal.

During February 2016 we became aware of another referral made by the NCR to the
National Consumer Tribunal, which referral is being contested by Capitec Bank.

It is, and remains, impracticable to estimate the financial effect of any possible
outcome of either of the referrals. Capitec is, and remains, of the view that the
matters will be satisfactorily resolved through due process.

Changes in executive management

Christian van Schalkwyk, who was in charge of risk management and company secretary
since we started in 2000, retired during November 2015. We would like to thank
Christian for the work he did in helping grow the bank and ensuring it has a solid
foundation. He is succeeded by Nkosana Mashiya as the risk management executive.
Nkosana was previously deputy registrar of banks at the South African Reserve Bank, and
brings a wealth of risk and regulatory knowledge. We welcome him on board. After
serving as assistant company secretary for 15 years, Yolande Mouton replaced Christian
as company secretary.

Prospects

The rapid growth in client numbers ensures that we will continue investing heavily in
people, branches and ATMs.

We expect difficult economic conditions to persist. We see this as an opportunity to
gain more clients as they look for value and better service from their bank.

Capitec Bank is well placed for the regulatory changes on credit agreements. We expect
minimal impact on our earnings from these changes.

We will strive to improve both ease of access for clients and service standards.
Quality of service is a never ending challenge in banking. With a strong brand, a
simple and cost-effective product, a conservative approach to credit and a healthy
capital adequacy position, the bank remains focussed on the financial needs of South Africans.

Dividend

The directors declared a final gross dividend of 680 cents per ordinary share on 
29 March 2016, bringing the total dividends for the year to 1 055 cents per share. The
interim dividend payment was increased to 36% of the total dividend from 29% last year.

There are 115 626 991 ordinary shares in issue.

The final dividend meets the definition of a dividend in terms of the Income Tax Act
(Act 58 of 1962). The dividend amount net of South African dividend tax of 15% is
578.00000 cents per share. The distribution is made from income reserves. Capitec's tax
reference number is 9405376840.

Post balance sheet event

On 10 August 2014, African Bank Limited was placed into curatorship. Capitec Bank is a
participant in a consortium that will underwrite the recapitalisation of African Bank.
The other members of the consortium comprise the Public Investment Corporation and five
other South African retail banks. The banks have a maximum exposure of R2.5 billion of
the recapitalisation. The participation level of each of the banks is based on a
formula agreed on between the banks. The recapitalisation occurred during March 2016.

Segment analysis

Capitec reports a single segment - retail banking, operating only within the South
African economic environment. The business is widely distributed with no reliance on
any major customers. The business sells a single retail banking product 'Global One'
that enables clients to transact, save and borrow.

Fair values

In terms of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', the fair value of loans and advances was
R38.2 billion (February 2015: R36.9 billion), deposits and bonds was R48.1 billion
(February 2015: R41.4 billion) and derivative assets was R225.4 million (February 2015:
R35.8 million asset; R22.1 million liability). The fair value of loans and advances was
calculated on a level 3 basis and deposits and bonds and derivative assets were
calculated on a level 2 basis. Investments designated at fair value are valued using
the market approach on a level 2 basis. The fair value of all other financial
instruments equates their carrying amount.

JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the
Companies Act applicable to summarised financial statements. The Listings Requirements
require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts
and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34

statements were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting
policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial
statements. All other standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 3% NON-REDEEMABLE,
NON-CUMULATIVE,   NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE  SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published its global regulatory framework for more
resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
in South Africa which came into effect on 1 January 2013.
Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the preference
share capital of Capitec contributed fully to the capital
adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of the
“grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel III,
the contribution of the preference shares to the
Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
annum. As from 1 January 2016, only 60% of the original
preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio.

In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
on 29 May 2015(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
under the general authority proposed to be granted by
shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
the provisions set out under the relevant special
resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
current general authority”).

Shareholders are hereby advised that, in addition to the
12.55% preference shares previously repurchased, as
advised to shareholders on 18 January 2016, the Company
has repurchased 75 616 preference shares, representing
3.30% of the issued preference share capital as at the
date of the current general authority to repurchase the
preference shares. The repurchase was made out of the
Company’s available cash resources. The total percentage
of preference shares repurchased to date in the 2016
  financial year amounts to 15.85%. The preference shares
  were repurchased for an aggregate value of R6 935 288.48.

25 February
2016

  The repurchases were made in terms of the general
  authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
  effected through the order book operated by the JSE
  trading system without any prior understanding or
  arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

  Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
  preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

  Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 95 335
  preference shares (4.15% of the preference shares in
  issue as at the date of the current general authority),
  in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
  until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
  the requirements of the Banks Act.

  As at the date of this announcement, the Company held 75
  616 preference shares in treasury.

  The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
  the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
  The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
  resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
  share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
  preference shares and interest earned on the cash
  utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

  OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

  The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
  repurchases and is of the opinion that:

  -   the Company and the Group will be able, in the
      ordinary course of business, to repay their debts for
      a period of 12 months after the date of this
      announcement;
  -   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
      will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
      the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
      after the date of this announcement;
  -   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
      reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
      business of the Company and the Group for a period of
      12 months after the date of this announcement; and
  -   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
      working capital for ordinary business purposes.

GENERAL REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 3% NON-REDEEMABLE,
NON-CUMULATIVE,   NON-PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE  SHARES
(“PREFERENCE SHARES”)

 In 2010 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
 published its global regulatory framework for more
 resilient banks and banking systems (“Basel III”). The
 Regulations relating to Banks were amended to provide,
 among other things, for the implementation of Basel III
 in South Africa which came into effect on 1 January 2013.
 Prior to the implementation of Basel III, the preference
 share capital of Capitec contributed fully to the capital
 adequacy ratio of the Company. As a result of the
 “grandfathering” provisions provided for in Basel III,
 the contribution of the preference shares to the
 Company’s capital adequacy ratio reduces by 10% per
 annum. As from 1 January 2016, only 60% of the original
 preference share capital contributed to Capitec’s capital
 adequacy ratio.

 In the notice of the Capitec annual general meeting held
 on 29 May 2015(“the AGM”), shareholders were advised that
 the board of the Company may resolve to repurchase
 preference shares due to the preference shares’ declining
 contribution to the Company’s capital adequacy ratio.
 Shareholders were further advised that any repurchases
 under the general authority proposed to be granted by
 shareholders, would be at market value in accordance with
 the provisions set out under the relevant special
 resolution. At the AGM, shareholders granted a general
 authority to the board of Capitec to repurchase up to 20%
 of the issued preference share capital of Capitec (“the
 current general authority”).

 Shareholders are hereby advised that, in addition to the
 9.55%   preference  shares  previously  repurchased,  as
 advised to shareholders on 6 November 2015, the Company
 has repurchased 68 865 preference shares, representing
 3.00% of the issued preference share capital as at the
 date of the current general authority to repurchase the
 preference shares. The repurchase was made out of the
 Company’s available cash resources. The total percentage
 of preference shares repurchased to date in the 2016
 financial year amounts to 12.55%. The preference shares
 were repurchased for an aggregate value of R6 118 712.18.

January
2016

 The repurchases were made in terms of the general
 authority granted by shareholders at the AGM, and were
 effected through the order book operated by the JSE
 trading system without any prior understanding or
 arrangement between the Company and the counterparties.

 Application will be made to the JSE to de-list the
 preference shares at which point they will be cancelled.

 Capitec is entitled to repurchase a further 170 951
 preference shares (7.45% of the preference shares in
 issue as at the date of the current general authority),
 in terms of the current general authority, which is valid
 until Capitec’s next annual general meeting, subject to
 the requirements of the Banks Act.

 As at the date of this announcement, the Company held
 48 074 preference shares in treasury.

 The impact of the repurchase of the preference shares on
 the financial information of the Company is immaterial.
 The preference shares were repurchased from excess cash
 resources of the Company; going forward, no preference
 share dividends will be payable on the repurchased
 preference shares and interest earned on the cash
 utilised for the repurchase will be foregone.

OPINION OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY

The board of Capitec has considered the effect of the
repurchases and is of the opinion that:

-   the Company and the Group will be able, in the
    ordinary course of business, to repay their debts for
    a period of 12 months after the date of this
    announcement;
-   the consolidated assets of the Company and the Group
    will be in excess of the consolidated liabilities of
    the Company and the Group for a period of 12 months
    after the date of this announcement;
-   the Company’s and the Group’s share capital and
    reserves will be adequate for the purposes of the
    business of the Company and the Group for a period of
    12 months after the date of this announcement; and
-   the Company and the Group will have sufficient
    working capital for ordinary business purposes.

STANDARD AND POOR’S UPDATE ON CAPITEC BANK’S CREDIT RATINGS
AND OUTLOOK

On 4 December 2015, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services
(“S&P”) revised its outlook on the Republic of South Africa
from stable to negative, reflecting a view of protracted
weak economic growth, with estimates of 1.4% GDP growth in
2015 and 1.6% in 2016. As a result, S&P has revised its
economic risk trend for South Africa from stable to
negative.

The effect is that the outlook on the bank’s global scale
long-term rating has been changed from stable to negative.
The global long-term ‘BB+’ and short-term ‘B’ ratings have
been affirmed. Simultaneously, the long-term national scale
rating of ‘zaA’ has been affirmed, and the short-term
national scale rating has been adjusted from ‘zaA-1’ to
‘zaA-2’, in line with S&P’s ratings criteria.
