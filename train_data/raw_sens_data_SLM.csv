The Group commenced the 2020 financial year from a solid base, with growth accelerating for most businesses in the second half of 2019. While recognising
that we would continue to face headwinds in some of our key markets in 2020 due to subdued economic growth, we remained confident in our ability to deliver
solid growth in all key performance indicators. This was achieved in the first two months of 2020, with most businesses outperforming targets for the period
by a healthy margin. However, the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, followed by the declaration of states of disaster and
emergency in a number of countries where we operate, abruptly transformed the operating environment into one of the most challenging periods faced by the
Group and our stakeholders. Despite these challenges we remain resilient as reflected in our underlying operational performance during the six months to 30
June 2020 and a healthy solvency position throughout the period. This resilience is founded on the quality of our client and other stakeholder
relationships, a superior strategic positioning, highly skilled and motivated employees and a generally prudent approach to managing our business.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R3,9 billion declined by 22% on the first six months of 2019, but increased by 18% excluding
the impact of COVID-19 on certain earnings components. Sanlam Personal Finance's net result from financial services decreased by 12%, but was up 2% excluding the 
COVID-19 impact, and up 6% also excluding the R70 million one-off prior year tax adjustment at Sanlam Personal Loans in 2019. Sanlam Emerging Markets' net result 
from financial services declined by 28% (up 27% excluding the impact of COVID-19). Sanlam Investment Group's net result from financial services decreased by 77% 
(up 4% excluding the COVID-19 credit impact), a particularly satisfactory performance under challenging conditions. Santam's net result from financial services
declined by 21% (more than doubling excluding the impact of COVID-19 on provisions). Sanlam Corporate achieved strong growth in net result from financial services
of 39%. The improvement in risk claims experience in the second half of 2019 persisted into 2020, driving a more than doubling in risk profits.

New business volumes increased by 40% under particularly difficult trading conditions. All clusters contributed strong growth, apart from Santam where large
specialist business written in the period resulted in an increase in the unearned premium and reinsurance reserves, reducing growth in net earned premiums
relative to gross written premiums. Life insurance new business volumes were in line with 2019, investment business inflows increased by 64% and general
insurance earned premiums increased by 6%. Overall net fund inflows of R33 billion in 2020 is a particularly satisfactory performance given the challenging
market conditions.

Shareholders are advised that the final cash dividend of 334 cents for the year ended 31 December 2019 was paid on Monday, 20 April 2020 by way of
electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in the register of Sanlam at close of business on Tuesday, 14 April 2020. Shareholders who have
not yet provided their banking details for dividend payments are requested to do so by contacting Sanlam's transfer secretary, Computershare, at 0861 100

ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IN RESPECT OF SANLAM’S THIRD
PARTY ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS


1. INTRODUCTION

   Sanlam shareholders (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement made on the Stock Exchange
   News Service (“SENS”) of the JSE Limited on 31 October 2018 when Sanlam announced its package of
   broad-based black economic empowerment (“B-BBEE”) transactions. As part of the package of B-BBEE
   transactions, Sanlam also announced that it was in the process of a reorganisation of its third party asset
   management business in order to enhance the competiveness and empowerment of the business.

   The board of directors of Sanlam (the “Sanlam Board”) is pleased to announce that agreement was
   reached in respect of a transaction to establish a leading South African black-owned asset management
   company (the “Transaction”). The Transaction will support Sanlam to grow and enhance its position in this
   important market, whilst also building on the Sanlam philosophy of mutually beneficial partnerships in
   pursuit of shareholder value creation.

   The Transaction will entail:
   (i)    the creation of a new investment holding company (“NewCo”), in which Sanlam will initially hold
          100%. NewCo will hold 100% of the interest in Sanlam Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited
          (“SIH”) which will, in turn, hold the Sanlam Investment Group’s interests in third-party asset
          management businesses in South Africa, other than the investment management business
          conducted by Sanlam Private Wealth Proprietary Limited and the Sanlam Specialised Finance
          division; and

   (ii)    African Rainbow Capital Financial Services Holdings Proprietary Limited (“ARC FS”) purchasing
           shares in NewCo which will give it an effective economic interest of 25% in SIH (the “ARC
           Transaction”).

   Sanlam will own the remaining economic interest in SIH and following implementation of the Transaction,
   the SIH shareholders may allow senior management of SIH to participate in up to 5% of the effective
   economic interest in SIH on market related commercial terms. This is a possible transaction and the details
   will be communicated in the future.

   The Transaction will result in a combined direct and indirect black economic interest in SIH in excess of
   51% in terms of the Amended Financial Sector Code.

   African Rainbow Capital Proprietary Limited (“ARC”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ubuntu-Botho
   Investments Proprietary Limited (“UBI”) which is a material shareholder in Sanlam and accordingly deemed
   a related party in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. ARC holds 50.1% in ARC FS.

2. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

   Promoting inclusive wealth creation in all of the markets where Sanlam operates is a key driver of Sanlam’s
   long-term prosperity and ability to create value for all stakeholders. In the South African context,
   institutional clients require participants in the financial services industry to contribute to inclusive wealth
   creation in a number of ways, including direct B-BBEE ownership. Within the asset management industry,
   empowerment credentials at the entity level where institutional investors transact, is an important
   consideration for clients when awarding business mandates. As a result, it is in Sanlam’s business and
   commercial interest to transform in line with the needs and preferences of its current and potential clients
   by creating a leading black-owned asset management business. Given the broad-based black
   shareholding of Sanlam’s B-BBEE partner, UBI, it will also benefit society by increased participation of
   these shareholders in the success of SIH.

   For Sanlam, the Transaction will contribute to the realisation of its strategy to protect and enhance its
   leadership position in South Africa through inter alia a leading empowerment status and appropriate
   partnerships. This will enhance the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of SIH, positioning it for
   future growth and enabling long term value creation for stakeholders. This is particularly relevant in the
   current challenging operating environment, which is likely to persist in the near term as the country
   recovers from the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

   Being South Africa’s leading black-owned asset manager, will position SIH favourably to attract strong
   institutional investment flows. Furthermore, this transaction will act as a catalyst to establish SIH as a
   strong independent asset manager and will create optionality to enhance the performance of the business
   over time through attracting affiliated managers. Sanlam and SIH therefore expect to realise significant
   synergies through attracting incremental flows to SIH and partnering with ARC FS on other value-accretive
   initiatives.

3. OVERVIEW OF ARC TRANSACTION

3.1. Background to ARC FS

   ARC FS, which is 50.1% owned by ARC and 49.9% owned by the ARC Fund; is the entity that holds all the
   financial services investments in the UBI Group other than the investment in Sanlam which is held directly
   by UBI. The strategic objective of ARC FS is to establish a black-controlled diversified financial services
   group with exposure to key sub-sectors in the financial services sector.

3.2. Price

   ARC FS will purchase shares in NewCo representing 25% of all shares in issue at a price calculated with
   reference to a base value of R787.5 million (the “ARC FS Base Value”). The ARC FS Base Value allows
   for a 25% minority and marketability/liquidity discount, which is appropriate for transactions of a similar
   nature. The ARC FS Base Value will be adjusted with a factor equal to the UBI Facility (see 3.3.below)
   funding rate up to the ARC Transaction effective date in order to determine the purchase price payable by
   ARC FS (the “ARC FS Purchase Price”).

   Based on an anticipated effective date of 1 December 2020, the expected maximum ARC FS Purchase
   Price would be R815.2 million at the current prevailing prime rate.

   If the assets under management of SIH decline by any amount or increase by more than 14% before the
   ARC Transaction effective date, either party may request an adjustment of the ARC FS Purchase Price. An
   adjustment will only be made if agreed and will be done in compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

3.3. Settlement of the ARC FS Purchase Price

   The ARC FS Purchase Price will be settled by ARC FS in part by utilising a portion of the preference share
   facility made available to UBI (“UBI Facility”), which was approved by Shareholders in December 2018, for
   up to 80% of the ARC FS Purchase Price, and from its own resources for the remaining portion.

3.4. Independent fairness opinion

    In terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements, the ARC Transaction is categorised as a small
    related party transaction.

    Accordingly, the Sanlam Board is required to provide the JSE with written confirmation from an
    independent professional expert confirming that the terms of the ARC Transaction are fair insofar as the
    Shareholders are concerned (the “Fairness Opinion”). A positive Fairness Opinion is one of the
    conditions to the ARC Transaction.

    In compliance with paragraph 10.7 (b) of the Listings Requirements, the Sanlam Board appointed BDO
    Corporate Finance (Pty) Ltd (“BDO”) as independent expert to provide it with the Fairness Opinion.

    BDO has furnished an opinion to the Sanlam Board confirming that the terms of the ARC Transaction are
    fair insofar as the Shareholders are concerned. This opinion has been provided to the JSE.

    The opinion of BDO will be available for inspection at Sanlam’s registered office, 2 Strand Road, Bellville,
    Cape Town, 7530, for a period of 28 days from the release of this announcement. It will also be made
    available during this period on request from Sanlam’s Company Secretary. Please email request to Sana-
    Ullah.Bray@sanlam.co.za.

3.5. Conditions and other key terms to the ARC Transaction

    In addition to receipt of a positive Fairness Opinion, the ARC Transaction is subject to certain suspensive
    conditions, including (but not limited to) approvals from the relevant regulatory authorities (including the
    Prudential Authority).

    The definitive transaction agreements to give effect to the ARC Transaction contain warranties and
    indemnities customary for transactions of their nature. The definitive agreements include a shareholders'
    agreement in respect of NewCo which incorporates non-compete undertakings given by ARC FS to
    NewCo and SIH, reserved matters in respect of which shareholders will need to agree and customary pre-
    emptive rights and deemed offer provisions.

3.6. Independent Committee Recommendation

    The Sanlam Board established the Committee of Independent Non-Executive Directors, comprising of all
    non-executive Directors who are independent of Sanlam and UBI, to evaluate matters involving the
    Company and the UBI Group which may give rise to conflicts of interest. Following their consideration of
    these matters in the context of the Transaction, they recommended to the Sanlam Board that Sanlam
    enter into the ARC Transaction. The chairman of the Committee of Independent Non-Executive Directors
    is Mr. E Masilela.

4. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION

   As per the latest audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 prepared in terms of
   IFRS, the segmental net result from financial services for the period was R352 million. SIH’s contribution to
   the consolidated Sanlam Group net asset value was R348 million.
   The net proceeds of the ARC Transaction will be received on the effective date of the ARC Transaction.
   Sanlam would seek to reinvest such proceeds to support its broader strategy including that of SIH.

   Sanlam will consolidate its effective economic interest in NewCo and SIH.

5. EFFECTIVE DATE

   The effective date of the ARC Transaction will be dependent on the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions
   to the Transaction and is expected to occur during the last quarter of 2020.

Trading Statement – 2020 Interim Results

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam is currently compiling its interim results for the
six months ended 30 June 2020. This trading statement provides an indication of a
range for headline earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to
equity holders of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. Sanlam's interim results will be released on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) on Thursday, 10 September
2020.

As communicated to shareholders in the Group’s operational update released on
Wednesday, 10 June 2020, the operating environment across the Group’s footprint
deteriorated substantially since the end of February 2020 as governments implemented
strict measures to control the spread of Covid-19. These included the declaration of
states of disaster and emergency in a number of countries where we operate, involving
severe limitations on people movement and economic activity. Global growth estimates
were revised down sharply, including for all of the Group’s key markets. This, together
with persistent uncertainty around the eventual impact of Covid-19, drove significant
volatility in equity, interest rate and currency markets. These conditions continue to
impact on the Group’s results for 2020.

Despite the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the Group’s earnings for the six months to
30 June 2020 as outlined in this trading statement, the Group’s operations remained
resilient and the Group sustained its strong capital position. The Group solvency cover
ratio exceeded 180% at 30 June 2020 with the ratio remaining well within our target
range throughout the worst of the recent market turbulence. Sanlam Life Insurance
Limited’s solvency cover ratio at 30 June 2020 was well in excess of the 253% ratio
reported at 31 December 2019. Funding levels of the participating policyholder
portfolios also remain sound.

Net operational earnings for the six months to 30 June 2020 were adversely impacted
by the following:

•   Lower investment-related fee income at Sanlam Investment Group and Sanlam
    Personal Finance as a result of negative investment market returns in the first half of
    2020, which depressed average assets under management and participating fee
    income.
•   Marked-to-market losses at Sanlam Specialised Finance due to a widening in
    corporate credit spreads, which, in the absence of defaults, will reverse in future
    reporting periods.                                                                                  
•   Increased doubtful debt provisioning at Sanlam Specialised Finance and the
    Group’s retail credit businesses, attributable to the deteriorating economic
    environment, continued restrictions on economic activity and pressure on clients’
    disposable income.
•   Negative investment return earned on insurance funds held by the Sanlam
    Emerging Markets general insurance businesses, in line with the downturn in equity
    markets.
•   Support of some R1 billion provided by Santam to clients with contingent business
    interruption cover.
•   Negative net investment return earned on the capital portfolio reflects the weaker
    equity market performance and additional expected credit losses recognised in
    terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 in respect of rising
    sovereign credit risk in Lebanon.

Net operational earnings are therefore expected to decline by between 35% and 45%.
Unrealised losses due to fair value changes and increases in doubtful debt provisions
account for a major part of this reduction in earnings. Some of this may reverse over
time.

Despite the decline in net operational earnings, HEPS are expected to increase by
between 5% and 15% compared to the first six months of 2019, supported by the
following:

•   The one-off IFRS 2 charge of R1.7 billion recognised in 2019 in respect of the share
    issuance to the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment special purpose
    vehicle (B-BBEE SPV).
•   A turnaround in fund transfers relating to the treatment of Sanlam shares held in
    policyholder portfolios as treasury shares, the consolidation of the Sanlam
    Foundation and B-BBEE SPV, and the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect
    of assessed losses in policyholder funds, from a net loss in 2019 to a net profit in the
    first half of 2020.

These items recognised in terms of IFRS represent non-economical profits and losses
for the shareholders’ fund, which are excluded from net operational earnings but
included in headline earnings.

Given the significant uncertainty around the eventual outcome of Covid-19 and the
trajectory of economic recovery, a prudent approach was applied in valuing the Group
operations at 30 June 2020. This resulted in generally lower valuations and
necessitated an impairment of the carrying values of certain operations. In addition to
the HEPS impact highlighted above, earnings attributable to equity holders of the
company for the six months ended 30 June 2020 will therefore also be affected by
these impairment charges. The following key assumptions were adjusted:

•   Non-life businesses
    o Economic assumptions were revised downwards in the current uncertain
      environment, in respect of both economic growth forecasts and future investment
      returns. This affected the valuations of the investment management,
      administration and SEM general insurance operations.
    o Top-line growth was reduced across the board for non-life operations, through
      lower net fund inflow assumptions for investment management businesses and
      lower premium/fee income growth at other businesses.                                                                                 
  o The valuation of the non-life operations in Lebanon was reduced to zero as a
      meaningful economic recovery, as well the potential to repatriate profits, is not
      expected in the foreseeable future.
  o Most of the premium paid for synergies as part of the Saham Finances
      acquisition has been written off. Realisation of the synergies will take longer than
      originally anticipated due to the slowdown in economic growth across the Saham
      Finances footprint as a result of Covid-19. We remain confident that the
      synergies can be realised, but decided to rather allow these to emerge as
      positive future experience variances.
  o The valuation of Shriram Capital in India was reduced in line with the lower listed
      share prices of Shriram Transport Finance Company and Shriram City Union
      Finance.
• Life insurance business
  o Persistency assumptions were strengthened at 30 June 2020. Despite no
      noticeably poorer persistency experience in the first half of 2020, it is anticipated
      that rising unemployment and increasing pressure on disposable income in
      South Africa may result in adverse persistency in future periods.
  o The valuation of the life insurance business in Lebanon was reduced to zero in
      line with the non-life operations.

The lower valuations resulted in an impairment of intangible assets recognised in
respect of the Saham Finances acquisition (circa R5.8 billion) and the equity-accounted
carrying value of Shriram Capital (circa R1.8 billion). These contributed the bulk of total
impairments of circa R7.8 billion to be recognised in the six months to 30 June 2020.
Foreign currency translation gains in respect of these investments, which are
recognised directly against equity, however limited the overall reduction in net asset
value to circa R1.5 billion.

Impairment charges are excluded from HEPS and only affect EPS. EPS are
commensurately expected to decline by more than 100% compared to the first six
months of 2019. Impairment charges do not impact on cash earnings and therefore the
Group’s dividend payment capability.

Shareholders are advised that the Group expects HEPS and EPS for the six months
ended 30 June 2020 to fall within the following ranges:


                            6 months to           6 months to            6 months to

Operational Update – June 2020

The Group had a solid start to the 2020 financial year as communicated to shareholders
in the Covid-19 update released on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service in March
2020. Most of the operational trends experienced in the second half of 2019 persisted in
the first two months of 2020. The operating environment, however, deteriorated
substantially since the end of February 2020 as governments implemented strict
measures to control the spread of Covid-19. These included the declaration of states of
disaster and emergency in a number of countries where we operate, involving severe
limitations on people movement and preventing face-to-face sales in most of our
businesses. These were in line with similar measures implemented globally. Global
growth estimates were revised down sharply, driving significant volatility in investment
markets across the world.

Despite these headwinds, we achieved acceptable results for the four months to 30
April 2020, testimony to the resilience afforded by our diversified operations and the
skills and exemplary dedication of our employees under difficult conditions.

The Group responded rapidly to the lockdown enforced in South Africa, our largest
market, from midnight 26 March 2020 as well as the lockdowns and curfews
implemented around the same time in our other markets. Close to 90% of our office
staff were enabled to work effectively from home. We will continue to carefully manage
employees returning to work in line with the amendments to lockdown levels, with the
health and safety of our staff being the priority. Our aim is for the majority of our
employees to continue to work from home for the foreseeable future to reduce the risk
of infection and to prepare the business for a new way of work post Covid-19.

Our designation as an essential service in South Africa excludes our tied and
independent advisors in line with the measures in our other markets. As a result, new
business volumes were significantly impacted since the last week of March in the
absence of face-to-face sales. Our investment in digital businesses such as MiWay and
Sanlam Indie, as well as digital sales tools for our advisors, alleviated this pressure to
some extent. The available digital sales tools are, however, more targeted at the
middle-income and affluent market segments. The Sanlam Sky intermediated
distribution channel and many of our other emerging markets channels are still
predominantly based on personal interaction, with a commensurately more pronounced
negative impact on new business sales in these areas. Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF)
accelerated the development of digital tools for Sanlam Sky, which will be launched in
the near future. Accelerated digital enablement is also a key focus for Sanlam Emerging
                                                                                 
Markets (SEM). The slowdown in economic activity following the introduction of the
lockdowns places further pressure on new business growth potential.

The key investment markets where we operate followed global trends, recording
negative returns across the board. Long-term interest rates in South Africa increased
substantially, while reference interest rates in our other key markets were more stable.

The investment market volatility impacted our financial results in four main areas:

•   Investment related fee income at Sanlam Investment Group (SIG) and SPF were
    suppressed by negative investment market returns and commensurately lower
    assets under management.
•   Increasing credit spreads and volatility in the share prices of listed preference
    shares are reflected in marked-to-market losses at Sanlam Specialised Finance
    (SanFin).
•   Credit risk is rising as a result of the deteriorating economic environment, requiring
    an increase in corporate credit provisioning at SanFin.
•   Investment return earned on insurance funds at SEM’s general insurance
    businesses in Africa was adversely affected by negative investment market returns.

Investment return earned on the Group’s capital portfolios were also affected, but this
was to a large extent alleviated by the hedging strategy in place in the South African life
insurance capital portfolio as well as foreign currency translation gains from the weaker
Rand exchange rate.
                                                                                   
The weaker average Rand exchange rates did not have an overall material impact on
the Group’s operational earnings for the four-month period due to offsetting positive and
negative foreign currency translation differences. The latter primarily relates to the
negative investment return on insurance funds in SEM and the weaker Angolan
Kwanza.

Earnings

Net result from financial services declined by 21% on the first four months of the 2019
financial year. Excluding the negative investment market impact highlighted above, net
result from financial services increased by a pleasing 13%.

o SPF’s net result from financial services declined by 13%. This is largely attributable
  to lower income from life investment products in Glacier where the business shares
  in the actual return earned on the underlying portfolios (refer table above). Excluding
  this, net result from financial services increased by 5%. Risk profits in the Recurring
  Premium business increased strongly, supported by growth in the size of the book
  as well as continued positive claims experience. No Covid-19 mortality claims have
  been received up to the end of April 2020. A small number of sickness benefit
  claims were lodged. The Glacier LISP platform also performed well, with the decline
  in investment markets more than offset by strong net fund inflows. Lower investment
  markets suppressed fee income in the Savings business, contributing to only
  marginal earnings growth. Sanlam Sky experienced a decline in net result from
  financial services, attributable to Covid-19 support to advisers, higher new business
  strain and negative expense assumption changes. The latter two relate to higher
  assumed acquisition and maintenance unit cost due to the negative impact of Covid-
  19 on new business volumes and expected in-force units at the end of 2020.
  Sanlam Personal Loans increased its bad debt provisions by some R50 million
  (Sanlam’s share after tax) to allow for increased credit risk under prevailing
  conditions.

o The decline in equity markets and lower valuations for unlisted properties in North
  West Africa adversely affected investment return earned on SEM’s general
  insurance funds in Africa (refer table above) due to the approximate 40% and 30%
  respective exposures to equities and properties in the portfolio. This more than
  offset an otherwise satisfactory performance. Net result from financial services                                                                               
   declined by 27% as a result. Excluding the general insurance float returns in Africa,
   net result from financial services increased by 29%. Life insurance earnings from the
   Africa portfolio declined slightly on 2019, with satisfactory growth in Botswana,
   Namibia and Nigeria countered by negative investment variances in North West
   Africa. The African general insurance portfolio had a good start to the year from an
   underwriting perspective, achieving a margin within the 5% to 9% target range. All
   key markets delivered improved performances compared to 2019. The negative
   return on insurance funds, however, contributed to an overall negative net insurance
   margin for the four-month period. The Other international region achieved overall
   strong growth. All major businesses in the region contributed to the performance,
   including continued strong profit growth from Shriram General Insurance. It should
   be noted that Sanlam reports the Shriram Capital results with a three-month lag.
   The impact of Covid-19 and regulations in India that allows credit clients a 6-month
   repayment holiday therefore does not yet reflect in these results.

o SIG’s contribution to net result from financial services decreased by 134% (up 19%
  excluding the impact of investment market volatility on SanFin as highlighted
  above). The asset management and wealth management businesses achieved
  sterling growth of 20% despite the pressure on assets under management (the
  average JSE/FTSE Swix index was 10% lower in the first four months of 2020
  compared to the same period in 2019). Earnings benefited from increased
  performance fees, strong net fund inflows at Sanlam Multi Manager and Satrix
  towards the end of 2019 and start of 2020, high demand for currency, equity
  protection and bond derivatives at Sanlam Structured Solutions, increased
  brokerage income at Sanlam Private Wealth and stringent expense management.
  SanFin experienced a decline in net result from financial services from R82 million in
  2019 to a loss of R350 million in 2020, due to rising credit spreads and marked-to-
  marked losses on listed preference shares (refer above), as well as additional credit-
  related provisions of R175 million after tax as credit risk rose in the wake of
  deteriorating economic conditions. The latter includes the first default of R100 million
  net of taxation. In terms of the Group’s accounting policies, 50% of the movement in
  credit spreads in 2020 was transferred to the asset mismatch reserve held in
  respect of non-participating policyholder business. This portion of the movement in
  spreads is attributed to changes in illiquidity premiums that should reverse over
  time. In line with the asset mismatch reserves held in respect of SPF and Sanlam
  Corporate, the SanFin asset mismatch reserve is recognised in future earnings at a
  rate of 16% per annum.

o Santam’s earnings for the period were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. A
  number of claims for Events Cancellation and Travel Insurance were covered in
  terms of its policies and are in the process of being settled in line with the policy
  conditions. A small minority of commercial and corporate policyholders have cover
  that includes protection against contagious or infectious diseases. This cover is
  provided under either the Contingent Business Interruption (CBI) or the Cancellation
  of Bookings sections of their policies. CBI insurance covers the interruption of a
  business as a result of a localised outbreak of a contagious or infectious disease
  that has directly impacted the business’s operations and caused a loss. Losses as a
  result of governmental restrictions on activity, such as a national lockdown, or the
  existence of a global pandemic, are however not covered. This view is in line with
  the majority of counterparts and reinsurers in the general insurance industry, both                                                                                 
   locally and globally. Provisions for claims from these policies were raised based on
   best estimates of the exposures; however, given the lockdown and the complex
   nature of these claims, significant uncertainty exists over the quantum of the claims
   provisions.

   The lockdown resulted in an otherwise very subdued claims environment for the
   month of April 2020, notably impacting the motor class of business. Santam and
   MiWay respectively provided premium refunds and discounts on motor policies as
   well as other premium relief support to personal and commercial policyholders
   amounting to R327 million. Support of R42 million is also provided to SMME and
   other suppliers.

   Despite these discounts, pressure on top line growth in the current environment and
   the Covid-19 provisions, Santam’s conventional business still managed to achieve
   an underwriting margin at the midpoint of its 4% to 8% target range.

o The management actions implemented by Sanlam Corporate in the past 18 months
  in respect of the repricing of loss-making schemes and improved claims
  management continued to yield positive results, with Group Risk profit reflecting a
  major improvement on the comparable four-month period in 2019. Sanlam
  Corporate’s net result from financial services increased by a particularly satisfactory
  34% as a result.

Net operational earnings decreased by 26%. This is the combined effect of the 21%
decline in net result from financial services and a combined decrease in net investment
return and project expenses from R633 million in the first four months of 2019 to R320
million in 2020. As indicated above, net investment return on capital was shielded from
the full impact of the investment market downturn by hedging strategies applied to the
South African life capital portfolio and foreign currency translation gains.

Headline earnings increased by 40% (44% increase in diluted headline earnings per
share). The decrease in net operational earnings was more than offset by a low 2019
comparative base, which included the one-off accounting cost of R1.7 billion recognised
in terms of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 2 in respect of the B-
BBEE share issuance. Excluding the IFRS 2 charge from the comparative base,
headline earnings declined by 22%.

Business volumes

New business volumes of R96 billion increased by 33% on the first four months of the
2019 financial year. The lockdowns and curfews imposed since the end of March 2020
and throughout April had a significant adverse impact on new business sales
performance. This is reflecting in the table below, which expresses new business sales
in April 2020 as a percentage of the average monthly new business written in the first
three months of 2020. At a Sanlam Group level, overall new business volumes in April
2020 were 12% lower than the average for the three months to 31 March 2020. Sanlam
Corporate was the most severely affected cluster as trustee activity largely stalled in the
first few weeks of the lockdown. The level of engagement and quotes found some
traction recently. The impact of the lockdowns and curfews are not yet fully reflecting in
these results due to timing differences between the writing and recognition of new                                                                                
business. New business production in April and May were in general between 50% and
70% lower than targets across many businesses. Sanlam Sky was more severely
impacted as highlighted before, with new business sales some 90% lower than target.

Sanlam Group                                       88%

o   Overall new business volumes at SPF increased by a healthy 18% in the first four
    months of 2020.

    Sanlam Sky new business sales grew by 19%, supported by Capitec Bank funeral
    business, a good start to the year for group recurring business and R37 million of
    new business sales contributed by African Rainbow Life. The lockdown since the
    end of March 2020 had a severe impact on the traditional individual life
    intermediated channel, which is primarily focused on worksites and face-to-face
    sales. New business volumes through this channel declined by 5%, with a further
    deterioration expected in the months to follow.

    The Recurring Premium sub cluster, primarily focused on the middle-income market,
    reflects the pressure on disposable income in this market segment, aggravated by
    the Covid-19 lockdown. New business volumes increased by 1%, with strong growth
    at BrightRock, Sanlam Indie and MiWay Life largely offset by lower sales of
    traditional risk and savings solutions.

    Glacier grew its new business sales by 19%, benefiting from sound demand for
    traditional life annuities, living annuities and international products. Glacier’s money
    market fund also experienced favourable demand.

o   SEM recorded overall new business growth of 43%. The African general insurance
    portfolio exceeded its budget for the period, which allows for a more muted growth
    target as focus remains on the quality of new business. This includes the non-
    renewal of loss-making schemes that cannot be repriced appropriately. Life
    insurance and investment new business volumes in Africa increased markedly on
    2019, with the latter benefiting from large new mandates in Kenya and Namibia.
    North West and East Africa were the main contributors to the growth in new life                                                                                  
    business. The Other international region achieved double-digit growth in life and
    general insurance business, exceeding targets for the period. Shriram Life and
    General Insurance continued to contribute strong growth. Pacific&Orient achieved
    reasonable results under difficult circumstances, as was the case in Lebanon, where
    the country is facing major economic and political challenges. MCIS in Malaysia had
    a slow start to the year, with the mix of business also changing to lower margin
    group business.

o   New business volumes at SIG increased by 42%, with the value of new mandates
    awarded to the South African Investment Management business increasing by 33%,
    while Wealth Management delivered more than double the 2019 level of new
    business. New business at the International businesses exceeded expectations and
    rose by 59%.

o The lockdown and economic slowdown negatively impacted premium growth at
  Santam. Despite these conditions, satisfactory growth in gross written premium was
  achieved, excluding the premium relief noted above. The Santam Commercial and
  Personal intermediated business continued to experience strained growth in the
  current economic climate exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19 on new business
  acquisition in April 2020. The Santam Specialist business reported strong growth in
  the corporate property and engineering businesses, while the growth in the travel
  insurance, aviation, transport and marine businesses were negatively impacted by
  Covid-19 in March and April 2020. MiWay maintained its positive growth momentum
  up to the start of the lockdown, after which new business growth was negatively
  affected. Santam Re continued to expand its third-party business and foreign
  currency premium growth benefited from the weakening Rand.

o   Sanlam Corporate achieved 68% growth in new business volumes for the four
    months to April 2020 despite a marked slowdown in April 2020 due to the Covid-19
    lockdown. Sales were, however, skewed towards low margin business.

o   Net VNB decreased by 22% (down 18% on a constant economic basis) largely due
    to lower new life business sales during the lockdown periods, with the higher margin
    businesses such as Sanlam Sky more severely affected. Lower forecasted volumes
    for the full-year increased allowance for acquisition and maintenance unit costs in
    the year-to-date VNB calculations. VNB margins declined commensurately.

o   Overall net fund inflows of R14 billion were 17% lower than the R16 billion achieved
    in the comparable four-month period in 2019. Net inflows at SIG declined due to
    some large client withdrawals, while all other clusters experienced higher net
    inflows.

o   No marked changes in persistency trends were experienced in the first four months
    of 2020.

Capital and solvency

The Group remains well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital Requirement
(SCR) cover ratio amounted to 201% on 31 March 2020 (Sanlam Life Insurance
Limited: 269%). The reduction in the Group cover level from 211% as at 31 December
                                                                                
2019 is largely reflective of the adverse investment market returns in 2020, which
depressed funding levels in the smoothed bonus and participating annuity portfolios.
Funding levels for the larger portfolios were between 84% and 94% at 31 March 2020
but has since recovered to between 92% and 101% in line with the recovery in global
investment markets.

Discretionary capital increased slightly from end-December 2019 to some R360 million,
with no significant movements in the first four months of the year. Future generation of
discretionary capital will be sufficient to fund any planned bolt-on acquisitions.
SEM announced at the beginning of June that it acquired the remaining stake in the
Nigerian insurance business FBN Insurance from its partner, FBN Holdings Plc
(FBNH). This gives the Group 100% ownership of FBN Insurance Limited (FBNI) and
its subsidiary, FBN General Insurance Limited. FBNH held 65% of FBN Insurance,
while Sanlam held 35%. The effective date for Sanlam taking full control of FBN
Insurance was 1 June 2020. The acquisition price was funded from available debt
capacity to further enhance the return on the investment. This is not a categorised
transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

This transaction is in line with our business strategy to deepen our presence in our
existing markets and highlights and enhances our long-standing commitment to the
Nigerian market. Sanlam exercised its pre-emptive right to acquire the remaining
shareholding of FBNI and in line with our partnership philosophy that underpins our
business model, we will introduce local shareholding at an appropriate time in the
future. The transaction reflects our belief and confidence in the value and future of the
business as well as the skilled management team and staff. Moreover, we are
committed to Nigeria and view it as a key market on the continent. The African
continent as a whole remains important and an integral part of Sanlam’s future growth.

Outlook

We continue to actively manage the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our
priority remains the health and safety of our employees. We are also providing support
to our clients, intermediaries and vulnerable suppliers across our businesses.

The impact of the pandemic on the communities and economies where we operate can
only be managed effectively through concerted efforts between government, business
and labour organisations. We are actively providing our support through the relevant
business associations. In addition, we have to date contributed more than R200 million
to solidarity and other Covid-19 relief funds across our footprint.

We are well positioned to weather the headwinds with a robust balance sheet and
solvency position, diversification across geographies, lines of business and market
segments, and an admirable depth of skills in our businesses as well as at a Board
level. Paul Hanratty and Abigail Mukhuba joining Sanlam as Chief Executive and
Financial Director respectively will further add to the years of experience at an
executive level.
                                                                               
We are, however, cautious about prospects for the remainder of the 2020 financial year
given uncertainty around the eventual impact of Covid-19. The position remains fluid,
but the gradual lifting of lockdown requirements in a number of markets, including South
Africa, should provide some relief to economic activity. Average investment market
levels, credit spread movements, potential credit defaults, the relative strength of the
Rand exchange rate, the level of long-term interest rates and the level of new business
production are some of the key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net
result from financial services, headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported
for the six months to 30 June 2020 and the 2020 full year. Potentially lower valuations
of strategic investments at the end of June 2020 may also require impairment of
intangible assets in terms of IFRS.

o New business growth potential and persistency risk remain under pressure in the
  context of anticipated deep economic recessions in many markets as well as
  continued limitations on engagement opportunities for our advisors after the end of
  April 2020. The current level of new business growth is therefore not expected to
  continue with downside risk to VNB.

o Investment market volatility is also likely to persist that may, together with rising
  corporate and retail credit risk from the economic fallout, further suppress earnings.

o The eventual claims experience from Covid-19 also remains uncertain, both at
  Santam as well as our life insurance operations. Our pandemic reserve of some
  R760 million is available to absorb any increased claims due to Covid-19 at the life
  insurance businesses.

WITHDRAWAL OF RESOLUTIONS 5.2 AND 7.2 OF THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Shareholders are referred to the Notice of Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) issued on 13
March 2020 and, in particular, Ordinary Resolutions 5.2 and 7.2.

Sanlam advises that it has withdrawn Ordinary Resolution 5.2 (“Re-Election of PB Hanratty as
a non-executive director”) and Ordinary Resolution 7.2 (“The Appointment of PB Hanratty as a
member of the Audit Committee”). The reason and effect for withdrawing the aforementioned
two resolutions are due to Mr Hanratty being appointed as the Group CEO, subsequent to
preparing and issuing the Notice of AGM. To this end, he ceases to be an independent non-
executive director with effect from 11 June 2020 as he prepares to assume his new role as
executive director on 01 July 2020. Noteworthy to highlight, is that Sanlam continues to comply
with the requirement relating to one-third of directors who have been proposed for rotation.

All other agenda items for the Annual General Meeting remain unchanged and will be put to
Shareholders for approval on 10 June 2020 at 14h00 following the Virtual Meeting process.
Shareholders are herewith advised that the withdrawal of Ordinary Resolutions 5.2 and 7.2
from the AGM, does not affect the proxy forms already submitted in respect of the remainder
resolutions. An amended proxy form has been uploaded onto the Sanlam website.

REPURCHASE, CANCELLATION AND DELISTING OF TREASURY SHARES

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam has repurchased 116,363,639 ordinary shares of 1 cent
each held in treasury by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanlam Life Insurance Limited (“Sanlam
Life”) (“Treasury Shares”) at a repurchase price of R56,29 per share (in aggregate
R6,550,109,239) (the “Repurchase”).

The Repurchase was executed in accordance with the requirements of Section 48 of the
Companies Act No. 71 of 2008.

The Treasury Shares were acquired by Sanlam Life in terms of general authorities to repurchase
shares approved by Sanlam shareholders during the annual general meetings held on 7 June
2006, 6 June 2007, 4 June 2008, 3 June 2009, 9 June 2010 and 8 June 2011 respectively
(“General Authorities”). Following the Repurchase, the Company applied to the JSE Limited
(“JSE”) for the cancellation and delisting of the Treasury Shares and accordingly, the Treasury
Shares will be cancelled and delisted on the JSE from commencement of business on 18 May
2020.

The Repurchase constitutes a transfer to, and subsequent cancellation of the Treasury Shares
previously acquired by Sanlam Life pursuant to the General Authorities and is cash neutral for the
Sanlam Group.

The Treasury Shares represented 4,97% of the issued share capital of the Company immediately
prior to their cancellation. Following the cancellation, the issued share capital of the Company now
comprises 2,226,974,408 ordinary shares of 1 cent each.

The Sanlam Group notes the recommendations outlined in the Joint Communication 1 of 2020
issued by the Prudential Authority and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority on 16 April 2020
(“Joint Communication”), in particular, the expectations that consideration be given to the
temporarily suspension of discretionary dividend distributions, including share buybacks and cash
bonuses to executives. The Repurchase will not result in any cash flow to any holders of Sanlam
shares outside of the Sanlam Group and has no impact on the Sanlam Group’s solvency position.

The Sanlam Group remains solvent and liquid and well capitalised. The board will take the Joint
Communication into account in its future deliberations.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Sanlam Group’s auditors.

Planning Commission, and Chair of several influential entities in South Africa, namely V&A

Operational update: COVID-19 pandemic

COVID-19 has spread at an alarming rate since its outbreak, being declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organisation. Government and central bank responses
globally have been unprecedented to limit the impact of the virus on public health and to
stem the unavoidable consequences for economic growth. These events contributed to
investment market turmoil not seen since the global financial crisis.

The JSE recently issued guidance in South Africa, requesting that shareholders and other
stakeholders be informed of the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of listed
companies. In line with this guidance and our transparent communication approach, this
update provides information in respect of Sanlam’s financial performance for the first two
months of the 2020 financial year as well as the possible impact of COVID-19 on Sanlam’s
operations and financial position.


RESULTS FOR THE TWO MONTHS ENDED 29 FEBRUARY 2020

Consistent with performance trends in the second half of 2019, the Group had a pleasing
start to the 2020 financial year, with strong growth in most key performance indicators
compared to the first two months of 2019:

•   Net result from financial services increased by more than 10%.

    o All clusters contributed strong growth, apart from Sanlam Personal Finance whose
      operating earnings were impacted by increased new business strain and lower
      earnings at Glacier. The decline in investment markets in the first two months of
      2020 had a negative effect on Glacier’s market-related earnings from products in
      which it shares in the actual investment return earned on the underlying portfolio.
    o The widening of credit spreads related to the COVID-19 outbreak detracted from
      Sanlam Investment Group’s earnings; the overall cluster however still achieved
      solid growth.
    o The underwriting margin of the former Saham general insurance portfolio showed
      pleasing improvement compared to the 2019 full-year results, augmented by higher
      return on insurance funds.

•   New business volumes increased by more than 30%. All lines of business reflect strong
    double-digit growth.

    o All clusters achieved very strong growth, with a welcome improvement in
      investment business flows at Sanlam Emerging Markets and Sanlam Investment
      Group’s international business.
    o Apart from Lebanon, the former Saham portfolio continued to perform in line with
      expectations.

•   The net value of new covered business (VNB) written increased by some 5% on 2019.

    o Sanlam Personal Finance achieved strong growth, which was partly offset by lower
      contributions from Namibia, Cote d’Ivoire and Morocco (change in mix of business
      and lower margins) and Sanlam Corporate (slower start to the year than 2019 in
      recurring premium life business).

COVID-19 OPERATIONAL IMPACT

The operating environment deteriorated substantially since the end of February 2020 as
governments implemented strict measures to control the spread of the virus. Global growth
estimates were revised down sharply (a global recession is now predicted by most
economists), driving the significant downturn in global investment markets.

The impact on Sanlam’s operations is summarised below, based on investment market
indicators as at close of business 25 March 2020. Sanlam remains well capitalised and
resilient despite the volatile conditions we are facing. This is an outcome of our prudent
reserving basis and capital management philosophy, well-embedded and appropriate risk
management processes, as well as our diversification across geographies, market
segments and lines of business. Shareholders are reminded that conditions remain fluid
and uncertain. The financial position reflected in this announcement will consequently
change over time.

Business continuity

States of disaster and emergency have been implemented in a number of countries,
involving limitations on people movement, with a number of countries imposing lockdowns.
South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Cote d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Malaysia, India and the United
Kingdom are some of the markets where Sanlam operates that are currently under some
form of lockdown.

The majority of business units within the Sanlam Group have completed their pandemic
response plans, aimed at protecting the health and safety of all staff. The main focus of
these plans includes:

•   Compliance with regulatory restrictions on the movement of people;
•   Emphasis on personal hygiene;
•   Employee distancing techniques in work environments;
•   Limitations around international and domestic travel;
•   Maximum use of remote working;
•   Self-isolation where staff have travelled or might have been exposed to the virus;
•   Access control measures dealing with visitors to worksites; and
•   Continuous communication to staff, clients and other stakeholders.

Most of Sanlam’s operations in South Africa, including Santam, has been classified as
essential services. During the lockdown period, the Group will operate on a limited staff
basis, with only core critical staff on site. We should therefore be able to service our
clients, albeit not at the usual levels of service. Sanlam Emerging Markets’ operations are
also operating at limited capacity where restrictions on movement is in place. The ability to
write new business is affected, as elaborated on in the Outlook section below.

The following table reflects year-to-date movements in the key market indicators that has

The market movements experienced in March are similar to the economic shock scenario
disclosed in Sanlam’s annual financial statements for solvency sensitivity analyses. The
shock scenario includes a 30% decline in equities, a 25% increase in interest rates and a
20% devaluation of emerging market currencies against developed market currencies.

Solvency

Sanlam Life Insurance Limited (Sanlam Life) is the largest life insurance company in the
Group and the most significant contributor to Group solvency.

The capital portfolio backing Sanlam Life’s R8 billion required capital is invested in zero
cost collars. The investment market volatility therefore did not have a significant impact on
the value of the portfolio. Pricing to roll the derivatives has, however, deteriorated
significantly. As a result, maturing tranches are currently being rolled into cash, which will
continue in the near term.

The decline in investment markets had a muted impact on Sanlam Life’s Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio. This is attributable to the protection provided by the zero
cost collars in the capital portfolio as well as the change in the equity symmetrical
adjustment allowed for in the SCR calculation, which dampens the impact of severe
investment market volatility. This is in particular the case for the solo entity (regulatory)
SCR cover, where the Sanlam Life participations (investments in subsidiaries and
associates) provide stability to the solvency ratio. The Sanlam Life solo solvency cover is
estimated at 258% on 25 March 2020 compared to 253% at 31 December 2019. The
estimate is based on the year-end sensitivity analysis.

The Sanlam Life internal view is used for management purposes, as it represents Sanlam
Life’s contribution to Group Solvency. It is based on the R8 billion of required capital
allocated to the Sanlam Life covered business and excludes the value of participations,
any excess capital held on the Sanlam Life balance sheet as well as cash held for dividend
payments. A target SCR cover ratio of 170% to 210% has been set for the internal view. At
the lower end of the target range (170%), Sanlam Life can withstand at least two economic
shocks (refer key features of economic shock above) without breaching the minimum SCR
cover ratio of 100%. The internal view SCR cover ratio amounted to 206% at 31 December
2019, at the upper end of the target range. It is estimated at 188% on 25 March 2020, well
within the target range. The estimate is based on the year-end sensitivity analysis.

Solvency levels within the other Group subsidiaries remained at appropriate levels, given
the relatively larger exposure to cash and fixed-interest securities within these businesses.

Portfolio funding levels

Sanlam Life has the most material exposure to products that provide financial guarantees
to policyholders, which include the following main lines of business:

•   Fixed-term guarantee plans

    Fixed-term guarantee plans are matched with appropriate fixed-interest instruments on
    a cash-flow duration basis. As both the assets and liabilities are valued on a consistent
    basis, movements in interest rates do not result in mismatch profits or losses. Credit
    risk is the main financial risk assumed by Sanlam under these contracts.

•   Smoothed bonus portfolios

    These products aim to provide a smoothed return to policyholders over time through
    the bonus declaration philosophy. The main smoothed bonus portfolios include
    (policyholder liabilities as at 31 December 2019) the Individual Life Stable Bonus
    Portfolio (R27 billion), the Group Stable Bonus Portfolio (R11 billion), the Monthly
    Bonus Fund (R7 billion) and With-Profit Annuities (R5 billion). The funding levels of
    these portfolios were between 80% and 90% on 25 March 2020 compared to close to
    100% funding levels at 31 December 2019. Should future investment returns earned on
    the portfolios be in line with the long-term investment return assumptions disclosed in
    the Group’s 2019 annual financial statements, the funding levels of these portfolios can
    be restored to 100% through the declaration of lower bonuses in the next three years.
    Should markets deteriorate further or underperform for an extended period, other
    management actions are available to manage the funding levels in combination with
    shareholder capital injections. These include the cancellation of non-vested bonuses,
    except for With-Profit Annuities or fully vesting smoothed bonus portfolios. The
    balanced mandates of these portfolios from an asset class perspective, together with
    foreign exposure of some 30%, provide a buffer to funding levels.

    Products offering financial guarantees to policyholders within the Sanlam Emerging
    Markets portfolio are mostly matched by interest-bearing securities. No material
    mismatch profits or losses have occurred in these portfolios.

Investment-related earnings

•   Sanlam Investment Group

    Credit spreads on listed debt have widened to historic high levels. This contributed to
    negative unrealised marked-to-market losses year-to-date of some R470 million after
    tax at Sanlam Specialised Finance (Sanfin) as at 25 March 2020. In the absence of any
    actual defaults, these unrealised losses will reverse in future as the higher spreads
    unwind to maturity, i.e. it simply causes timing differences in earnings recognition. Any
    narrowing of spreads going forward, will accelerate this reversal. The current
    circumstances are likely to lead to an increase in credit counterparties experiencing
    distress. These exposures will be proactively managed with an emphasis on obtaining
    security where possible, and maximising recovery should any defaults actually occur.

    All required margins/collateral have to date been received as required in respect of the
    equity-backed lending business.

    Derivative structures (including interest rate, equity and currency derivatives) are
    requiring an increased need for margins/collateral to be posted by Sanfin. The Group
    has a well-established liquidity risk management framework to ensure sufficient liquidity
    during stressed market conditions such as those currently being experienced. All
    margin/collateral requirements have been and are projected to be met from internal
    resources, and will continue to be prudently and proactively managed within the
    liquidity risk management limits of the Group.

•   Sanlam Personal Finance

    As highlighted in the 2019 annual results financial review and referred to above,
    Glacier’s product offering includes a line of business where it participates in the actual
    investment return earned on the underlying portfolio. This product contributed some
    R200 million to Glacier’s net result from financial services for the 2019 full year. As at
    25 March 2020, earnings from this line of business amounted to a loss of some R90
    million after tax.

•   Sanlam Emerging Markets

    The weaker equity markets in Namibia, India, Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire have a
    negative impact on investment variances in the life portfolios. Return on insurance
    funds held in the Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire general insurance portfolios are also
    negatively affected given the equity exposure within the asset mix.

    COVID-19 is likely to result in a further deterioration of economic conditions in
    Lebanon, aggravated by the sovereign debt defaults in March 2020, which may require
    credit provisioning to be recognised in terms of IFRS 9 in finalising the Group’s interim
    results for the six months to 30 June 2020, in addition to the provisions recognised in
    the Group’s 2019 annual results.

Claims and persistency experience

To date we have not been exposed to any major change in claims and persistency
experience.

•   Life insurance business

    The development of claims experience will be dependent on, among others, the
    infection rate in the markets where we provide cover, the ability of the local healthcare
    infrastructure to cope with the number of individuals requiring hospitalisation and the
    eventual mortality rate. The swift action taken by many governments, in particular
    lockdowns, should limit infection rates and mortality experience.

    The Group’s policy liabilities at 31 December 2019 included a pandemic reserve of
    R760 million that was created specifically for an event of this nature a number of years
    ago. This reserve is available to cover increased mortality experience emanating from
    COVID-19.

    Sanlam’s geographic diversification also provides resilience.

•   General insurance business

    Santam

    Santam is in the process of reviewing all relevant policy wordings in order to assess
    potential insurance exposure relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine how
    Santam’s policies may respond to any claims made.

    Sanlam Emerging Markets

    The impact of COVID-19 on general insurance claims is, among others, dependent on
    governments’ response to the pandemic. Some governments are considering
    requirements for insurers to pay medical costs even if this is not covered under the
    policy contracts, or to contribute voluntarily to relief funds. Despite limited contractual
    exposure in many instances, measures implemented by governments may therefore
    still have an impact.

    Business Interruption (BI) Insurance

    The vast majority of property policies are written on a named perils basis and do not
    provide cover for BI. Where BI cover is provided, it is generally restricted to direct
   business interruption as a consequence to damage to property (usually fire or
   machinery breakdown only).

   Health Insurance

   Exposure to COVID-19 claims is dependent on policy conditions, which vary between
   countries. These conditions in general exclude pandemics and/or pandemics where
   quarantine is implemented.

Outlook

Economic growth in all of the Sanlam markets will be lower than anticipated, with some
expected to enter recessions, including South Africa. This poses risk to growth in new
business volumes as well as persistency experience. Increased pressure on corporate
earnings will also heighten credit risk. New business volumes are furthermore restricted by
the lockdowns in a number of markets, limiting advisors’ ability to conduct business. We
do have a number of digital sales channels across the Group, which includes digital
enablement of advisors. Sales through these channels will provide some relief.

Equity, interest rate and currency markets are expected to remain volatile in the
foreseeable future. Moody’s downgrade of South Africa’s sovereign rating to below
investment grade on 27 March 2020 is expected to add to volatility in the South African
markets. Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange
rate and the level of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on
the growth in net result from financial services, operational earnings and Group Equity
Value to be reported for the six months to 30 June 2020 and the year to 31 December
2020.

Sanlam is well positioned to weather the current conditions - we have a solid balance
sheet, strong operational processes and some of the best expertise available in the
market.

The final 2019 ordinary dividend of 334 cents per share that was declared on 11 March
2020 will be paid on Monday 20 April 2020.

(1) Weighted average number of shares excludes Sanlam shares held directly or indirectly through consolidated 
investment funds in policyholder portfolios, as well as Sanlam shares held by the Group's Broad-Based Black Economic 
Empowerment special purposes vehicle (B-BBEE SPV) that is consolidated in terms of International Financial Reporting 
Standards. These shares are treated as shares in issue for purposes of normalised weighted average number of shares, 
which are used for the per-share metrics for the Shareholders' fund information.
(2) PVNBP = present value of new business premiums and is equal to the present value of new recurring premiums plus 
single premiums.

The Group achieved a solid operational performance in 2019, with growth of 14% and 15% respectively in net operational
earnings and the net value of new covered business (VNB) written. The 37% increase in net fund inflows is a particular
highlight.

We recognised from the outset that we will face a number of headwinds in 2019. Low economic growth in some of our key
markets, heightened global geopolitical risks as well as volatility in investment and currency markets did not bode well
for growth in our key performance indicators. Our diversification across geographies, market segments and lines of
business provided significant resilience, enabling us to continue delivering value to all our stakeholders.

Net result from financial services (net operating profit) of R9.7 billion increased by 9%, with solid contributions from
most major businesses. Relatively stronger investment market returns in 2019 augmented this performance, contributing to
the 14% growth in net operational earnings.  New business volumes increased by 12% despite low investor confidence in
South Africa and lower investment inflows in the UK, Namibia and Kenya. Life insurance new business volumes increased
marginally, investment business inflows grew by 14% and general insurance earned premiums were 22% higher.

Shareholders are advised that a final cash dividend of 334 cents per share was declared for the year ended 31 December
2019, an increase of 7.1% on the prior year dividend. This represents 3% real growth in the Sanlam dividend. The South
African dividend withholding tax regime applies in respect of this dividend. The dividend in full will be subject to the
20% withholding tax, where applicable, which result in a net dividend, to the shareholders who are not exempt from paying
dividend tax, of 267.2 cents per share. The number of ordinary shares in issue in the company's share capital as at the
date of the declaration is 2,069,106,282 excluding treasury shares of 274,231,765 at 31 December 2019. The company's tax
reference number is 9536/346/84/5.

The dividend is payable on Monday, 20 April 2020 by way of electronic bank transfers to ordinary shareholders recorded in
the register of Sanlam at close of business on Friday, 17 April 2020. The last date to trade to qualify for this dividend
will be Tuesday, 14 April 2020, and Sanlam shares will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 15 April 2020. Share certificates
may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 15 April 2020 and Friday, 17 April 2020, both days
included. Shareholders who have not yet provided their banking details for dividend payments are requested to do so by

Trading Statement - 2019 Annual Results

Shareholders are advised that Sanlam is currently compiling its annual results for the
year ended 31 December 2019. This trading statement provides an indication of a range
for headline earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity
holders of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements. Sanlam's annual results will be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (SENS) on Thursday, 12 March 2020.

The Group achieved satisfactory growth in net result from financial services as well as
investment return earned on its capital portfolios for the 2019 financial year, contributing
to estimated combined growth of between 8% and 18% from these sources of earnings.

The Group also concluded a share issuance to a new Broad-Based Black Economic
Empowerment (B-BBEE) entity (B-BBEE Entity) as approved by Sanlam shareholders in
December 2018 and notified on SENS in March 2019 (B-BBEE Share Issuance). The B-
BBEE Share Issuance positions Sanlam as the foremost empowered insurance and
investment management group in South Africa.

Headline earnings for the year ended 31 December 2019 are impacted by the following:
*   A one-off expense of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2 Share Based Payment in respect of the B-BBEE Share
    Issuance, as reported to shareholders in our 10-month operational update in
    December 2019.
*   The value of business acquired (VOBA) intangible assets recognised in 2018 upon
    the first-time consolidation of Saham Finances and Nucleus as Group subsidiaries
    contributed an additional amortisation charge of some R250 million in 2019.
*   Profits and losses recognised in terms of IFRS in respect of the treatment of Sanlam
    shares held in policyholder portfolios as treasury shares, the movement in deferred
    tax assets recognised in respect of assessed losses in policyholder funds and the
    consolidation of the Sanlam Foundation and B-BBEE Entity (Fund transfers), declined
    from a R106 million net profit in 2018 to a net loss of R868 million in 2019. The
    consolidated results of the B-BBEE Entity included in the 2019 Fund transfers
    comprises interest paid on the external funding and administration costs incurred of
    some R600 million.

Given the size of these items, headline earnings of the Group for the year ended 31
December 2019 are expected to decrease by between 15% and 25% compared to 2018.
Earnings attributable to equity holders for the year ended 31 December 2019 are further
impacted by the profit on deemed disposal of Saham and Nucleus of R2,8 billion in 2018.
These were one-off earnings that increased the comparative base, contributing to an
expected decrease in earnings attributable to equity holders of between 35% and 45%
compared to 2018.

Excluding the one-off IFRS 2 charge, the additional amortisation of intangible assets, the
Fund transfers and the profit on disposal of Saham and Nucleus referred to above,
headline earnings and earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group would have
increased by between 10% and 20%, reflecting the solid underlying operational
performance by the Group.

The weighted average number of shares used for HEPS and EPS is not impacted by the
B-BBEE Share Issuance as the Sanlam shares held by the B-BBEE Entity is treated as
treasury shares upon consolidation. These shares will, however, be treated as issued
shares for purposes of the Group's disclosed per share management information, such
as net result from financial services per share and Group Equity Value per share.
Shareholders are advised that the Group expects HEPS and EPS for the 2019 year,
expressed as growth on the prior period, to fall within the following ranges:


                              12 months to        12 months to

Operational Update - December 2019

The Group maintained a solid operational performance in the 10 months to 31 October 2019,
especially in the context of persisting challenging operating conditions in our largest markets.
Highlights for the four month-period since the end of June 2019 include continued strong net fund
inflows at Sanlam Investment Group (SIG), traction in Glacier's new business sales, as well as a
marked improvement in Sanlam Corporate and Santam's risk underwriting profits. Overall new
business volumes increased by 6%. The net value of new covered business (VNB) written
increased by 13%, supported by a change in the mix of business to more profitable lines of
business and a lower comparable risk discount rate at the end of October 2019. Net result from
financial services grew by 12%, contributing to a 16% rise in net operational earnings. Saham
continues to outperform its top-line target.

Operating conditions remained challenging in South Africa with no major improvement expected
in the country's economic growth in the short to medium term. The medium-term budget policy
statement (MTBPS) by the Minister of Finance highlighted the need to implement the structural
reforms proposed in National Treasury's recently-released economic strategy document. The
MTBPS contributed to a downgrade by Moody's of South Africa's sovereign credit rating outlook
to negative. The continued policy and political uncertainty weighed on the South African currency
and investment markets, which significantly underperformed global markets. Despite these
headwinds, we continued to grow strongly in all of our South African businesses, testimony to the
quality of our business and our people, their ability to execute in tough times and delivery from
the new growth initiatives that we launched in recent years, such as BrightRock, Sanlam Indie,
MiWay Life and the Capitec Bank partnership.

The South African equity markets recorded muted growth in the first 10 months of 2019 compared
to global indices, with the JSE/FTSE Swix Index delivering a return of 7.1% compared to a
negative return of 13.6% in the first 10 months of 2018. Average equity markets as measured by
the JSE/FTSE Swix Index were, however, still some 4.9% lower than the comparable 10-month
period in 2018.

Economic conditions in the other emerging markets where we operate remained broadly
unchanged from the first half of 2019. The exceptions were Angola and Lebanon. The Angolan
currency collapsed since the Central Bank removed the band within which it protected the
currency, exacerbating inflationary pressure in our general insurance business and contributing
to foreign currency translation losses of R111 million since 30 June 2019 on exposure that cannot
be settled due to foreign currency liquidity constraints. Pressure on the Lebanese economy and
general operating environment intensified following social unrest and political uncertainty. The
Indian businesses continue to perform well despite a slowdown in economic growth.
We remain focused on our core competencies: delivering shareholder value under challenging
conditions while at the same time executing future growth strategies. This is founded in our
diversified profile as well as a federal management model that supports dual focus on operational
and strategic delivery.

Results

The constant currency information included in this operational update has been presented to
illustrate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and is the responsibility of the Group's
board of directors (""Board""). It is presented for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature
may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in equity, result of operations or
cash flows. All references to constant currency information are based on the translation of foreign
currency results for the 10 months to 31 October 2019 at the weighted average exchange rate
for the 10 months to 31 October 2018, which is also applied for the translation of comparative
information. The major currencies contributing to the exchange rate movements are the British
Pound, United States Dollar, Indian Rupee, Botswana Pula, Moroccan Dirham, Angolan Kwanza
and the Nigerian Naira (negative movements in the table below indicate a strengthening in the
rand exchange rate):

The constant currency information has not been audited or reviewed by Sanlam's external
auditor.

All comparative information is for the 10 months ended 31 October 2018 unless otherwise
indicated. Any reference to the Saham structural impact refers to the impact of Sanlam acquiring
the remaining 53% interest in Saham Finances effective 1 October 2018.

The salient features of the Group's performance for the 10 months to 31 October 2019 are:

*         New business volumes of R199 billion, up 6% on the first 10 months of the 2018 financial
          year (3% in constant currency and excluding the Saham structural impact).

      o    Overall new business volumes at Sanlam Personal Finance (SPF) were in line with 2018,
           a marked improvement compared to the first six months of 2019.

           Sanlam Sky new business sales grew by 9% (52% excluding the one-off Capitec Bank
           credit life mandate included in the comparative base). Sales through the traditional
           individual life intermediated channel continued to perform well, increasing by a healthy
           11%. Sales of Capitec Bank funeral business, launched in May 2018, continue to exceed
           expectations, contributing some R900 million to new business volumes. Safrican and
           Group Benefits are having a slower year.

           The recurring premium sub cluster, primarily focused on the middle-income market,
           reflects the pressure on disposable income in this market segment, with new business
           volumes only marginally up on 2018. Good demand for single premium retirement
           annuities, the MiWay Life and Sanlam Indie offerings as well as Sanlam Personal Loans
           credit life was offset by lower sales of traditional individual life recurring premiums risk and
           savings products.
                                                                                                 2|P age
        Despite persisting uncertainty, Glacier experienced a welcome improvement in life and
        non-life sales, exceeding sales targets in recent months. New business sales for the 10
        months to 31 October 2019 were only slightly down on the previous year.

    o   SEM recorded overall new business growth of 37% (10% up in constant currency and
        excluding the Saham structural impact). Trends were broadly in line with the first-half 2019
        performance. Saham continues to outperform its top-line targets by a considerable
        margin, partly offset by lower investment business flows in Namibia and Kenya. Nigeria
        also continued to contribute strong growth.

    o   New business volumes at SIG increased by 6%, a strong performance under difficult
        conditions. The value of new mandates awarded to the South African Investment
        Management and Wealth Management businesses increased by 14% and 34%
        respectively. The International businesses experienced a 26% slowdown in new business
        inflows.

    o   Santam achieved slightly more subdued growth in conventional business gross written
        premiums compared to the first-half performance.

    o   The comparative base for Sanlam Corporate includes large one-off mandates awarded in
        2018 that were not expected to repeat in 2019. The cluster's new business volumes
        commensurately declined by 20% despite exceeding the target for the period by a healthy
        margin.

    o   Net VNB increased by 13% (up 6% on a constant economic basis) with all clusters
        contributing good growth. Overall net VNB margins improved by some 21 basis points on
        a constant economic basis on the comparable 2018 period.

    o   Overall net fund inflows of R43.5 billion were 20% higher than the R36.2 billion achieved
        in the comparable 10-month period in 2018. SIG attracted strong net inflows of R18.5
        billion compared to R8.7 billion in the comparable period.

    o   Persistency trends remained in line with the first half of 2019.

*   Net result from financial services increased by 12% on the first 10 months of the 2018
    financial year (up 6% excluding the Saham structural impact and in constant currency).

    o   SPF's net result from financial services increased by 7%, supported by strong growth at
        Glacier. The improved relative investment market performance in 2019 compared to the
        first 10 months of 2018 benefited fee income from Glacier's participating products.

    o   SEM's net result from financial services increased by 36% (12% excluding the Saham
        structural impact and in constant currency). All key regions contributed strong growth,
        apart from Namibia where increased new business strain and lower general insurance
        earnings limited net profit growth to 2%. India in particular continued its strong growth in
        operational earnings. Claims experience in Saham remains under pressure, with the
        overall general insurance underwriting margin below the 5% to 9% target range. Saham
        continues to implement corrective measures, including repricing and improved claims
        management. The investment performance has, however, been better than expected,
        which partly offset the lower underwriting result.

    o   SIG's contribution to net result from financial services decreased by 6%. The South
        African asset management and wealth management businesses continued to do well and
        achieved 30% growth in net result from financial services despite the 4.9% lower average                                                                                         
        equity markets in the period that suppressed fee income. One-off income earned in the
        alternative businesses supported the performance, augmented by improved performance
        fees in the third-party business and diligent cost management. Sanlam Specialised
        Finance's net result from financial services declined by 16%, largely due to the increased
        provisioning in respect of certain corporate credit exposures.

    o   As indicated above, claims experience improved at Santam since the end of June 2019.
        Underwriting margin within the conventional business moved well above the midpoint of
        the target range of 4% to 8%.

    o   Repricing of loss-making schemes, combined with improved claims management, are
        yielding positive results at Sanlam Corporate, with Group Risk profit reflecting a major
        improvement on the comparable 10-month period in 2018. Actual disability claims
        experience continued at elevated levels.

*   Net operational earnings increased by 16%. This is the combined effect of the 12% growth
    in net result from financial services and a 62% combined increase in net investment return
    and project expenses. Net investment return benefited from the relatively stronger investment
    market returns.

*   Diluted headline earnings per share declined by 20%, but increased by 2% per share if the
    B-BBEE IFRS 2 charge is excluded. Headline earnings reflect the combined effect of:
    o The 16% increase in net operational earnings;
    o The one-off accounting cost of R1.7 billion recognised in terms of IFRS 2 in respect of
         the B-BBEE share issuance in the first half of the year.
    o A 185% increase in the amortisation of intangible assets following the first-time
         consolidation of Saham and Nucleus in 2018.


Capital

The Group's operations remain well capitalised. The Sanlam Group Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) cover ratio amounted to 216% on 30 September 2019 (Sanlam Life
Insurance Limited: 262%).

Discretionary capital available at the end of June 2019 has been fully utilised for corporate
transactions amounting to some R770 million. Some R630 million was utilised for the acquisition
of the Thesis Group in the United Kingdom (UK) and the capitalisation of African Rainbow Life,
which received its insurance licence in July. The Thesis Group augments the scale of the Group's
private wealth, advice and asset management operations in the UK. Focus in the UK is now on
embedding the recent acquisitions made, with no further transactions planned for the foreseeable
future.

Future generation of discretionary capital will be sufficient to fund the planned bolt-on acquisitions
across the portfolio.

Outlook

We do not expect improvement in the economic conditions of the major territories where the
Group operates in the short term. New business growth potential will commensurately remain
under pressure. Investment market volatility is also expected to persist, aggravated by Brexit and
the finalisation of a trade deal between the United States and China.
                                                                                            
Continuation of the recovery in the South African mass affluent new business performance is
largely dependent on developments in the political environment. New business growth in the
South African entry-level market will be impacted by the diminishing base effect from the launch
of the Capitec Bank funeral product in May 2018. Outside of South Africa, new business growth
in other emerging markets is expected to remain strong, supported by the base effect of the
Saham structural impact.

Average investment market levels, the relative strength of the Rand exchange rate and the level
of long-term interest rates are key factors that may have an impact on the growth in net result
from financial services, normalised headline earnings and Group Equity Value to be reported for
the year to 31 December 2019. Currency volatility in Angola and the weakening operating
environment in Lebanon are particular risk factors.

The focus will remain on delivering results from Saham and finalising the third-party asset
management B-BBEE transaction approved by Sanlam shareholders in December 2018.

The information in this operational update has not been reviewed and reported on by Sanlam's
external auditors. Sanlam's annual results for the year ending 31 December 2019 are due to be
released on 12 March 2020. Shareholders are advised that this is not a trading statement as per
paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.
